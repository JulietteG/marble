Dear I fear we've gone wrong
You've always hung me from the gallows
Well I don't feel I'll be forgiven
Ya I don't feel I'll be forgiven

If you don't see it you can never walk away
If you don't feel it, it's gonna get harder every day
But you don't want love keeping you awake at night,
 till you can't sleep

Dear I fear that you've settled
You've always pushed me in the shadow
Well I don't feel you'll be forgiven
No I don't feel you'll be forgiven

If you don't see it you can never walk away
If you don't feel it, it's gonna get harder every day
But you don't want love keeping you awake at night,
 till you can't sleep

Ah ah ah ah ah 
Whe you wake up alone, wake up alone
Do you love me still
Ah ah ah ah ah
When you wake up alone, wake up alone
Do you question the choice you made
Ah ah ah ah ah
When you wake up alone, wake up alone
Do you love me still
Ah ah ah ah ah
Do you wake up at all, wake up at all

If you don't see it you can never walk away
If you don't feel it, it's gonna get harder every day
But you don't want love keeping you awake at night, 
 till you can't sleep---Lyrics submitted by adri.
