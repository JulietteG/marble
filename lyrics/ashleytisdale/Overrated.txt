Yeah eh eh eh, oh

I pass my reflection, its someone else
I see your invention and not myself

I turned into your perfect girl
A total stranger
Now I see then I dont want to

Being you when its just all an act
Its overrated
The truth is Im wanting me back
Cause I cant take this
I gotta be who I am underneath
Who I gave up so you believe
Being you when its just all an act

Its overrated
So overrated

I let you control me or so you thought
Dont think that youre perfect, youre still messed up
I hid away the best of me
Too scared to notice
Now I do and Im not going to

Being you when its just all an act
Its overrated
The truth is Im wanting me back
Cause I cant take this
I gotta be who I am underneath
Who I gave up so you believe
Being you when its all just an act
Its overrated

Changing for a guy
overrated
Living in a lie
Its overrated
Always asking why?
Its overrated

Oh whoa oh

The mirror is shattered
Im finally free

Being you when its just all an act
Its overrated
The truth is Im wanting me back
Cause I cant take this
I gotta be who I am underneath
Who I gave up so you believe
Being you when its all just an act
Its overrated

Overrated, yeah
Overrated, yeah
So overrated, yeah
Overrated

Oh oh, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
