Youre out of this world Im sure of it, a crazy intuition,
youre up and on youre here then gone come back, a curious condition.
And then you switch right over,
its weird yeah I know, but
just cant get a hold of myself.

(Chorus)
Hey so strange,
you switched in front of me,
hey youve changed,
not like you used to be,
cause you get in my head and hold my heart,
when Im here your there, were worlds apart,
so your reversewords get to the start,
and switch back to my world.

Hey youre just,
talking like a machine,
hey Im stuck,
on everyword in between,
cause you get in my head and hold my heart, w
hen Im here your there, were worlds apart,
so your reverse words get to the start,
and switch back to my world.

Youre out of this world, Im sure of it, a little more than different, and you keep lacking, lacking concern of it, its you that I am missing, and then you switch right over, its weird yeah I know, but just cant get a hold of myself.

(Chorus)
Hey so strange,
you switched in front of me,
hey youve changed,
not like you used to be,
cause you get in my head and hold my heart,
when Im here your there, were worlds apart,
so your reversewords get to the start,
and switch back to my world.

Hey youre just,
talking like a machine,
hey Im stuck,
on everyword in between,
cause you get in my head and hold my heart, w
hen Im here your there, were worlds apart,
so your reverse words get to the start,
and switch back to my world.

Wonder where you are,
how can I find you, staring at the stars falling behind you,
across the universe hope youll be back soon.
I got a feeling that our planet will be rearrenging.

(Chorus)
Hey so strange,
you switched in front of me,
hey youve changed,
not like you used to be,
cause you get in my head and hold my heart,
when Im here your there, were worlds apart,
so your reversewords get to the start,
and switch back to my world.

Hey youre just,
talking like a machine,
hey Im stuck,
on everyword in between,
cause you get in my head and hold my heart, w
hen Im here your there, were worlds apart,
so your reverse words get to the start,
and switch back to my world.

Open your heart, yeah, get back to the start,
Open your heart, yeah, were back to the start,
Open your heart, yeah, get back to the start,
Open your heart, yeah, were back to the start,
Open your heart, yeah, get back to the start.---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
