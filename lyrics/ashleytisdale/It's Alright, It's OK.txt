You told me 
there's no need 
To talk it out 
Cause its too late 
To proceed 
And slowly 
I took your words 
And walked away 
No looking back 
I wont regret, no 
I will find my way 
I'm broken 
But still I have to say 

[Chorus] 
It's Alright, OK 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry 
Alright, OK 
So don't you bother what I do 
No matter what you say 
I wont return 
Our bridge has burnt down 
I'm stronger now 
Alright , OK 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry 

You played me 
Betrayed me 
Your love was nothing but a game 
Portrait a role 
You took control, I 
I couldn't help but fall 
So deep 
But now I see things clear 

[Chorus] 

Don't waist you fiction tears on me 
Just save them for someone in need 
It's Way to late 
I'm closing the door

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
