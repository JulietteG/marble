Hip shaker
dream maker
heart breaker
earth Quaker
I can be anything that you want me too

Core fender
mind bender
jet sweater
go better
changing my get-up for anything you choose

i don't mind tryin on someon else
i won't mindseein how it feels
I might like changing my disguise
to makes you happy

Here's my formal invitation
you and me go masquerading
lose ourselves in this charading
is this love were imitating?
do we want, what we got
if not I, say so what
Here's my formal invitation
la la la la

you could be my
my school teacher
mind reader
dream weaver
just be the one i can count on to play it with me

hot waiter
cool skater
trail blazer
pose major
I already ask what's available to me

you wanna try on someone else
you might like seeing how it felt
do you mind changing your disguise
if it makes me happy

Here's my formal invitation
you and me go masquerading
lose ourselves in this charading
is this love were imitating?
do we want, what we got
if not I, say so what
Here's my formal invitation

let's go
let's go masquerading

we'll make it fun
when it's over and done
i still want you
too see the real me
no more disguises
let true love decide if
we should be together

Here's my formal invitation
you and me go masquerading
lose ourselves in this charading
is this love were imitating?
do we want, what we got
if not I, say so what
Here's my formal invitation

let's go
let's go masquerading

la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
