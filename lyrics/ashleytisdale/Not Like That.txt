I feel oh, so glamorous
Lookin' super fabulous
Sometimes I'm insecure
Something I can't ignore
All the flashing cameras
Try my best to handle it
I'm just the girl next door
I can hear the rumors take off

Chorus:

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they want to be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, not that girl
And it's not, not, no it's not my world

So many girls be checkin' my style,
checkin' my style, checkin' my style.
So many girls be checkin' my style.
But I don't even care, no!

I move in mysterious,
ways that got them curious
They're looking at what I'm wearing
Standing on the sidelines staring.
Taking every chance they get
To find who I'm going with.
I just wish they'd see,
what I'm like in real life.

Chorus

So many girls be checkin' my style,
checkin' my style, checkin' my style.
So many girls be checkin' my style.
But I don't even care, no!

What's good I'm weak no longer
In life it's making me stronger.
What I like, i'm a get that
Like a quick cat,
no I won't quit that,
you heard me!
You'll find that I'm just like you
And I do the same things you do.
The type of chick that hits spots,
in my flip-flops
listening to Hip-Hop,
you feel me!
