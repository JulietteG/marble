It's in your eyes
Feelings can't be disguised
'Cause the truth makes me want you
To tell me lies

My biggest fear
Is crying oceans of tears
I would rather you not be so sincere
How could could you be
What would you do if you were me
I'm better off
If it's a mystery

Chorus:
'Cause I don't want to know
If I've kissed your lips for the last time
Please don't say
If it's so
Tell my heart
It's not goodbye
And do this one thing for me
Make up some stupid story
Tonight
It's alright
Keep your truth and tell me lies

Something's not right
Love is nowhere in sight
I'm not ready to let go
It's not time
How cruel could you be
Don't say we're through
Least not to me
I'm better off
Leave it a mystery

Chorus

Don't tell me 
You're leaving
There's only so much I can take
It's easier if you're faking

'Cause I don't want to know
If I've kissed your lips for the last time
Please don't say
If it's so
Tell my heart
It's not goodbye
And do this one thing for me
Make up some stupid story
And we keep pretending
This is not the ending 
Tonight
It's alrgiht
Keep your truth and tell me lies
