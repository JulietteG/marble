Boy walk in the spot, he's so fresh
He got what he needs to impressin'
Just look at the way that he dressin'
Ain't no question chicks like oh.

Girl walkin' the spot, she stop traffic
She blowin' your mind with her asset
So Jessica Alba fantastic,
Instant classic boys like oooh.

Maybe I can see us moving like that.
Maybe I can see us touching like that.
Baby I can see us kissing like that.
We don't need no more that he said she said.
Maybe I can see us moving like that.
Maybe I can see us touching like that.
Baby I can see us kissing' like that.
We don't need no more that he said she said.

He said girl you winnin'
She said boy where you been at
Stop talking let's get with it
Just like that they

He said you're amazing
She said then why ya waiting
No more deliberating
What you doin' let's get to it
Just like that they

Boy actin' as if there's no pressure
He do everything to get with her
He say anything to convince her.
Money spent to diamonds send her

Girl playin' it cool but she's with it
She lovin' the fact that she's gifted
Everything he do she gets lifted
Feels so wicked lovin' like oh.

Maybe I can see us moving like that.
Maybe I can see us touching like that.
Baby I can see us kissing like that.
We don't need no more that he said she said.
Maybe I can see us moving like that.
Maybe I can see us touching like that.
Baby I can see us kissing' like that.
We don't need no more that he said she said.

He said girl you winnin'
She said boy where you been at
Stop talking let's get with it
Just like that they

He said you're amazing
She said then why ya waiting
No more deliberating
What you doin' let's get to it
Just like that they

One night with you, boy just one night with you,
All the things we could do,
Every day i think of

One night with you
no one else but us two
All our dreams would come true
If we'd just get together

Maybe I can see us moving like that.
Maybe I can see us touching like that.
Baby I can see us kissing like that.
We don't need no more that he said she said.
Maybe I can see us moving like that.
Maybe I can see us touching like that.
Baby I can see us kissing' like that.
We don't need no more that he said she said.

Uh, what you waitin' for?

He said girl you winnin'
She said boy where you been at
Stop talking let's get with it
Just like that they

He said you're amazing
She said then why ya waiting
No more deliberating
What you doin' let's get to it
Just like that they

You're gonna like it
You're gonna want it
You're gonna like it
We don't need no more that he said she said.
You're gonna like it
You're gonna want it
You're gonna like it
We don't need no more that he said she said.---Lyrics submitted by Micaela.
