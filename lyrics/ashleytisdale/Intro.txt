Suddenly, I am in front of the lights
I can't unlove you (you, you, you, you)
He said, your amazing
She said, then why you waitin'?
(Be good, be good, be good, be good)
Show some positivity (zoom, zoom zoom)
Show me some positivity
We'll be together, come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
These are headstrong, crazy days
When your mind's made up and the music plays

So much for you [x6]---Lyrics submitted by dhanissta.
