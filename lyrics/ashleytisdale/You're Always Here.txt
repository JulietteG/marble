I looked to the sky last night
And my eyes caught the light of a star
Burning like the memories of brighter days
And I know this life is all mine
Just a moment in time
But everyday's another beginning's so

Pull yourself together
You know it's for the better
Now, It's our turn
It's our turn to carry this way
Nothing is forever
You can't predict the weather
Now, it's our time
And I'll help you carry this way

They say that love won't die
And then I realize
What will be will be
You're always here with me
And in the darkest night
I feel you by my side
What will be will be
You're always here with me

Meet me in my dreams
And you can help me believe
Tell me there are gonna be better days
To see your face and I feel your embrace
I swear I'll never forget what you gave so I

Pull myself together
I know it's for the better
Now, it's my turn
It's my turn to carry this way
Nothing is forever
You can't predict the weather
Now, you'll be there to help me carry this way

They say that love won't die
And then I realize
What will be will be
You're always here with me
And in the darkest night
I feel you by my side
What will be will be
You're always here with me

And if the day goes by
And you start to question why
Tell me why
There is a way to hold on
You just gotta stay strong
Close your eyes and you will find
Love lives on inside

They say that love won't die
And then I realize
What will be will be
You're always here with me
And in the darkest night
I feel you by my side
What will be will be
You're always here with me

What will be will be
You're always here with me

What will be will be
You're always here with me ---
