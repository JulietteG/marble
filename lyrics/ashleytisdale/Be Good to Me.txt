(Can you be good to me
Be good, be good, be good, be good
Can you be good to me)

Every day its getting worse
Do the same things and it hurts
I dont know if I should cry
All I know if that Im trying
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you
(but you make it so hard to do)

Whats the point of making plans
You break all the ones we have
I dont know where we were wrong
'Cause we used to be so strong

I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you

So why cant you be
Be good to me

Chorus:
I dont ask for much, all I want is love
Someone to see, thats all I need
Somebody to be, somebody to be, somebody to be,
Good to me, good to me, can you be good to me
Good to me, please

I used to think I had it all
Then one day we hit a wall
I had hoped you were the one
Wheres my dream, where has it gone?
I wanted to be with you
Forever just me and you

So why cant you be
Be good to me

Chorus

Where do I go from here?
Youve gotten under my skin
And I dont know how to get out
Of this place that Im in

Chorusx2

(Be good, be good, be good, be good
Can you be good to me, good to me
Be good, be good, be good, be good)

Can you be good to me, good to me
Can you be good to me, good to me, Please?---Lyrics submitted by Moira.
