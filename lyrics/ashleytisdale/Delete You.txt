Its not time to give this one more try, I dont think so
Last night you said you want a last lie

I can let you wreck my plans
Im planning to let you go
Oh, Only one thing is true, only one thing to do
Time to, delete you

Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters

This is, this is
For the better

Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all the power

Cause one mess is on me to
Delete you
Oh, oh delete you
Noah oh oh, oh delete you

Its not time to say how much you care, I dont think so
I dont want you, I want you not there
Im done I think that the times come
To bring this thing to an end

I think this could be goodbye, I think youve run out of time
Time to, delete you

Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters

This is, this is
For the better

Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all the power

Cause one mess is on me to
Delete you

All I want from you is to disappear
All I need from you is for you to not be here
I guess its time you got the news
Gonna replace you, erase you
Delete you, Delete you

Oh, oh delete you
Whoa oh oh, oh delete you

Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters

This is, this is
For the better

Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all the power

Cause who says I need you
Cause one mess is on me to
Delete you

Oh, oh delete you
Whoa oh oh, oh delete you

Time to delete you
Whoa oh, delete you---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
