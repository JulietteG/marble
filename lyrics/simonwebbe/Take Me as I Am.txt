i can say waiting on my troubles 
i believe,I've gone stronger than before 
I have dreams,so many had been answered so let them be
am not asking anymore I still search for that satisfaction 
that the battle is one,when i found my fait  and the place i belong

><
 but until that day  I'll be walking on to another place 
just drift along,tell I find  somebody
who'll be my guide make me feel alive
will take me as i am,and that's when I'll know i found my destination 
       whoo oo, who'll take me as i am  and never let it go and be my inspiration  
oo girl!! be my inspiration 


it's alright,'cause looking till tomorrow in my style 
i take things one day at a time ,i don't realize am driven' in my sorrows to get by
i take those worries in my stripe there'll be trails  there'll be tribulations 
but where ever i roll, i hope the path i take will lead me back home 


><

donno what the future holds
am happy driven' down this road
u never know what life brings no no no no 

my prophesy will show her face somewhere along the way 
as long as i will keep this faith I'll find my destination
