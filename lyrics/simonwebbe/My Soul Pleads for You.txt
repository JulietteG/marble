Oh yeh yeh, oh oh, hey

There's a place I've never been
A place I long to be
Will I reach? I just don't know
Still I hope one day I'll go, hey

My wish just never seems to come, yeh
I know for certain you're the one, yeh
So close I get, still no cigar
Carrying my wounded heart, yeh

I can't stop the river from running, I can't, I can't
I can't stop the rain from falling down on me, oh no no
I know I'm not what you want
I'm hoping in time you'll see how
My soul pleads for you

Not every time you meet someone and
You both just click in a minute
Baby it's the eye contact, smile like that
Click click and you're rolling
Can't stop calling you, I don't know what to do
Baby you're making me break down all of my rules, yeh

I can't stop the river from running, (I can't stop the river from running)
I can't stop the rain from falling down on me, oh no no
I know I'm not what you want
I'm hoping in time you'll see how
My soul pleads for you, yeh, yeh, yeh

Now I can believe you've put a spell on me
Oh it's the way it seems, I can't keep you out my dreams
Oh I get chills baby, when I can't talk to you
I'm in pain and I hope you feel the way I do

I can't stop the river from running, (I can't stop the river from running)
I can't stop the rain from falling down on me, oh no no
I know I'm not what you want
I'm hoping in time you'll see how
My soul pleads for you, yeh, yeh, yeh

I know for certain you're the one baby
So close, and no cigar
I carry this, my wounded heart
So close but yet so far

Chorus until fade---Lyrics submitted by Nathalie.
