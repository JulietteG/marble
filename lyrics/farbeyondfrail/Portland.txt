Hey Love, I dont understand
Everything happened so fast
And now youre gone
I woke up alone, and you were gone
Last night, you were talking kinda strange
You asked me
Where Id go
If we could both run away.
I didnt know
But you said theres only one place that youd go
You said the sun sets in Portland
So thats where Im going
I guess that Im hoping our story didnt end
And Ill write you a letter
Just as soon as I get there
And itll say:
Hey Lover, Im waiting for you here
Hey Love, you whispered in your sleep
I lay there thinking you were talking to me
Oh whered you go?
I started to like not being alone
Whered you go?
Oh I know
You dont owe me a thing
But I guess, Id hoped
You wanted to need me
But you dont.
And I wish I could let you go
But I wont.
I heard the sun sets in Portland
So thats where Im going
I guess that Im hoping our story didnt end
And Ill write you a letter
Just as soon as we get there
And itll say:
Hey Lover, Im waiting for you here
Gotta leave before night falls
Cuz if it falls, its falling on me
I gotta leave before night falls
Cux if it falls, its falling on me
I heard the sun sets in Portland
So thats where Im going
I guess that Im hoping our story didnt end
And Ill write you a letter
Just as soon as I get there
And itll say:
Hey, Lover Im waiting for you here
I guess that Im hoping our story didnt end
And Ill write you a letter
Just as soon as I get there
And itll say:
Hey Lover, Im waiting for you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
