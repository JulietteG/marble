And I know Im down, but Id be okay
If only Id found
A boy like you
Cant figure it out, Im barely breathing
Even though I
Have a boy like you
A boy like you
Im sick of myself
Guess Im just broken
Seems theres nothing to help
A girl like me
I see in your eyes
That you feel helpless
But theres no use to try
With a girl like me
A girl like me
And I have tried, to survive in my mind
But every night it just gets harder
And I could lie
And say Im gonna be fine
But I think you know
That its over
Youve told me before, that I was pretty
Now that Ive lost control
What do you see?
I dont know why you think you love me
Cuz Im such a mess and youre so damn clean
Used to be so clean
And I have tried, to survive in my mind
But every night it just gets harder
And I could lie
And say Im gonna be fine
But I think you know
That its over
And this time love cant bring me back
And this time love cant bring me back
And this time love cant bring me back
And this time Love cant, you cant bring me back
You cant bring me back
You cant bring me back
You cant bring me back---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
