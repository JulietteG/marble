Three fifteen, new morning
And Ive only said goodnight
You called my phone
No ones home
I think you thought that I was gone
But Im all right
Im okay
Was just one, of those days
Baby I know
Sometimes its hard to tell
I think you know by now
Im just a little confused
I know I may get down
I think you know by now
I couldnt ever leave you
Walking round, upside down
Turning wheels inside my head
Lost control
Found my soul
I guess its not as bad as I said
Say goodbye
Say hello
Some things come, some things go
Baby I know
Sometimes days Im not that well
I think you know by now
Im just a little abused
I know its hard to tell
I think you know by now
I couldnt ever leave you
Sometimes its hard to tell
I think you know by now
Im just a little confused
I know I may get down
I think you know by now
I couldnt ever leave you
Some days Im not that well
I think you know by now
Im just a little abused
I know its hard to tell
I think you know by now
I couldnt ever leave you
I couldnt ever leave you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
