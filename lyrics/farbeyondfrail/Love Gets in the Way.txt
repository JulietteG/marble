Sweet deliverance
From a pillow and bottle of pills
Striking the balance
Between what is perfect and what is perfectly real
Could this all be a dream?
Could this all be a dream?
I cant imagine you with another
Maybe I dont wanna know
But you are just like any other, Darling
And my heart needs to let go
And Im haunted by the feeling
That I need to get away
But love gets in the way, Child
Love gets in the way
And I cant say goodbye to you
Love gets in the way, Child
Love gets in the way
And I cant say goodbye to you
I could run down to Carolina, oh
Charlotte knows me well by name
But theyre devoted to their sunshine, Darling
And you know I love the rain
And I think that you could love me
But I know youll never change
But love gets in the way, Child
Love gets in the way
And I cant say goodbye to you
Love gets in the way, Child
Love gets in the way
And I cant say goodbye to you
And I probably should let you go
And start again
But love gets in the way, Child
Love gets in the way
And I cant say goodbye to you
Love gets in the way, Child
Love gets in the way
And I cant say goodbye to you
No, I cant say goodbye to you
No, I cant say goodbye to you
No, I cant say goodbye to you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
