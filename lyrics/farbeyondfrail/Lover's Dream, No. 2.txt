This towns under water
Cuz I control the weather
And every time I cry
It rains
This town aint seen a sunrise
For what feels like a lifetime
Cuz I aint had a happy thought in days
So last night I dreamed myself away
Last night I dreamed myself away
From this place
It was a lovely dream
Such a lovely dream
Cuz you were there
Dreamed myself into a fairytale
And found you there
Babe, Id dream myself anywhere
But you, you gotta swear
That youll be there
I was tired of the East Coast
So I drove toward the West Coast
Guess I just got lost somewhere in between
The Kansas City skylines
Been playing tricks on my mind
Telling me Im all right without you here
So last night I dreamed myself away
Last night I dreamed myself away
From this place
It was a lovely dream
Such a lovely dream
Cuz you were there
Dreamed myself into a fairytale
And found you there
Babe, Id dream myself anywhere
But you, you gotta swear
That youll be there
I need you there
Youre my favorite dream
Youre the reason I sleep
Cuz you were there
Dreamed myself into a fairytale
And found you there
Babe, Id dream myself anywhere
But you, you gotta swear
That youll be there
Dreamed myself into a fairytale
And found you there
Babe, Id dream myself anywhere---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
