The sun slowly melts away
Disappears beneath the water
You feel further away
With each and every tomorrow
If only time would go backwards things might get better
If only we could have stayed perfect and young forever
Wed still be happy just holding hands
Id still have the best thing I ever had
And after all these years
Im still thinking of you
I finally figured out I shouldve waited for you
Its so hard to go on
When Ive realized Ive been in love
Ever since you
I still read what you wrote to me
I somehow knew it would be your last letter
I never would have thought to leave
If I knew loves not the same when youre older
Oh sometimes I see you in the faces of strangers
For a moment forgetting I lost my angel
And after all these years
Im still thinking of you
I finally figured out I shouldve waited for you
Its so hard to go on
When Ive realized Ive been in love
Ever since you
Ever since you
Ever since you
Ive been falling backwards
Letting go of love
Ever since you
Ive lost my grip and I 
Wish I could reach back to you
And after all these years
Im still thinking of you
Ive finally figured out I shouldve waited for you
And after all these years
Im still thinking of you
Ive finally figured out I shouldve waited for you
Its so hard to go on
When everythings been wrong
Ever since you
Ever since you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
