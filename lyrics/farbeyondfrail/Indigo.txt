We started out fast
We started out slow
And it figures that Id be the last to know
That you, were only playing a game
Wasnt my face you saw
Just a girl you once knew by a different name
And if your heart is really in this
I wish youd find a way to show it
Cuz Im out on a line
Wondering which way to go
Caught between your violet skies
And your blue eyes
Im feeling like indigo
With no one to call my own
You said that I am the light of the moon
The light of the sun
And Im the place in which all your good things go
And you said you
Dont wanna see me cry
You just cant bear to say goodbye
Before I do
So if your heart is really in this
Could you find a way to let me know it
Cuz Im out on a line
Wondering which way to go
Caught between your violet skies
And your blue eyes
Im feeling like indigo
With no one to call my own
Im tired of the meaningless words you say
Were perfect and broken in one
Fucked up day
And Im out on a line
Wondering which way to go
Caught between your violet skies
And your blue eyes
Im feeling like indigo
With no one to call my own---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
