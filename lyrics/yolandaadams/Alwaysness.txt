Although the sun has been around for a long time
It still has the ability to shine
And although the moon lights up the night
Sometimes it likes to hang out in the sunshine
And although green grass sometimes turns brown
It's refreshed when the raindrops come falling down
Creation starts and it's renewed by a single touch from you

So I depend on you, No matter what I do
I know you'll always come through
You never changed the rule
I can depend on the alwaysness oh---------

With every change you remain 
Even through life's ups and downs you're still the same
Your everlasting love for me so heavenly that's the alwaysness

The seasons change without a calendar
And the breezes know how and when to blow 
Never have to wonder where the water goes
Cause it flows home to the ocean floor

Everything reacting in time itself
When placed in it there are other abilities
Please help show me how I should me so glory I can give

Cause I depend on you, no matter what I do
I know you'll always come through
You never change the rule
I can depend on the alwaysness oh------uh----

Every change you remain
Even through life's ups and downs you're still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly that's the alwaysness

Every change you're still the same
Even through life's ups and downs you still remain 
Everlasting love for me so heavenly that's the alwaysness

It's so simple when I do things your way
So I try everyday sometimes my path can get hard
Even when I start off with the best of intentions 
I get weak and fall short
And I know when I'm down you'll be there to pick me up
You'll never ever waiver
oh no, no, no, no

Through the change you'll remain
Even through life's ups and downs you're still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly that's the alwaysness
Never, never, never change

Every change you remain 
Even through life's ups and downs you're still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly that's the alwaysness

The alwaysness of God----------- of God!!!!!!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Regina.
