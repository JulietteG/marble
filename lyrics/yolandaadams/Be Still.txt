Slow down come closer, listen...
It's been a long time since we've
Gotten together like this.
And I really miss you.
I told you you could talk to me
But it's easy for you I see
For you to rush and get in a hurry
To be anxious and to worry.
Instead of coming to me,
And remaining in my safety.
You'd rather do it all yourself
But you know you need my help...

Be still and know, just be still and know
Be still, I will never leave your side
No, no, no I will never make you cry
You have got to know
I already know, oh yeah
Because I'll have to make you try,
Don't wanna see you cry
Give you hope and peace of mind,
You must be still

Your best is in my hands, your success is in my plan
Pretending as I speak to you, in restfulness I keep you
I'll wash your fears away so doubt can never stay
When I stand strong in you, I give you power to renew
But You never take the time out,
Sit in silence and to find out
I've always been right here, waiting on you to come near me

Be still and know, just be still and know
I will never leave your side
I will never make you cry
You have got to know, Oh no
I already know, yes I know
Because I'll have to make you try,
Gonna make you try
Give you hope and peace of mind,
You must be still

So hold, hold on, to my hand
And rest in my heart, and hear,
Hear the still small voice saying "You can make it"
I've never let you down so...

Be still and know, just be still and know
Be still and know, I will never leave your side
(I could never leave you) I will never make you cry
(Why would I leave you?) You have got to know
(You are my child and) I already know (I already know)
Sometimes I'll have to make you try,
(I did it before the foundation)
Give you only peace of mind,
Of the world Be still, be still
Be still, be still, be still
Just be still and know
I will never leave your side
(I will never leave you), I will never make you cry
(Have I ever left you?)
(You've got to know) I already know
(I already know) Sometimes I'll have to make you try
Give you only peace of mind,
You got to be still...
I will never leave you
Nor will I forsake you
Been there for you all along
I've never left you alone---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
