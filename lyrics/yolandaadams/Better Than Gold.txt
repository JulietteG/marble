Sun comes up.  Moon goes down.
Heaven shines all around.
It feels my heart and moves my soul.  
Because loving him is better than gold.

In his arms dreams come true.  and in his eyes the world is new
Diamonds bling and yes sliver glows (it glows) but loving him is better
than gold.

He came my way when hope was gone.  I never knew I could love so strong.  I walked some lonely roads before.  But now I search no more.  This still feels right I know its real.  The deepest truth has been revealed.  All the joy that a heart can hold.  OH yeah yeah loving him is better than gold.  Than gold.  Better than gold.  So much better than gold.  I walked some lonely roads before but now I search no more.  This feels right I know it's real.  The deepest truth has been revealed.  he's all I need and all I know.  All I know is loving him is better than gold.  Loving him is better than gold.  Loving him is better...  than gold.---Lyrics submitted by Nikole.
