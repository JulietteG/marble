Wake again to tea with cinnamon
some honey on a spoon it is almost noon
Walking down the stairs to shed my morning tears
just can't be satisfied lord knows that I've tried
that I've tried that I've tried 
And it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, 
it's so beautiful
but it's not real it's not real 

Bright the sun the day is almost done
I sit and drink champagne I am very sane
Smell this tea 
and dream of what could be
defeated yet again 
by tea with cinnamon
as many braver men
I might bounce back my friend 

And it`s so beautiful it`s so beautiful
it's so beautiful
but it`s not real it`s not real 

Now it`s night and I don`t feel so bright
My pulse is beating fast this will never last
Another day is gone and I can not outrun
The time is closing in let the sleep begin
let it begin let it begin---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
