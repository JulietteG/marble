The summer has ended quietly surrendered
Laying its weapons on 
the ground 'round her feet
The chimes they are calling, 
the leaves they are falling
to cover this land with their innocent lives 
Lalalala, wading in deeper
Lalalala, up to her knees 

Two hands that are white, 
can't put up the fight
Bereft of all strength and
the flames in her eyes
The infant, the damage, 
the plunder, the pillage
Her ruins of smoke, this river can't choke 

Lalalala, wading in deeper
Lalalala, up to her waist 

The fall is a'coming, closer each morning
it snarls at her heals and 
breathes down her neck
A raven is calling Promethean warning
The ties to her arms and 
her legs pull her down 

Lalalala, wading in deeper
Lalalala, over her head---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
