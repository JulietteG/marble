Everything you want everything you do
Everything and anything is up to you
Every single day starts with a riddle
You can go left or right down the middle

So take a little trip down the road and see
What youre gonna find who you want to be
But you might have to pick between these three

Rock Paper Scissors which one is its your decision
And no matter what you chose you gonna live it
Rock Paper Scissors

Everybody wants to be happy so
Take a look around find a hand to hold
If you really want you can change like the weather
No matter what you do itll keep getting better

Everything you want that is who you are
You can be the sun and the moon and the stars
Or the bass or the drums or the lead guitar

 Rock Paper Scissors..---Lyrics submitted by Marthe Granheim.
