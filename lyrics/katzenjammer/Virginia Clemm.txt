He was a child I was a child
Sentimental and wild
Now we're resting
Now we're resting
For twelve short years 
we lived out of health
and of prosperous wealth
oh my dearest
oh my dearest
My only portrait to remind you
my wine on your old cloak
my voice sustained in our piano
comme les carillons 
de notre nuit de noces
Heir of my illness writer 
of all the stories and the words
that I'm haunting
that I'm haunting
When your heart is on your sleeve
then I'll bid you my sweet adieu
don't forget me
don't forget me
The other woman to explain
her letters I deplore
I'm the flare inside your sorry dark eyes
and I'll leave you nevermore---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
