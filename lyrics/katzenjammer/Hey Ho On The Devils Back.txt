As I was walking in the big black woods
Hey ho, the big black woods
I met the evil devil and he offered me a ride
Hey ho, he offered me a ride
He said: "you look tired, let me carry you a while"
Hey ho on the devil's back
There's an evil, little bastard hiding in his eye
Hey ho, of fire, flames and fry 
Lord, I'm only human
I'm tired and I wanna go home
Let me ride on the devil's back, 
but save my soul
Save my soul 

The rain poured down from the grey sky above
Hey ho, the rain pissed down
But the devil he went hasty 
and steady running fast
Hey ho, oh this could never last
And then he saw my home through 
the branches and the leaves
Hey ho, lay hidden by the trees
Inside my darling loved one 
and children oh so sweet
Hey ho, my children oh so sweet 

Lord knows you're only human
You were tired and you wanted to go home
Pay me the soul of your one true love
or you will never see your children again 

Oh Lord knows you're only human
You were tired and you wanted to go home
Pay me the soul of your one true love 
or you will never see your children again
Save my soul!---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
