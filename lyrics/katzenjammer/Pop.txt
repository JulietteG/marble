Feelin' like a lollipop forgot in Pyongyang
Dancin' to the voodoo beat boom bam bam
Baby doll, remote control
Caravan love is all you know
Kickin' at the motherfuckers one by one 
You sell tickets to a funeral
'Cause you need tickets to The Cramps 

A rock'n'roll band, a little whiskey, 
a candy apple
All you know you're dancing 
till you drop
when you're listening to Le Pop 

Pick me up and drive me home
Crank crank crank crank 
crank up the volume
Pull up the tights 
to your wuthering heights
No means no, no means no 

You sell tickets to a funeral
'Cause you need tickets to Katzenjammer---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
