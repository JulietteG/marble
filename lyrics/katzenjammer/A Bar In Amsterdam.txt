9 Hours Past,
And "How long will it last?"
Says the man with the plan, the gun in his hand.
He's scared but prepared,
It might be as he feared.
Are we still in controle, and safe behind the wall?

This evenings too quiet,
It's allwe need, or we'll riet.
To Shake and to break, and to bite like a snake.
We're stuck in his atick,
So bored and so statick,
Tomorow They'll ask us to throw off our masks.....

[Chorus]
But the storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight.
The storm isa-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts---that should fight!

Mary's like me,
She's a looser to be.
Got a lock on her door, and a bed on the floor.
You will know they will win,
And then they'll Come in,
There's nothing you can say, to lead them astray.

We still live in silence,
Like sworn trades of violence.
I'm known for an end, and it's commin round the bend.
If we live through this night,
And we still be alright,
We'll flee to Siam, or a Bar in Amsterdam....

[Chorus]
But the storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight.
The storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts---that should fight!

------Instrumental Break-------

[Chorus]
The storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight.
The storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts---

And the storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight.
The storm is a-commin cross the hills tonight,
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts---that should fight!---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
