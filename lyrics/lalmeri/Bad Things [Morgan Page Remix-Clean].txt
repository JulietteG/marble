Bad things...4X

I know I should of gone over,
I've been here for days like a soldier,
Watching and just staring at the sun,
Can't help me from falling down.

Make you, made you, baby,
Get a room to just speak to me,
Stuck in hope unless I view,
I can drive everyone crazy.

My whole world is turning, babe,
Don't speak of all,
Just look at all those bad things,that you made me do...
I could never blame,
Get on ma knees, looking plain,
But I, much rather take it out on you.

CHORUS:
Bad things...wouldn't been true 2X
Look at all those bad things you made me do,
I'll never say I'm sorry, I'll never say it to you.
Look at all those bad things you made me do,
I could say I'm sorry but it wouldn't been true.

So low I touch the ground,
And I don't care if I bring you down 'cause I,
Think you'd like to suffer too.
One day my love is true,
The next I don't care for you,
But I wont, let you go,
Even though, I threaten too...

CHORUS

Bad things...
Wouldn't been true...
Bad things...
Bad things...

I'll never say I'm sorry...NOBODY!
Look at all those bad things you made me do,
I'll never say I'm sorry, I'll never say it to you.
Look at all those bad things you made me do,
I could say I'm sorry but it wouldn't been true...
No, it wouldn't been true...!---Lyrics submitted by Desir.
