Speak to me
            For I have seen
            Your waning smile
            Your scars concealed
            So far from home, do you know you're not alone
            Sleep tonight
            Sweet summerlight
            Scattered yesterdays, the past is far away

            How far time passed by
            The transience of life

            [Those] wasted moments won't return
            And we will never feel again

            Beyond my dreams
            Ever with me
            You flash before my eyes, a final fading sigh
            But the sun will (always) rise
            And tears will dry
            Of all that is to come, the dream has just
            begun

            And time is speeding by
            The transience of life

            Those wasted moments won't return
            And we will never feel again---Lyrics submitted by Parisa.
