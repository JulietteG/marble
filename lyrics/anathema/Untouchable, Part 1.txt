And I feel like I knew you before
And I guess that you can hear me through this song

And my love will never die
And my feelings will always shine
And my love will never die
And my feelings will always shine

And I know that you just wanted me to belong (to someone)
And I guess that now Ill just be moving on (to someone)

And my love will never die
And my feelings will always shine
And my love will never die
And my feelings will always shine

Ive never betrayed your trust
Ive never betrayed your faith
Ill never forsake your heart
Ill never forget your face
There`s a feeling that I cant describe
There`s a reason that I cannot hide
Cause Ive never seen a light that`s so bright
The light that shines behind your eyes

Ive never betrayed your trust
Ive never betrayed your faith
Ill never forsake your heart
Ill never forget your face
Theres a feeling that I cant describe
A reason that I cannot hide
Ive never seen a light that`s so bright
The light that shines behind your

I can see in this life what you mean to me
When I dream, I dreamed of you
When I wake, tell me what I do

I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
To find a way back home
I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
To find a way back home---Lyrics submitted by Michel ACOLTY.
