Adrift on a silent sea
The cold night surrounds me
Black ice forms beneath
The waves of a childhood dream
A far light hypnotized
A voice calls from paradise
Paradise to here

My light is fading now
My heart is breaking now
My light is fading now
My heart is breaking now

A child sings to me
The mists rise, blinding me
I can't find a way out of here
And the sound of angel dreams
The stars fall into the sea
The ice breaks, I'm pulled beneath
Pulled beneath the waves

My light is fading now
My heart is breaking now
My life is failing now
My mind is drowning now
But your hand reaches down,
to reach down and pull me out
Save me!(12 times)---Lyrics submitted by mahyar shaabani.
