Hey you.. rotting in your alcoholic shell
Banging on the walls of your intoxicated mind
Do you ever wonder why you were left alone
As your heart grew colder and finally turned to stone

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...

Pathetic oblivion
Forgotten hopes buried in your soul's lonely grave
Pathetic oblivion
Remember how you were before you locked your heart away

Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Do you ever dream of escaping?
Don't you ever dream of escaping...---Lyrics submitted by Arsham.
