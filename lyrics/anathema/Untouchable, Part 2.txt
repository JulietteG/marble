Why I should feel this way
Why I should feel this way
Why I should feel the same

Something I cannot say
Something I cannot say
Something I cant explain

I feel you... outside
At the edge of my life
I see you... walk by
At the edge of my side

Why I should follow my heart
Why I should follow my heart
Why I should fall apart

Why I should follow my dreams
Why I should follow my dreams
Why I should be the piece

I feel you... outside
At the edge of my life
I see you... walk by
At the edge of my side

I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
To find a way back home

I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
To find a way back home

Ive never seen the lights so bright (x3)

Blinded by the light thats inside you (x3)

I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
To find a way back home---Lyrics submitted by Michel ACOLTY.
