Feel free to comprehend
What I see will never end
It can't be now that life is gone
It's too real to overcome

It's too real
It's too real
It's too real

And these days my hands are tied
These days I think you'll find
I'm not me now a light has died
It's too real to run and hide

I was floating in the water
Something tried to pull me under
I was floating in the water
Something tried to pull me under
I was trying to live my life
It wouldn't let me
Let me let me let me
I was trying to live my life
It wouldn't let me
Let me let me let me

Feel free to comprehend
What I see will never end
I'm not me now a light has died
Its too real to run and hide

I was floating in the water
Something tried to pull me under
I was floating in the water
Something tried to pull me under
I was trying to live my life
It wouldn't let me
Let me let me let me
I was trying to live my life
It wouldn't let me
Let me let me let me---Lyrics submitted by Hossein.
