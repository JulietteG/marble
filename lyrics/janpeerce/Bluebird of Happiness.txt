The beggar man and the mighty king are only different in name,
For they are treated just the same by fate.
Today a smile and tomorrow a tear, we never know what's in store.
So learn your lesson before it is too late.

So be like I, hold your head up high 'til you find the bluebird of happiness.
You will find greater peace of mind, knowing there's a bluebird of happiness.
And when he sings to you, though you're deep in blue
You will see a ray of light creep through
And so remember this, life is no abyss
Somewhere there's a bluebird of happiness.

The poet with his pen, the peasant with his plow,
It makes no different who you are, it's all the same somehow.
The king upon his throne, the jester at his feet,
the artist, the actress, the man on the street.

It's a life of smiles and a life of tears It's a life of hopes and a life of fears.
A blinding torrent of rain and a brilliant burst of sun,
A biting tearing pain and bubbling sparkling fun.
And no matter what you have, don't envy those you meet.
It's all the same, it's in the game, the bitter and the sweet.

And if things don't look so cheerful, just show a little fight.
Fore every bit of darkness, there's a little bit of light.
For every bit of hatred, there's a little bit of love.
Fore every cloudy morning, there's a midnight moon above.

So don't you forget, you must search 'til you find the bluebird.
You will find peace and contentment forever,if you will be like I.
Hold your head up high, 'til you see a ray of light appear.
And so remember this, life is no abyss
Somewhere there's a bluebird of happiness.---
