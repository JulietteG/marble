If everyday was Christmas
If we could make believe
If everyone would care a little more
There'd be harmony

The city is covered in snow tonight
The children fast asleep
I'm waiting for him, but he's nowhere in sight
And I wonder if he could hear me

Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
Bring my baby home tonight

Why does it feel like it's colder than winter
Even by the fireside
My baby said that he'd be home for Christmas
And now it's almost midnight
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing till he's with me

Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
Bring my baby home tonight

I know your sleigh is full inside
But won't you stop and give my baby a ride
I'll be waiting by candlelight this Christmas
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing
Santa please hear me

Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
Bring my baby home tonight

(Solo)

The Christmas lights up and down the street
The presents by the tree
I hear a knock, oh... can it be?
My wish is staring back at me

Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
I guess you heard me tonight
Hey, Santa
Hey, Santa... Santa
I'm underneath the mistletoe
With my baby tonight

Sleigh ride...
It's Christmas time...---Lyrics submitted by Jim Watson.
