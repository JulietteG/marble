Well I was knowing that you were going when you came knocking at my door
I was grieving that you were leaving I wouldnt see you no more
But you were laughing as I was gasping, you were cashing all my cheques
You were lying as I was crying you were taking all the rest

Oh I, Ive been so blind
Like a fool I was falling, falling for your lines
I fell for you one by one, line after line
How was I so blind

I, I, Ive been had
I, I, Ive been had

I was drinking while you were thinking of how youd run away from me
I guess I was missing that you were wishing for a better man than me
But I was hoping while I was floating on those clouds inside my head
Based on lies that youd deny now that youd had ever said

Oh I, Ive been so blind
Like a fool I was falling, falling for your lines
I fell for you one by one, line after line
How was I so blind

(class verse)

My mistakes in my past, theyve taken their toll
Im going to find the kind of girl with whom Ill grow old
And shell treat me, yeah shell treat me, oh Ill try her so nice
And I wont be making those mistakes Ive made before twice
I wont be making those mistakes Ive made before twice
Oh I wont be making those mistakes Ive made before twice

Oh I, Ive been so blind
Like a fool I was falling, falling for your lines
I gave you my heart but you just wasted my time
How was I so blind

I, I, Ive been had---
