As you read this poisoned letter
There will be no turning back
Absorbent penetration
You will have a slight attack
Slow asphyxiation
Nerve agents will ignite

Now you know that
Your days were numbered
Welcome to forever slumber
Now you know that 
Your days were numbered

A twist of your own fate 
That you called upon yourself

A Poisoned Letter
Revenge is better

As I plotted retribution for consistent injuries
Couldnt help thinking of something wicked  
That could make your death taste sweet
Deadly suffocation 
I wont turn the other cheek

Now you know that
Your days were numbered
Welcome to forever slumber
Now you know that 
Your days were numbered

A twist of your own fate 
That you called upon yourself 

A Poisoned Letter	
Revenge is better---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
