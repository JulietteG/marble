This is the Day of the Dead
The dead have all resurrected
They need to be celebrated 
Their shrines are waiting
This is the Day of Dead

Sugar Skulls
Marigolds 
Incense burns
Spirits yearn

Open grave
Lady Dead
Light my way
Take me to a better place

Hear them calling
Hear them swarming
See them dancing

Day of the Dead! 

Rise Rise Rise from the Grave 

Another Day of the Dead
The dead have all resurrected
They need to be celebrated 
Their shrines are waiting
This is the Day of Dead

Theres no way out---Lyrics submitted by Miss.
