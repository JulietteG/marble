Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail of cotton,
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day.

Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta jump down turn around
Pick a bail a day.

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

We planted this cotton early 
With the first winds of May
We gotta keep the cotton balls from falling
Cant wait another day

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 


The way that we plant cotton, 
The good Lord scatters seeds.
Pick those balls before they all go rotten 
Or theyll die among the weeds

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

The Lord will do his reapin
On the last day of time
If you aint picked, 
From all the seeds Hes planted,
Then Hell be leavin you behind.

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
[Were gonna pick all over this world] 

Jump down, turn around
[A cotton needs a pickinso bad]
Pick a bail of cotton
Gotta Jump down, turn around
Pick a bail a day
