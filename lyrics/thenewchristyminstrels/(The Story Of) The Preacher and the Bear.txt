Now the Preacher he went out a walkin
It was on one Sunday morn,
Course it was against his religion,
But he took his gun along,
He shot himself some mighty fine quail, 
And one little measly hair,
And on his way returning home,
He met a great big, mmmm, grizzly bear.

Well the bear sat down in the middle of the road,
Just as mean as he could be,
And the Preacher he commenced to shaking,
And he climbed up a cimmon tree, 
Well the bear stood up and rolled his eyes,
And he shook his ugly head,
And the preacher looked up to the skys,
And these are the words he said,
And these are the words he said.
Chorus:
Oh Lord, you delivered Daniel from the lions den,
Delivered Joanah from the belly of the whale and then,
The Hebrew children from the firey furnace,
Oh the Good Book do declair,
Well Lord, Lord if you cant help me,
For goodness sakes wont you help that bear.
Oh Lord,Lord if you cant help me,
For goodness sakes wont you help that bear.

Now the bear commenced to climb that tree, 
And that made the preacher sore,
The preacher climbed still higher,
Till he couldnt climb no more,
Just about then this limb give away,
And the both come a tumbling down,
And when that preacher began to pray,
You could hear it for miles all around.

Chorus:

Well they fought all the way right down to the river,
And it was a terrible fight,
That bear was really laying it on, 
But the preacher, well he was doing all right,
He dragged that beast right down in the water,
It was  mmmm three times in and out,
Then the bear got loose and He limped away,
And the preacher began to shout.
.
Oh Lord you delivered Daniel from the lions den,
Delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale, Amen.
Now Lord it may not seem like much,
From where you sit up there,
But the hardest job I ever done,
Was baptizing that bear,
Yeah, the hardest Job I ever done,
Was baptizing that bear,
Chorus:
Thats the story of the preacher and the bear!
