One of these mornings won't be very long
You'll look for me and I'll be gone, yes, I will
I'm going to a place where there'll be nothing, nothing to do
But simply walk around Heaven all day

When I get to Heaven, I'm gonna jump and shout
Nobody will be able to put me out
My mother, she'll be waiting, my father, my three sisters too
We'll get together and walk around Heaven all day

Oh Father up above, don't You hear, can't You hear me praying?
I need You, I need You to walk right by my side
Lord, when my way, when my way gets cloudy
I need You for my guide

Everyday will be Sunday, my Lord, Sabbath will have no end
We'll do nothing but sing and praise His holy name
And when He says, "Sister, well done"
Then my race, one that's will be won

Gonna walk around Heaven, walk around Heaven
Walk around Heaven, walk around Heaven
I'll walk around Heaven, walk around Heaven
We're gonna walk around Heaven all day---Lyrics submitted by Richard.
