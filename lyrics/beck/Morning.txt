Woke up this morning, found a love light in the storm
Looked up this morning, saw the roses full of thorns
Guns are falling, they don't have nowhere to go
Oceans of diamonds always shine, smooth out below

Can we start it all over again this morning?
I lost all my defenses this morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be?

I've gone all around 'til there's nothing left to say
Wrote it all down into something that couldn't be said
I tore it all down and buried me underneath the wave

Can we start it all over again this morning?
I let down my defenses this morning
It was just you and me this morning
I fought all my guesses this morning
Won't you show me the way it could've been? ---
