I cant believe what weve seen outside
You and me watching the jets go by
Oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oooh, oh

Down by the sea so many peopleve
Already drowned
You and me watching the sea full of people
Try not to drown

So many people, so many people
Where do they go?
You and me watching the sky full of chemtrails
Thats where we can float

All I can take from these skies is fog
And all I can see in this light are boats sinking
Oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oooh, oh

Down by the sea 
Swallowed by evil theyve already drowned
You and me watching the sea full of people
Whove already drowned

So many people, so many people
Where do they go?
You and me hit by a test of white evil rain
Watching the jet planes go by

You and me watching
You and me watching
Chemtrails form swelling behind
Thats what I mean when we got in the slipstream
Were climbing a hole in the sky---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
