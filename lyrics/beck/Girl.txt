I saw her, yeah I saw her 
With her black tongue tied round the roses
Her fist pounding on a vending machine
A toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang in the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where the bones are bleaching

And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
And take her where her soul belongs
I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl

I saw her, yeah I saw her
With her hands tied back, her rags are burning
Crawling out from her landfill life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for my midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
And take her where her soul belongs
I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyes girl

Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, sun-eyed girl---Lyrics submitted by Ivan.
