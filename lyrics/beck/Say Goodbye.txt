See the sleet that rests upon
The quiet street we're standing on
Is it time to go away
And try again some other day?
'Cause these are words we use to say goodbye
These are the words you use to say goodbye

Bones crack, curtains drawn
On my back and she is gone
Somewhere else I do not know
Time will tell and I will go
These are the words we use to say goodbye
These are the words we use to say goodbye

I will wait and take a turn
Sort it out, let it burn
Empty out empty drawer
In my pockets, there's nothing more
These are the words you use to say goodbye
These are the words we use to say goodbye ---
