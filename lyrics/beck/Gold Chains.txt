People lookin' fresh
In their lightning bones
Had the TB Blues
I couldn't find no phones
Women driving down
In their whip flash rides
Had a wooden nickel finger
Pointing from all sides
Tryin' to get together
Into some kind of scene
I shook my spice last Sunday
Like a broken machine
I got 50-foot woofers
And I'm lonesome tonight
I put my hands in the air
Like a hazard light

I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains

(What's your name? Cheetah and Tammy)

Stealin' my water from an empty well
I got birds of life and a chain-gang bell
Smokin' cigarettes like an ass in the road
I got debutantes with the elephant's gold
Feast and famines all holding their hands
Filling in the blanks with swollen glands
Draggin' my heels down the varicose lanes
Paradise landlords swingin' their chains

I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains

People lookin' fresh

I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home
With my gold chains---
