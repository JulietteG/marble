On a highway unpaved going my way
you're so alone today
like a ghost town I've found 
there's no relief, no salt in the sea
is it true what they say
you can't behave
you gamble your soul away
measuring your dreams 
oh this life seems like the gristle of loneliness

don't let the sun catch ya crying
don't let the sun catch ya crying

Like an ice age nice days 
on your way sipping the golden dregs
on a rip tide freaks ride
sleep inside a parasite's appetite
oh say can't ya see the chemistry
the parasites who cleanup things
death letter hands recycled cans
get well cards to the hostage vans

don't let the sun catch ya crying
don't let the sun catch ya crying

You're a deadweight right straight
on your way sunk in the midnight shade
skies burn eyes turn
learning to counterfeit their disease
in this town where we roam 
we bluff our souls on canteen patios
drink the greatest draft 
the music drags the music drags the music drags...

don't let the sun catch ya crying
don't let the sun catch ya crying---
