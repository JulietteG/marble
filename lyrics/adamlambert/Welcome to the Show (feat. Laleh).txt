You know I have a veil
All covered up, to myself
It's always there
Now they wanna know...
How does it feel?
Gonna let it show
I'm happy to entertain and share with you
It's hard to say how your own thoughts can hurt you

I'm gonna let them stare
They feel like me out there

So welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
Let it shine on you
We're together here tonight
Welcome to the show
Welcome to my life
Welcome to the show
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life

I know I have my flaws
I pay the price but I'm grateful
You're letting me be myself
The good and the bad

I'm gonna let them stare
They feel like me out there

So welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
Let it shine on you
We're together here tonight
Welcome to the show
Welcome to my life
Welcome to the show
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life

Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life
My life
My life

I'm gonna let them stare
I'm gonna let you in (I'm gonna let you)
I'm gonna let them (I'm gonna let them)
They feel like me out there

So welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
Let it shine on you
We're together here tonight
Welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
Let it shine on you
We're together here tonight
Welcome to the show
Welcome to my life
Welcome to the show
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life

Welcome to my life
My life
My life
My life
Welcome to my life---
