Well I can't, Remember 
Much at all
Wait for the fall

So tell me
Why your here
Looking over, My shoulder
Seems none of us
Are any older

So tell me
Why your here, And how
How high must we Climb
In order to fall
What will it be this time
Just waiting for your call
And the Joker said, some
Don't ya know
Your on your own
The End here
Were on our own

Standing 
In the Lions den
It's only, much of anything
So tell me
Why your here and how

How high must we Climb
In order to fall
What will it be this time
Just waiting for your call
And the Joker said some

Don't ya know
Your on your own
The end you
Were on our own

The end you 
Were on our own---Lyrics submitted by maia harmon.
