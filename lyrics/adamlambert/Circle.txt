You turn just to spite me
You run where I cannot see
You walk all over me but you won't, you won't

You know what you'll never be
You show all your pleasantries
You love to incite me but you won't, no you won't

Every time I hear the sound of footsteps walking up to my door
I turn around and I don't see your face inside my mind anymore

The circle is now complete
The loser admits defeat
Stop reading between the lines
No one will realize

You want what you can't possess
You'd love for me to confess
You said that you were the best
But you're not, no you're not

Turn the spinning wheel and turn me out to where there's nothing at all
Slipping through my fingers, losing grip and I can still hear you fall

The circle is now complete
The loser admits defeat
Stop reading between the lines
No one will realize

The circle is now complete
The circle...

Turn the spinning wheel and turn me out to where there's nothing at all---Lyrics submitted by Rachel Barnhart.
