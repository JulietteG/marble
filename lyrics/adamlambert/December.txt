November, not much to remember
You were not in sight
December, change in the weather
You were by my side

Love, it's all we want
Love, love, it's all we need
It's all that we really want

No matter where the day goes
I know your close by
Changes in the seasons
It's just whats required

Love, it's all we want
Love, love, it's all we need
It's all that really want

Love, It's all we want
Love, love, it's all we need
It's all we really want

Yeah

Love, love, love, love
It's what we want, It's 
What we want
It's we really need

Love, love, love,love,
It's what we want, it's
What we want
It's what we really need

Yeah

Love, It's what we want
It's what we really want
Yeah, love---Lyrics submitted by Shannon.
