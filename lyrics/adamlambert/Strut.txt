I want to start a revolution 
A type of personal solution 
We all have got our own pollution 
Its all about the execution 

You got something to say 
Your hands are tied 
Open your mouth, open it wide 
Let the freedom begin 
Get on the floor, just let it drop 
Dont it feel good, dont it feel hot? 
Feel the fire within 

I wanna see you strut. strut, strut
Cmon walk for me 
Strut, strut, strut
How you wanna be 

Everybodys looking for some love 
But they dont know 
How to let it all hang out 
And thats why theyre solo, solo, solo
Dont wanna be solo, solo, solo 
Dont wanna be solo 

Were a complicated nation 
And now were in a situation 
Lets take a make believe vacation 
And get yourself some validation 

You got something to say 
Your hands are tied 
Open your mouth, open it wide 
Let the freedom begin 
Get on the floor, just let it drop 
Dont it feel good, dont it feel hot? 
Feel the fire within 

I wanna see you strut, strut, strut 
Cmon walk for me 
Strut, strut, strut
How you wanna be 

Everybodys lookin for some love 
But they dont know 
How to let it all hang out 
And thats why theyre solo, solo, solo
Dont wanna be solo, solo, solo
Dont wanna be solo 

Ill be a leader 
Darling, let your hair down 
Show me what youre working with and let me see you 
Strut, strut, strut, strut

How you wanna be
Everybodys lookin for some love 
But they dont know 
How to let it all hang out 
And thats why theyre solo, solo, solo
Dont wanna be solo, solo, solo
Dont wanna be solo 

Strut for me and show me what youre working with 
Strut for me and show me what youre working with

Yeah, Yeah, Ye-eah!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeeahh!
Ooohhh!---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.
