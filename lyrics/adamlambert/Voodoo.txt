Moon shine on the bayou
Love shrine break the taboo
I wanna know what's in your potion
Bound by total devotion

I was lookin' for love all over
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)

Swamp sings over the bazaar
Snake bites aligning stars
I'm in rapture there is no cure
No sanctuary from your allure 

I was lookin' for love all over
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell) 

'Cause the voodoo you do 
Is all that can do 
To make me into your fool
'Cause when you do voodoo 
I'm just like a doll 
That pins keep pushing into

So every time I try to break this trance
I'm almost afraid I'll miss my chance
To be bewitched by the bayou
I just gotta say I want your hex
I don't want to live without your hex
I'm so obsessed with your sexiness

Yeah.....

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo 
(under your spell)
(So obsessed with your sexiness)---Lyrics submitted by Felicia.
