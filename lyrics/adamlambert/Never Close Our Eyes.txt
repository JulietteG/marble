(feat. Bruno Mars)

I wish that this night would never be over
Theres plenty of time to sleep when we die
So lets just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way wed never close our eyes, our eyes, never!

I dont wanna let a minute get away
Cause we got no time to lose
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose

Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I dont wanna miss a second with you
Lets stay this way forever
Its only getting better if we want it to

But you know I wish that this night would never be over
Theres plenty of time to sleep when we die
So lets just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way wed never close our eyes, our eyes, never!

It's so hard to think this would fade away
But what goes up must come down
Why can't we just live life with no consequence
Got no way of living the now

Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I dont wanna miss a second with you
Lets stay this way forever
It only gets better if we want it to

You know I wish that this night would never be over
Theres plenty of time to sleep when we die
So lets just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way wed never close our eyes, our eyes, never---
