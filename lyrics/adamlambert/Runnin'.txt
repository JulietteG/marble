Steel to my tremblin' lips
How did the night ever get like this?
One shot and the whiskey goes down, down, down
Bottom of the bottle hits
Waking up my mind as I throw a fit
The breakin is takin me down, down, down

My heats beating faster
I know what Im after

Ive been standing here my whole life
Everything Ive seen twice
Now its time I realized
Its spinning back around now
On this road Im crawlin
Save me cause Im fallin
Now I cant seem to breathe right
Cause I keep runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin from my heart

Round and around I go
Addicted to the numb livin in the cold
The higher, the lower, the down, down, down
Sick of being tired and sick
And ready for another kind of fix
The damage is damning me down, down, down

My heats beating faster
I know what Im after

Ive been standing here my whole life
Everything Ive seen twice
now its time I realized
Its spinning back around now
On this road Im crawlin
Save me cause Im fallin
Now I cant seem to breathe right
Cause I keep runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin from my heart

Oh, Im coming alive
Oh, Ill wake up now and live
Oh, Im coming alive
A life thats always been a dream
Ill wake up now and live

Ive been standing here my whole life
My heats beating faster
I know what Im after

Ive been standing here my whole life
Everything Ive seen twice
Now its time I realized
Its spinning back around now
On this road Im crawlin
Save me cause Im fallin
Now I cant seem to breathe right
Cause I keep runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin from my heart
Cause I keep runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin runnin runnin runnin
Runnin from my heart---
