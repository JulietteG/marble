break out over mechanical
step right up to the freaky intangible
hands un-cuffed take the leash off this animal
if its gettin' high fee hit me with a night-c 

slip right into your stripper shoes
roll the dice i can sneak out some deja vu 
rompin off fire meltin with ballyhoo
tune in tune in turn on turn on drop by

goin down the rabbit hole
get away from all we know
oh come on follow 
come on and follow me
goin down the rabbit hole
in hoes and gigalos
oh come on follow
come on and follow me
quick slow high or low 
 youre never gonna know for sho
see in stereo
down the rabbit hole

catnip and honey 
tea timin all over town
houses of candy build em up and then burn em down
it melts in the face and not in armour-All
it starts in the bass and it end in a crystal ball
yea

goin down the rabbit hole 
get away from all we know
come on follow
come on and follow me goin down the rabbit hole
in hoes and gigalos
oh come on follow 
come on and follow me
disco rodeo
my kaleidoscope
Cleopatra knows 
whats down the rabbit hole

goin down the rabbit hole
get away from all we know
come on follow come on and follow me
goin down the rabbit hole
in hoes and gigalos
come on follow come on and follow me
quick slow high or low
youre never gonna know for sho
see in stereo
down the rabbit hole

who are you?
who are you?
who are you?
who you
who you are
who
