I want your body, mind, soul, etc.
And one day you'll see
you should give it to me
And I don't want anyone instead of ya
Oh babe, I'm going crazy
Come on and give it to me
And I ain't never met anyone better-er
You're someone else's baby

I'm sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya
I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine
And look into my eyes baby eyes

Oh ya make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah ya make me wanna listen to music again

There have been many moons before I met ya
And I ain't going no where
And now you give me back my raison d'etre
And I'm inspire again

And I know in some ways 
we're kinda evil
Got my roots
and you've got ties
But my heart's no stranger to upheaval
Put your little hand in mine
And look into my eyes baby eyes

Oh ya make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah ya make me wanna listen to music again

Aaaaah, music again
Look into my eyes baby eyes
I just wanna listen to music again

Oh yeah oh yeah whoa
Oh
Hey

I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya
I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine
and look into my eyes baby eyes

Whoa
Oh ya make me wanna listen to music again
Whoa
Yeah ya make me wanna listen to music again
Whoa
Oh ya make me wanna listen to music again
Whoa
Yeah ya make me wanna listen to music again---Lyrics submitted by Izzy.
