Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
Walk on alone
Its not the first time
Its not the worst crime
Your soul will be okay

And you had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

Burned by your dreams
Its never how it seems
Cold crushed esteem
Take shelter and hide forever
Your soul will be okay

And you had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new


And you had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new

Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
I will take you home
Its not the first time
Its not the worst crime
Our souls will be okay---Lyrics submitted by Destenie.
