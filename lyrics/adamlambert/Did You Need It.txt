So one of us has to go, we know
One of us, yeah
Come out, it's time to go

And was the spotlight
Up above you
Shining so bright
A searchlight, signaling?
Ahh, yeeaahh.

And as the storm
Rolls in a-yea-yeaahhh
Leave it all within
I guess there's a first time for everything

It was the spotlight
Up above you
Shining so bright,
A searchlight, signaling
Ohh, yeahhh

Now where the hell, does it go?
And was the road too long?

It was the spotlight
Up above you
Shining so bright
A searchlight

Signali-ing
To bring you home
Always warning
You'd found the love of your life.

Did ya need it, did ya want it?
Did ya find him?
Did ya need it?

And where the hell, did ya, go?
And was the road, too long?---Lyrics submitted by veron.
