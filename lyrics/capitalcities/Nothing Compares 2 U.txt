It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues,

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong?

I went to the doctor guess what she told me
Guess what she told me
She said boy you better try to have fun
No matter what you do
But she's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you 
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you---Lyrics submitted by Michael Smith.
