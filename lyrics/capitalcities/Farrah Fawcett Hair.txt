You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit

[Andre 3000]
Falling mirrors and a her hair in above 
Kids with big glasses that laugh when they run
Girls with old-school names like Ruby May
Have infants with baby breath, yawn in your face (oh yeah)
You'll be tucked in every night for a month
By all of the American Apparel ad girls
American... American Apparel ad, as girls
You know what I mean?

I like it when you're under the ocean and all you can feel is calm
I like it when I'm sleeping
I like it when I'm listening to music because that's the only thing that takes me to another world
I like it when public bathrooms have scented candles
I like it when you talk to me like that
I like it when it rains at night and I'm curled up in bed with a good book
I like it when I turn my head around and I catch you looking back

[Hook]
You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
Oh yeah
(I like it when you play with my hair)

You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit
It's good shit (Oh, it's good shit baby)
It's good shit
Oh yeah
