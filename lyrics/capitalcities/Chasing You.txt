Broken down on the side of the road
It'd be nice if you could help me out
I drove for miles to the place I was told
I could find you in the shadow of doubt

But you weren't there
(I was there)
You weren't there
(I was there)

Chasing you
It's the only thing I want to do
But now I'm facing you
What the hell am I supposed to do

Is it foolish to follow the rules when everybody's following you
You gave directions that make no sense and now I'm fucking stuck in a loop

But you're not there
I was there
You're not there
I was there

Chasing you
It's the only thing I want to do
But now I'm facing you
What the hell am I supposed to do

You must think I'm a mannequin
Because I only come alive in my Sunday best
But somehow I'm on the run again
So you probably shouldn't hold your breath
Don't train yourself to be a fool
I only want to stick around if you pass the test
Don't cross the line
Stop chasing time
Cause in time you'll find that I-I-I'm just
Chasing you
Chasing you

Chasing you
It's the only thing I want to do
But now I'm facing you
What the hell am I supposed to do

I'm 
Chasing you
It's the only thing I want to do
But now I'm facing you
What the hell am I supposed to do

Chasing you
Chasing you---Lyrics submitted by Rumi Tucker.
