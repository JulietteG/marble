Beggars can't be choosers
But i choose to be a beggar
So I'm always on the move
my heart is always on the mend

Hailstorms, rain, and snow I go
No hurricane can stop me, no
It's up and over and back down home again

We played Memphis last Night,
it was fine
Next stop on the tour
is bound to hold my peace of mind

Oh it always puts 
A smile on my face and it's the 
first time I've been back here since 
the last time that I came
And I think you're really pretty
and that's all I'm gonna say
Did you miss me Mississippi?
Would you kiss me if i stayed?

That house was built before 
the first world war
and I can see her now
standing on the  porch
that baby boy's daddy's
going to fight and 
she hopes and prays
that he'll come home
and they'll be happy and lord,
Lord, I pray that she's right

Wind blowin' thru the trees
Oh, it feels like heave's breathing' down on me

Oh it always puts 
A smile on my face and it's the 
first time I've been back here since 
the last time that I came
And I think you're really pretty
and that's all I'm gonna say
Did you miss me Mississippi?
Would you kiss me if i stayed?
Oh, No Yeah

I have to leave you in the morning
That old 55 to 12
but I'll be back again
before the leaves turn orange
So, I'll say goodbye for now

Oh it always puts 
A smile on my face and it's the 
first time I've been back here since 
the last time that I came
And I think you're really pretty
and that's all I'm gonna say
Did you miss me?

Oh it always puts 
A smile on my face and it's the 
first time I've been back here since 
the last time that I came
And I think you're really pretty
and that's all I'm gonna say
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me, Mississippi?
Would you kiss me if i stayed?

Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, My God
da, da, da, da, da, da

Oh, No, No
Ohhhhh....
No, No, No
Na, na, na, na
da, da, da, da, da, da---Lyrics submitted by Yetta Rodriguez.
