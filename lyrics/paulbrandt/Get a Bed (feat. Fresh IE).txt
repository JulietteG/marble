Seems like everybody nowadays
Is truckin' down to the river
Or down to the lake
With their moonshine home-made wine
Flyin' high and in the mood, ha
And maybe I'm shy or a little naive
But there's a lotta ticks down in them weeds
Hoods and tailgates are great
But honey, I want more for you
Yeah, I can think of a lot of ways better
For you and me to get together

We could get a house
We could get a bed
Honey, think of how nice that'd be instead
Ain't nothin' wrong with the great outdoors
But baby, that's what RV's are for
I love my jacked up pickup truck
But I love you a million times as much
And you deserve the best
We could get a bed

Do do, do do do do
Do do
Ah baby, we could get a bed
Do do, do do do do

I'd be in it for good
In it for keeps
I ain't the kinda guy who loves and leaves
I appreciate nature, but I prefer a roof above
And I know it don't sound quite as cool as
Gettin' stuck in the woods with those other dudes
Skinny-dippin'
Shine-sippin'
Masters of vehicular love
Compared to them I ain't with it
But if you're looking for a little commitment

We could get a house
We could get a bed
Honey, think of how nice that'd be instead
Ain't nothin' wrong with the great outdoors
But baby, that's what RV's are for
I love my jacked up pickup truck
But I love you a million times as much
And you deserve the best
We could get a bed

Do do, do do do do

Before we take off any clothing
Consider what I'm proposing
Check, check, uh, yeah
C'mon Friesh IE, bring it

Not here to dis you or dismiss you
Your ma girl and I wanna get wit you
You're all
Ohhh boy, I love your truck with the bling on it
And I just wanna take your finger
Put a ring on it
Trhough all kids of weatha'
For worse or fo' betta'
On the clock (tic toc)
All the time we're togetha'
I'm gonna love you and respect you
Treat you like you're my treasure
You'll be tha'
Queen of my double-wide trailer
Foreva

We could get a house
We could get a bed
Honey, think of how nice that'd be instead
Ain't nothin' wrong with the great outdoors
But baby, that's what RV's are for
I love my jacked up pickup truck
But I love you a million times as much
And you deserve the best
We could get a bed

Do do, do do do do
Do do
Ah baby, we could get a bed
Do do, do do do do

Mmmm, mmmm
Baby, we could get a bed
Ah, baby we could get a bed---
