shot gun everybody getting for the long run 
don't know where we're going 
but the out come comes with a little bit of trust 
lets go following whatever where the wind blows 
flying with our hands out of the window 
we didn't even see the dust 

see how far we get 
driving straight ahead 
getting lost 
didn't seem to matter much 
all we had was time 
and a yellow line 
looking back we didn't even see the dust 

(chorus) shot gun everybody getting for the long run 
don't know where we're going 
but the out come comes with a little bit of trust 
lets go following whatever where the wind blows 
flying with our hands out of the window 
we didn't even see the dust 

ohhhh yeah 
didn't even see it 

we had ups and downs 
we got spun around 
we held on when the going got a little tough 
it took love and faith 
and some give and take 
and grace 
no we didn't even see the dust 

shot gun everybody getting for the 

(chorus) shot gun everybody getting for the long run 
don't know where we're going 
but the out come comes with a little bit of trust (oohhhhh) 
lets go following whatever where the wind blows 
flying with our hands out of the window 
we didn't even see the dust 

come on now! 

lets go following whatever where the wind blows 
flying with our hands out of the window 
we didn't even see the dust---Lyrics submitted by Tanin.
