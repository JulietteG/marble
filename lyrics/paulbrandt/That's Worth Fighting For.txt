Weve been around in circles about a thousand times
And babe its been so long and I just dont know why
Does it really even matter whos wrong or right, Anymore
I cant believe I spoke to you that way
And Im trying to forget the words I heard you say
How our two hearts are holding this much hate and pain
I dont know
I dont know 

But I know I cant remember 
No I dont know the reason 
Why we ever started fighting anymore
If we could just lose the temper
Find a way to be more tender 
Our love is just too strong to ignore
And thats worth fighting for

Its just foolish pride that hold these feelings back
cause i look into your eyes and im a helpless man
And I know you hate it when I try to make you laugh
Even so, I want to hold you like I never done
Say sorry long before tomorrow morning comes 
show you how i know that im the lucky one 
cause babe i know
babe i know

I know I cant remember 
No I dont know the reason
why we ever started fighting anymore 
If we could just lose the temper
Find a way to be more tender
Our love is just too strong to ignore
And thats worth fighting for

Fighting for
This loves worth fighting for

I know I cant remember 
No I dont know the reason
why we ever started fighting anymore 
If we could just lose the temper
Find a way to be more tender
Our love is just too strong to ignore
And thats worth fighting for---Lyrics submitted by tiffany.
