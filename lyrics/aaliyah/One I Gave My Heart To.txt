How could the one I gave my heart to, break my heart so bad
How could the one who made me happy, make me feel so sad
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand 
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that
How could the one I gave my world to, throw my world away
How could the one who said I love you, say the things you say
How could the one I was so true too, just tell me lies
How could the one I gave my heart to, go and break this heart of mine
Tell me
How could you be so cold to me, when I gave you everything
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door
How could you not love me anymore
I thought we had forever
I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with, take my dreams from me
How could the love that brought such pleasure, bring such misery
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please
If you love me, how could you do that to me
Tell me
Woah hay ay
hay hay
umh mm
umh
yeah yeah yeah
How could you just walk out the door
How could you not love me anymore
I thought we had forever
I can't understand
How could the one I gave my heart to, break my heart so bad
How could the one who made, make me feel so so sad
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand
If you love me, How could you hurt me like that
How could the one I gave my world to, throw my world away
How could the one who said I love you, say the things you say
How could the one I was so true to, just tell me lies
How could the one I gave my heart to
How could the one I gave my heart to
How could the one I gave my heart to, break my heart so bad
Tell me
Woo
