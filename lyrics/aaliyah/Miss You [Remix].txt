sup baby girl
Felt I had to talk to you again
missin you
Tim is missin you, missy's missin you, Rashad is missin you, your mom is missin you, you pop is missin you, Dame is missin you Damn we missin you 

All we listen to is all the different you
is 4 page letters in addition to
Have you ever loved sombody 
use to get the party poppin
we use to party hop
we use to be in the hamptons party alot
we was the breakfast club
you was apart of the rock
we use to make up special names for the food we ate
remember cereal pie one of your favorite plates
Well Dame told me to tell you he's doin well due to the circumstances
It could have been bellevue
But I ain't gotta tell you, you lookin over us 
our little angel
But you know what 

Brooklyn's missin you, detroit is missin you, New Orleans is missin you, Philly's missin you
It's been to long and I'm lost with out you
Your uncles missin you, your family's missin you, you fans is missin you Valerie's missin you, Damn we missin you
It's been to long and I'm lost without you

Now Star is mad I won't grant him an interview 
Now he's dissin me cause he dissed you
can you believe the nerve of this dude
cause your memory I won't bring it da pistol
But he got issues
enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents pain
But I know God's protecting you
We use to read seed of the soul
I know God's perfecting you
All the extra you
The architecture you are
The more intellectual you are
So professional 
Our little purple star 
too good for earth you are

I miss you
Houston's missin you, LA's missin you, DC's missin you , Chicago's missin you
It's been to long and I'm lost without you
Kathad is missin you, Chaka's missin you, Kelleen is missin you, Tanya's missin you
It's been to lonag and I'm lost with out you

By they way Big we missin you, Pac we missin you 
We feel you presence just not in the physical
All across the world blocks is miserable
Ya'll left a void theres alot of little yous
and they not origional and they not identical
Niggas studied your flows and they'd watch your interview
I swear on hip hop if it's not ten of you
then there gotta be more
ya'll left your paws footprints on the game hood ain't been da same
feelin ain't been in music hooks ain't been da same
But i'm doin what I can man tryin to follow yall down memory lane man
Big you'd be ashamed to see new york game man
Pac you feel da same man they use you name in vein
But I guess thats the issue and it proves how much niggas really miss you

I miss you
Pun we miss you, Regale we miss you, Left Eye we miss you, Jay we missin you
Jam Master Jay, Ricky Ty, Scotland Rock This your song
The world is missin you The hood is missin you
Know what I mean
Miss Ya'll
This goes to all our fallen soldiers
Soldiers and soldettes
All accross the world
I miss you
we gonnna hold ya'll down
Ya'll livin in our memory forever
We never gonna let Ya'll go
(I can't think no more)
We not remembering you death though 
We celebrating you life know what I mean
(since you went away I don't really feel like talkin no one here to love me baby do you understand me, I can't do a thing without you)
Damn we missin you
(Wondering if your the same and who's been with you 
I miss you 2x)---Lyrics submitted by Jucenta.
