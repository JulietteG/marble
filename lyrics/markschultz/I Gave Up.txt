I gave up all my striving
I gave up living lies 
I gave up analyzing if I measure up or if Im right?
I gave up criticizing  
I gave up being right
I gave up always trying to be good enough in some peoples eyes

Chorus:  

Well I dont need a house on top of the world
I like the car Im driving
Everything I got aint what Im worth
Thats not the reason Im living
I dont need to see my name in lights or leave any grand impression 
Ive got everything I need in life cause loves all were taking to heaven

I gave up comprising
I gave up all my pride
I gave up justifying and found who I was in my Saviors eyes

Chorus

Always working, never stopping, talking on the cell phone
Never find the time to get away and leave the work load
Run around in circles just to keep up with the Joneses
Even in the 9 to 5 all I really know is .....

I dont need a house on top of the world
I like the car Im driving
Everything I got aint what Im worth
Thats not the reason Im living

I dont need a house on top of the world
I like the car Im driving
Everything I got aint what Im worth
Thats not the reason Im living
I dont need to see my name in lights or leave any grand impression 
Ive got everything I need in life cause loves all were taking to heaven

I gave up all my striving
I gave up living lies 
I gave up justifying and found who I was in my Saviors eyes

I gave up x 2
Oh I gave up 
I gave up 
Oh yea!---Lyrics submitted by Connie Lancaster.
