We bow our hearts, we bend our knees
Oh Spirit, come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil things
Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.

So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another.

And God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face, Oh, God of Jacob
And God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face, Oh, God of Jacob.

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees
Oh spirit, come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil things
Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.

So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another.

And God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face, Oh, God of Jacob
And God let us be a generation thet seeks
That seeks your face, Oh, God of Jacob.

So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another.

And God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face, Oh, God of Jacob
And God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks your face, Oh, God of Jacob.---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
