Down on my knees again tonight
Hoping this prayer will turn out right
See there is a boy that needs your help
Ive done all that I can do myself

Hes mother is tired
Im sure you can understand
Each night as he sleeps
She goes into hold his hand
And she tries, not to cry, as the tears
Fill of her eyes

Can you hear me?
Am I getting through tonight?
Can you see him?
Can you make him feel alright?
You can hear me
Let me take his place somehow
See hes not just anyone
Hes my son

Sometimes late at night I watch him sleep
I dream of the boy hed like to be
I try to be strong and see him through
God who he needs right now, is you
Let him grow old
Live life without this fear
What would I be
Living without him here
Hes so tired
And hes scared
Let him know
That youre there

Can you hear me?
Am I getting through tonight?
Can you see him?
Can you make him feel alright?
You can hear me
Let me take his place somehow?
See hes not just anyone
Hes my son

Can you hear me?
Am I getting through tonight?
Can you see him?
Can you make him feel alright?
You can hear me
Let me take his place somehow
See hes not just anyone

Can you hear me?
Can you see him?
Please dont leave him
Hes my son---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
