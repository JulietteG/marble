Come, thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy praise.
Streams of mercy, never ceasing 
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above!
Praise the fount, I'm fixed upon it 
Fount of thy redeeming love.

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by thy love I come
And I hope, by thy good pleasure 
Safely to the life at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the folds of God
He, to rescue me from danger 
Interposed his precious blood

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be.
Let thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love!
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above.

Come, thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy praise.
Streams of mercy, never ceasing 
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above!
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above.
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above.---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
