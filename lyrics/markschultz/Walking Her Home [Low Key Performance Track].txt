looking back he sees it all. 
it was her first date the night he came to call.
and her dad said "son have her home on time, and promise me you'll never leave her side."
He took her to a show in town and he was ten feet off the ground.
as he was walking her home and holding her hand.
oh the way she smiled it stole the breath right out of him
down that old road with the stars up above
He remembers where he was the night he fell in love
He was walking her home.

Ten more years and a waiting room at a half past one
so when the doctor said come in and meet your son
and his knees went weak when he saw his wife 
she was smiling and she said he's got your eyes
and as she slept he held her tight,

His mind went back to that first night
oh he was walking her home and holding her hand
oh the way she smiled it stole the breath right out of him
down that old road with the stars up above
he remembers where he was the night he fell in love
he was walking her home

He walked her through the best days of her life
sixty years together and he never left her side
a nursing home, at eighty-five
and the doctor said this could be her last night
and the nurse said "oh, should we tell him now, 
or should we wait until the morning to find out?"
but when they checked her room that night
he was laying by her side

Oh he was walking her home and holding her hand
oh the way she smiled when he said "this is not the end"
just for a while, they were eighteen
and she was still more beautiful to him than anything
he was walking her home,
he was walking her home

Looking back, he sees it all
it was her first date the night he came to call---Lyrics submitted by Alexis.
