Long ago on the Texas Plains was a little that never changed...

Until a man rode into town
A ranger known for miles around
He could keep the peace without a gun
From Abilene down to Galveston
And when he rode by the general store
People crowded through the door
To see the ledgend and the man called McBride

Chorus:
Oh...In Iverson

Through the doors of the old hotel
A burning fire began to build
People screaming for their lives
And the first one there was John McBride
Just as soon as he stepped in
People saw the roof cave in
and everybodyknew that he would not survive

Chorus

Then a lady right outside
Said her baby boy was trapped inside
But not a man could fight the flames
And she she knew that it would be to late
But through the smoke and the burning flames
She heard her baby call her name
The boy appeard but no one knew who saved his life

And when the boy grew old and gray
he spoke about that fateful day
And the man who saved his life
Texas Ranger John McBride

Chorus

Ya Ya Ya Ya

Still people travel far and wide
To hear the Legend of McBride---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
