I call
you hear me
Ive lost it all , and its more than i can bare, 
i feel so empty
You're strong, i'm weary
I'm holding on, but i feel like giving in
but still you're with me

And even thought im walking through the valley of the shadow
i will hold tight to the hand of him whos love will comfort me
when all hope is gone and i've been wounded in the battle,
he is all the strength that i will ever need
HE WILL CARRY ME

i know im broken,
but you alone can mend this heart of mine, 
you're always with me

and even though im walking through the valley of the shadow
i will hold tight to the hand of him who's love will comfort me
when all hope is gone and i've been wounded in the battle,
he is all the strength that i will ever need,
HE WILL CARRY ME
HE WILL CARRY ME

and even though i feel so lonely
 like i have never been before,
you never said it would be easy, 
but you said you'd see me through the storm

and even though im walkin through the valley of the shadow
i will hold tight to the hand of him whos love will comfort me
when all hope is gone and i've been wounded in the battle,
he is all the strength that i will ever need,
HE WILL CARRY ME
HE WILL CARRY ME
HE WILL CARRY ME---Lyrics submitted by Zach.
