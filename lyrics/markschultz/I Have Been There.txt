In a room without a view, a new mother smiles and holds the tiny fingers of her brand new baby girl.
Her husband takes her by the hand, so unsure about the future, and no money.
Can they make it in this world?
And they pray, Lord all we have to give is love.
Then they heard a gentle voice, like an echo from above.

I have been there! I know what fear is all about, yes I have been there!
And I'm standing with you now!
I have been there,
And I came to build the bridges on this broken road leading home,
Oh I have been there.


He's been a pastor 20 years,
But tonight he sits alone and broken hearted in the corner of the church.
I'm tryin to change a fallen world,
With this words and with this wisdom, but it seems like it is only gettin worse.
And he cries, Oh Lord I just don't understand.
Then he felt the hand of Grace, 
And he heard a voice that said:

"I have been there! I know what pain is all about, yes I have been there!
And I'm standing with you now!
I have been there
And I came to build the bridges on this broken road leading home,
Oh I have been there.


An older man upon the hill, holding flowers but he can't hold back the tears,
For he has come to say goodbye.
He thinks about the life she lived, thinks about her heart,
He'll bear to live without her since she is right by his side.
And he cries, Oh Lord I loved her till the end.
Then he heard a gentle voice,
Sayin "You'll see her once again."

"I have been there! I know what sorrow is all about, yes I have been there!
And I'm standing with you now!
I have been there 
The road will lead her home! Oh I have been there!
You know I overcame the cross,
Yes I have been there!
So that life will not be lost!
Oh I have been there!
And I came to build the bridges on this broken leading road, the road will lead you hom!
Oh I have been there!
Yes I have been there!---Lyrics submitted by Christy.
