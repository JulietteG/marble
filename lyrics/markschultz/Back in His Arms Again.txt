I see it in your eyes 
The pain you keep inside
Slowly tearing you apart 

And though you've run away 
Reminded day by day 
You've stumbled and you've fallin 
Still he's callin

Chorus:
Cause I believe that he loves you where you are 
I believe that you've seen the hands of God 
I believe that you'll know it when you're back in his arms again
I believe that he never let you go 
I believe that he's wanting you to know 
I believe that he'll lead you till your back in his arms again 

I'm glad I found you here
Cause inbetween the tears
Something in your eyes shows hope 
And I stand before you now 
As one that knows about 
Coming to him open and broken

Chorus: 
And i know that he's callin 
He's callin you home 

Chours: 
echoed :(One life One love One way home) 
And when you rise and when you fall 
He will see you through it all 
He is with you through it all 
Back in his arms again 

Chorus:
Your back in his arms
back in his arms again---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
