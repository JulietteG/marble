He who dwelleth in the secret place 
Of the most high shall abide 
Under the shadow 
Under the shadow 
Of the Almighty 

Though a thousand 
Fall before me 
From the evil 
Thats around me 
They shall not 
They shall not come nigh my dwelling 

And I will say of the Lord He is my refuge and my fortress 
My God in Him will I trust 
And I will not be afraid of the snare of the fowler 
My God in Him will I trust---Lyrics submitted by kim.
