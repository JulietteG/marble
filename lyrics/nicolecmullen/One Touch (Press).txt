Been ostricized for 12 years, im used to being alone, spent everything I had and now, its gone. I'm used to being put down, my issues tell it all, my only hope is in this fall, if I could just touch the hymn of His garment, I know, i'd be made whole, if i could just press my way through this madness, His love, would heel my soul if only one touch. 
So many people calling, how could He ever know, that just the brush of Him would, stop the flow. If He new that they rebuked me or shamed me to the ground well, im desperate cause its never or its now. 
If i could just touch, the hymn of His garment, i noe i'd be made whole, if i could just press my way through this madness, His love, would heel my soul. And then suddenly He turned around, He said somebody has unleashed my power, well frightend and unbarressed i bowed, you see i don't amund my troubles and how high, how high high high high.
I have to touch the hymn of His garment, and I know I've been, made whole, and how I have pressed my way through this madness, and His love has heeled my soul and that with one word touch.
 He touched the hymn of my garment, and you no ive been made whole and some how he pressed His way through my madness and His love has heeled my soul, I tell ya. He touched me, He reached way down and touched me, when no one else would touch me your Jesus touched me, and I know i've been made whole.---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
