I dont know if light is brighter 
In the earth or the soul 
I dont know which night is darker 
The one I do or dont know 

Chorus 
But Im convinced 
Im persuaded 
I will not be separated 
From the love 
I have in You 
Cause neither death or life can severe 
Neither height or depth could measure the love You have 
And my love for You 

The wind will blow on everybody 
And rain will fall on us all 
And if the, weather of my life 
Is not like I want it, still 
Ill survive thru the storm 

Ill give it all 

(repeat)
