I got no arms,
I got no legs
I got no shoulders, but I got a head.
I got a head that tells me stupid things to do.
But I got heart
And I got hot.
And it's slowly buring me apart,
Cause i'll never feel same as you.
So tell me if this love?
Cause baby i'm a tin man!
And tell me if it's love.
I wanna be a real man!
ohhh

(instrumental)

Is this love?
Is  this pain?
I got a feelin I cannot name.
Slowly changing every part of me.
I know you think i'm just a toy,
But I wanna be a real boy.
Only boy to feel the same as you.

So tell me if this love?
Cause baby i'm a tin man!
Tell me if it's love.
I wanna be a real man!
Tell me if it's love.
Cause baby i'm a tin man!
Since you took my heart...
Got a missing heart...

Got a missing heart...
Got a missing heart...
Got a missing heart...
Got a missing heart...
Got a missing heart...

I got no arms,
I got no legs
I got no shoulders, but I got a head.
I got a head that tells me stupid things to do.
I cannot eat,
I cannot sleep.
I got a hole a hole inside of me,
Cause i'll never feel the same as you...
So tell me if this love?
Cause baby i'm a tin man!
Tell me if it's love.
I wanna be a real man!
Tell me if it's love.
Cause baby i'm a tin man!
Since you took my heart...
Got a missing heart...

Got a missing heart...
Got a missing heart...
Got a missing heart...

Woah Woah

Got a missing heart...

Woah Woah

Got a missing heart...

Woah Woah

Got a missing heart...

Woah Woah oh oh oh!!!

Got a missing heart!
Got a missing heart!---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
