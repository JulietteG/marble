Strange, strange attractor 
Strange attractor 

Verse: 
The light in your eyes 
Well it's pulling me in 
Yeah, it's pulling me in 
A heart that's still speeding up 
And it's coming again 
Yeah it's coming again 
How did it happen? 
How did it come to this? 
taking me over 

Chorus: 
It only comes in waves 
And then it goes away 
Well it must be chemical 
Well it must be chemical 
Well it must be chemical 
Chemical 
Chemical 

Verse: 
The light in your eyes 
Well it's pulling me in 
And it's pulling me in 
Push your arms; lift them up 
And it's coming again 
Yeah, it's coming again 
How did it happen? 
How did it come to this? 
taking me over 

Chorus: 
It only comes in waves 
And then it goes away 
Well it must be chemical 
Well it must be chemical 
Well it must be chemical 
Chemical 
Chemical 
Chemical 
Chemical 

And somethings happening 
It's like coming up for air 
Breathe it in again 

It only comes in waves 
And then it goes away 
Well it must be chemical 
Well it must be chemical 
Well it must be chemical 
Chemical 
Chemical 
Yeah it must be chemical
