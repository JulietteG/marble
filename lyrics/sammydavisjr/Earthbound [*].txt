Earthbound, my heart was Earthbound 
Til I looked into your eyes 

I found my heart was Earthbound 
Til you took it to the skies 

I felt your arms around me 
And I was safe and warm in your embrace 
Suddenly, the change that bound me 
Were gone and I was soaring into space 

I thought happiness missed me 
But you changed my world around 

Yes, I was Earthbound 
Until you first kissed me 
And then in your arms 
I became Heavenbound 

(I thought happiness missed me 
But you changed my world around) 

Yes, I was Earthbound 
Until you first kissed me 
And then in your arms 
I became Heavenbound---Lyrics submitted by Johnny Quaglia.
