Oh, after watching her appeal from every angle
There's a big romantic due I've got to wangle
For I've fallen for a certain lovely lass
And it's not a passing fancy or a fancy pass
I love the look(s) of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you,  the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love at least a small percent of me do
For I love all of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love at least a small percent of me do
Baby for I love all of you
Bla du n du ba dooby do ya
For I love all of you---Lyrics submitted by Johnny Quaglia.
