Well I been seein' red and singing the blues far back as I can tell, til daisys came from heaven and decorate the gates of hell, you might b'lieve the world is sweet and fine as sugar candy, but I myself believe in whatever comes in handy
daisys up your butterfly, daisys up your butterfly, makes me up and wonder why, you got daisys up your butterfly: you're whistlin' past the graveyard, hopin' for the best, but a hum job after k-mart just might wreck your party dress, your poodle smokes, he'll probably choke and die in his own mink coat, your rainbow's bringing rain that's gunna sink your damn love boat: daisys up your butterfly, maybe maybe not, could be daisys up your butterfly or a bad day at Black Rock---
