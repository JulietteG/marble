Well, good morning, Captain
Well, good morning to you
Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run
Ha, ha, hip, ee, ee.........

Well, I'm an old mule skinner
From down Kentucky way
And I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, ha, ha
Well hey, hey

Little water boy, come here boy
Bring that water bucket around
Ha, ha, ha
If you don't like your job
Water boy, put that bucket down
Ha, ha, ha, ee, ee, ha, ha, ha---
