Three little children layin in the bed.
Two were sick and the other most dead.
Sent for the doctor, the doctor said,
"Feed those children on shortnin bread."

When those children layin in the bed
Heard that talk about shortnin bread,
They popped up well and started to sing,
Skipping round the room doing the pigeon wing.

Mammas little baby loves shortnin bread.

Mammas little baby loves shortnin bread.

Put on the skillet! Put on the lid!
Mammas going to make some shortnin bread.
Thats not all shes going to do,
Mammas going to cook us some cocoa too!

Mammas little baby loves shortnin bread.
Mammas little baby loves shortnin, shortnin,
Mammas little baby loves shortnin bread.

I snuck to the kitchen, picked up the lid,
I filled my pockets full of shortnin bread.
I winked at the pretty little girl and said,
"Baby, how'd you like some shortnin bread?"

Mammas little baby loves shortnin, shortnin,
Mammas little baby loves shortnin bread.
Mammas little baby loves shortnin, shortnin,
Mammas little baby loves shortnin bread.

Got caught with the skillet. Got caught with the lid.
Got caught with my mouth full of shortnin bread.
Six months for the skillet, six months for the lid
And five for stealing that fine bread---
