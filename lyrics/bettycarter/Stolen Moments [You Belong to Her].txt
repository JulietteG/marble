How I miss all our stolen little moments
The many times I'm not with you
They are such precious stolen moments
That are meant only for us two

Whenever you're gone
And I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember
When you disappear
With your face always there
Right in front of me dear
But you belong to her

But you belong to her

Why do we have to have stolen moments
Why can't I always have you near
Holding you in my arms forever
And I never have any fear
Whenever you're gone and I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember when you disappear
With your face, always there
Right in front of me dear
But you belong to her

I have heard when you have stolen moments
It is called an affair, unfair.
I don't want to have just stolen moments
So be mine and I'll always care
Whenever you're gone
I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember when you disappear
With your face, always there
Right in front of me dear
But, but, but you belong to her
You belong to her

How I miss all our stolen little moments
The many times I'm not with you
They are such precious stolen moments
That are meant only for us two

Whenever you're gone
And I know you're not here
It's so hard to remember
When you disappear
With your face always there
Right in front of me dear
But you belong to her

But you belong to her
But you belong to her
But you belong to her---Lyrics submitted by bito aguilos.
