Tonight I am a body in the desert
Tonight I wanna feel a body in my hands
Tonight there is no name I'd rather listen for
Then that one headed maniac leading that all girl band

Tonight there is no water in the gutters
Tonight there is a feeling coming through the sand
Tonight there is some trouble in my future
Like a storm cloud coming on the beat of this dried out land

Burned out and busted
Dead, tattoos, and babies
Who knew that's what love was all about

Tonight I'm on the bottom of the ocean
Tonight I can't see the light that's over me
Tonight I don't care about the morning
With its loose start giving ways and humbling tendered seeds

Burned out and busted
Dead, tattoos, and babies
Who knew that love could be deadly sweet

Like an Alibi
Deadly sweet
So sweet

Burned out and busted
Dead, tattoos, and babies
Who knew that's what love
Who knew that's what love

Who knew that's what love was all about---Lyrics submitted by Steve Drake.
