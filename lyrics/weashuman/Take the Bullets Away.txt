(feat. Lacey Sturm)

I've got my finger on the trigger
One bullet in the gun
And I'm spinning the revolver
Thinking this could be the one

I tried to find religion
To see what I'd become
I was ruined by the world
But I blamed it on the Son

Am I worthless?
Am I filthy?
Am I too far gone for a remedy?
Will you help me?
Cause I'm dying
To be something more than a memory
If I reach out
Can I trust you?
Will you help me see the light of one more day?
Take the bullets away
Take the bullets away

I've tried to build resistance
I've tried to start a war
But no one ever listened
I've battled with the storm

Am I worthless?
Am I filthy?
Am I too far gone for a remedy?
Will you help me?
Cause I'm dying
To be something more than a memory
If I reach out
Can I trust you?
Will you help me see the light of one more day?
Take the bullets away
Take the bullets away

You're so disarming
There's nothing left to fear
You're so disarming
I'd drop all my weapons to show you that I'm not afraid
Take the bullets away
Take the bullets away ---
