Said I'd never leave her
Cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue-tied over three words
Cursed, running over thoughts
That made my feet hurt
Bodies intertwine with her lips

Now she's feeling so low.
Since she went solo,
Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo

And it's no joke to me,
So can we do it all over again?

*CHORUS*
If you're pretending from the start
Like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss 
Everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road
two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it

Tell me with your mind, body and spirit.
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British.
Whether we're together or apart,
We can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start.

*CHORUS*
If you're pretending from the start
Like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss, can mend your broken heart
I might miss 
Everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again.

You'll never know,
How to make it on your own.
And you'll never show
Weakness for letting go.
I guess you're still hurt if this is over.
But do you really want to be alone?

*CHORUS*
If you're pretending from the start
Like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss, can mend your broken heart
I might miss 
Everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again.

*CHORUS*
If you're pretending from the start
Like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss, can mend your broken heart
I might miss 
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again.---Lyrics submitted by Deena Wood.
