Counted all my mistakes and there's only one 
Standing up on a list of the things I've done 
All the rest of my crimes don't come close 
To the look on your face when I let you go 

So I built you a house from a broken home 
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke 
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out 
How to fix up a heart that I let down 

Now I'm searching every lonely place 
Every corner calling out your name 
Trying to find you but I just don't know 
Where do broken hearts go? 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Get a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue 
It's at the top of the list of the things I want 
Mind is running in circles of you and me 
Anyone in between is the enemy 

Shadows come with the pain that you're running from 
Love was something you never heard enough 
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out 
How to fix up a heart that I let down 

Now I'm searching every lonely place 
Every corner calling out your name 
Trying to find you but I just don't know 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Are you fixing it by yourself? 
Or are you giving it to someone else? 
Trying to find you but I just don't know 
Where do broken hearts go? 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Tell me now, tell me now 
Tell me where you're going 
Will you be afraid? 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Tell me now, tell me now 
Tell me will you ever love me again? 
Love me again? 

Now I'm searching every lonely place 
Every corner calling out your name 
Trying to find you but I just don't know 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Are you fixing it by yourself? 
Or are you giving it to someone else? 
Trying to find you but I just don't know 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Tell me where you're hiding now? 
Where do broken hearts go? 
Come on baby, cause I need you now 
Where do broken hearts go? 
Tell me, cause I'm breaking down 
Where do broken hearts go? 

Come on baby, come and get me out 
Come on baby, come and get me out 
Come on baby, cause I need you now 

Where do broken hearts go? 
Where do broken hearts go? 
Where do broken hearts go? 
Where do broken hearts go?---
