I know you say
That you dont like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never ever simple, no

Someday, youre gonna see the things that I see
Youre gonna want the air that I breathe
Youre gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it never end?
Were never coming back down
Yeah, were looking down on the clouds

I know you said, that you dont like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
Well love is always, always changing, oh

Someday, youre gonna see the things that I see
Youre gonna want the air that I breathe
Youre gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it never end?
Were never coming back down
Yeah, were looking down on the clouds

And we go, and we go, and we go
And we dont stop
But we dont, no we dont
No we dont ever grow up
And we go, and we go, and we go
And we dont stop
But we dont, no we dont
No we dont ever grow up

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?---
