[Harry]
Don't try to make me stay, or ask if I'm okay.
I don't have the answer.
Don't make me stay the night, or ask if I'm alright.
I don't have the answer.

[Liam]
Heartache, doesn't last forever.
I'll say I'm fine.
Midnight, ain't no time for laughing.
When you say goodbye.

[Zayn]
It makes your lips, so kissable.
And your kiss, unmissable.
Your fingertips, so, touchable.
And your eyes, irresistible.

[Niall]
I, try to ask myself, "should I see someone else?"
I wish I knew the answer.

[Harry]
But I know, if I go now.
If I leave, and I'm on my own tonight.
I'll never know the answer.

[Liam]
Midnight, doesn't last forever.
Dark turns to light.
Heartache, flips my world around.
I'm falling down, down, down that why.

[Zayn]
I'll find your lips, so kissable.
And your kiss, unmissable.
Your fingertips, so, touchable.
And your eyes, irresistible.

[All]
Irresistible (irresistible) [x4]

[Harry]
It's in your lips, and in your kiss.
It's in your touch and your fingertips.
And it's in all the things and other things
that make you who you are.
And your eyes, irresistible.

[All]
It makes your lips, so kissable. (ooooh)
And your kiss, unmissable.
Your fingertips, so, touchable.
And your eyes [x6]
Irresistible. ---
