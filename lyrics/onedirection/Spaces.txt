Whos gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Whos gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?
Whos gonna be the last one to drive away?
Whos gonna be the last one to forget this place?

We keep taking turns, will we ever learn?

Spaces between us keep getting deeper
Its harder to reach ya
Even though Ive tried
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I dont know why
Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Whos gonna be the first one to compromise?
Whos gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?
Whos gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made?

Spaces between us keep getting deeper
Its harder to reach ya
Even though Ive tried
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I dont know why
Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?

We keep taking turns, will we ever learn?
When will we learn?

Spaces between us keep getting deeper
Its harder to reach ya
Even though Ive tried
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I dont know why
Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?

The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us---
