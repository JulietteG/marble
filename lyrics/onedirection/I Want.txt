Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials

I should know because I've heard
The girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
But that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue

Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

Oh and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

Be loved by you
I wanna
I'll stay true
I wanna
If you knew
What you've put me through
You'd want, you'd want, you'd want
Me to love you too

I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
But that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

Oh and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
But that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you

I want, I want, I want
Oh and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
But that's not me
I want, I want, I want
To be loved by you---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
