[Harry:]
Better than words
More than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling

[Liam:]
Everytime we touch
I'm all shook up
You make me wanna..
How deep is your love
God only knows, baby

[Chorus:]
Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
Better than words

[Louis:]
Better than words
Drive ya crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby

[Niall:]
Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna..
One more night
Irreplaceable (yeah), crazy (crazy)

[Chorus:]
Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no

[Louis:]
Everyone tries (They try)
To see what it feels like (Feels like)
But they'll never be right
Cause it's better (better)
It's better

[Liam:] One more time
[Zayn:] Better than words

Yeah

[Chorus:]
Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up (I don't know)
Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
I don't know how else to sum it up (To sum it up)
Cause words ain't good enough, ow (The words ain't good enough)
I can't explain your love, no
