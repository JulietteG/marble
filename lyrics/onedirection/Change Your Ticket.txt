I dwell alone with thoughts I had
Its all I know, its what I am
I want to know myself like you do
I want to know myself like you
I want to know myself like you do
I want to know myself from you

Give me a new energy, until my loneliness is gone
You are the push I am the pull
I bathe in your energy, until my loneliness is gone
You are the push I am the pull
Revival

I dwell alone with thoughts I had
Its all I know, its what I am
I want to know myself like you do
I want to know myself from you

Give me a new energy, until my loneliness is gone
You are the push I am the pull
I bathe in your energy, until my loneliness is gone
You are the push I am the pull
Revival

You are the push, I am the pull
I just want to know myself from you

Give me a new energy, until my loneliness is gone
You are the push, I am the pull
I bathe in your energy, until my loneliness is gone
You are the push, I am the pull
Revival

I want to know myself like you do
I want to know myself like you---
