I told her that I loved her, just not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party died downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

I said you're on fire babe
And down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day is you love who you love
There ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

You said the night was over, I said it's forever
20 minutes later wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil
My mum thinks it's the flu
But girl it's only you

I said you're on fire babe
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day is you love who you love
There ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping, you and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day is you love who you love
There ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day---
