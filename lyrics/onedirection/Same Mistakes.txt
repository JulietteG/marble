Circles, we going in circles
Dizzy's all it makes us
We know where it takes us
We've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong
Without blaming each other

Think that we've got more time
But we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play 
All the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait
For the end to change
And we take, take, take 
It for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes

Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer maybe we'll be closer
Stronger then we were before, yeah
Maybe something more, yeah

Think that we've got more time
But we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play 
All the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait
For the end to change
And we take, take, take 
It for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, Yeah, that's what crazy is
When its broken, you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray
That everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes

Don't look back
But if we don't look back
We're only learning then
How to make all same mis- same mistakes again

So we play, play, play 
All the same old games (same old games)
And we wait, wait, wait
For the end to change (well, nothings gonna change)
And we take, take, take 
It for granted that we'll be the same (nothings gonna be the same)
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, Yeah, that's what crazy is (crazy is)
When its broken, you say there's nothing to fix (theres nothing to fix)
And you pray, pray, pray (o-oh)
That everything will be okay (Everything will be okay)
While you're making all the same mistakes---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
