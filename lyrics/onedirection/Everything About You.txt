You know I've always got your back girl
So let me be the one you come running to, running to, r-r-running
I said it's just matter of fact girl
You just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll get coming

On the other side of the world
It don't matter, I'll there in two, i'll there in two, i'll there in two
I still feel it everytime
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do do
From the way that we touch baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two,
And there's nothing I could point to,
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do do
It's everything about you

Yes I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see you but don't realize that it's my, my loving
There's something about your laugh that makes me want to have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at n-n-nothing

Every minute's like our last so
Let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock, that's tick-tick-ticking

I still feel it every time
It's just something that you do
Now as to why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do do
From the way that we touch baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two,
And there's nothing I could point to,
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do do
It's everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know without you I can't face it
All we wanna have is fun
But they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do do
From the way that we touch baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do do
Like every party is just us two,
And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do do
It's everything about you---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
