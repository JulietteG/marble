Harry:
Maybe it's the way she walked, straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards, just like she already owned it

Zayn:
I said can you give it back to me, she said never in your wildest dreams

All:
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

Liam:
Said her name was Georgia Rose, and her daddy was a dentist

Harry:
Said I had a dirty mouth 

Zayn:
(I got a dirty mouth) 

Harry:
But she kissed me like she meant it

Niall:
I said can I take you home with me, she said never in your wildest dreams

All:
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

Louis:
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me,

Zayn:
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced,
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah) how we danced

Harry:
1,2,1,2,3

All:
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(we danced, we danced, it goes something like this)

We danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes....

Zayn:
Best song ever, it was the best song ever,
It was the best song ever, it was the best song ever---Lyrics submitted by Lucy Jane.
