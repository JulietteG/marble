Zayn: 
Girl it should be me 
Driving to your house 
Knocking on your door 
And kissing you on the mouth 

Liam: 
Holding on your hand
Dancing in the dark 
Cos I was the only one 
Who loved you from the start 

Harry: 
But now when I see you with him 
Tears my world apart 

Because 
Chorus: 
Ive been waiting 
All this time to finally say it 
But now I see your hearts been taken 
And nothing could be worst 
Baby, I loved you first. 
Tight my chances 
Couldnt be when he is standing 
Thats what hurts the most, 
Girl, I came so close 
But now youll never know 
Baby, I loved you first 

Louis: 
Girl it should be me 
Calling on your phone 
Saying youre the one 
And that Id never let you go 

Harry: 
I never understood 
What love is really like 
Falling from the first time 
Looking in your eyes 

Liam: 
But now when I see you with him 
My whole world falls apart 

Because 
Chorus: 
Ive been waiting 
All this time to finally say it 
But now I see your hearts been taken 
And nothing could be worst 
Baby, I loved you first. 
Tight my chances 
Couldn't be when he is standing 
That's what hurts the most 
Girl, I came so close 
But now you'll never know 
Baby, I loved you first 

Zayn: 
First touch 
The first kiss 
First girl who made me feel like this 
Oh, pray 
Its killing me 
I loved you first, why cant you see? 

Niall: 
Ive been waiting all this time to finally say it 
But now I see your hearts been taken 
And nothing could be worst 
Baby, I loved you first. 

Tight my chances 
Couldn't be when he is standing 
That's what hurts the most 
Girl, I came so close 
But now you'll never know 
Baby, I loved you first 

Baby, I loved you first (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Faith dominguez.
