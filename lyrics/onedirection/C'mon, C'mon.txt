Cmon cmon
The one that I came with, she had go
But you look amazing, standing alone
So cmon cmon
Move a little closer now
Cmon cmon
It aint no way of walking out 
C'mon c'mon 
Show me what youre all about

Yeah, Ive been watching you all night
Theres something in your eyes
Saying cmon cmon and dance with me baby
Yeah, the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So cmon cmon and dance with me baby

The one that I came with, dont know how to move
The way that you let your hair down, I can tell that you do
So cmon cmon
Move a little closer now
Cmon cmon
It aint no way of walking out 
C'mon c'mon
Show me what youre all about

Yeah, Ive been watching you all night
Theres something in your eyes
Saying cmon cmon and dance with me baby
Yeah, the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So cmon cmon and dance with me baby

Every step I take, I feel it more and more
She's calling out, shes a lucky girl
My heart is racing, she's turing around
I reach for her hand and I say

Yeah, Ive been watching you all night
Theres something in your eyes
Saying cmon cmon and dance with me baby
Yeah, the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So cmon cmon and dance with me baby
Cmon cmon, cmon cmon and dance with me baby---Lyrics submitted by margaret colosi.
