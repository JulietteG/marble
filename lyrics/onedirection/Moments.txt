Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heart beats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin, it makes this hard girl
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life, for one more day
If we could only turn back time...
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment in time, I'll find the words to say, before you leave me today

Close the door, throw the key, don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen, don't wanna be without you
My judgement clouded, like tonight's sky
Undecided, voice is numb, try to scream out my lungs
But it makes this harder, and the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life, for one more day
If we could only turn back time...
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment in time, I'll find the words to say, before you leave me today

Flashes left in my mind, going back to the time
Playing games in the street, kicking balls with my feet
Dancing on with my toes, standing close to the edge
There's a part of my clothes, at the end of your bed
As i feel myself fall, make a joke of it all

You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment in time, I'll find the words to say, before you leave me today. x2 (two times)---Lyrics submitted by Jewelz Martinez.
