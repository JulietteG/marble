Whos that shadow holding me hostage?
Ive been here for days
Whos this whisper telling me that Im never gonna get away?

I know theyll be coming to find me soon
But I fear Im getting used to
Being held by you

Baby look what youve done to me
Baby look what youve done now
Baby Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby look what youve done to me
Baby you got me tied down
Baby Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way

Whos this man thats holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now hes changed his mind

I know theyll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah I fell for you

Baby look what youve done to me
Baby look what youve done now
Baby Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby look what youve done to me
Baby you got me tied down
Baby Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way

All my life Ive been on my own
I used the light to guide me home
But now together were alone
And theres no other place Id ever wanna go

Baby look what youve done (to me)
Baby look what youve done to me
Baby look what youve done now
Baby Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby look what youve done to me
Baby you got me tied down
Baby Ill never leave if you keep holding me this way

(Baby look what youve done)---
