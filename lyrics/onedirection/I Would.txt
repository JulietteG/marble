Liam:
Lately I've found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got

Harry:
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

Zayn:
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me, then I would
I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know
That I would
I would

Chorus:
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me, then I would
I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know
That I would

Niall:
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were goin' alright
With a sign on my back saying 'Kick Me'
Reality ruined my life

Louis:
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
Cuz I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos

 Zayn:
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me, then I would
I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know
That I would
I would

Chorus:
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me, then I would
I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know
That I would
I would
I would

Louis:
Would he please you
Would he kiss you
Would he treat you like I would

Zayn:
I would

Louis:
Would he touch you
Would he need you
Would he love you like I would

Harry:
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me, then I would
I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know
That I would

Louis:
Would he please you
Would he kiss you
Would he treat you like I would
Would he touch you
Would he need you
Would he love you like I would

Chorus:
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me, then I would
I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know
That I would
I would
I would---Lyrics submitted by renee sistek.
