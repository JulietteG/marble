Oh,oh,oh

She's  so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little 
She's a temping animal
Spends too much
And I'll never tell her no
Drive's me nuts
And she got me by the throat 
She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go 


Breaks a billion hearts 
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind yeah  

I want her 
Everybody wants her
She knows it
I want her but I better run away

Oh,oh,oh

She's so mean but I gotta love it 
And I just can't let her go
I m so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal 
Spends too much 
But I'll never tell her no
Drive's me nuts
And she's got me by the throat
She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go---Lyrics submitted by Sohrin Parveen.
