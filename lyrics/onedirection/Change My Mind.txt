Louis:
The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on, while everyone's gone

Zayn:
Never felt like this before
Are we friends, or are we more
As Im walking towards the door
I'm not sure

Chorus (Liam):
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
Cuz I don't wanna know
I'm walking away, if you'll be mind
Won't go
Won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night 
I'll change my mind

Niall:
Lean in when you laugh
We take photographs
There's no music on
But we dance along

Harry:
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

Chorus:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
Cuz I don't wanna know
I'm walking away, if you'll be mine
Won't go
Won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind

Zayn:
I'll change my mind

Niall:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind

Chorus:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
Cuz I don't wanna know
I'm walking away if you'll be mine 
Won't go
Won't go
So baby if you say, you want me to stay
Stay for the night

Zayn:
I'll change my mind---Lyrics submitted by Megan Shauny.
