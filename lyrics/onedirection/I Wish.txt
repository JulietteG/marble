He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes, and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?
When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze, and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped

I hear the beat of my heart 
Getting louder whenever I'm near you

But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart cuz you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that was me

He looks at you, the way that I would
Does all the things, I know that I could
If only time could just turn back

Cuz I got three little words that
I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart cuz you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that was me
With my hands on your waist
As we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me 
That you call in your room 
Cuz you wanna say goodnight

But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart cuz you don't see
But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart cuz you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish 
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish that was me
Oh, how I wish that was me---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
