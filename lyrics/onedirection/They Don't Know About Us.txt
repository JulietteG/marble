Liam:
People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
but I say they don't know
what they talk talk talking about

Harry:
Cause this love is only getting stronger
so I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that your mine girl

Chorus:
They don't know about the things we do
they don't know about the I love yous
but I bet you if they only knew
they will just be jealous of us
they don't know about the up all nights
they don't know I've waited all my life
just to find a love that feels this right
baby they don't know about us
they don't know about us

Niall:
One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss it gets a little sweeter
Its getting better

Harry:
it keeps getting better all the time

Chorus

Louis:
They don't know how special you are
they don't know what you done to my heart
they can say anything they want
cause they don't know about us

Niall:
They don't know what we do best
that's between me and you our little secret

Zayn:
But I wanna tell them 
I wanna tell the world that your mine girl

Chorus

Baby they don't know about us
they don't know about us

Chorus

they don't know about us
they don't know about us---Lyrics submitted by Faelyn Daubs.
