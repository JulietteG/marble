Hey, I got a lot of faith in you
I'll stick with you kid, that's the bottom line
Yeah, you have a lot of fun, don't you?
And living with you is a ball of a time

Hey, beauty when the mood gets you down
Your bottom lip's near dragging on the ground
That's when I gotta play the clown for you
Black humor made you kick your blues

Howdy angel
Where did you hide your wings?

Her love shines over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah
Warm moonlight over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah

Ha, ha, ha, ha, have fun

Hey, I gotta lotta faith in you
I'll stick with you kid, that's the bottom line
Yeah, we have a lot of fun, don't we?
And heaven has to be with you all the time

Hey beauty, when the mood gets you down
Your bottom lip's near dragging on the ground
That's when I gotta play the clown for you
Black humor made me kick my blues

Howdy angel
Where did you hide your wings?

Her love shines over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah
Warm moonlight over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah

Her love shines over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah
Warm moonlight over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah

Howdy angel
Where did you hide your wings?

Her love shines over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah
Warm moonlight over my horizon
She's a slice of heaven, yeah

She's a slice of heaven, yeah
She's a slice of heaven, yeah
She's a slice of heaven, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
