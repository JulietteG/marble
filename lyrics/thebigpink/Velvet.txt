Seen it in my head, burning my heart 
Seen it in my past, back in my home 
Doesn't make sense, see her again 
I don't, know 
I felt it for some time, ever not at all 
Poison in my head, gotta love her 
I'm not looking for love, but it's hard to resist 
I don't recall, me and mistakes 

She's the only one, that's the best I've had 
I found her in a dream, looking for me 
This heart's on fire, I'll bring myself 
Up to fall, down again 

These arms are mine 
Don't mind who they hold 
So should i maybe, Just leave love alone 
You call out my name, for the love you need 
Which you won't find in me 

These arms are mine 
Don't mind who they hold 
You're made for me, and i'll leave love alone 
you call out my name for the love you need 
Which you won't find in me 

Seen it in my head, burning my heart 
I found her in a dream, looking for me 
Doesn't make sense, see her again 
I don't, know 

I can see the end, of what I've become 
A tale of a love, come and gone 
And now my love, no promises 
I won't go, falling in love---Lyrics submitted by emily.
