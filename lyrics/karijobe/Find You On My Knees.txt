Troubles chasing me again,
Breaking down my best offense,

Im looking,
God, Im looking for you.

Weary just wont let me rest,
Fear is filling up my end.

Im longing,
God, Im longing for you.

But I will find you in the place Im in,
Find you when Im at my end,
Find you when theres nothing left of me,
to offer you except for brokenness,
You lift me up,
You never leave me thirsty.
When I am weak,
When I am lost and searching,
Find you on my knees.

So what if sorrow shakes my faith,
And what if broken heart still remains,

Ill trust you,
My God, Ill trust you.

Cuz you are faithful,
And I will find you in the place Im in,
Find you when Im at my end,
Find you when theres nothing left of me,
to offer you except for brokenness.
You lift me up,
You never leave me thirsty.
When I am weak,
When I am lost and searching,
Find you on my knees,
My knees.

When my hope is gone,
When the fear is strong,
When the pain is real,
When its hard to heal,
When my faith is shaken,
And my heart is broken,
And my joy is stole,

God I know that you lift me up,
You never leave me thirsty,

Find you in the place Im in,
Find you when Im at my end,
Find you when theres nothing left of me,
to offer you except for brokenness.
You lift me up,
You never leave me thirsty.
When I am weak,
When I am lost and searching,
Find you on my knees.---Lyrics submitted by Bella Jackson.
