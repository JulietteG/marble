Come all ye weary and ye broken
Come to the table of the Lord 
Come sing the song of the forgiven 
Come lay your burden on the word 

Chorus
Come and find peace 
everyone needs a little rest 
Everyone needs a little joy and a song to sing in the darkest night 

Life, even when it gets you down 
Hope, will turn it all around 
But love is the greatest of these, everyone needs a little 

Sing all ye saints and ye sinners 
Call upon the mercy of the Lord 
Come sing the song of redemption 
Sing about the hope that is to come 

Chorus 
Come and find peace 
everyone needs a little rest 
Everyone needs a little joy and a song to sing in the darkest night 

Life, even when it gets you down 
Hope, will turn it all around 
But love is the greatest of these, everyone needs a little 

He will lift you up 
He will lift you up higher than the sorrow 
He will lift you up and cover your soul with healing 

Chorus 

Come and find peace 
everyone needs a little rest 
Everyone needs a little joy and a song to sing in the darkest night 

Life, even when it gets you down 
Hope, will turn it all around 
But love is the greatest of these, everyone needs a little 

Peace 
everyone needs a little rest 
Everyone needs a little joy and a song to sing in the darkest night

Life, even when it gets you down 
Hope, will turn it all around 
But love is the greatest of these, everyone needs a little---Lyrics submitted by Prinz Mathew.
