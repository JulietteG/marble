Come, and rest here
Come, and lay your burdens down
Come, and rest here
There is refuge for you now

You'll find his peace
You'll know you're not alone anymore
He is here

You'll find his healing
You're heart isn't shattered anymore
He is Here

Breathe in
Breathe out
You will, You will find him here

Come, and rest here
Come, and lay your burdens down
Come, and rest here 
There is refuge for you now

You'll find his peace
You'll know you're not alone anymore
He is here

You'll find his healing
You're heart isn't shattered anymore
He is Here

Breathe in
Breathe out
You will, You will find here

I will rest in you
I will rest in you
I will rest in you
   (I will)
I will rest in you

Breathe in
Breathe out
You will, You will find here

Breathe in
Breathe out
You will, You will find here

(You will find him, You will find him..... Here)---Lyrics submitted by Bryan Vazquez.
