You never change, you are the god you say you are 
When I'm afraid you calm and still my beating heart 
You stay the same, when hope is just a distant thought 
You take my pain 
And you lead me to the cross 

What love is this, that you gave your life for me 
And made a way for me to know you 
And I confess you're always enough for me 
You're all I need 

I look to you 
I see the scars upon your hands 
And hold the truth 
That when I can't you always can 
I'm standing here beneath the shadow of the cross, I'm overwhelmed that I 
Keep finding up that ours 

What love is this that you gave your life for me and made a way for me to 
Know you 
And I confess, you're always enough for me 
You're all I need 

Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me 
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me 

What love is this, that you gave your life for me 
And made a way for me to know you 
And I confess, you're always enough for me 
You're all I need 

What love is this, that you gave your life for me 
And made a way for me to know you 
And I confess, you're always enough for me 
Always enough for me 
Always enough for me---Lyrics submitted by Evelyn.
