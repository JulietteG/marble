The more I seek You,
The more I find You.
The more I find You,
The more I love you.

Chorus:
I want to sit at your feet,
Drink from the cup in your hand;
Lay back against you and breath,
feel your heartbeat.

This love is so deep,
It's more than I can stand.
I melt in your peace,
It's overwhelming.---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
