Countless days on a journey that led so far
Endless nights they traveled to follow the star
They did not find a palace just a humble village home
And searching for a king but finding a child no crown no throne
Still they bowed down

Come let us adore him
Oh, come let us adore him

Expectation turned to mystery
For nothing was like anything they dreamed
Anticipating the royal and those honored by this world
Instead they gazed in the awe-struck eyes of a lowly peasant girl
Holding her child

The brilliant gold the fragrant myrrh the costly frankincense
Placed before him

Christ the Lord---
