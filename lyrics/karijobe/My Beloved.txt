You're My beloved, you're My bride.
To sing over you is My delight. Come away with Me, My love.

Under My mercy come and wait, till we are standing face to face.
I see no stain on you, My child.

You're beautiful to Me, so beautiful to Me.
I sing over you My song of peace
Cast all your cares down at My feet
Come and find your rest in Me.

I'll breathe My life inside of you.
I'll bear you up on eagles' wings and hide you in the shadow of My strength.
I'll take you to My quiet waters.
I'll restore your soul.
Come rest in Me and be made whole.

You're My beloved, you're My bride.
To sing over you is My delight. Come away with Me, My love.---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
