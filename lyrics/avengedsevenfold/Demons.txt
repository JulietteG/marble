I've been thinking lots about my life and
How quick I'd wash it down the drain
Past tense the future, nothing matters now
I act on my own and I'm to blame
Live in a wicked dream, with angst turned out all wrong
Were all so weak, no matter how strong, yeah

I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for obscenity, all a part of me

I don't like that you're calling me a liar
I don't like that you found out I'm a snake
Been sneaking around for far too long now
I don't like how fast my intentions fade
Karma has beat me down, but the worst is yet to come
Many mistakes and still I'm so young, yeah

I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for obscenity, all a part of me

I can't
Count how many times
Awakened in fear, nightly
I'm sweating
Dreams
Where promises are made
To no one but myself
Help him
Crushed daily

Don't lend me your hand
I can't trust my self
So how can you trust me

We've all made selfish, bad decisions
We've all tried dishing out the blame
Convinced our selves of our own actions
My problem is I'll never change
In doubt, some good comes out
I'll fold before its time
Can't promise you that its my last time, yeah

I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for obscenity, all a part of me

Truth won't help you now
All the loves gone too far

Truth won't help you now
All the loves gone too far

I'm scarred, yeah
Demons they follow me, 'cause my insanity

I'm scarred, yeah
Demons they follow me, 'cause my insanity

I'm scarred, yeah
Demons they follow me, 'cause my insanity

I'm scarred, yeah
Demons they follow me, 'cause my insanity---Lyrics submitted by adolfo.
