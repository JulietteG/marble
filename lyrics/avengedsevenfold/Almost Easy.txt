I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise 
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways and thats the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance 
By that look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip.

I'm not insane, I'm not insane 
I'm not insane, I'm not,not insane 
(I'm not) 
Come back to me, it's almost easy 
(Sad at all) 
Come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you 
It's hard to face but the fact remains that this is nothing new

I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories selfish beneath the skin but deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane, I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane (I'm not) come back to me It's almost easy (set it off) 

come back again It's almost easy (you learned your lesson) come back to me It's almost easy (It's still your fault) come back again It's almost easy

now that I've lost you it kills me to say (kills me to say) I've tried to hold on as you slipped away I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so long now let me make it right
(make it all right)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane, I'm not insane, I'm not,not insane (I'm not)
come back to me It's almost easy (set it off)

come back again it's almost easy (you learned your lesson) come back to me It's almost easy (It's still your fault) come back again It's almost easy---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlin.
