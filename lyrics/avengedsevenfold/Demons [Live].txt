I've been thinking a lot about my life and
how quick I'd wash it down the drain
Past tense, The future, Nothing matters now
I act on my own and I'm to blame

Living's a wicked dream where things turn out all wrong
We're all so weak, no matter how strong, yeah

I tried running away from me, convince me that I've grown
but I can't change so unnaturally Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me, convinced that I have grown
but found out all my reasons for insanity, all a part of me

I don't like that you're calling me a liar
I don't like that you've found out I'm a snake
Been sneaking around for far too long now
I don't like how fast my attention's fading

Karma has beat me down, the worst is yet to come
Many mistakes and still I'm so young, yeah

I tried running away from me, convince me that I've grown
but I can't change so unnaturally Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me, convinced that I have grown
but found out all my reasons for insanity, all a part of me

I can't count how many times awakened in fear nightly, palms sweating
Dreams of promises I've made to no one but myself I've been crushed daily
Don't lend me your hand, I can't trust myself so how can you trust me

We've all made selfish bad decisions
We've all tried dishing out the blame
Convinced ourselves of our own actions
My problem is I'll never change

In doubt some good comes out, I fold before it's time
Can't promise you that it's my last time, yeah

I tried running away from me, convince me that I've grown
but I can't change so unnaturally Demons they follow me
I quit running away from me, convinced that I have grown
but found out all my reasons for insanity, all a part of me

Truth won't help you now, oh love's gone too far
oh, oh
Truth won't help you now, oh love's gone too far
oh, oh

I'm scarred, yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah yeah oh
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity---Lyrics submitted by Ben.
