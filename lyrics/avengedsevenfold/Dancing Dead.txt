Dead men, they celebrate as the final chapter fades away
Cause they can't hide we can see their flesh is rotten

The band plays a hopeful tune the champagne is poured as they socialize 
The look in their eyes, hiding the light!

Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
dead dancing in their graves

The drinks here are free so relax
Enjoy the sight of all the dead dancing in their graves

And while the world that they built
Told' em to change
Told' em to listen
They just kept it the same

And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watchin' the dead dancing in their graves

Bones covered up by suits
As the visible scares,
they multiply 

Kiss it goodbye
I'm to stubborn and I will destroy

Tick, tock
The the time bomb has been
Recognized and pressurized 

Nowhere to hide 
Swallowing light!

Everything is paid
for tonight
While at the party of the 
dead dancing in their graves

The drinks here are free 
so relax
enjoy the sight of all the 
dead dancing in their graves

And while the world that they build
told' em to change 
told' em to listen
they just kept in the same 

And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watchin' the dead dancing in their graves

We feel a coming strength
and now it's too late 
to change

Why'd you want to go?
you drown me
whit all that you are 
oh, how the mighty fall,
             YEAH

Everything is paid
for tonight
While at the party of the 
dead dancing in their graves

The drinks here are free 
so relax
enjoy the sight of all the 
dead dancing in their graves

And while the world that they build
told' em to change 
told' em to listen
they just kept in the same 

And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watchin' the dead dancing in their graves

We feel a coming strength
and now it's too late 
to change---Lyrics submitted by dancing dead.
