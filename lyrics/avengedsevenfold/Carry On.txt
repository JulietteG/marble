Some people live out selfish desire
Some choose to shout when they speak and death be the star!
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow!

They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free!
Fly past the edge of the sea!
No bended knee!
No mockery!
Somehow we still carry on!

(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)

Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all!
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow!

Destroy their perfect crime, watch the power fold

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free!
Fly past the edge of the sea!
No bended knee!
No mockery!
Somehow we still carry on!

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free!
Fly past the edge of the sea!
No bend in knee!
No mockery!
Somehow we still carry on!

Carry on!---
