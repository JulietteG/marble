Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A light that healed a broken heart 
With all that it could

Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart 
With all that I could

Will you stay
Will you stay away forever

How do I live without the ones I love
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold

A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find 
A place in my mind

Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
'Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away

I love you
You were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I see you
When it lets me
Your pain is gone 
Your hands untied

So far away
I needed to know

So far away
And I need you to
I need you to know---Lyrics submitted by meikz.
