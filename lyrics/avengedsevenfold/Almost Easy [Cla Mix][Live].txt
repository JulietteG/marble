I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise,
Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways and thats the way it stay-ay-ays.
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip!

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, Im not... not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you,
It's hard to face but the fact remains that this is nothing new.
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories.
Selfish beneath the skin but deep inside I'm not insane!

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, Im not... not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy
(Youll learn your lesson)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(But first you fall)
Come back again it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you it kills me to say,
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away.
I'm losing the fight,
I've treated you so wrong now let me make it right.
(Make it alright)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, Im not... not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy
(Youll learn your lesson)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(But still youll fall)
Come back again it's almost easy---Lyrics submitted by Sam.
