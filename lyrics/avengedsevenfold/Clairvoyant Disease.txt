Dust begins to fall, to the ground
(You just sit there and do nothing)
The air is cold and thin (you're content with doing nothing)
(but in my life i wanted more)
Thought surrounding me as i look around
This will never end when i bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where i belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

(There's nowhere left to run and hide)
Outside shell is strong, confidence
But slowly eats away
(Be better off dead)
Like a man plagued with disease i try to find
Through my pores it seems to seep, when i bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where i belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

While you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing

There's nowhere to run and hide when you live in denial
Stuck alone inside your head, better off dead
The fall debris in the empty house
No one's around

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where i belong
I've come so far, it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

Haunted my life
I wanted more
I needed more
I taste
More...---Lyrics submitted by Austin Stewart.
