Our Father, Creator.
You hold our hearts together
There is no one higher than You!
Redeemer, Defender,
Our Great and Mighty Savior
Theres no one higher than You!

You are always with us
Gracious to forgive us
By Your power we have been set free

And Lord we stand amazed in Your presence
Astounded by Your mercy and love
Our hands are lifted high in surrender
Your grace for me is always enough
And there is no one higher than our God
There is no one greater than You
Let my life forever praise
The glory of Your name
Theres no one higher than You!

Majestic in wonder
You reign with love forever
Theres no one higher than You
Your beauty, Your splendor
Your glory knows no measure
Theres no one higher than You!

You are always with us
Gracious to forgive us
By Your power we have been set free

And Lord we stand amazed in Your presence
Astounded by Your mercy and love
Our hands are lifted high in surrender
Your grace for me is always enough
And there is no one higher than our God
There is no one greater than You
Let my life forever praise
The glory of Your name
Theres no one higher than You!

There is no one higher, no one greater, no one like our God
There is none more able, Christ our Savior, great and glorious

And Lord we stand amazed in Your presence
Astounded by Your mercy and love
Our hands are lifted high in surrender
Your grace for me is always enough
And there is no one higher than our God
There is no one greater than You
Let my life forever praise
The glory of Your name
Theres no one higher than You!---Lyrics submitted by Roger Churchill.
