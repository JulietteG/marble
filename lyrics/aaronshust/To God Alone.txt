Can you take me by the hand
Can you use me as I am
Break me into who you want me to be
When the time is finally right

You will open up my eyes
Show me everything you want me to see
This life is not my own

Chorus:
To God alone be the glory
To God alone be the praise
Everything I say and do
Let it be all for you

The glory is yours alone
Yours alone Take the offering
I bring You want more than what I sing
Can I give you every part of me

Turn these pennies into gold
Take this life I call my own
Until I'm running after your heart
I'm needing to let go

We will rise and we will fall
But you remain after all
You're glorious and beautiful You're beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Beanie Kendrick.
