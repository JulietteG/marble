Back in 19 and 92
We were good, man
We were traveling all over Finland, England, we went over to London, too
We were up and down the Hudson river
We were shedding a lot; we lived in our sheds

Go to church where the blinking light was
Park by the Olympic sized swimming pool
Snake Anthony knew Mr. William
Why, he could help you move your fine Chinese, if you needed them moved
He also helped us find the start of wind
What he really helped us find was,
To discover that we were the best

When Snake Anthony came out on the road with us
We went to the West of Highway 61, we didn't go to the East
You can go to the West-South, 
you can go to the East-North, no one ever does
They just want to go to Phoenix, to find the start of wind
If you go West of 61 you're going to have to have tone, 
you're going to have to have time, 
and you're going to have to have space
And uuuh-huh, Snake Anthony was not a small Japanese woman

When Snake Anthony came out on the road with us,
We knew we were the best, the very best
When Snake Anthony came out on the road with us---Lyrics submitted by MR D.
