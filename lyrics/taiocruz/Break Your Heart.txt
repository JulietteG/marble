Woah Woah

Now listen to me baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
Imma tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start.

I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart. (x4)

Now listen to me baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
Imma tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start.

I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart. (x4)

Woah woah

Theres not point trying to hide it
No point trying to erase me
I know I got a problem
By doing this behavior

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
Imma tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start.

I'm only gonna break break ya break break ya heart. (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Gail.
