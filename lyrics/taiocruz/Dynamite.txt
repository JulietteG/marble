I-I-I-I came to dance, dance, dance, dance
I hit the floor cause thats
my plans, plans, plans, plans
Im wearing all my favorite
Brands, brands, brands, brands
Give me space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
You, you cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on yeaaah

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying ayo gotta let go
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying ayo baby, lets go

Cause we gon rock this club
We gon go all night we gon light it up
Like its dynamite
Cause I told you once now I told you twice
We gon light it up like its dynamite

I came to move, move, move, move
Get out the way me and
my crew, crew, crew, crew
Im in the club so Im gonna do, do, do, do
Just what the f*** i
Came here to do, do, do, do

Yeah, yeah cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Sayin ayo gotta let go
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Sayin ayo baby, lets go

Cause we gon rock this club
We gon go all night we gon light it up
Like its dynamite
Cause I told you once now I told you twice
We gon light it up like its dynamite

Im gonna take it all out
Im gonna be the last one standing
Im over all 
Im gonna be the last one landing
Cause I, I believe it
And I, I, I .. I just want it all
I just want it all
Im gonna put my hands in the air
Hands, hands in the air
Put your hands in the air

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Sayin ayo gotta let go
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Sayin ayo baby, lets go

Cause we gon rock this club
We gon go all night we gon light it up
Like its dynamite
Cause I told you once now I told you twice
We gon light it up like its dynamite---Lyrics submitted by Rissa.
