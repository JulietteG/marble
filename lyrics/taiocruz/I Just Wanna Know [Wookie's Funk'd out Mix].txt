Baby, talk to me
What is goin' on,
'Cause lately we ain't been spending
time alone
And last night when I touched you
hand
You didn't wanna hold,
And today, no kiss goodbye
Just said that you had to go

[Chorus]
If you're leaving me baby
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
If you're done with me baby
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
Listen, if you have something you
wanna say,
Please don't, don't hold it back
It'll come out someday
And I am, I'm strong enough
To mend my broken heart
If you say that you and I are better
off apart

[Chorus]

Strings
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I just wanna know
I wanna know

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Lightofnightta Tata.
