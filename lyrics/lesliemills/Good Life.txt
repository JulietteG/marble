Skip down Mistic street 
Have a smile, it's on me 
Cross-town traffic days 
And Jimi is singing (Jimi is singing) 
Wonder Bread Factory, surplus stores and Maybelline 
Hold my hand, I hold my own 

Gotta get me out of the junkyard heap 
Kicking back in marigold summertime dream 
It's a good, good life, we got the good life 
Falling in love under the raspberry sun 
Turn up the stereo, baby have some fun 
It's a good, good life, we got the good life 

Fortune jackpot blues 
What's an empty pocket do? 
Climb the nearest dream and start demanding 
Bean bags, bobby pins, glitter gel, I'm home againg 

Gotta get me out of the junkyard heap 
Kicking back in marigold summertime dream 
It's a good, good life, we got the good life 
Falling in love under the raspberry sun 
Turn up the stereo, baby have some fun 
It's a good, good life, we got the good life 

Roll down the window (the rearview window gleams) 
See you waving (waving back at me) 
Find change under (the sofa cushion seat) 

As long as you are here, with me 

Gotta get me out of the junkyard heap 
Kicking back in marigold summertime dream 
It's a good, good life, we got the good life 
Falling in love under the raspberry sun 
Turn up the stereo, baby have some fun 
It's a good, good life, we got the good life---Lyrics submitted by Hazar.
