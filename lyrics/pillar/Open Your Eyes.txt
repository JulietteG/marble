Your running the race that never ends 
To make ammends 
With the friends you've had since the day that your life began
Your caught up in the rap race with your face disgraced
This is the time and the place for everything
So we bring what you can sing 
Giving glory and honor to the one that we call the King
You've gotta fix your eyes on him
'Cause you know that death is the way to disease
Just open your eyes

Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise that it's your own demise
Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise reach out for the prize

Tell me once again
Bringing the noise to fill you in
On the secret that you'll see when you open your eyes then
So party people when you've fallen down and enough
Just open them up and let him fill you up
You can't do anything without consquences or reprecussions
You think the world loves you so big
Well stop your fussing 
'Cause it 'aint my fault it's nobody but yours
So see what your life has in store 
When you open your eyes

Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise that it's your own demise
Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise reach out for the prize

Open your eyes
Open your eyes

Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise that it's your own demise
Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise reach out for the prize
Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise that it's your own demise
Just open your eyes 
It's time you realise reach out for the prize---Lyrics submitted by Drake.
