Next time i try to cross your mind
remind me to look both ways so i dont get hit by your lies
you lacerate me with all of these memories
and now i wear these scars on, on my sleve

(Chorus)

These broken hearts, are left with scars,because of your lies
and all this time, it feels like i'm,
chasing shadows at midnight

The days fade, the stars come out at night..... 
and when the sun goes down, i know exactly what i'll find
some things in this life, will never change
we both have oprodogies we need to exchange........

Chorus 2x

How could i let myself fall into your lies
i only trusted you with all of my life
now i am stuck here, i'm trapped in your lies
the only way out is for me not to ask why......

Chorus 2x 

Chasing shadows at midnight 2x---Lyrics submitted by Eli.
