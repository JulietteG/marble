Wipe the tears away, wipe the tears away
Sunday, bloody Sunday 
Sunday, bloody Sunday

I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? how long...

'cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I will heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday (sunday bloody sunday...)
(lets go!)

Now the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart


How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? how long...

'cause tonight...we can be as one
Tonight...
Tonight...

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday (Sunday bloody Sunday...)

Wipe your tears away
Wipe your tears away
Wipe your tears away


And today the millions cry
We need a dream while tomorrow they die


Now battle has just begun 
To claim the victory that Jesus won

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday 
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
