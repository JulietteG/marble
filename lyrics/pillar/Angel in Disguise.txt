Friday morning when she walked out the door
She couldn't take anymore and so she tried to ignore

Her daddy he wanted to settle the score
From all the little meetings they had had before

All the secrets started taking their toll
Making daddy more bold, but it was bruising her soul

He didn't know that she had already told
Her mother already knows and now the drama unfolds
As she says

My, you're my angel in disguise
You look at me with gentle eyes
My, you're my angel in disguise
You saved my from that one last cry

It's Friday evening and he's at it again
Another hour and then all the pressure begins

The phone keeps ringing so he finally gives in
To hear the voice of his wife asking where have you been

He tells her I'll be home as soon as I can
So tuck the kids into bed 'cause time has slipped through my hands

A pause and then she says she loves him again
Then it finally sets in that she's always been

My, you're my angel in disguise
You look at me with gentle eyes
My, you're my angel in disguise
You saved my from that one last cry

My, you're my angel in disguise
You look at me with gentle eyes
My, you're my angel in disguise
You saved my from that one last cry


It's Friday morning and she walked through the door
All of those thoughts from before she no longer ignored

She's finally home she set her bags on the floor
But her mother wasn't there to hold her hand anymore

She heard her daddy he was calling her name
She went back to his room but he wasn't the same

He said I'm sorry for the tears that you've cried
Will you ever forgive me she said I've already tried, as he said

My, you're my angel in disguise
You look at me with gentle eyes
My, you're my angel in disguise
You saved my from that one last cry

My, you're my angel in disguise
You look at me with gentle eyes
My, you're my angel in disguise
You saved my from that one last cry---Lyrics submitted by like.
