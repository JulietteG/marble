Days were so cold. 
Nights spent alone.
Searching for that something that I've never known.
Held captive by the pain
Caught up in all the shame 
My heart just won't stop playing these head games 
It's like a torent of disease 
Now i've found a remedy 

It's you your keeping Your keeping me alive with this fire on the inside 
It's you your keeping your keeping me alive with this fire on the inside

Now I see the Sun
The battle wages on
I gotta watch my back this time
So I know where it's all coming from
It's like a shadow I can see
and it's sneaking up on me

You your keeping Your keeping me alive with this fire on the inside 
You your keeping your keeping me alive with this fire on the inside

You your keeping Your keeping me alive with this fire on the inside 
You your keeping your keeping me alive with this fire on the inside---Lyrics submitted by Drake.
