What would it take to make you see me
The way that I see you?
What would it take to make you want me 
The way I've always wanted you?
I don't know why
You're in everything I see
I can't deny
That you're everything I need
So I'm reaching ...

Whatever it takes to get to you
Whatever it takes to break through
Whatever it takes you are my reason
For everything I do
Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes to break through to you.
Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)

What would it take to make you fall for me
The way I fell for you?
What would it take to make you fight for me
The way I've always fought for you?
I don't know why
You bring me to my knees
But I can't unwind
From how you've twisted me
But I'm reaching...

Whatever it takes to get to you
Whatever it takes to break through
Whatever it takes you are my reason
For everything I do
Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes to break through to you.
Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)

Whatever it takes
To get to you!
To get to you!
To get to you!

Whatever it takes to get to you
Whatever it takes to break through
Whatever it takes you are my reason
For everything I do


Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes to break through to you.
Whatever it takes, (Whatever it takes)
Whatever it takes---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
