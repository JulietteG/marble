I lean so hard on myself
Turning my back on how you felt
Seeing a life that led me on
Leaving a love that did no wrong
That's what it took for me to say

Cause you simply love
Despite all the stupid things I've done
It's hard to remember,
Cause you simply love
Even though I know not what I've done
It's hard to remember
That you simply love

I've tried to do all this on my own
Not thinking works of what you've shown
All that I've done has blinded me
To all that you have for me
But I want you to know that I finally see

Cause you simply love
Despite all the stupid things I've done
It's hard to remember,
Cause you simply love
Even though I know not what I've done
It's hard to remember
That you simply love

I don't know what I can't understand
And I don't know what I can't comprehend
And I don't know what I can't understand

Cause you simply love
Despite all the stupid things I've done
It's hard to remember,
Cause you simply love
Even though I know not what I've done
It's hard to remember
That you simply love(Repeat x2)

You simply love...
You simply---Lyrics submitted by elle.
