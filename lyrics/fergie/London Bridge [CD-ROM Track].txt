Oh shit (oh shit) (x3)
Are you ready for this? 
Oh shit (oh shit)
Ohhhhh
It's me, Fergie
The Pimp! 
Polo! Polo! 
Fergie Ferg, what's up, baby? 

[Verse 1]
When I come to the club, step aside. (Oh shit)
Pop the seats, don't be having me in da line. (Oh shit)
V.I.P., 'cause you know I gotta shine. (Oh shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time (Oh shit)

All my girls get down on the floor, (oh shit) 
Back to back, drop it down real low (oh shit)
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a ho (oh shit)
'Cause you'd know If I gave a fuck, so here we go! (oh shit)

[Chorus] 
How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, we going down like... 

How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, we going down like... 

[Bridge]
As the drinks start pouring, 
And my speech start slurring, 
Everybody start looking real good. (oh shit)

[Verse 2]
That Grey goose got your girl feeling loose.
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes. 
It's like everytime I get up on the dude, 
Paparazzi put my business in the news.

And I'm like get up out my face, (oh shit)
'Fo turn around and spray your ass with mace, (oh shit)
My lips make you wanna have a taste. (oh shit)
You got that... ? 
I got the bass.

[Chorus]
How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, we going down like... 

How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, we going down like... 

[Bridge 2}
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, dooo, do, do, do, dooo
Me like a bullet type, you know they coming right
Fergie love em' 
My girls support her right? 
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, dooo, do, do, dooo
Me like a bullet type you know they coming right
Fergie love em' 
My girls support her right?
