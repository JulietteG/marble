Crazy about you baby. You know that I am
I wish I could phrase it, like red roses can
Three little words. Thats the best I can do
Im no Picasso. Im no Mozart 
I cant draw no pictures of this song in my heart
Just three little words, thats the best I can do
Its all been said. Its all been done
Since Adam and Eve hit off
Its all been written. Its all been sung
Hope my three little words, just is enough
Baby Im just trying to tell you the score
Just like nobody ever told anyone before
Three little words. Thats the best I can do
BREAK
There must be a million, ways to say, what is always on my mind
And I been working on it, night and day
Still all I got, is just one line
Three little words, babe, thats all that there is
Since every time, I hope you like this
Three little words, thats the best I can do
Three little words, babe, thats the best I can do---Lyrics submitted by John Pearn.
