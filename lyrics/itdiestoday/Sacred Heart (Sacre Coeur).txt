From the gutter,
The diamond seemed,
Far too bright to see,
The gleaming eyes,
Always tend  to turn away, 
Just turn away!
And every innocent wish,
Has granted tragedy,
And our hands have,
Since been soiled in the,
Blackest of coal!
Come on!

Most days Id sit and wish for,
This place to fall into the bay,
Its greats offense,
Being thievery,

A nightmare awakened by the boundless waters,
Will see a broken vow thrust,
Into the arms of hellbound cowards,
And Ive found,
The perfect accessory,
To that beautiful gown,
The handsome ghost of me,
Of me,
Of meeeeeee, Woah!

Most days Id sit and wish for,
This place to fall into the bay,
Its greats offense,
Being thievery,
And I,
Will wash away the sins of former lovers,
A trail of stillborn,
Conquest in my wake,
Tonight,

OH!

Take this four-fingered salute,
I gave the fifth for you my dear,
May it beckon you to the salts below,

Most days Id sit and wish for,
This place to fall into the bay,
Its greats offense,
Being thievery,
And I,
Will wash away the sins of former lovers,
A trail of stillborn,
Conquest in my wake,
Tonight,

TONIGHT, TONIGHT!---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
