Fuck you for getting to me
You made the drugs seem easy love
Fuck it all
And fuck all the fools and junkies
You find to subdue your empty love
Fuck it all

You turn all my suicide
Pain has been on your side.. Aha
Love, you shouldn't of shared corner eyes
I wish they could make me blind.. Aha

I'm down you know. I'm down. Yes, I'm down

Break out your boo a-press too
Commence in the hopes to save your soul
I hope you can croak
I took the first chance I could to
Secure and ensure them through you
She asked for it all

I know you're unable to
Left you a fairy tale of my heart
Love
You need to feel my crash
More than you needed cash

I'm done you know. I'm done. Yes, I'm done
Well, I'm done. Yes, I'm down.

How can I emphasize
When will you realize
I hurt

I'm done you know. I'm done. Yes, I'm done
Well, I'm done. Yes, I'm down.
You know I'm done. Yes, I'm done.

Fuck you for getting to me
You made a kick out of easy love---Lyrics submitted by sky calen.
