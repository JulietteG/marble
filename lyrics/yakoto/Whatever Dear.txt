You talk to me and I don't trust you
Underneath my cloths my hart is braking
So I look away your voice is shaking 
Why you're lying to my face
There's no time to waste babe

And yet I will cry but for now all I can say is
Whatever dear all I can say is whatever dear

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

I'm gonna save myself from you
Before you tear me up in two 

Your tricks and games covered me with shame
They nearly cost an explosion in my brain
And my soul is all that remains
But for now all I can say

Whatever my dear all I can say whatever dear

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

I'm gonna save myself from you
Before you tear me up in two 

There will be light thru the stars
There will be thunder once more
But for now all I can say
Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

Whatever you do whatever you say
I will not beg you to stay 
Go other way have a nice day
I think I'm threw with your case

I'm gonna save myself from you
Before you tear me up in two---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
