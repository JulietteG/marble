I don't wanna change you
I think you're quite ok
You're strong, elegant and (..)
Where you keep all the good stuff away from me
You are all appearance and slick I want you say
The way you say it sound terrific boy
But I'm interested in the silence between your lines
Open up boy align thoughts fly 

Talk to me talk to me let me in
I want to know how it's like under your skin
Talk to me talk to me let it go
Trust me love let yourself go 

So please don't protect me
I'm here to take you all in 
And to share your tears
Trust my love.. love
I am strong in my heart's (..) as space
Avoid your stories com'on have faith in me
I'm not a hero but that can take in all the pain
And I'm cry with you then smile with you again

Talk to me talk to me let me in
I want to know how it's like under your skin
Talk to me talk to me let it flow 
Trust me love let it go let it go

Let's give us a chance let's open up
Let our feelings dance com'on dance
Let's give love a chance let's open up
Let our feelings dance

Talk to me talk to me let me in
I want to know how it's like under your skin
Talk to me talk to me let it go 
Trust me love let it flow let it go

Talk to me talk to me talk to me
Talk to me talk to me talk to me
Talk to me com'on love talk to me
Talk to me talk to me talk to me me me me---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
