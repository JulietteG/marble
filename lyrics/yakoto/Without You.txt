When I saw you
the night was blue.
I pursued by
with my eyes.

Hypnotised
by your smile,
by your grace,
by your style.

I wanted to
be close to you
and I could tell you wanted too.

Cos I cant go home without you
wont leave alone.
Cos if I wake up without you
my chance is blown.
Cos you are leaving with the break of dawn,
so let us try to change our lives, tonight.

(Ooh, tonight)

I wont explain,
Ill use no words,
for what I feel
when youre near.

Take my hand
and turn me around.
Lets take off
from the ground.

Dance me far,
far away.
Hold on tight
lets be insane.

Cos I cant go home without you
wont leave alone.
Cos if I wake up without you
my chance is blown.
Cos you are leaving with the break of dawn,
so let us try to change our lives, tonight.

Ive never felt this way,
I cannot tell you why.
Theres something in the air
that we can not deny.

Dont wana be afraid,
don't wana be too wise.
I want your love,
I wana feel alive. 

Cos you are leaving with the break of dawn,
so let us try to change our lives
I cant go home without you
wont leave alone.
Cos if I wake up without you
my chance is blown.
Cos you are leaving with the break of dawn,
so let us try to change our lives, tonight.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
