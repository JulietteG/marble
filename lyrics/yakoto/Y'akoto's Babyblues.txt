The love of my life pushed me down the valley
Disappeared and never showed up again
And now he's in love with a very old lady
A women who's 10 years older than me
What cursed and killing one drink after the other
I am sure I will never recover

(R)She's probably everything I never was
A rich pretty face and very mature
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death what (a fucking) surprise 

But she shouldn't hate me she should pitying me
'Cause she took away the best part of my existency 
The man I love in the arms of a very old lady
A woman who's 10 years older than me

(R)She's probably everything I never was
A rich pretty face and very mature
And as I drunk myself in toxic tears
I'll question we'll use of all these years

He left me hanging until he let go of my wrist
I sow them walking down the street and back when they kissed
And now my dead body is doing the best he can
I'm gonna find myself a very old man

(R)She's probably everything I never was
A rich pretty face and very mature
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death what (a fucking) surprise

She's probably everything I never will be
A rich pretty face and ready for maternity 
I hope he's happy with his brand new life
She hates me to death what (a fucking) surprise---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
