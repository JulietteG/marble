Old California is where I come from
But I'm here in Cody just sitting alone
So thanks for the nod
Thank God for your smile
Thank God I'm in Cody
For this little while.

Just an old cowboy alone in my room
Just my old guitar playin' my tunes,
I saw you working in the hotel saloon
You gave me a smile
and said, "See ya real soon."

I'm here in Cody but not very long
Not much for talking and soon I'll be gone
But I'll take you with me right here in this song
And I'll still have Cody now after I'm gone.

Old California is where I come from
But I'm here in Cody just sitting alone
So thanks for the nod
Thank God for your smile
Thank God I'm in Cody
For this little while.
