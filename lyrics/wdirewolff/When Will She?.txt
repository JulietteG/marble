When Will She?
Written by: W. Dire Wolff - 10/15/03
Written in Cody, Wyoming


In a field with grass of green
She rests beneath that stone
Waited for me, so many years
So why am I alone?

When will she, come to me?
When will she? I pray
When will she, come to me?
Im living for that day.

In a field beneath a walnut tree
Shes waiting all alone
In the stars and clouds above
Shes making us our home.

When will she, come to me?
When will she? I pray
When will she, come to me?
Im living for that day.

Late at night when the stars are bright
She reaches for my hand
She graces me with heavens touch
But I am just a man.
