Pretty Nice Girl - Part One

Riding my pony on a Saturday Night
I told the trail boss I wouldn't go there to fight,
Got on my best clothes, still got my gun
Won't look for trouble, but I never run,
Saturday night, but I won't tear up this town
Got one good reason for coming around.
Got one good reason that I really care
To find a bath and slick back my hair,
Got one good reason I travel this world
For I want to find me a pretty nice girl,
A pretty nice girl, where can she be?
My mama said there would be one for me,
A pretty nice girl that I cannot find
Seems I have wasted so much of my time,
A pretty nice girl, nowhere in sight
So me and my partners were drinking that night.

Me and my partners were there at the bar
One of them laughs at some guy with a star,
Me and my partners just looking for fun
One of them pulls out and is twirling his gun,
Twirling his gun, around and around
Then he cocks the lever and fires off a round,
Fires off a round above the guy with the star
It sure got quiet in that little bar,
The guy with the star was quick to his feet
I saw his partner a drawin' on me,
They shot my partner, they killed him so quick
They didn't like his gun twirling trick,
They shot my partner and were looking at me
I saw their pistols all pointed at me,
I said, "It's Saturday Night so don't gun me down
Got one good reason for coming around."

"Got one good reason that I really care
To find a bath and slick back my hair,
Got one good reason I travel this world
For I want to find me a pretty nice girl,
A pretty nice girl, where can she be?
My mama said there would be one for me,
A pretty nice girl that I cannot find
Seems I have wasted so much of my time,
A pretty nice girl, nowhere in sight
So me and my partners were drinking tonight."
