Princess of the Rodeo (Abridged Version) 
Written by: W. Dire Wolff  October 11, 2003
Written in Crow Country, Montana


Born in the land where her grandmother died
Big Horn Mountains on the other side
Across a little valley some called a draw
Red clay country beneath the canyon walls.

Riding on the ponies that her daddy tamed
Riding with the deer that called her name
She always remember what her grandmother said
Riding through the canyons where the clay is red.

Learned to ride the barrels, learned to ride and tie
Chasing all the cattle across the mountainside
Then she told her daddy and she made it so,
Im gonna be your Princess of the Rodeo.

Riding on the ponies that her daddy tamed
Riding with the deer that called her name
She always remember what her grandmother said
Riding through the canyons where the clay is red.

She said, Im gonna be your Princess of the Rodeo.
