Letters in my Pocket
Written by: W. Dire Wolff - 10/17/03
Written in Cody, Wyoming

I Drove her in the wagon to the station
Her ma was ill so many miles away
It was there that we kissed
And she said that she would miss
My love when she was so far away.

I waited for the day that I would find her
Standing inside our kitchen door
And I loved her every night
In the letters she would write
Until the day they didn't come no more.

I still have her letters in my pocket
Just like they were written yesterday
I still have her picture in her locket
Though it's faded like the memories of that day.

Her pa was the one who come to tell me
I guess so he could tell me man to man
At the station we both cried
When he told me she had died
With her mother so many miles away.

I still have her letters in my pocket
Just like they were written yesterday
I still have her picture in her locket
Though it's faded like the memories of that day.

I rode away from that life we built together
But I couldn't leave the memories or the pain
I ran from that life
But I couldn't leave my wife
Though she died so many miles away.

From heaven I know she looks down here and sees me
That is why I still try the best I can
And I feel her every day
She helps to guide my way
She's my darling and she knows that I'm still her man.

I still have her letters in my pocket
Just like they were written yesterday
I still have her picture in her locket
Though it's faded like the memories of that day.

So tell the Angels on high
That this love will not die
Beside her I still need a place
And I'll do what I can
To be a good man
Until I ride into heaven someday
So don't cry for me
When my soul is set free
For we'll be together that day.
