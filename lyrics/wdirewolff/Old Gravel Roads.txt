Old Gravel Roads

Old gravel roads
Not many now are left
They brag about their changes
But all I see is death
They turn us on our neighbors
When they need a helping hand
I'm on my knees now praying
Have mercy on this land.

Old gravel roads
Now so hard to find
The things I took for granted
Now seem another time
I tried to grow up straight and true
And be a honest man
But the way these folks are acting
I'll never understand.

And this ain't what I bargained for
When I was just a boy
I thought this land was great and true
Not something to destroy.

Old gravel roads
The ones I traveled down
They put up all those fences
And the farms were all torn down
They say it's for convenience
They say it makes it fast
They call this progress, "Culture"
But how long will this last?

Old gravel roads
So many now are paved
We take so much for granted
But look at how we've changed
I was born my father's son
And grew into a man
And in my lifetime passing
This became a modern land.

And this ain't what I bargained for
When I was just a boy
I thought this land was great and true
Not something to destroy.

It was something to believe in
Something great and strong
The time has come for another change
But we can't wait too long.

Old gravel roads
Not many now are left
They brag about their changes
But all I see is death
They turn us on our neighbors
When they need a helping hand
I'm on my knees now praying
Have mercy on this land.
