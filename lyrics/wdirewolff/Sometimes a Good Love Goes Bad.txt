Sometimes when love won't find you
There's something to remind you
Of the joy and it wasn't always pain.

Sometimes when you're dreaming
And those memories come screaming
Like the tears that are pouring down your face.

And all your friends they say someday
They're talking about a new day
But all their words seem so out of place.

And now they all tell you to make a new start
But what do the know about the ways of the heart?
And sometimes a good love goes bad.
I guess that is why you sit by yourself
And wait for the day you can love somebody else
And how can they know how it makes you feel sad?
To remember that love the two of you had
And sometimes a good love goes bad.

So now you just there
All alone in your pain
And wait for the winter to end.

But you better get ready
Like a bird waits for spring
For the flowers shall all come again.

And now it is time to make a new start
'cuz it's you who's forgotten the ways of the heart
And sometimes a good love goes bad.
And I can't let you sit there in pain
I'll take your hand, but I don't own the blame
And I truly do know how it makes you feel sad
But there's more to life than the love you once had
And sometimes a good love goes bad.

But now it is time to make a new start
And find someone else to trust with your heart
And I know it seems strange and I know you can't see
But I know about love, cuz it happened to me
And sometimes a good love goes bad.
