She likes adventure with security
And more than one man can provide
She planned adventure feeling sure that he
Would not be home till after five
He turned on the light and turned it off again
And said the one thing he could say

All these years
Where have I been
I've been down the road to work and home again
But I'm still here, and until I'm gone
Don't you rub it in too hard that I've been wrong
All these years

She said "You're not the man you used to be"
He said "Neither is this guy"
She said "There's some things you refuse to see
But I guess sometimes so do I"
She made no excuse why she was lying there
She said the one thing she could say

All these years
What have I done
I've made your supper and your daughter and your son
Still I'm here
And still confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years

Still I'm here
And so confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years---Lyrics submitted by Jen.
