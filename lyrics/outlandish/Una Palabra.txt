This aint a story bout race, color or creed
Its a story bout hate, envy and greed
Talk about ambitions but dont want us to progress
Ya talk about assistance but all we get is the stress
U dont really wanna see me grow
Hating on me choking on my flow
U say we rude, dont like our attitude
We crude, aint got no gratitude
But I wasnt born to be low, I was born to rise
Wasnt born to pretend or keep my faith in disguise
Aint got no freedom of speech
No freedom to teach  make our kids out of reach
Wanna break ties  alienated in their own land
Running riot in the streets, day by day getting out of hand
U dont want me to be an inspiration
U wanna blame me for agitation
How can u tell me bout participation
When all u really want is segregation

Una palabra no dice nada
Y al mismo tiempo
Lo esconde todo
Como aquel viento que esconde el agua
Como las flores que esconde el lodo

Translation:
[One word contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the air contains water
Like the flowers contain the mire]

Is it my religion  u keep seeing as a threat 
U think its all about  murder, violence and death
But do u care to find  find the truth
Or is it easier to keep fronting and oppressing our youth
Is this why Im a be awestruck? 
Damn these lies just make us stuck
Bow down to something greater
Nah forget that maybe later
Really must be joking, deceits and lies is all I see
Should I be your enemy or should I trust your lies
Should your treatment of my peeps make us forge them ties
Got to tell me the truth as it is
Or well be keeping coming back right here to this
Second class citizen in my own home
Been 30 years gone - and still no dome, still gotta stay strong
Thinking Im thick trying to sell me this hypocrisy 
Heard it before, u must be kidding me! 

Wanna dictate who I marry
And even what my sis should wear
Then prevent her from a job
Stuck on welfare - seems
To provoke and oppress us is ok - seems
Racism is cool  despite what u say
Wanna blame us for ya shortcomings
Just want a scapegoat
Still seeing us like a problem
Like we just off the boat
Guess u wanted cheap labour to build ya home

Una palabra no dice nada
Y al mismo tiempo
Lo esconde todo 
Como aquel viento que esconde el agua
Como las flores que esconde el lodo

Una Mirada no dice nada
Y al mismo tiempo
Lo dice todo
Como la lluvia sobre tu cara
O el Viejo mapa de algn tesoro

Translation:
[One word contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the air contains water
Like the flowers contain the mire

One look contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the rain on your face
Or an old map leading you to some treasure]

Where the next Abu Dharr at?
Where the next Khalid Ibn Walid aka Sayf-Allah at? 
Tell us how we fuel this crime
Everyday statistics, everyday media  plenty of us doing time
Why should I take the blame or shame
When I know u just looking for someone to frame
My individual freedom; abused
Redicule of my deen, my beliefs, guess I be the new jew
Ive become the new ni**a of the world
Product of your society, adopted your values in their entirety
Wasnt born like this, I was made this way
U like it or not, player - Im here to stay
We walk the same streets, breathe the same air
Add to this state, but do u even care? 
Guess u gotta reciprocate
Want us to be people of faith or people of hate?
U got your deen, I got mine  okay?---Lyrics submitted by rana.
