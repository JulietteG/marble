[Isam]
They were the youth, a faith who didnt pray
Young ones from the hood came back another day
Told the old ones youre wasting you time
Time, what you know bout that? the old ones replied
Lifes like a parking lot, products dont help a lot
Hoping they listen and wise up before they drop
Prayed for them to mend their brains
For the twig and the sky and every grain
For the hood grown soon, the streets to look too
Oughta to be cool, oughta to be true
Occasionally there would be one who come through
Fused to the sky and became one so

[Waqas]
So, so, so, so, so, so, fresh
Half the youth wont settle for less
Wait slow down you pace for a minute
Life aint even started you already up in it
Aint worth to giving in parts in it
Stuck in the brain, stuck in the fame
Stuck in the mind frame stuck in the paradigm
No changing lanes, hear me
Can I get a witness? Lord Im in the midst of shit
And I know its getting too much
Aint filling the cup, cause Ive had enough
And I fear for my son these streets stay tough
Once in a while there will be one who comes through
And I hope that its you you, you, you

[Chorus]
I know it seems Like just a dream
I try to reach but someones got to believe
Sometimes it seems So hard to see
I know, I know someday well all be free

[Lenny]
Qu, qu, qu, qu, qu, qu miedo
Perder este fuego de fuego
Sentir el dolor que me niego
Nunca saber lo que entrego
Tambaleo buscando salida
Pero mi sombra pesa, mi sombra carga
Mi alma herida, so la mano que me mata
So la mano que me falta[?]

[Isam]
They became men, of good, good men
Who been gangsters so long they walk like kings
Under the streetlights, they raise their arms
Hear us, too much pain on earth
No place to store with, we drown or burning
Six by ten prison cells weve earned
Occasionally there would be one who come through
Fused to the sky and became one so true

[Chorus]
I know it seems Like just a dream
I try to reach but someones got to believe
Sometimes it seems So hard to see
I know, I know someday well all be free

[Bridge]
Ser libre, libre, de todo lo que no sere(?)
Someday well all be free
Ser libre, libre, de todo lo que me a da(?)
A veces el mundo me mata

[Isam]
Like you wanted to bring life to me
My dead life like dead soil you bring water to
Busy watching DVD's 24/7
Ain't even time for the D.A.D.'s going to heaven
There was the method of dealing
A fine method if you lived in the hood
Was done with smooth measure
On the corner everybody was, hustling
Worrying about the cause, trembling
So much that wanted the angels to stop crying
Keep struggling we'll support you
You're gonna make mistakes still support you
When you make mistakes we'll be there for you
Occasionally there would be one who come through
Fused to the sky and became one so true

[Chorus]
I know it seems Like just a dream
I try to reach but someones got to believe
Sometimes it seems So hard to see
I know, I know someday well all be free

Ser libre, libre,Someday
