All y'all radios out there
Song goes out to you
Yeah, Aicha for my sisters ya

So sweet, so beautiful
Everyday like a queen on her throne
No, nobody knows how she feels
Aicha, Lady one day it'll be real

She moves, she moves like a breeze
I swear I can't get her out my dreams
To have her shining right here by my side
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes, oh

Aicha Aicha, passing me by
Aicha Aicha, my my my
Aicha Aicha, smile for me now
Aicha Aicha, in my life

She holds her child to her heart
Makes her feel like she blessed from above
Falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
Her lullaby fades away with his fears

Aicha Aicha, passing me by
Aicha Aicha, my my my

Needs somebody to lean on, lean on
Someone body, mind and soul, body, mind and soul
To take her hand, to take her world
Show her the time of her life, so true

Throw the pain away for good
No more contemplating, contemplating
No more contemplating

Lord knows the way she feels
Everyday in His name she begins
To have her shining here by my side
Sacrifice all them tears in my eyes, oh
Aicha Aicha, coutez-moi

Aicha Aicha, passing me by
Aicha Aicha, my my my
Aicha Aicha, smile for me now
Aicha Aicha, in my life

Aicha Aicha
Aicha Aicha, passing me by all the time
Aicha Aicha, she don't know she the light of my life
No she don't know
Aicha Aicha, no she don't

Satellite motivating, doing it again
Yeah, Aicha baby
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by kanika sharma.
