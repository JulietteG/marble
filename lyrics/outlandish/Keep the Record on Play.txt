Keep the record on play yeah
No matter, no matter what they say yeah
I got the remedy for you
Everybody turn the radio up

Okay, okay haters here to front
They say, they say
See that boy he went from rags to raja
Fresh out the slum
Straight out the record booth to the streets, to the souk
I am. what I can't complain, so yeah I screwed up
No matter how, they would try to hold me down
But I hit back
I stopped being a slumdog long ago
Get those 24 inch rims on rickshaws
It ain't all out sourced so we hustle hard

Ayo, Ayo - Keep the record on play yeah
If you had a hard day yeah
Don't let it get the best of you
Brush it off, turn the radio up
Keep the record on play yeah
No matter, no matter what they say yeah
I got the remedy for you
Everybody turn the radio up

Hey it doesn't matter your situation
Cause it's time to celebrate
Let it all go, while the record play
It's okay, all I need is your cooperation
Scream it out on the count of three
Everybody one, two, three ayo ayo.
