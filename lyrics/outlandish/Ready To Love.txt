[Chorus]
We got one life to love each other
One life, One love
Protecting and be there one another
Yeah
We're worthless if we keep on fighting
'Cause together we can face the night
Yeah
If we're ready to love

[Verse]
Faceless nameless rich and famous
Taxes,Gases we are born in places
Devil won't forget us God won't forsake us
Beast is born and bred to break us
Jesus save us , mad they make us
It ain't enough that we are war with nature
We want more more more than our 40 acres
We want more more more that what you can pay us
We original means you all can't replace us
Can't pop a pill for that ill that plagues us
This is the real ill these ills ain't just
Stomach aches but earthquakes, melting glaciers

[Chorus]
We got one life to love each other
Protecting and be there one another
We're worthless if we keep on fighting
'Cause together we can face the night
If we're ready to love
Ready to love
Ready to love somebody
Ready to love
If we're ready to love

[Verse]
Hopeless, fearless, can't change them
We have to change us, must be courageous
We can't lose not, we're gonna make it
If you're still scared look at you're children's faces
To give to love, live in different places
Sky is ours we're ready to face it
This is the real ill these ills ain't just
Stomach aches but earthquakes, melting glaciers

[Verse]
No pasa nada si la vida cansa
Cuando no hay sudor, no nace la esperanza
Si no dormimo mas droghemos junto
Y esto va querer y da lo el diablo susto

[Chorus]
We got one life to love each other
One life, One life
Protecting and be there one another
We're worthless if we keep on fighting
'Cause together we can face the night
If we're ready to love
Ready to love
Ready to love somebody
Ready to love
If we're ready to love
We got one life to love each other
Protecting and be there one another
And be there for one another
We're worthless if we keep on fighting
Worthless if we keep on fighting
'Cause together we can face the night
Together
If we're ready to love
Ready to love
Let it out for the people out there
Ready to love somebody
Ready to love
If we're ready to love ---Lyrics submitted by hibaabdallaa.
