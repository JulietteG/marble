Theres a sweet summer breeze
in the air, and its bringing me back to my hometown
No more chains do I drag
On the cold ground
of that prison far east of the sun

Theres a sweet summer breeze
in the air, and my heart filled with joy is now burning
cause the wind blows me home
Im returning, from that prison far east of the sun

And I wonder if life has now changed
since I fought in the battle for freedom
cause the changes, how could I have seen them
from a prison far east of the sun

There were many like me why not free them
From their prison far east of the sun. 


I fought for what I believed in
Cause if ones heart is not looking for the truth 
his eyes will never see real beauty
An no matter how desperate my future looked
no Siberian chains could capture or destroy my Russian soul
For absence made my heart grow stronger
in my prison far east of the sun

Theres a sweet summer breeze in the air
even sweeter than I can remember
Its the end of eternal december
and the perfume of roses I smell

Oh I can see all smiles warm and tender
I have come to my heaven through hell.---Lyrics submitted by Jesse.
