Now the south side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown
Now Leroy Brown he's trouble
And he stands about six feet four
And all the downtown ladies call him treetop lover
and all the studs they call him: sir

Now Leroy he's a gambler
And he likes those fancy clothes
He likes to wave his big fat diamond ring
Under everybody's nose
He's got a custom Continental
He's got an Eldorado too
He's got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He's got a razor in his shoe

Refrain

Yeah he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
He's meaner than a junkyard dog

Well Friday about a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar, sat a lady named Doris
Man, she sure looked nice
And then he laid his eyes upon her
That's when the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown he learned a lesson bout messin'
With the wife of a jealous man

Refrain

Much badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog---Lyrics submitted by coretta jenkins.
