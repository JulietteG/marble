What can I do for You
What can I bring to You
What kind of song would You like me to sing
'Cause I'll dance a dance for You
Pour out my love to You
What can I do for You, beautiful King

'Cause I can't thank You enough
'Cause I can't thank You enough


All of the words that I find
and I can't thank you enough
No matter how I try
and I can't thank you enough

Then hear you saying to me
Listen you, don't have to do a thing 
Just simply be with me 
and let those things go
'Cause they can wait another minute
Wait, this moment is too sweet 
Would you please stay here here with me
And love on me a little longer

I hear you saying
You don't have to do a thing 
Just simply be with me 
and let those things go
'Cause they can wait another minute
Wait, this moment is too sweet 
Would you please stay here here with me
And love on me a little longer

'cause I like to be with you a little longer

I love to be with you a little longer

'Cause I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
