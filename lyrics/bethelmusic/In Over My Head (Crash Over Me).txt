I have come to this place in my life
Im full but Ive not satisfied
This longing to have more of You
I can feel it my heart is convinced
Im thirsty my soul cant be quenched
You already know this but still
Come and do whatever You want to

Im standing knee deep but Im out where never been
I feel You coming and I hear Your voice on the wind

Would you come and tear down the boxes that I have tried to put You in
Let love come teach me who You are again
Take me back to the place where my heart was only about You
And all I wanted was just to be with You
Come and do whatever You want to

Further and further my heart moves away from the shore
Whatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours
Further and further my heart moves away from the shore
Whatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours

Then You crash over me and Ive lost control but Im free
Im going under, Im in over my head
And You crash over me, Im where You want me to be
Im going under, Im in over my head
Whether I sink, whether I swim
It makes no difference when Im beautifully in over my head
Whether I sink, whether I swim
It makes no difference when Im beautifully in over my head
Im Beautifully in over my head
Im Beautifully in over my head ---
