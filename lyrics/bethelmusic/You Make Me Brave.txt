I stand before You now 
The greatness of your renown 
I have heard the majesty and wonder of you 
King of Heaven, in humility, I bow 

As Your love, in wave after wave 
Crashes over me, crashes over me 
For You are for us 
You are not against us 
Champion of Heaven 
You made a way for all to enter in 

I have heard You calling my name 
I have heard the song of love that You sing 
So I will let You draw me out beyond the shore 
Into Your grace 
Into Your grace 

You make me brave 
You make me brave 
You call me out beyond the shore into the waves 
You make me brave 
You make me brave 
No fear can hinder now the love that made a way 

You make me brave 
You make me brave 
You call me out beyond the shore into the waves 
You make me brave 
You make me brave 
No fear can hinder now the promises you made---
