How do I say thank You, Lord
For the way that You love
And the way that You come

For all that You've done
All that You'll do
My hearts pours out
Thank You

You don't have to come
But You always do
You show up in splendor
And change the whole room

How do I say thank You, Lord
For the life that You gave
The cross that You bore

For the love You poured out
To ransom my soul
My hearts pours out
This thankful song

You walk through all my walls
Conquered my shame
Stepped into my past
Fill my world with grace
You didn't have to come
But You wanted to

I say Thank You---
