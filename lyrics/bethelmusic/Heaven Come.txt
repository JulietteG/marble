You are calling me again
I hear your voice upon the wind
In the quiet in the still

Heaven

Glory written in the sky
In the turning of the seas
Echoes of your majesty

Heaven

All that you have done
The promise that there's more to come
All I am cries out for more of you

Your presence is heaven
Just to be with you
Just to be with you

Your glory all around me
Oh to be with you
I love to be with you

There's a stirring in my soul
And a fire here within
Deep is calling deep again

Heaven

Heaven come fill this place
Glory to glory and grace to grace
Here and now your kingdom come
Our God eternal now and forevermore---
