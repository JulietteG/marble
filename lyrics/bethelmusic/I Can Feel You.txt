The wind and waves surround me
And I'm tossed, Feel like I'm drowning
I am tired, I am weak
I need you here with me
'Cause I can feel the rising tide
But I don't have the strength to fight
I feel clouded and confused
I need you here with me

Chorus:-
In thechaos of the storm
I have drifted far; far away
But I call out your name
'Cause you are just a breath
A breath away

Then through the shadows
Your light appears
I've known you're with me
But now it is clear
I can feel you
Jesus All around

Like sun on my skin
Warm to the touch
Here you surround me
I am held by love
I can feel you
Jesus all around

Now hope is rushing through my veins
With everything you've rearranged
I am peaceful; I am brave
When you're here with me

All my questions find their answers here
When you come you change the atmosphere
I am focused; I am clear
When you're here with me
Chorus...
Bridge:-
There is nothing in this world
That will satisfy my soul like you do (2)

Then through the shadows
You're light appears
I've known you're with me
But now its is clear
I can feel you
Jesus all around
Like sun on my skin
Warm to the touch
Here you surround me
I am held by love
I can feel you
Jesus all around

Though the storm it rages
I won't be moved
I won't be shaken
I'm anchored in you
I can feel you
Jesus all around---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
