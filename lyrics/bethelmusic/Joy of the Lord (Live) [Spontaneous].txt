Spring up, o well!
Spring up, o well!

You turn my mourning into joy, my mourning into joy,
You break depression!
You turn my mourning into joy!
O Jesus, you break depression,
You break depression!

Let freedom reign!
Let freedom reign!
Let freedom reign!
Break off the change!
Break off the change!
Let freedom reign!

The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
Is our strength!
Over every problem, and every possibility
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
Is our strength!

Joy, joy, joy,
overflowing joy,
overflowing joy,
overflowing joy that breaks depression,
that breaks depression!
Overflowing joy!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord,
is our strength!---
