I was stumbling in the darkness
Couldn't see my hand in front of me
I was sending up an SOS
When all was lost, You came running

Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
You sent the shadows scattering
When through the clouds, a piercing light
And then I saw You

Shine, shine, shine like the sun
You're waking hearts to life
You've only begun
Every fear, every doubt disappears
When You shine on us
We wanna see You
Shine, shine, shine like the stars
You are the first love to open my heart
Every hope, every dream comes alive
When You shine on us
When You shine on us

Heart of stone into a prism
Light of heaven flowing through me
Black and white to vibrant color
I'm reflecting Your beauty

I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed
Just standing in Your presence
Your face illuminates the sky
And then I saw You

Shine, shine, shine like the sun
You're waking hearts to life
You've only begun
Every fear, every doubt disappears
When You shine on us
We wanna see You
Shine, shine, shine like the stars
You are the first love to open my heart
Every hope, every dream comes alive
When You shine on us
When You shine on us---
