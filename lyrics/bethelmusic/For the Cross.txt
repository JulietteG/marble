The life You gave
Your body was broken
Your love poured out
You bled and You died for me
There on the cross
You breathed Your last as You were crucified
You gave it all for me

Hallelujah, what a Savior
Hallelujah, what a friend
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross

There in the ground
Sealed in the darkness
Lifeless laid
The frame of the Father's son
In agony
He watched His only son be sacrificed
He gave it all for me

Hallelujah, what a Savior
Hallelujah, what a friend
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross

But on that day
What seemed as the darkest hour
A violent hope
Broke through and shook the ground
And as You rose
The Light of all the world was magnified
And You rose in victory

Hallelujah, it is finished
Hallelujah, it is done
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross

Hallelujah, it is finished
Hallelujah, it is done
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross

We thank You for the cross

(Music interlude)

Though our sins are scarlet
You have made us white as snow
Though our sins are scarlet
You have made us white as snow---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
