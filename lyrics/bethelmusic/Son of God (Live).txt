There is a place of sorrow and love
The innocent Savior broken and bleeding for us

Nails in his hands, thorns on his brow
Rivers of mercy endlessly flowing down

The Son of God
High and lifted up
The Father's love
Came pouring down for us
He has overcome
The spotless lamb
For every sinner slain
Our victory
Our hope beyond the grave
He has overcome

There is a place for all who will come
His arms open our sins are washed white in his blood
The lost and unworthy come find your home
The broken and hurting his love will never let go

The Son of God
High and lifted up
The Father's love
Came pouring down for us
He has overcome
The spotless lamb
For every sinner slain
Our victory
Our hope beyond the grave
He has overcome
He has overcome

Oh, how marvelous
Oh, how wonderful
Oh, how marvelous
Oh, how wonderful

The Son of God
High and lifted up
The Father's love
Came pouring down for us
He has overcome
The spotless lamb
For every sinner slain
Our victory
Our hope beyond the grave
He has overcome---
