(feat. Jenn Johnson)

I am the Lord your God, I go before you now
I stand beside you, Im all around you
Though you feel Im far away, Im closer than your breath
I am with you, more than you know

I am the Lord your peace, no evil will conquer you
Steady now your heart and mind, come into My rest
Oh, let your faith arise, lift up your weary head
I am with you wherever you go

Come to Me, Im all you need.
Come to Me, Im everything
Come to Me, Im all you need.
Come to Me, Im your everything

I am your anchor, in the wind and the waves
I am your steadfast, so dont be afraid
Though your heart and flesh may fail you, Im your faithful strength
I am with you wherever you go

Come to Me, Im all you need.
Come to Me, Im your everything
Come to Me, Im all you need.
Come to Me, Im your everything

Dont look to the right or to the left but keep your eyes on Me
You will not be shaken, you will not be moved ooh
I am the hand to hold, I am the truth, I am the way
Just come to Me, come to Me, cause Im all that you need---Lyrics submitted by maria levan.
