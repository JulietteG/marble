Every night I sit home alone
Sitting by my radio
I'm just hoping that something good will come on
But it never does
Hours away, back in the street
Sally's out with some man she'd met
She's just hoping that something good will come along
But it never did

And I'm still hoping 
Hoping that someone could tell me
I sit here praying
That somebody knows
I keep on wishing
That someone could tell me
Exactly what I'm going to do

So late at night
I make up games
I try to make the silence play
What harm could it do
Sometimes I try and call you
I'd seen him come
I'd seen him go
Some are faster now
Some not so
You know Sally
She ain't a bit of fun anymore

And I'm still hoping
Hoping that someone could tell me
I sit here praying
That somebody knows
I keep on wishing
That someone could tell me
Exactly what I'm going through

So every night
I'm home alone
Just sitting by my radio
Just hoping that something good will come along
But it never does

And I'm still hoping
That it someone could tell me
I sit here praying 
That somebody knows
I keep on wishing
That someone could tell me
Exactly what I'm doing here---Lyrics submitted by Rolf.
