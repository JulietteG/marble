walking bones
choose your own direction
go have fun
some place else

bring your soul
and your Beach Boys records
I can't stand
to have you here

so worn out
cold and dehydrated
the fortune is spent
and dad is in space

every home should have a mom in love
and a daddy in space
chinese porcelain cats
to guard her love
in the window space
show her some respect
she's all worn down

for years to come
I will not forget you
as my son
as my pain

time will heal
what now feels so wounded
tears are spilled
and the holes will fill

every home should have a mom in love....---Lyrics submitted by Peter.
