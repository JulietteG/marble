I like to be real cool
Say it doesn't bother me
But every night she is out, walking' the streets
And I worry

She can lead her live the way that she wants
It is not for me to say, but I worry
It is not for me to say, but I worry

Worry, Worry,
About the world that she lives in
Worry, Worry,
That I could lose her in the end

I keep thinking, she's okay
But it's driving me crazy
It is not save to be out on the streets
And I worry

She could be lost, the danger is there
There's trouble, trouble everywhere
Trouble, trouble everywhere

Worry, Worry,
About the world that she lives in
Worry, Worry,
That I could lose her in the end

She is not a lover
She is just a friend
I cant ignore it or I just pretend
I cant think of myself and
Shes all alone with no one waiting, for her to come home

Shes just a child in every fathers eyes
Just cant help it, but I worry
I cant help it, that I worry

Worry, Worry,
About the world that she lives in
Worry, Worry,
That I could lose her in the end

Worry, yeah
I worry
Worry, worry
I worry
Worry
I worry ---
