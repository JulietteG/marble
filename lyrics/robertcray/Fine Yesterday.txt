I was fine yesterday
What made you think that you could do that?
Summer shine. Rain so hard
I just had to scream, I never knew a storm so rough
Never knew a person so mean
Maybe by mornin' this will all go fume
And I'll pick up the pieces of my life
And forget about you

Cause I was fine yesterday
What made you think that you could do that?
Someone showed you? Wasn't anyone
I had no clue, I know that you're not sorry babe
By the things that you do
Same ol' winds, same one blew in today
Gonna change the direction, find you something

Wasn't any one, I had no clue, 
No, you're not sorry, baby
Same ol' winds, same ones that blew in today
They're gonna change the direction, find you something
I was fine yesterday, said I was fine
Sun was shining---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
