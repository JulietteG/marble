(feat. Bilal & Jazmine Sullivan) 

To me, you're everything x2
I was alone and thought that I was doin' alright
Cause everyday was always the same
Just when I thought nothin' was ever gonna change
You came along and put me back in the game
To me, you're everything

To me, you're everything
I need you, babe, in every way
It's a wonderful feeling having you all to myself
It got me grinnin' from ear to ear
They say (???) not good for your health
Cause you change my world like no one else
To me, you're everything

There's not a thing I wouldn't do for you
Call me morning, noon or night
Whatever it is I do she agrees with me
I need you in my life
To me, you're everything x2---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
