As her car pulls out the driveway
And she dont wave goodbye
Her last words echo in my mind
Listen honey, i gotta get away

Im standing here watching her tail lights
As if theyre some kind of sign
Fading into a memory
I just got tired of trying

So long, i hate to see you go
So i save my tears for later on down the road
How come i keep i holding on
Knowing you wont be coming home

Two days later i get a letter
A picture of a room in some hotel
Sitting framed up on the table,
A picture i know so well
Youve painted yourself in to a corner
Now youre trying to paint something new
And your lipstick on the letter
Is a goodbye kiss from you

So long, i hate to see you go
So i save my tears for later on down the road
How come i keep i holding on
Knowing you wont be coming home

I still set the table
Still set it for you and me
Its become a habit
My own personal make believe

So long, i hate to see you go
So i save my tears for later on down the road
How come i kee i holding on
Knowing you wont be coming home

So long, i hate to see you go
So i save my tears for later on down the road
How come i keep i holding on
Knowing you wont be coming home---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
