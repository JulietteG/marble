Worried, you betcha ya'
Discouraged I don't know
Every time I see a 1040
Out of my pocket it goes
Ow!

I hate taxes

I work hard for my money
Every April you take it all away
Don't you know I work hard for my money every day, people
You take it all away from me
Ow!
Owwww!

I hate taxes

Taxes gonna break my back I swear
Don't you know I pay a lot more than my share?

I hate taxes

SOLO

(Same as above)
Can't have any fun anymore
Gotta make plans for everything now
Gotta plan for every thing I do, people
Can't go out and have a real good time
Now I've gotta worry about everything
That my little money can buy

Ohhhh!
OWWWWW!

I hate taxes

Taxes gonna break my back I swear
Don't you know I paid a lot more than my share

You know I've thinkin' about movin' somewhere else
But I can't because I love america too much
Especially California
Yeah
I guess I'm gonna have to pay these taxes
If I'm gonna live here

Ohhh!
