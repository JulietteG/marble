Only a man with one heart to read
Silently holding my love within
And hoping in time Ill quietly find your love, your love
So many words that I wish to say
Honestly you take my breath away
My feelings I hide
New passion, new lives I say

Then I guess Ill never miss the love I never had, oh no
Its a moment just like this is enough to make me sad, oh no
And I guess Ill never miss just another kiss
Sure I cant resist your love, your love

Only some me gets so far away
Years passing by in a single day
Though seasons may change
My love still remains the same, the same
Sometimes I feel like to write a book
After one page you will surely look
Right into my eyes
Predicting the life
Then I say

Then I guess Ill never miss the love I never had, oh no
Its a moment just like this is enough to make me sad, oh no
And I guess Ill never miss just another kiss
Sure I cant resist your love, your love

I wish I had you
But I guess Ill never have you, oh no, oh no
I wish I had you
But I guess Ill never have you, oh no, oh no---Lyrics submitted by GN Hew A Kee.
