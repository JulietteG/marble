I got day drunk and watched as my city got younger
On the steps of the ford lofts across from the theatre
Where I was a contender now none of that matters
The kids have new heroes and new dreams to get shattered
I wouldn't change a thing about the way it went down
16 years of memories built on a town
That nobody will know just how a cool kid can drown
In a pool of his own hype and beer

Goodbye

It's the most perfect time and the weather is perfection
To watch as my father battles infection
My life in the dark is now bright as the reflection
The store window he worked '77
Now millions of snapshots will shoot through my brain
Push through the dark like that underground train
Just as real as the blood pumping fast through my veins
Just as real as I'm standing here

Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
