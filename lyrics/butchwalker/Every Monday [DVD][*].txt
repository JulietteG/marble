i was checked in by four with a sign on the door
looked out the window of the seventeenth floor
talk to the city that knows me by name
and all the bad things that i do
i shed five bitter tears into five bitter beers
looked at my watch and said where have the years gone?
im wastin' away like a castle of clay
that's slowly crumblin' too

every Monday i get this pain
every Wednesday it hits my brain
every Friday i die cause every day
i still think of you

i was fucked up by five
talkin' nothing but jive
told the bartender he'd never take me alive
all of this because my favorite show
was canceled last night on TV
so i called up Marie, 
she has sex for free
but for 10 bucks an hour she'd listen to me
talk about rock stars and models on dope
and why i cant cope with this scene

every Monday i get this pain
every Wednesday it hits my brain
every Friday i die cause every day
i still think of you

every Monday i get this pain
every Wednesday it hits my brain
every Friday i die cause every day 
i still think of you
talk like you, eat like you
breath like you, sleep like you
every day 
i still want you.---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
