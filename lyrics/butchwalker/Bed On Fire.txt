And oh, you got a lot of nerve
Thinking me want you so bad
Never make this easier
So hard to have

And no you never will know this
That you already my kill
so baby fire at will

Gonna take you down
Over my knees
Make that sound
Make you see
Untie your hair
Let it fall
I'm gonna rain
Bed on fire
Love in flames
A hundred times
Make you say my name
Lay in shock with me
Till the darkness ends
I'll do it again

You cry by me every day
You leave me for dead
My puddle of sweat just standing in
One of my sin

And no you never will know this
That you already my kill
so baby fire at will

Gonna take you down
Over my knees
Make that sound
Make you see
Untie your hair
Let it fall
I'm gonna rain
Bed on fire
Love in flames
A hundred times
Make you say my name
Lay in shock with me
Till the darkness ends
I'll do it again

Gonna take you down
Over my knees
Make that sound
Make you see
Untie your hair
Let it fall
I'm gonna rain
Bed on fire
Love in flames
A hundred times
Make you say my name
Lay in shock with me
Till the darkness ends
I'll do it again---
