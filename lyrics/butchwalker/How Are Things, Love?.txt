When you walked into living room
And your eyes were living proof
You've done all you could
And you were finally sick of me
And there was nothing I could be
To make you feel good

As you take off from your nest
I thought I could love you best
Before you go

How are things, love?
Since something stole our love
Did you ever feel the sting love
Is it any of the above, love
I hope you're well

There's a picture of us with our kid
In my wallet that I keep hid
So I don't have to explain
There's a little pill next to that
That I take in case I have
To do so... Oh oh....

I will pick him up by 2
I know there's a lot you gotta do
Before he goes....

How are things, love?
Is the new guy everything love
Does it feel like you're in chains love
Is it all of the above, love
I hope you're well

And of all the weight on my chest
One thing I never did best
Was love you

How are things, love?
Did you get rid of the ring love?
Do you ever think of me love
I do all the above, love
I hope you're well...---
