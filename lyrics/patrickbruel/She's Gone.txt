The lights are out, so is my heart
Something is missing I'm fall apart
I can't wake up, I can't fall asleep
A smell in the bed never left the sheets

I tried and tried to pray
But even God is away

She's gone, she's gone
I can't find the strength to move on
Never knew how hard it is to be alone
She's gone

She's gone, she's gone
I feel alone in London
All I do is sit here wondering what went wrong

I walk in the streets
I can't concentrate
Food is not good
I lost my taste

My friends call me up
And take me out
Wherever I go I still see her face

I think I'm going insane
When all I hear, is her name

She's gone, she's gone
I can't find the strength to move on

Never knew how hard it is to be alone
She's gone

She's gone, she's gone
I feel alone in London
All I do is sit here wondering what went wrong
She's gone

I tried and tried to pray
But even god is away

She's gone, she's gone
I can't find the strength to move on
Never knew I heard he is to be alone
She's gone

I tried and tried to pray
But even God is away

She's gone, she's gone
I can't find the strength to move on
Never knew how hard it is to be alone
She's gone

She's gone, she's gone
I feel alone in London
All I do is sit here wondering what went wrong
She's gone

She's gone, she's gone
The lights are out, so is my heart
Something is missing I'm falling apart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
