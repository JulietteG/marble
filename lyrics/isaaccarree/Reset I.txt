(feat. Joe)

Back to the drawing board
Seems like Im wasting half on my life
Oh, oh, its gotta be something more

You gotta find me quick, 
Cause were running out of time.
And who said?
You can make a new score 
Tell me who said,
But youre stuck where you are
And when you change your mind,
I promise youll change your heart!

All you got to do is reset, reset, reset
The narrowness behind you
Im here to remind you that you cant 
Reset, reset, rest, yeah
Its not over, you cant say its over!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
