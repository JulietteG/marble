(Cee-Lo)
Asher baby haha

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
(ho! ho!)

(Asher)
In the back seat screamin' out loud (HO!)
In the back seat (HO!) screamin' out (HO!)
Ash is young, attractive, handsome bachelor, awesome rapper
Gotta knack for vernacular, when I perform spectacular
I'll have any girl that i want(want), Ima take the girl in the front(front)
Boobs bounce when i tell the crowd jump
Hunnie come back stage I just wanna have
But, Im to young to be locked down (not now)
Need a new car with the top down
New broad with her bra and her top down
Chillin' in the back seat screamin' out loud (HO!)

(Cee-Lo)
She wants to be my lady, but i don't see her
She wants to be my lady, but I'm a free bird
I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fry by myself, go get high by myself this time

(Asher)
The cycle of Sean Mitchaels' (heartbreak)
N yeah I like you, but not enough to wife you
You say Im nice (true), n u think im the right dude
But there's another girl just like you (like how)
Im on the road, nother night nother show
New event, in a new time zone
N the live show is so mind blowin'
N it's my show so you know that I'm blowin'
(You Know)
No txt gonna give me head
Long distance just ain't my thing
Yeah I'm single, don't need no ring
I'm a free man now I don't need no strings sing

(Cee-Lo)
She wants to be my lady, but i don't see her
She wants to be my lady, but I'm a free bird
I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fry by myself, go get high by myself this time

(Asher)
Well, if your cool then nights at the pool
Jacozies n Groupies, Groupies n Booze
N no rules I'm only 22 (true)
I need to watch football n hang with the crew
But if you don't get mad when i get fat
Cuz all i do is eat, drink, smoke weed n rap n play Madden 
Then dag your pretty rad n i take all back (Come On)

(Cee-Lo)
She wants to be my lady, but i don't see her
She wants to be my lady, but I'm a free bird
I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fry by myself, go get high by myself this time

(Asher)
Just keep clapin' your hands, feels good
Feels nice n warm in here right now
I'm feeling free, if you feel free clap your hands (ha)
I I I come on

(Cee-Lo)
She wants to be my lady, but i don't see her
She wants to be my lady, but I'm a free bird
I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fry by myself, go get high by myself this time---Lyrics submitted by Alexis.
