Lets head into the ford torus man
and cruise around the streets for a little bit.

Yo we cruisin' (yeah we cruisin')
Yo we cruisin' (yeah we cruisin')
Down the street (down the street)
I got money, who got the dutchies?
You got the munchies? I got the weed
You know we be Blunt Cruisin' Blunt Cruisin'
My hommies in the front
Got hunnies in the back
You role that weed up
Then put it in the air
You know we be Blunt Cruisin' Blunt Cruisin'

So role it up, role it tight
Hit it once, hit it twise
Pass it round, but don't role the windows down
Lets box it out, n save the trees
We hoppin' out like the mystery machine
My eyes be the size of Mr. Miagi's
Squinting to read the fine print on the wide-screen
We riding riding, n that's when i see head light behind me
