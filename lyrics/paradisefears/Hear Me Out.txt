[verse]
im just about ready to explode 
because this breath Ive been saving is so suffocating and i know that you are the answer thats fading 
all these doubts that im up against 
and all these months have got me convinced 
this is love

[chorus] 
youve got me head over heels for you 
youve got me down on my knees 
and im begging you please hear me out 
youve got me fighting the seas for you 
youve got me riding the breeze 
and im begging you please hear me out 

[verse 2]
im just about ready to let go 
im tired of stalling and saying the wrong thing 
im wasting my time and im so sick of falling 
out of love and into consequence
but all these months have got me convinced 
this is love 

[chorus]

[bridge]
im pressing for an answer 
i never should have asked her 
see the mess that ive made 
its amazing that i still stay 
but youve got me drifting further and further away
