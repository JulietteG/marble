Its so damn good to see you, 
Howve you been? 

What kind of car do you drive 
How do you feel about the government 
Shutting down? 
I guess its fine. 
I guess I'm fine. 

And we all look so damn happy, 
Even though were all so lonely, 
And were standing close together 
Cause we think that its the only 
Way to feel 
Like were not alone. 
Like were not alone. 

So we raise our glass, 
Pretend were fine, 
Apologize a million times, 
We drink til we, 
Cant feel ourselves at all. 

And maybe then, 
Once were 10 drinks deep, 
Well finally say some things we mean, 
Like, oh God, 
Im so lonely, 
But at least I'm not alone. 

Alyssas getting married, 
And Alexa got engaged, 
And I think Tylers got a ring inside his pocket 
Just in case. 

I guess some people grow up fast, 
I guess some people never change, 
I guess some people just become themselves a little more with every day. 

And we all look so damn happy, 
Even though were all so lonely, 
And were standing close together 
Cause we think that its the only 
Way to feel 
Like were not alone. 
Cause were not alone. 

So we raise our glass, 
Pretend were fine, 
Apologize a million times, 
We drink 'til we, 
Cant feel ourselves at all. 

And maybe then,  
Once were 10 drinks deep, 
Well finally say some things we mean, 
Like, oh god, 
Im so lonely, 
But at least I'm not alone. 

I guess some people grow up fast, 
I guess some people never change, 
I wonder if in 10 years, will i still be here the same? 

I dont wanna be lonely.---
