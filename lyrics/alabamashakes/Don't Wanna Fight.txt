My life, your life
Dont cross them lines
What you like, what I like
Why cant we both be right?
Attacking, defending
Until theres nothing left worth winning
Your pride and my pride
Dont waste my time

I dont wanna fight no more

Take from my head
Put in your hands
The fruit of all my grief
Lying down aint easy
When everyone is pleasing
I cant get no relief
Living ain't no fun
The constant dedication
Keeping the water and power on
There aint nobody left
Why cant I catch my breath?
Im gonna work myself to death

No, no, no---
