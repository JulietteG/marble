You ain't alone 
So why you lonely? 
There you go on the dark end of the street 
Are you scared to tell somebody how you feel about somebody? 
Are you scared what somebody gonna think? 
Are you scared to wear your heart out on your sleeve? 
Are you scared of me? 

Cause I'm scared that love gonna take me away 
But I really don't know what I got to say 
Oh, alright, alright, alright, alright 

One, two, three 
Are you too scared to dance for me? 
Bite the bullet or touch my sleeve 
Are you scared that I don't want to be 
We really ain't that different, you and me 

Cause I'm scared that love gonna take me away 
But I really don't know what I got to say 
Oh, alright, hold on, hold on, hold on 

If you gonna cry 
Well come on, cry with me 

You ain't alone 
Just let me be your ticket home---
