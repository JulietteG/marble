On your way to God 
Did you think of me? 
On your way to Heaven 
Did you say I'll see you again? 

It wasn't me 
Why wasn't it me? 

On your way to the promised land 
Did you say Oh, she was such a friend? 
Then they took you higher and I don't know if I can follow 

It wasn't me 
Why wasn't it me? 

On your way, I said to the air 
I don't know if I am strong 
So I climbed to the mountain 
And I don't know what I did wrong. 

Cause it was just me 
Just lil ol me---
