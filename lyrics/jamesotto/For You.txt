You could call me anytime and I'd come running
I'd go to hell and back to rescue you 
I'd give up my soul and everything I own
If that's what you want I'd do that for you 

Oh, but now you're asking too much 
You want me to find somebody new
Oh, I never thought I'd say this but girl congratulations
You found the one thing I can't do for you 

Ask me for forgiveness, girl you've got it 
If you don't love me what else can I do
If this really is the end you won't see my face again
If that's what you want I'd do that for you 

Oh but now you're asking too much 
You want me to find somebody new
Oh, I never thought I'd say this but girl congratulations
You found the one thing i can't do for you

You'll have to think of something else
'Cause there's no way to turn it off
I'm sorry girl, I can't fall out of Love

Oh, I never thought I'd say this but girl Congratulations
You found the one thing I can't do for you
You found the one thing I can't do for you---Lyrics submitted by Micahel.
