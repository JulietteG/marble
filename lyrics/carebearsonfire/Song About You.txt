Stuck in here, got nothing to do
But it's alright cause I can write about you
If I have something to say I can say it out loud
Say how you're just one of the crowd
Bring it on, I'll write it down

This is a song about you
You never listen to what I say
A song about you, yeah you
This is a song about you
Figure it out, take you all day
Song about you, yeah you

You think I write to get your attention
But this ain't honorable mention
You think this is part of a game
Well, you and me, we just aren't the same
Bring it on, I'll write it down

This is a song about you
You never listen to what I say
A song about you, yeah you
This is a song about you
Figure it out, take you all day
Song about you, yeah you

You can walk, but I can run
At the end of the day, what you have down
It doesn't matter if you don't take it seriously
This isn't for you, this song's for me

This is a song about you
You never listen to what I say
A song about you, yeah you
This is a song about you
Figure it out, take you all day
Song about you, yeah you---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
