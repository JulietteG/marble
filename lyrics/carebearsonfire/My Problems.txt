My problems, didn't know I had
My problems make me so sad
My problems must be really bad
Cause everybody's telling me
I gotta go fix my problems

My hair's not bouncy, what should I do?
My teeth aren't straight, my clothes aren't new
My freckles are weird, my hands aren't slender
Got too many problems to remember

My problems, didn't know I had
My problems make me so sad
My problems must be really bad
Cause everybody's telling me
I gotta go fix my problems

Don't know what's happening on that show
The big hit song, don't know how it goes
Don't keep up with celebrity facts
So many problems, I can't relax

So many problems, what should I do?
Do other people have them too?
Must be something wrong with me
Help I need a remedy, help I need a remedy

Everything's wrong, my face, my hair
What they don't know is that I don't care
I don't need you to tell me who to be
I'll decide what's wrong with me

My problems, you don't know about
My problems, I can figure out
My problems, you don't need to know
I don't need your help so
Worry about your own problems---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
