Make up, nose job, seven foot tall
Wears high heels but she never falls
No hopes, no dreams just one big smile
She's got no brains but she's got style

Barbie eat a sandwich before you die
Barbie eat a sandwich, give it a try
Barbie eat a sandwich to survive
Barbie eat a sandwich, barbie eat a sandwich

Everyone wants to have your hair
Wherever you go, they want to be there
They all think you're real but we know you're fake
Believing in you was a big mistake

Barbie eat a sandwich before you die
Barbie eat a sandwich, give it a try
Barbie eat a sandwich to survive
Barbie eat a sandwich, barbie eat a sandwich

Hey there, hey there
It's getting kinda drastic
Even though you look fantastic
Hey there, hey there
It's getting kinda drastic
Even though you're made of plastic

Perfect tan and big blue eyes
Everybody thinks that she's the prize
What is it that you've got to hide?
Is there anything going on inside?

Barbie eat a sandwich before you die
Barbie eat a sandwich, give it a try
Barbie eat a sandwich to survive
Barbie eat a sandwich, barbie eat a sandwich

Barbie eat a sandwich before you die
Barbie eat a sandwich, give it a try
Barbie eat a sandwich to survive
Barbie eat a sandwich, barbie eat a sandwich
Or just an apple---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
