A minute of loneliness for a lifetime apathy
A finger on the pulse of love, it ain't no remedy

In this commotion, it turns me up today
No magic potion can bring me back
Went through all over, but baby, don't believe in fate
While we make a future for ourselves

(Chorus)
I might survive
Don't tell me either way
I'd rather be with you
Then alive
I might survive
Tomorrow or today
I'd rather be with you

A silhouette of emptiness or a part-time empathy
A victim of a look of love, now you're my tragedy

In this commotion, it turns me up today
No magic potion can bring me back
Went through all over, but baby, don't believe in fate
While we make a future for ourselves

(Chorus)
I might survive
Don't tell me either way
I'd rather be with you
Then alive
I might survive
Tomorrow or today
I'd rather be with you

Than alive
I might survive
I might survive
Tomorrow or today
I'd rather be with you
Than alive ---
