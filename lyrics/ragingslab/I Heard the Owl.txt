I flipped heaven the finger
sold my hand to a bird
for a fist fulla' true death
i gotta' horn that'll blow your brain
like skin balloons on a cobra fang
i've heard chicks go pow and guns go bang
I heard the owl call my name

I layed the driveway some rubber
just to pour on some iron
I cleft a hoof on the pedal and drove my ashes to ash
where the ground sweats you like bullets
and angels dress up white as trash
my love came loose like a paper chain
when i heard the owl call my name

I could light the fuse on a bible
with my breath and a match
it keeps gittin' harder and tougher
to tell the quick from the stiffs
so i'll burn the ghost to a fossil
and sink a worm in the devils apple
while snakes with lips were kissing people
I heard the owl call my name---Lyrics submitted by Jake Carter.
