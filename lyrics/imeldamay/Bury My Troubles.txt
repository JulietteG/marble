Secrets I hide in me, deep down inside of me
I keep them, I keep them at bay
No one will ever know what I don't wanna show
I lock them, I lock them away

And do I dig, yes I dig
I'm goin' to bury my troubles away
I'm goin' to bury my troubles away

Oh worries, stop haunting me, don't you keep taunting me!
I won't be, I won't be no slave
I put you to rest for good, I did the best I could
So get in, get into your grave

Farewell ye gentlemen, goodbye my mental friends
Hear what, hear what I'm sayin'
Ashes and dust to dust, that is the end of us
Oh Lord, Oh Lord I'm prayin'---Lyrics submitted by jaisfem.
