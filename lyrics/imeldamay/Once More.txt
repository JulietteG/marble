If I could see you, once more
If I could touch you, once more
If I could tell you, I need you, once more

To hold you near me, once more
and feel your kisses, once more
If I could share your love, like I once did, before

No simple explanation, can tell you how I feel
I miss the old sensations, that was once so warm and real

Please let me open the door
To all we knew once, once before
Say you'll forgive me, and love me

Once more---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
