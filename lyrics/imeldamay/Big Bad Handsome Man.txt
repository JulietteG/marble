The man is tall, mad, mean, and goodlookin'
And he's got at his eye
When he looks at me, I go weak at the knees
He's got me going like no other guy

Chorus
Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man
He's got me at the palm of his hand
He's the Devil Divine, I'm so glad that he's mine
Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man

Oh, the music he plays, the way he moves and sways
Rocks me to the floor
When he sings in my ear, he makes me shiver and leer
Leaves me wanting more and more

Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man
He's got me at the palm of his hand
He's the Devil Divine, I'm so glad that he's mine
'Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man

Trumpet

With his rugged good looks yeah hes got me hooked
Got me where he wants me to be
With his arms so wide, he pulls me in by his side
Hes the kind of guy that does it for me

Chorus
Cause hes my big bad handsome man yeah
Hes got me in the palm of his hand
Hes the devil divine, Im so glad that hes mine
Cause hes my big bad handsome man
Ouuuw
My big bad handsome man, yea
Hes got me in the palm of his hand
Hes the devil divine, Im so glad that hes mine
Cause hes my big bad
Im so glad that hes my handsome man
