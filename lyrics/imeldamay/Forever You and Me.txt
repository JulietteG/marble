When the moon's the sky's host, 
I miss my lover man most, 
He's inside my head.
When the owl twit-twoos, 
... one wish that was you, 
inside my bed.

When the sky is so dark, 
and one star's little spark, 
uplifts the night.
Memory of you in my heart, 
although we're apart, 
you are my light.

He's nowhere round me, 
I can't sleep soundly, 
I need my baby back with me.
Can't live or dream, 
and without him it seems, 
each day turns to weeks and to years.

When the sky is so dark, 
and one star's little spark, 
uplifts the night.
Memory of you in my heart, 
although we're apart, 
you are my light.

(trumpet solo)

He's nowhere round me, 
I can't sleep soundly, 
I need my baby back with me.
Can't live or dream, 
and without him it seems, 
each day turns to weeks and to years.

I love him, 
and nobody knows, 
I'll miss him, 
and so it shows. 
God meant us to be, 
two by two birds and bees, 
Forever you and me x 3---Lyrics submitted by Laurence.
