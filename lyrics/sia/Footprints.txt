I don't like to wait too long, to wait too long, wait too long
Figured out I'm burning slow, but I burn babe
I feel the pain and it feels good, I know it would
Your heart burns slow, I feel the pain and I cry out, I cry out

I need you, I need you
Babe I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen

Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I'm going on up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
Baby I'm a house on fire
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
Baby I'm a house on fire

So take me to the heavens now
As we burn down, as we are found
Take me to the heavens now
My heart screams out

I need you, I need you
Babe I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen

Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I'm going on up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
