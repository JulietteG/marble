Lonely float got in the way
You are the feel, and knew it anyway
Take a chance, it wasnt what you know
Take my hand, and dont let go

Oh, ooh ooooh
You can do it
Dont break
Yeah, youll pull through it
Youre safe
Yes, you can do it
Dont break
Yeah, youll pull through it
Youre safe

Tell her on how you feel
Give her every say she needs to hear
Give your heart, and say come take it
And she will see youre a good man

Oh, ooh ooooh
You can do it
Dont break
Yeah, youll pull through it
Youre safe
Yes, you can do it

Dont break
Yeah, youll pull through it
Youre safe
Yes, you can do it
Dont break
Yeah, youll pull through it
Youre safe---
