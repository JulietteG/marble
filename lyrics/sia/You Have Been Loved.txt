You shut me up, yeah, and you filled my cup, oh
You sailed my boat, you were my very last hope
You took my very last hope away

Oh, you, you will be loved by someone good,
Yeah, you, you will be loved by somebody good
You have been loved.

You dropped the bomb, and now you're gone.
I held you dear, you swallowed my fears,
And now I've drunk my last beer with you

Oh, you, you have been loved by someone good,
Yeah, you, you will be loved.

Oh will you ever know
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago?
Only sadness remains and it will pass, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah, you, you will be loved by somebody good,
By somebody good.---Lyrics submitted by Sheila.
