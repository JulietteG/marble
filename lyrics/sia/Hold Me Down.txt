Could never met the kind that keeps these thoughts I lie in, turn out on the spot watch it all pass by
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
I kinda seemed to move, nothing more to lose waiting in the base that we used to use
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down

It's dirty like it is, everything's a mess, I can only save but your last kiss
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
I cannot show my face, blurred in your embrace , I am controlling your taste
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down

These memories
way on me
make believe sets me free
I long for you

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hod me down
You hold me down
You hold me down---Lyrics submitted by Daniel Salazar.
