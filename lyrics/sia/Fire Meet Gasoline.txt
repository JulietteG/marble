Its dangerous to fall in love, but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
You hurt me
Theres two of us
Were certain with desire
The pleasure is pain and fire, burning
So come on now
Ill take you on
Take you on, I
Hate for love, in for us, why
Why don't you come, don't you come a little closer?
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
And a perfect match
Perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame and candle meet
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
Im burning alive
I can barely breathe
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got all I need
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline
Im burning alive
And I can barely breathe
And you're in love with me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight

And we will rise
Like smoke darkening the sky
Ill meet on the drive
Take on fire
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
And a perfect match
Perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame and candle meet
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
Im burning alive
I can barely breathe
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I've got all I need
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline
Im burning alive
And Ian barely breathe
And you're in love with me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight

But its about best, certain death
But I want what I want, and I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Darken the skies
Hot ash, dead match only smoke is left
Its about best, certain death
But I want what I want, and I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Darken the skies
Hot ash, dead match only smoke is left

Flame and candle meet
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
Im burning alive
I can barely breathe
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got all I need
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline
Im burning alive
I can barely breathe
And you're in love with me
Fire meet gasoline
Burning tonight

Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Eh eh---
