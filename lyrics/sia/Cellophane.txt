Look at me Im such a basket case 
Delivered to you wrapped in cellophane 
Waiting on your doorstep, out your day 
Delivery, a basket filled with pain 

Patience is your virtue, saint o mine 
Id have fallen through the cracks without your love tonight 
Im your groundhog, and I'm skating on thin ice 
But you see me at your feet and carry me inside 

Eh eh eh eh 
Eh eh eh eh 

Oh, can't you see Im wrapped in cellophane? 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Cant hide the pain 
Cant hide the pain 
When youre wrapped in cellophane 

Look at me Im such a basket case 
While I fall apart, you hide all my pills again 
And all the things I need to hear you say 
Youll watch as all my thoughts get right back on the train 

Eh eh eh eh 
Eh eh eh eh 

Oh, can't you see Im wrapped in cellophane? 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Cant hide the pain 
Cant hide the pain 
When youre wrapped in cellophane 

Oh 

Can't you see Im wrapped in cellophane? 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Cant hide the pain 
Cant hide the pain 
When youre wrapped in cellophane---
