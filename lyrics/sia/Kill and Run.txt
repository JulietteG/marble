Watching the sequence of sounds coming out of your mouth
But the snow is too loud
Follow the hands as they move
Trying to make out your mould
But your brain doesn't want to

Hi, close the door, silent cold
For youuuuuu
What have I done to you

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one, off the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart

Interpret your eyes as they die
Should I die should I now
Your poor lashes blow
We've done of sanctuary laugh
You cry all over
An innocent call

Hi, close the door, silent cold
For youuuuuu
What have I done to you

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one, off the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart ---
