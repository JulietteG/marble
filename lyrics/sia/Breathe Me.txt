Help, I have done it again
I've have been here many times before
Hurt, myself again today
And, the worst part is there's no one else to blame

Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I'm small, and needy
Warm me up. and breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe 

Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I'm small, and needy
Warm me up, and breathe me.---Lyrics submitted by pablo acuna.
