My flawless shadow is haunting me
It chases me all the way up to the hill with the lilac trees
I look down from the hill and I see a silver lake
And imagine that this is the last time my heart breaks

Cause I am helpless without you
And you wont help me if I dont forgive and face the truth

The sky is black and I am blue
The stars are whispering that Im ready to break on through
But its hard to forgive the pirate hearts 
Of all people whove tried to tear me apart

And I am helpless without you
And you wont help me if I dont forgive and face the truth

Its funny how things can last forever in a moment of love
And its sad how moments can vanish into the thin air above

Cause I am helpless without you
And you wont help me if I dont forgive and face the truth---Lyrics submitted by B.
