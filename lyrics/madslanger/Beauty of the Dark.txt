The beauty of the dark is the beauty of you
I dream of dreaming dreams of you but nightmares always block the view 
I can't sleep 

The beauty of silence is the noise of no words 
When everything I listen for is here when you walk in the door tonight

Where is the light in your deep dark room?
A shock of white could save you from your shadow
Why is the dark behind the moon?
Out of reach until the light is shattered

The ugly things I do for beauty
If you could see what's real in me then maybe beauty wouldn't be so cruel

Where is the light in your deep dark room?
A shock of white could save you from your shadow
Why is the dark behind the moon?
Out of reach until the light is shattered

The beauty of the dark

The beauty of the dark is the beauty of you

Where is the light in your deep dark room?
A shock of white could save you from your shadow
Why is the dark behind the moon?
Out of reach until the light is shattered---Lyrics submitted by B.
