Constellation a silver chandelier
Hanging overhead like frozen tears
Realization that I must have let go
And I'm still spinning all alone

The stars are falling like rain
Crashing all around my head tonight
And a dark sky is all that remains of you

Imagination temps me with a smile
Draws me in then leaves me running wild
No sedation to swallow with my pride
An avalanche is breaking loose and I can't hide

The stars are falling like rain
Crashing all around my head tonight
And a dark sky is all that remains of you

Twilight left me blind
And now all that ever shined is gone with you

The stars are falling like rain
Crashing all around my head tonight 
And a dark sky is all that remains of you
Remains of you

Twilight left me blind---Lyrics submitted by B.
