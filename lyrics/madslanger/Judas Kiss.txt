Is this a Judas kiss?
A gentle way of killing
Killing everything we had - nothing's left but the aftermath of you

Is this a hidden war? 
Between night and nightmares?
Erase my name from your memory - embrace the death silently tonight

It just wasn't blue as blue was meant to be
It just wasn't good as good was meant to be

There's lipstick in your eyes
Youve got tears on you lips
Broken flowers in your hair - golden words are in the air  its oh so hollow

It just wasn't blue as blue was meant to be
It just wasn't good as good was meant to be

Over is over - closer is closer 
Silence is screaming - hello

It just wasn't blue as blue was meant to be
It just wasn't good as good was meant to be---Lyrics submitted by B.
