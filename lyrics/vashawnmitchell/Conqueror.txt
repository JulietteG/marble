[Spoken:]
This song is to remind you of the winner within
Regardless of what you've seen
Regardless of what you've heard
You are a conqueror
You are the head and not the tail
Above and not beneath
The first and not the last
You are a conqueror, a conqueror
A CONQUEROR

[Verse 1:]
I have the power over the enemy
No weapon formed shall prosper against me
Greater is he that is within me
In the end I'll recieve what he has for me

[Chorus:]
I am a conqueror
Through him that loves me I have the victory
I won't be defeated
(Ohhh ohhh)
I'll keep on believing
(Yea Yea)
Every work started in me shall be completed
I am a conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
There is a winner in me
Thanks be to God who gives me the victory
[Repeat 3x and modulate]

[Chorus]

[Spoken]
...Now can all my conquerors make some noise up in here?
Lift your voice
If you are victorious, c'mon claim your victory
and help me say this part in here
Here we go

[Hook:]
I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me
I am, I am
More than a conqueror
[Repeat 2x after lead and modulate]
I'm more than a conqueror
(More than a conqueror)
I'm more than a conqueror
(More than a conqueror)
I'm more than a conqueror, yea
(More than a conqueror)
I'm more than a conqueror
(More than a conqueror)
Now unto him
(More than a conqueror)
Who is able to keep me
(More than a conqueror)
Because of him I'm more than...
(More than a conqueror)
Because of him I'm more than...
(More than a conqueror)
I can do all things
(More than a conqueror)
Through Christ that strengthens me
(More than a conqueror)
I'm more than a conqueror
(More than a conqueror)
I'm more than a conqueror, yea

[Spoken:]
All the conquers make some noise
C'mon make some noise in here
If you're a conqueror
Shout out
"I'm more than a Conqueror"
