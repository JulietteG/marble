Help
I don't know what to do, and I'm depending on you, to see me through
Help
When trouble comes my way and I don't know what to say, Lord have your way

[Chorus:]
Help Me
Help me
Help me
Help me

Help
When I don't understand what's in your master plan, and I need you direction
Help
When I am all alone, and I need someone to call on, to love me and care for me

[Chorus:]
Help me
Help me
Help me
Help me

[Verse:]
Lord I need your help
Just can't make it, no without your help
OOOHHHH
Lord I need you help
Just can't make it no, without your help

[Bridge:]
I need your help
Just can't make it with out your help

[Vamp:]
I have tried over and over again
But I just can't make it
With out you help

[Chorus:]
Help me
Help me
Help me
Help me ---Lyrics submitted by brandy.
