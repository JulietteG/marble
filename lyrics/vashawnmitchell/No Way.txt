(Chorus)
No way no weapon is formed shall prosper
No way no weapon is formed shall prosper
No...
It just won't work
It just won't work
No way

Tried to tear me down but I'm still standing
Wanted what I have but I'm sustaining
Scandalized my name, tried to bring me shame
Find More lyrics at
But there is no way

(Chorus)

I am more than a conquerer
Through Christ that loves me
That's why I'm still here
I have already been set free

(Chorus)

It just won't work
