[Chorus: x2]
His blood still works and I'm glad to report
That it never lost it's power
Yes, it works, I've been redeemed
By the Blood of the Lamb

[Lead:]
His blood still works and I'm here to testify
God is not dead, He's still alive
The same blood that was shed way back at Calvary
Is the same blood that's working now for me

Oh, His blood redeems me from the stain of sin
And His blood cleanses me deep down within
So, if you ask me how I made it and how I've overcome
I can tell you it's because of the blood

[Chorus:]
His blood still works and I'm glad to report
That it's never lost it's power
Yes, it works, I've been redeemed
By the Blood of the Lamb

Oh, the blood of Jesus [x2]

[Lead]
Ohhhhh oh the blood, oh the blood, oh the blood, oh the blood of Jesus
Yes, it does

[Chorus]
It still works, it still works
The blood Jesus shed still...

His blood still works, His blood still works [x2]

Yes it works, yes it works [x2]

Never lost it's power, never lost it's power [x2]
Yes it works
Never lost it's power, yes it works [x4]

It still works, it still works
The blood Jesus shed still works ---Lyrics submitted by Shavanna.
