Sometimes discouraged, but not defeated
Cast down, but not destroyed

There's times I don't understand
But, I believe it's turning around for me

I've had struggles and disappointments
There's times I've felt so alone
Some of my friends they let me down
But, I still believe it's turning around for me

Around for me
Around for me
Around for me
It's turning around for me

Around for me
Around for me
Around for me
It's turning around for me

I see the breaking of day
God is making a way
Change is coming for me
If I stay strong and believe
There's no reason to doubt
I know He's working it out
And it's turning around for me

And it won't always be like this
He will perfect that concerning me
And sooner or later it will turn in my favor
It's turning around for me

It won't always be like this
The Lord will perfect that concerning me
Sooner or later turn in my favor
Sooner or later turn in my faovr
It's turning around for me

Around for me
Around for me
Around for me
It's turning around for me---
