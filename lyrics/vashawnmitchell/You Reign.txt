Lord you reign, reign forever
Lord you reign forever more
Lord you reign, reign forever
Lord you reign forever more

The angels bow down at the thought of you,
In adoration of your greatness and truth.
The Earth trembles and the Heavens proclaims,
Your royalty all power is in your name.

Lord you reign, reign forever
Lord you reign forever more.
Lord you reign, reign forever
Lord you reign forever more.

The angels bow down at the thought of you,
In adoration of your greatness and truth.
The Earth trembles and the Heavens proclaims.
Your royalty all power is in your name.

The angels bow down at the thought of you,
In adoration of your greatness and truth
The Earth trembles and the Heavens proclaims
Your royalty all power is in your name

The angels bow down at the thought of you,
In adoration of your greatness and truth.
The Earth trembles and the Heavens proclaims,
Your royalty all power is in your name.

The angels bow down at the thought of you,
In adoration of your greatness and truth.
The Earth trembles and the Heavens proclaims,
Your royalty all power is in your name.

You reign, you reign
Father you reign, Jesus you reign.
You reign [x24]

Lord you reign
Lord you reign
Lord you reign, reign forever
Lord you reign forever more.
Lord you reign, reign forever
Lord you reign forever more. ---Lyrics submitted by Jerry Newton.
