I hear the sound the abundance of rain
That means my blessings are on the way
May not see it but i (really do) believe it
The promises of God are already mine

Already Mine
Already Mine
I believe its already mine (X2)

I hear the sound the abundance of rain
That means my blessings are on the way
May not see it but i (really do) believe it
The promises of God are already mine

Already Mine
I believe its already mine (X4)

If God said it 
I believe it

...Until I receive it

Ill hold onto his every word
The promises of God are already mine(X2)

Mine
Already Mine(X6)

The Promises of God are already mine.---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
