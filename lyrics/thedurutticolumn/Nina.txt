See the ghost of Bob Marley as he gets up to go
Driven out by the new reality TV shows
In the ghost of ideals we've got nothing to show

Alcohol gives us courage, selling corporate deals
You pin all your dreams on a new set of wheels
And the New Labour spokesman tells us all how we feel.---Lyrics submitted by Bob Marley.
