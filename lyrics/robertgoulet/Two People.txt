Now and then a cloud may darken your day,
Turning the bluest of skies into gray,
But two people, deeply in love,
Can make them seem blue again

Now and then the world may cast you aside,
All of your dreams may appear to have died,
But two people, deeply in love,
Can make them come true again

Now and then you may find,
Things are inclined to go wrong,
You won't seem to mind for when love is strong,
Somehow, you both get along

Now and then a love,may fade and grow old,
Love that was lovely, when you may grow cold,
But two people, deeply in love,
Know how to keep a love that's true,
Warm and bright and new

Yes, two people, deeply in love,
Know how to keep a love that's true,
Warm and bright and new---Lyrics submitted by Tom A Chura Jr.
