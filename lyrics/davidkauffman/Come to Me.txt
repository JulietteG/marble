My burden is easy my yoke is so light
If you need rest, come to me 
you who are weary, you who are laden. 
Give to me your worry, your anguish and I will set you free


I hear the words that you speak
Still with these I cant see
Help me Lord to leave behind
What makes me blind
What makes me weak

My burden is easy my yoke is so light
If you need rest, come to me 
You who are weary, you who are laden. 
Give to me your worry, your anguish and I will set you free


I wait for you Lord, in this space
To come sit by me, take your place
Teach me to come to your table
Where I am able, to receive your grace


My burden is easy my yoke is so light
If you need rest, come to me 
You who are weary, you who are laden. 
Give to me your worry, your anguish and I will set you free


Lord, you call me even though
Ive become hard as a stone.
Crumble the fear that is mine,
So I may find, rest for my soul.

My burden is easy my yoke is so light
If you need rest, come to me 
You who are weary, you who are laden. 
Give to me your worry, your anguish and I will set you free

And I, will set you free.---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
