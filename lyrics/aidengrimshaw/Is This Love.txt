As the shadow looms over
Covers me and I cant see
So you better move over
Cause I cant breathe
Theres a fiery eye in the middle of the dark sea
And its pulling me down
So I cant breathe
And as you pull out your gun point blank got a feeling this cant be
The air is moving around me but I cant breathe
I cant breathe

[Chorus]
Is this love?
When the sun goes down
Is this love?
When the sun goes down
But this love, its just not enough for me
Its just not enough for me
Violently Ive come around

An extension of hope, this could be misleading
Could you write it down now
Cause I cant speak
And it cuts like a knife in the cracks that I cant read
And youre pulling me down so I cant breathe
And theres a fire eye in the middle of the dark sea
And its pulling me down so I cant breathe
I cant breathe

[Chorus]
Is this love?
When the sun goes down
Is this love?
When the sun goes down
But this love, its just not enough for me
Its just not enough for me
Violently Ive come around

[Bridge]
Its a situation, sometimes we all want out
Vicious regulations, from time to time we need some help
Situations, sometimes we all want out
Vicious regulations, from time to time we need some help---
