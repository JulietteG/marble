Blue lights flashin' in my rear view 
The sheriff say's 'boy i should have known it was you'
You got fourteen people in the back of this truck
I warned you twice and now i'm writin you up
I said officer what have i done? 
He smiled and said "boy, you're havin to much fun"

Too much fun? whats that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty, with too much class
being too lucky or car too fast
No matter what they say i've done 
I aint never had too much fun

There was a fight friday night at the Stumble inn
Me and ol' harley just had to join in
The next thing you know, we were both seein stars
They threw us out and closed down the bar
I said, the long branch is open, the nights still young
And we ain't never had too much fun

Too much fun? whats that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
it's like a girl too pretty, with too much class
Being to lucky or car to fast
No matter what they say i've done
Well i aint never had too much fun

I'm a holy terror, a tornado
Wind me up turn me loose and let me go

Too much fun? whats that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl to pretty, with to much class
being to lucky or car too fast
No matter what they said i've done
I aint never had too much fun

No matter what they say i've done
Well i aint never had too much fun

Give me the reins and let me run
Cause i aint never had too much fun---Lyrics submitted by gerry.
