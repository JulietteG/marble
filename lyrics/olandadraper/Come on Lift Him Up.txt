Come on let's worship Christ the King
Come on let all our praises ring
Come on and help me lift him up
Come on and let him fill your cup
For he's good, good, come on and lift him up

Come on let's worship Christ the King
Come on let all our praises ring
Come on and help me lift him up
Come on and let him fill your cup
For He's good, good, come on and lift him up
Lift him up,
Lift him up,
Lift him up,
