i feel the wind rush across me face
like an invisible wave crashing over me
started holding my breath the moment i left
wondering what the day was going to bring for me
but there is no way that i could ever prepare
for the scope of it all for the chill in the air
the cold of the rain the warmth of the day
im never gonna be the same

(chorus)
the whole worlds racing by
and our words cant describe how this feels inside
you need to be here, you need to be here with me
you come and go so fast
these moments never last
so you need to be here, you need to be here with me

theres something new and beyond every corner theres a mystery
cause every road that ive taken can never be mistaken for the one that was under my feet
and i realized with open eyes that every second that we have is once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime

(chorus)

cause nothings incomplete
not quite how it should be
and i try and i try just to live in the moment
but everything i do, just leads me back to you
cause there is no thoughts but you

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
