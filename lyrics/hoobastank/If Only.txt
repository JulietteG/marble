I thought it wasn't wrong
To hide from you a simple truth
I was scared, I'd felt it all along
But it hurt too much for me to share

If only I had been less blind
I'd have someone to hold on to
If only I could change your mind
If only I had known, if only I had you 

I finally understand why things have happened
And how it all could go so wrong
Will this pain ever end?
Cause I don't think I can carry on

If only I had been less blind
I'd have someone to hold on to
If only I could change your mind
If only I had known, if only I had you 

If only I had you
If only I had you 

If only I had been less blind
I'd have someone to hold on to
(I would have you)
If only I could've spoke my mind
If only it were true 
(Then we could start brand new)
I know I'd make it through, if only I had you

If only I had you
If only I had you---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
