spill out my heart
but you don't hear a word
cause your busy thinking bout how long till its your turn
so you can go on and on about yourself
go on and on about yourself
and my heart can go back on the shelf
and go on and on about yourself

(chorus)
but its not all about you, all about you
the more you speak, the less i care about you, you, you
it's not all about you, but we'll charge without you
the more you speak, the less i care about you, you, you

Whatever I do, you've already done
Only you've done it better and way before anyone
Cause you think, that its some game to win 
You think, that its some game to win
Accomplishments and places been
You think, that its some game to win

(chorus)

Go on and on and on about yourself 
Go on and on and on about yourself
The places that you go
The places that you've been 
Why can't you say no one cares about you

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
