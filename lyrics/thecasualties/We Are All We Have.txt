We are all we have tonight
WOAH OHHH OHHH

The ones you can't control
Brought together by lifes twist
Have only one another to depend upon
Displaced from society, outcast we are
We have nothing to live up to
We are all we've got

HEY! Loud, fast music
HEY! Sweat and dirt
HEY! Songs from a man's soul
HEY! Noise of battle
HEY! Black clouds of smoke
HEY! It's time to lose control

COME ON GET UP NOW
Vengeance with our fist
RIGHT NOW
Screaming in the air

WHOA OHHH OHHH
We are all we have tonight

All these joys and sorrows
I gladly sadly bring
This music's all we've got
The only place I need is drinking here
tonight
Together with you all

HEY! Loud, fast music
HEY! Sweat and dirt
HEY! Songs from a man's soul
HEY! Noise of battle
HEY! Black clouds of smoke
HEY! It's time to lose control

COME ON GET UP NOW
Vengeance with our fist
RIGHT NOW
Screaming in the air

WHOAH OHHH OHHH
We are all we have tonight

NOW- Vengeance with our fist
WHOA OH OH- Screaming in the air

The only place I need is drinking here with
you
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT
This noise is all we've got
So let me hear you sing
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT

HEY! Loud, fast music
HEY! Sweat and dirt
HEY! Songs from a man's soul
HEY! The only songs we need

WHOA OHHH OHHH
We are all we have tonight ---Lyrics submitted by frederick.
