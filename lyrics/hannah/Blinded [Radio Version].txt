Your eyes, your kiss
Every little thing that you ever do
The smile I miss
Every minute while I'm away from you
Cause you're the other side of my heart
Iknow that we'll never part

My eyes are blinded
My heart is waiting for you
Like a lightning
That tears apart my soul
My eyes are blinded
My heart is waiting for you
No need to fight it
I've never felt that strong

When dream has gone
Leaving me alone with reality
Look what you've done
I depend on you, lost my sanity
Cause you're the other side of my heart
I hope that we'll never part---Lyrics submitted by Winston.
