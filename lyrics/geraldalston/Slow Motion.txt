The way you feel when make love baby

You can turn down the lights
And move closer to me
Love is long overdue
I've been waiting all day
With you on my mind
I cant wait to get next you
Cause you make my body come alive, yes you do
And i feel the need to tell you why

You do it slow, nice and easy
I want you so, you know how to please me 
You dont say no, when i need a little more baby
You make me go, crazy

I like the way do it when you do it baby, oh girl
You do it in slow motion, yes you dou
I like the way you tease me when you please me baby, oh it feels so good
You do it in slow motion, yes you do, yes you do girl

I used to think, a kiss was just a kiss
But girl you changed my mind
Cause now i know, i know i know
That there was something i missed
Cause girl, you're one of a kind
And you make my body come alive, yes you do
And i feel the need to tell you why

Cause you do it slow, nice and easy
I want you so, you know how to please me 
You dont say no, when i need a little more baby
You make me go, crazy

I like the way do it when you do it baby, oh girl
You do it in slow motion, yes you dou
I like the way you tease me when you please me baby, oh it feels so good
You do it in slow motion, yes you do, yes you do girl

Cause you make my body come alive, yes you do girl
And i feel the need to tell you why

Cause you do it slow, nice and easy
I want you so, you know how to please me 
You dont say no, when i need a little more baby
You make me go, crazy
I like the way do it when you do it baby
You do it in slow motion 
I like the way you tease me when you please me baby
You do it in slow motion---Lyrics submitted by Abdirahman Musse.
