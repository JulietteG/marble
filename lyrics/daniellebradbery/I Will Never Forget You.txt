Sooner or later they say
That it all gets easier
Take it one tear at a time
I wake up one day
To find some closure
Shining like the sunlight through the blinds

No matter how much time make pass between us
Youll never be more than memory away

Cause Ill never forget you
No Ill never forget you

Whisper of the evening rain
On the bedroom window
Like the sky is missing you
The flicker of the candle flame
Theres only one shadow
Oh, but I can still see two

No matter how much pain I have to go through
Its better than feeling nothing for you at all

Cause Ill never forget you
No Ill never forget you
When Im sleeping
When Im dreaming
When i'm awake
Whenever when
I got the feeling that Ill never get you out of my mind

Oh and Ill never forget you
Oh, Ill never forget you (never forget you)
Never forget you, oh oh
Never forget you---Lyrics submitted by Monet Thomas.
