(Do-lang, do-lang, do-lang)
(Do-lang, do-lang)
He's so fine (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Wish he were mine (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
That handsome boy overthere (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
The one with the wavy hair (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
I don't know how I'm gonna do it (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
But I'm gonna make him mine (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
He's the envy of all the girls (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
It's just a matter of time (Do-lang-do-lang)

He's a soft Spoken guy (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Also seems kinda shy (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Makes me wonder if I (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Should even give him a try (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
But then I know he can't shy (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
He can't shy away forever (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
And I'm gonna make him mine (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
If it takes me forever (Do-lang-do-lang)

He's so fine (Oh yeah)
Gotta be mine (Oh yeah)
Sooner or later (Oh yeah)
I hope it's not later (Oh yeah)
We gotta get together (Oh yeah)
The sooner the better (Oh yeah)
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
To be held in his arms
If I were a queen (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
And he asked me to leave my throne (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
I'll do anything that he asked (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)
Anything to make him my own (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)

For he's so fine
(So fine) so fine
(So fine) he's so fine
(So fine) so fine
(So fine) he's so fine
