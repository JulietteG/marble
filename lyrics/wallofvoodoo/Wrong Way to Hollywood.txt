He walked into a mexican restaurant
Looking for some pills
She shivered on Cahuenga and Yucca
She couldn't shake the chills
An old man walked out of the Greyhound station
Where did my wallet go
And Jimmy searching lost and last seen
His mother will never know
He took the wrong way, the wrong way to Hollywood
He took the wrong way, the wrong way to Hollywood
A Babylon place where blondes die young
It's a g-string girl's revenge
Young boys baiting on S&M; and Highland for family men
The old soft shoe goes on and on
And the chumps are down for the count
And the ones who last the longest get their screen test at Paramount
He took the wrong way, the wrong way to Hollywood
He took the wrong way, the wrong way to Hollywood
A flash of nausea a tembling hand
Falling where we stood
In a shallow doorway grave
Lay me down in Hollywood
He took the wrong way, the wrong way to Hollywood
He took the wrong way, the wrong way to Hollywood---Lyrics submitted by wrongway.
