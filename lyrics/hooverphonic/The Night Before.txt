I ring your bell,
the buzzer opens the door.
As I walk in, I only mind the floor.

I raise my head and I see
a shadow on the wall,
vibrantly,
reminding your last call.

(chorus)
You are lying on the floor,
trying to remember,
what happened the night before.

Step by step,
the sound of breaking glass.
What happened here, well I can only guess.

You seem asleep,
as I try to put you on the bed,
as I find traces of regret.

(chorus)
You are lying on the floor,
trying to remember,
what happened the night before.
You, are you really that sure,
that I'm the prince who'll wake you.

We can't rewind the movie called our life.
And though I'm your hero,
I'm not that sure, so unsure I'll save
You are lying on the floor,
trying to remember

(chorus)
You are lying on the floor,
trying to remember,
what happened the night before.
You, are you really that sure,
that I'm the prince who'll wake you.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
