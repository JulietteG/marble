Friday night I'd just got back
I had my eyes shut
Was dreaming about the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I should have got moving
For some reason I stayed

I started drifting to a different place
I realized I was falling off the face of your world
And there was nothing left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away
A million miles away
A million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today

I took a ride, I went downtown
Streets were empty
There was no one around
All the faces that we used to know
Gone from the places that we used to go

I'm at the wrong end of the looking glass
Trying to hold on to the hands of the past and you
And there's nothing left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away
A million miles away
A million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back toda---Lyrics submitted by Barkay.
