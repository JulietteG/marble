She must belong to San Fransisco
She must have lost her way
Forces of Pancho and Sisco one California Day
She says she believes in the Robin hood and Brother hood
And Colors of Green and grey

And all you can do is laugh at her 
Doesn't anyone know how to braid?
Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world my, my 
Arizona, cut off your Indian Braids
Arizona, hey won't you go my way

Strip off your pride
Your acting like Teeny bob a run way child
Scrape of the paint from the face of a small town saint

Arizona, take off your hobo shoes
Arizona, hey won't you go my way 
You're going to follow me back to San Fransisco
I'll guide your way 
I'll be the counten of cristals  
You'll be the countess slain

And you can believe in the Robin hood and brother hood
and hiding the bottle in the hay
and i will be near you in the stable
Anything to make you stay
Arizona take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world my, my
Arizona, cut off your Indian braids
Arizona hey wont you go my way?

Come on

Arizona take off your hobo shoes
Arizona have another look at the world my, my
Arizona get off your eight ball blues
Arizona hey wont you go my way....---Lyrics submitted by Alisha.
