He came riding in on a sunrise
On a hot West Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon
With some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water
Well water is my game
And for the small price of one hundred dollars
I bet you I can make it rain

Step back nonbelievers for the rain will never come
Someone get that fire a burning somebody beat the drum
I said some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are gonna see some rain

The all just stood there a stairing
Trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzy Cooper
Who said he was a lying cheat
She said you call yourself a rainman
Well you ought to be ashamed
For starting all theses people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain

Step back nonbelievers or the rain will never come
Someone get that fire a burning somebody beat the drum
I said some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are gonna see some rain

Hey Lizzy, well a man's got to have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me
I'll meet you in between
Oh come with me Lizzy
And the stars will write your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you 
Look yonder there comes the rain

Step back nonbelievers for the rain will never come
Someone get that fire a burning somebody beat the drum
I said some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are gonna see some rain

Step back nonbelievers for the rain will never come
Someone get that fire a burning somebody beat the drum
I said some may think I'm crazy for making all theses claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are gonna see some rain---Lyrics submitted by Carla.
