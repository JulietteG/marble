See the Sunday mornin' wino
Slowly shufflin' down the street
The only God he knows clutched in his hand
Heaven is a drink from that bottle
And Jesus Christ to him is just another man

Jesus is the only one who loves us
He'll forgive us when we sin
Jesus is the only one who loves us
Even when we think we haven't got a friend

In cheap hotel room somewhere in Chicago
A cheatin' husband takes his neighbor's wife
That's not the way he killed em in Vietnam
But it's just another way of takin' someone's life

Jesus is the only one who loves us
And He'll forgive us when we sin
Jesus is the only one who loves us
Even when we think we haven't got a friend

Around the corner in a cement city alley
Hidin' from the cold Chicago wind
While the Salvation Army band's a-playin'
A junky rolls his sleeves up and lets his savior in

Jesus is the only one who loves us
He'll forgive us when we sin
And Jesus is the only one who loves us
Even when we think we haven't got a friend

Jesus is the only one who loves us
He'll forgive us when we sin
Jesus is the only one who loves us
Even when we think we haven't got a friend ---Lyrics submitted by dan maldovan.
