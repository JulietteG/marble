She was cuter than a speckled pup just turned 21
She had a lot of fun playing with my gun
Just before the sun come up she couldn't take no more
She came undone crying crawling for the door

And it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
And the only friends that's left is them behind them swinging doors
And it's hard to keep your trying when your back is to the floor
And it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore

White lightning is the horse I ride pedal to the floor
He blows hot from his nostrils and runs like Man-O-War
Someday we both may wind up in some junkyard on the side
Until that day you bet your ass we're gonna win that ride

And it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
And the only friends that's left is them behind them swinging doors
And it's hard to keep your trying when your back is to the floor
And it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore

Some super stars nowdays get too far off the ground
Singing 'bout the backroads they never have been down
They go and call it country, but that ain't the way it sounds
It's enough to make a renegade want to terrorize the town

And it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
And the only friends that's left is them behind them swinging doors
And it's hard to keep your trying when your back is to the floor
And it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore---
