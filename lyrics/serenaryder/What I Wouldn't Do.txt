If you should fall to pieces
You know Ill pick them up
There are so many reasons
Im never going to get enough
If you should leave this country
You know Ill come to you
Because you always love me
oh what I wouldnt do
oh what I wouldnt do

Ill carry the weight
Ill do anything for you
My bones may break
but Ill never be untrue
Woah-oh-oh Woah 
Woah-oh-oh Woah
Woah-oh-oh Woah 
Oh what I wouldnt do 
Oh what I wouldnt do

Your love is like an ocean
that always takes me home
Whispering wind is blowing
telling me Im not alone
Your love is like a river
that I am floating down
Ive never been a swimmer
but I know that Ill never drown
I know that Ill never drown

The current grows stronger
under different shades of blue
Ive fallen in your water
forget everything I knew
Woah-oh-oh Woah 
Woah-oh-oh Woah
Woah-oh-oh Woah 
Oh what I wouldnt do 
Oh what I wouldnt do

Oh the things I never noticed
Opened my ears to the chorus
You have made me listen careful
And you gave me the line
Woah-oh-oh Woah 
Woah-oh-oh Woah
Woah-oh-oh Woah 
Woah-oh-oh Woah
Ill carry the weight
Ill do anything for you
My bones may break
but Ill never be untrue
The current grows stronger
under different shades of blue
Ive fallen in your water
Oh what I wouldnt do
Oh what I wouldnt do
oh what I wouldnt do---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
