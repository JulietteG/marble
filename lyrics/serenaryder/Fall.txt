There was a time
I couldn't live without you, baby
So many things I used to say
Were a waste of breath
But now I see that I can breathe
Without you, maybe
And everything you did to me
I did to myself

'Cause everybody falls
When they're in love
There's no one at all
Can get enough

Got everything I'll ever need
I'll never break any piece of your heart
Got every love, got every true
Got every you, even when we're apart

I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
Fall in love with you
Oh, oh, oh

Our love, it grows
Because I know it makes me better
Thy will be done
When we are one, us together

'Cause everybody falls
When they're in love
There's no one at all
Can get enough

Got everything I'll ever need
I'll never break any piece of your heart
Got every love, got every true
Got every you, even when we're apart

I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
Fall in love with you
Oh, oh, oh
To fall in love with you
Ooh

I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall
To fall in love with you
Oh, oh, oh
To fall in love with you
Ooh ---
