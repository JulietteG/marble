Down by the lake
a warm afternoon -
breezes carry children's balloons.
Once upon a time,
not long ago,
she lived in a house by the grove.
And she recalls the day,
when she left home...


Long good-byes,
make me so sad.
I have to leave right now.
And though I hate to go,
I know it's for the better.
Long good-byes,
make me so sad.
Forgive my leaving now.
You know I'll miss you so
and days we spent together.


Long in the day
moon on the rise -
she sighs with a smile in her eyes.
In the park,
it's late afterall,
she sits and stares at the wall.
And she recalls the day,
when she left home...
