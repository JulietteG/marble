well listen very carefully
my words are about to unfold
interpret the lady, i've seen
but i never could hold

i see by your smile
it'll take a long while
my words could come through
and see that they're true
ofcourse she reminds me of you

don't misunderstand me
it's not always easy to say
the words in your head and your heart
that you just can't explain

Oh i could see clearly
your face in the sky
the moons in your eye
your passing me by

tell me the reason why

(jamming)

saw you riding on a moon cloud
saw you walking on a whirlpool
from the corner of my eye 
i.......saw you.....

saw you sitting on a sunbeam
in the middle of my daydream
oh my lady fantasy
i........love you---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
