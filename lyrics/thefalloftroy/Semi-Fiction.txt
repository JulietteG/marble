Waiting On My Confidence,
To Feel The Knife Run Through

Tear You Down and Leave You there
Cast Your Fears Aside,
She Was Nothing More Than A Game To Me Anyway

Call Out!
With The Little Bit Of Confidence She Has Left
Shot Down!
Isnt It A Shame You Have Nothing Left

Tear you down and leave you here
Cast your fears aside
She was nothing more than a game to me anyway

Last Call!
You Dont Have To Go Home But You Cant Stay Here
Back down!!
Everyone you brought down with you I just cant ever forgive you

Tear you down and leave you here
Cast your fears aside
She was nothing more than a game to me anyway

Pencil you out, just to erase you
I've got a bad taste in my mouth thanks to you!!!

Pencil you out, just to erase you
I've got a bad taste in my mouth thanks to you!!!

You fetish hoe, aw fuck!
I don't see any reason that could possibly be!
Are you alarmed?! please stay calm.
I'm walking away. I don't think you should go---Lyrics submitted by trent.
