Quarter past midnight,
Sittin' here in the moonlight
No offense my dear
I hope you know
Tonight... I write... to you.

Love is a question,
And a conversation
And did I mention,
the foul intention

Let me demonstrate,
Elaborate to your liking, honey...
Haunt me, how you taught me
Question after question,
Story after story
Tensions move way too fast
And I'm afraid to say
What would you think of me anyway

Here's a few things that I might say,
If you really wanna know
I've got nothing in my way...
1 2 3 overdose!

You make me feel like I can fly,
Keep me up all day and night
Incredible, I know you're skeptical
Believe me I'm not wasting any time
I found what I had to find,
Is what's on my mind

Sittin' here in the sunshine,
Trying to put you outta my mind
But oh no my dear!
No way, no how
So much to learn,
So much to find out
What goes around comes around
In any way, in any case
I'm losing faith to find myself in your warm embrace
just today
Maybe tomorrow baby, but... Ohhhh

Not today, Honey,
Not today, Baby

Haunt me, how you taught me
Question after question,
Story after story.
Tensions move way too fast
and I'm afraid to say
what would you think of me anyway?

Here's a few things that I might say,
If you really wanna know
I've got nothing in my way...
1 2 3 overdose!

You make me feel like I can fly,
Keep me up all day and night
Incredible, I know you're skeptical
Believe me I'm not wasting any time
I found what I had to find

In the final act you bend and wave
I won't let anyone harm you
Keep it together for another day
Come to my window, I'll sing you to sleep. Sing you to Sleeeeeeeep!
