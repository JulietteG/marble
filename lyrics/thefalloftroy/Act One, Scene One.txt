Open Wide, Space and Time Distorts The Mind
Constantly We Dare to Cheat
It Feels So Right To Be So Wrong
Normal Love Set Aside,Leave Your 
Heart At The Bedside
Contaminate The Air Like You Do,
Swear Im Telling You the Truth

Jaded Masquerade, No Names
Contradicting Fates, Its All The Same
Im Telling You the Truth
Im Telling You the Truth, I Swear....(x2)

I just Want Your Attention Baby
Every Sweat Soaked Night,
Every Taunting Fight

Lock The Doors, Turn off the Lights
Remove All Your Clothes (x2)

Jaded Masquerade, No Names
Contradicting Fates, Its All The Same
Im Telling You the Truth
Im Telling You the Truth, 

Bridge

Lock The Doors, Turn off the Lights
Remove All Your Clothes (x2)---Lyrics submitted by trent.
