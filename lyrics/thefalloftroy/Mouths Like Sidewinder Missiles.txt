YEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All this time alone.
I cannot go home.
Artificial friend. 
You Reap what You Sow.

(You said)
It was a little of something else
(I Hope)
That you lose it all
Cause you were the one that
Made me feel better
In such a fucked up bitter way
I dont understand what you say.

All this time youve known.
Such condescending Tone
Taste the tears of men 
Did it make you feel better then?

You said
It was a little of something else
(I Hope)
That you lose it all.
Cause you were the one that made feel better
In such a Fucked up bitter way
I dont Understand what you say!

(Long guitar solo leading to End of song.)---Lyrics submitted by Bryan.
