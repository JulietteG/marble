Back and forwards, you think I'll stand beside you?
Misproportioned, unattended, we hide them.
Don't try to say anything baby,
Stitched your lips to constrict languages.
Bite at your tongue...

Get up and kick up a storm,
Sit up and pin up the whore!!!
Exhale the pressure, provide a source...
Get up and kick up a storm,
Sit up and pin up the whore!!!
Straight to the bloodstream, blistered and sore...

I'll stay silent while my mind grows violent.
How will you sleep sound when theres no air in your lungs?!

Wide eyes, tearing up...

Honey, I think it's time to see...

YOU'RE MINE!!!

STICK 'EM UP!!!

Such a pretty face, such a shame that it's not gonna smile today!!!!!

Get up and kick up a storm,
Sit up and pin up the whore!!!
Exhale the pressure, provide a source...
Get up and kick up a storm,
Sit up and pin up the whore!!!
Straight to the bloodstream, blistered and sore...---Lyrics submitted by Avery.
