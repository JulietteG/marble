I've been calling you plenty of things
This is what is, like when neon turns to grey
I'm barely here, you're losing your touch my dear.
I'll be sincere, I simply can't hide my fear

Tasteless fashion following the herds
You say, "Actions speak louder than words can speak"
I'm barely here, you're losing your touch my dear
I'll be sincere, I simply can't hide my fear

Back and forth... back and forth (x2)

Raise your hand. 
Ask permission before you speak to the class!

BANG! BANG-BANG!

Twisting our bodies, to exaggerate our games
And dust that decays, in this space, do you feel safe?
I can't behave

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Take a drink and pass it my way... you want me? come crawling baby...
Tell me everything is okay, lie to me, die for me tonight

BANG! BANG-BANG!

Twisting our bodies to exaggerate our games
And the dust that decays, in this space,
I can't behave

BANG! BANG! BANG!

I've been calling you plenty of things
This is how it feels to be lifeless

You're gonna get yourself in trouble baby
Gonna get yourself caught up in some drama alright
Cause you've been cheating and been lying honey
Never thought I could say goodbye, but maybe tonight...

You're gonna get yourself in trouble baby
Never thought that I could say goodbye, but maybe. But maybe. 
Just maybe... tonight---Lyrics submitted by Nicholas Brooks.
