There's a ghost in the mirror
I feel it creeping into your head
Claiming another victim

Is it me that you hear?
And when the hatred rises up do you wish that I had been there?
And there's a ghost in the mirror
I feel it creeping up beneath me
Holding out to my tongue

Could it be any clearer?
And if the Devil ain't a beast
Then he's a bully to his loved ones

Full throttle, full speed ahead
And I'll move the earth around to save you
In my head have a heart attack
Without you, without you

Full throttle, full speed ahead
And the world will turn around
It is only you and I
Just try, just try

There's a ghost in the mirror
And in the loneliest of nights you can feel it coming closer
Should've known that the fear
Is gonna bury you beneath all the love that you held back

And there's no love in this mirror
I feel it beating like the past
Every second makes it clearer
It's you and me in the mirror
And I've let it go, like we've never ever been there

Full throttle, full speed ahead
And I'll move the earth around to save you
In my head have a heart attack
Without you, without you

Full throttle, full speed ahead
And the world will turn around
It is only you and I
Just try, just try

Hold your heavy head, hold you heavy head
And I drive up into the sky, drive into the
sunrise
Hold your heavy head, hold your heavy head upright
Into the sky, into the sun blind

Full throttle, full speed ahead
And I'll move the earth around to save you
In my head have a heart attack
Without you, without you

Full throttle, full speed ahead
And the world will turn around
It is only you and I
Just try, just try---
