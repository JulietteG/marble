The ugly naked truth:
She starves me of my youth,
And I stand alone until
You catch on.
I swear it's not by choice.
But Ana has this voice,
And it calms me down,
It gives me purpose.

And it's alright,
I'm alright,
I want to be okay.
I've seen it before,
This eyesore; it's me.
Ohh, ohh, ohh, me.

I want out from under
This confining skin
That I so reluc-tantly live in.
My worth is measured solely
According to the scale.
I am heavy, but I feel frail.

And it's alright,
I'm alright,
I want to be okay.
I've seen it before,
This eyesore; it's me.
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohhh.

Me.
Ohh, ohh, ohh,
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
(Me)
Ohh, ohh, ohh,
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
(Me)
Ohh, ohh, ohh,
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
Oh.---Lyrics submitted by neO.
