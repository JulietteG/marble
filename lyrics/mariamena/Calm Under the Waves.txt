I walk barefoot where the water drowns the sand
With you no longer here to hold my hand
I let go
I let go

The ocean makes my swelling heart feel small
With the sounds it makes you wont hear it if I call
I let go
I let go

There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves
As I choose to sink

Your skin protected me from sunbeams
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact
I let go
I let go

You were always there to walk me home
With you not here, the streets I roam
I let go
I let go

There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat passing over there
There's a calm under the waves
As I choose to sink

With your voice in my head
I could float here instead
But there's a calm under the waves
So  I choose to sink

I'm tired now
I'll see you when I wake up
I've heard it's pretty where you are
I let go
I let go---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
