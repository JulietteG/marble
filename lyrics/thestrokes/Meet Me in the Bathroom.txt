When they say,
Promises.
When mean,
Promises.

When they say,
"That's okay..."
"long as we can celebrate."

Ooh! You see
My uncle would say,
"Things would change."
When he's dead,
Meet me in the bathroom.
That's what she said,
"I don't mind..."
"it's true..."

Never was on time,
Yes, I once was mine.
But that was long ago,
And darlin' I don't mind.
Yeah we were just
Two friends in lust,
And baby
That just don't mean much.
You trained me not to love,
After you showed me what is was.

Now she's staring wide-eyed,
Can't close her eyes.

Anywhere is fine,
Just don't waste my time.

Ah! You see
My uncle would say,
"Things would change."
Once he's dead,
Meet me in the bathroom.
That's what she said,
"I don't mind..."
"it's true..."

Never was on time,
Yes, I once was mine.
But that was long ago...
But darlin' I don't mind.
Yeah we were just two fucks
In lust,
And baby,
That just don't mean much.
You trained me not to love,
After you taught me what is was.---
