Hey shady baby Im hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower youre the chosen one

Well your left hands free
And your rights in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun, oh no

I tackle weeds just so the moon buggers nibble
My writers grip ponders close shingle like she on me
(whoa)

Well your left hands free
And your rights in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun, oh no

N-E-O, O-M-G, gee whiz
Girl youre the one for me
Though your mans bigger than I am
Oh my days he disagrees, no
(Speak easy)

Well my left hands free
Well my left hands free
Well my left hands free, oh no

Hey shady baby Im hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower youre the chosen one

Well your left hands free
Well my left hands free
Well my left hands free
Well my left hands free
Well my left hands free
Oh no ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
