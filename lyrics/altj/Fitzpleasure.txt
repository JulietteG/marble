Tra, la, la,
In your snatch fits pleasure, broom-shaped pleasure

Deep greedy and Googling every corner

Dead in the middle
Of the C-O double-M-O-N

Little did I know then
That the Mandela Boys become Mandela Men
Tall woman, pull the pylons down
And wrap them around the necks
Of all the feckless men that queue to be the next

Steepled fingers ring la la la la la la la leaders
Q-queue jumpers rock fist paper scissors, la la la la la la la lingered fluffers
Be quiet
In your hoof lies the heartland
Where we tent for our treasure, pleasure, leisure, leisure
It's all in your eyes
In your snatch fits pleasure, a broom-shaped pleasure

Deep greedy and Googling every corner

Tra, la, la,
Tra, la,
Tra-a, la, la la la la la la la
Oh, blended by the lights ---
