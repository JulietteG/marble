Your sting red full stops my skin, dotted, scratch scratch, now Im bleeding.
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings.
Theres bears in the wood and theyre out to get me,
And Im safe from harm if I stay in this chalet.
And hold me tight and Ill sink in,
Im absorbed in your thinking,

But you dont know.
You-ooooo...
But you dont know.
You-ooooo...

Your sting red full stops my skin, dotted, scratch scratch, now Im bleeding.
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings
For you-oooo...
For you-oooo.......... ---
