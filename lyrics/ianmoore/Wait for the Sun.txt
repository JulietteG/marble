Should we wait for the sun to come?
Well if it never comes,
do we look to walk to places we know we shouldn't be?
Do we count the days?
Do we count the days?
Will it be enough?

If you look for another love
make sure it holds you up
to the bitter bites of the winter wind
when you walk out to the day.
Oh won't you count the ways,
won't you count the ways
I've been good to you?

Oh, my love
don't let it trip you up.
Fill your head with the little things
we don't talk about.
Just give me a sign
and we'll work it out in time.

Oh hello, hello,
da da da da....

So if you think that your heart could bloom,
The swell of bud to burst
To the Dogwoods, and the Dandelions,
to cover us in wine.
Oh, and lend on a scent,
and the thought of spring
finds the citizens again.

Oh, my love
don't let it trip you up.
Fill your head with the little things
we don't talk about.
Just give me a sign
and we'll work it out in time.

Should we wait for the sun to come,
well if it never comes,
Will you hold your heart for someone
you know you'll never see?---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa Thomas.
