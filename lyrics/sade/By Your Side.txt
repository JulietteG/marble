You think I'd leave your side baby 
You know me better than that 
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees 
I wouldn't do that 
I'll tell you you're right when you want 
And if only you could see into me 
Ha ah ah ah ah ah 

Oh when you're cold 
I'll be there 
Hold you tight to me 

When you're on the outside baby and you can't get in 
I will show you you're so much better than you know 
When you're lost and you're alone and you cant get back again 
I will find you darling and i will bring you home 

And if you want to cry 
I am here to dry your eyes 
And in no time 
You'll be fine 

You think I'd leave your side baby 
You know me better than that 
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees 
I wouldn't do that 
I'll tell you you're right when you want 
And if only you could see into me 
Ha ah ah ah ah ah 

Oh when you're cold 
I'll be there 
Hold you tight to me 
When you're low 
I'll be there 
By your side baby 

Oh when you're cold 
I'll be there 
Hold you tight to me 
Oh when you're low 
I'll be there 
By your side baby---
