This may come, this may come as some surprise 
but I miss you 
I could see through, all of your lies 
But I stll miss you 
He takes her love, but it doesn't feel like mine 
He tastes her kiss, her kisses are not wine, they're not mine 
He takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now 
She takes, but surely she doesn't know how 

Is it a crime 
Is it a crime 
That I still want you 
And I want you to want me too 

My love is wider, wider than victoria lake 
My love is taller, taller than the empire state 

It dives and it jumps and it ripples like the deepest ocean 
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back 

Is it a crime 
Is it a crime 
That I still want you 
And I want you to want me too 

My love is wider than victoria lake 
Taller than the empire state 
It dives and it jumps 
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back 

Is it a crime 
Is it a crime 
That I still want you 
And I want you to want me too 

It dives and it jumps 
And it ripples like the deepest Ocean 
I can't give you more than that 
Surely you want me back 

Tell me 
Is it a crime---
