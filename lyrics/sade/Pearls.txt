There is a woman in Somalia 
Scraping for pearls on the roadside 
There's a force stronger than nature 
Keeps her will alive 
That's how she's dying 
She's dying to survive 
Don't know what she's made of 
I would like to be that brave 
She cries to the heaven above 
There is a stone in my heart 
She lives a life she didn't choose 
And it hurts like brand-new shoes 

Hurts like brand-new shoes 

There is a woman in somalia 
The sun gives her no mercy 
The same sky we lay under 
Burns her to the bone 
Long as afternoon shaddows 
It's gonna take her to get home 
Each grain carefully wrapped up 
Pearls for her little girl 

Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

She cries to the heaven above 
There is a stone in my heart 
She lives a life she didn't choose 
And it hurts like brand-new shoes---
