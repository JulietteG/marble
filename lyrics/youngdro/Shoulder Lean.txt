Chorus:
 Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean.
 Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean.

Verse 1:
 Dro...I'm clean in this bitch
now I'm funna shoulder lean in this bitch

I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath the opposite of Primatime Mist

Dro be watchin" Oprah,mac, 9 up ina clip
Triple Black Phantom nigga nah it aint Tip

and i bet my car charge, and i bet my motor clean  
Suicide doors, Brown Rover look like pork n  bean
