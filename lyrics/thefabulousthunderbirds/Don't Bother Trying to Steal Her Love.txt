if my baby smiles at you it's alright you see
shes smiling cuz shes coming home to me
and if her lonely friend looks good to you I dont mind
over a hundred guys like youshell pick me every time
I dont brag and I dont lie its plain to see
Ill do anything for her cuz she means so much to me
And I know our love will go on endlessly
So dont you bother tryin to steal her love from me

Youre just wasting your time if you think while Im away
Shes getting restless and running to you when you make your play
When you think she might sitting home all alone
Shes buying a new tight skirt and sweater to wear when her daddy comes home
I dont brag and I dont lie its plain to see
Ill do anything for her cuz she means so much to me
And I know our love will go on endlessly
So dont you bother tryin to steal her love from me

Well theres guys that she once dated they all say
That she wont settle down on anyway
They think they know what we got going on
But the truth is that they could not be more wrong
I dont brag and I dont lie its plain to see
Ill do anything for her because she means so much to me
And I know our love will go on endlessly
So dont you bother tryin to steal her love from me

No dont you bother tryin to steal her love from me
No dont you bother tryin to steal her love from me---Lyrics submitted by Greg Reinhard.
