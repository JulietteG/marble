And what if I never kiss your lips again 
Or feel the touch of your sweet embrace 
How would I ever go on 
Without you there's no place to belong 

Well someday love is gonna lead you back to me 
But 'til it does I'll have an empty heart 
So I'll just have to believe 
Somewhere out there you thinking of me 

Until the day I'll let you go 
Until we say our next hello 
It's not goodbye 
'Til I see you again 
I'll be right here rememberin' when 
And if time is on our side 
There will be no tears to cry 
On down the road 
There is one thing I can't deny 
It's not goodbye 


You'd think I'd be strong enough to make it through 
And rise above when the rain falls down 
But it's so hard to be strong 
When you've been missin' somebody so long 

It's just a matter of time I'm sure 
But time takes time and I can't hold on 
So won't you try as hard as you can 
To put my broken heart together again 

Until the day I'll let you go 
Until we say our next hello 
It's not goodbye 
'Til I see you again 
I'll be right here rememberin' when 
And if time is on our side 
There will be no tears to cry 
On down the road 
There is one thing I can't deny 
It's not goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Rawan.
