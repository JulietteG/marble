I remind myself in the darkness 
when half the world is awake
and when I can't sleep, I imagine I'm without 
until my eyes start to wake

When I head off for new adventures
and find my feet on new paths
no matter how far away I end up
my heart always wants

In my deepest thought: 
the marrow of my goals
Oh ooooh oh ooooh
Oh oaooh oh oaooh

I remind myself in the darkness 
when half the world is awake
and when I can't sleep I imagine I'm without you
'till my eyes start to wake

In my deepest thought 
the marrow of my goals
All I need is already above me
Things I cannot touch for your to keep

In my deepest call
the marrow of my bones
All my past intentions
I lay them on the altar

Oh ooooh oh ooooh
Oh oaooh oh oaooh

I remind myself in the darkness...---Lyrics submitted by Art Linn.
