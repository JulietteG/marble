It feels a little strange, asking how you've been.
I haven't written in a while, but misery's a funny thing.
I used to lie awake and pray you were the one.
But up on Signal Hill, I'm seeking shelter from the sun.

Chorus:
I can see the world from way up here,
where the air is thin and there is no fear.
Once there stood an army here,
but the army it stood still.
Waiting for a sign up on Signal Hill.

How you feel I cannot tell,
I see only myself in this well.
Deadman's Pond is bottomless they say.
No one knows how many
love lost souls in there lay.

(Chorus)

I lay by this pond holding hearts.
I could have seen this from the start.
Even though it seems you've won,
I know I'll find another one.

(Chorus)

Whose eyes will you be looking through
when this letter gets to you?---Lyrics submitted by Erik.
