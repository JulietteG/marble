(feat. Susan Tedeschi)

If you think I love you, well baby your right
If you think I wanna hug you, well baby your right
I wanna love you, I wanna hug you
Oh cause I need you so bad
Ooh yes I do, oh so c'mon baby baby
Lord it's just me and you now
I said, I wanna hug you, I wanna love you
Oh cause I need you so bad
When I can't get you it makes me so mad

If you think I want you, well baby your right
If you think I want to haunt you, lord baby your right
Oh I wanna love you, I wanna hug ya
Oh cause I, oh yes I, I, I love ya baby
Lord just me and you darling
Oh and everything everything everything gonna be alright
Said it is now
Oh I wanna love you, I wanna hug ya
Oh cause I need you so bad
And oh when I can't get you lord it drives me stone mad

Oh everybody's got the blues
Lord, oh it's giving me to you baby
I believe everything gonna be alright
Oh just one more time one more time
Lord oh baby baby
I wanna love ya, I wanna hug ya
Oh cause I need you so bad
And oh when I can't get you it make me so mad
Oh c'mon now

Oh oh baby baby baby lord
Oh said daddy you and me ooh yes
I wanna love ya, mmmm hug you
Lord I wanna get together and love you
Mmmm---
