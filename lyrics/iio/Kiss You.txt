I'd wake up
and make love
to you if i had you
 I would touch
You so much 
but i'm not allowed to
What i hate,is to wait
But in this case i'm patient
I'm discreet,i'm not weak,
I just need the moment

If i leaned over and tried to kiss you
Would i be wrong after so long to kiss you?
Would you pretend,we're only friends,
if i kissed you?
At least i can dream of you in a scene when i kiss you

.........kiss you..........

At least i can dream of you in a scene when i kiss you

On one hand we are friends
But still my mind,it wonders
THrought the side streets and alleys
I just keep growing fonder

If i leaned over and tried to kiss you
Would i be wrong after so long to kiss you?
Would you pretend,we're only friends,
if i kissed you?
At least i can dream of you in a scene when i kiss you---Lyrics submitted by karkour.
