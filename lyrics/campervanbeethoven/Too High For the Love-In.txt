I was too high for the love-in
I woke in my car at the drive-in
And there was a bird in my kitchen
When I got home

Wasn't my bird, wasn't my pet
It was quite large, it was upset
Black like a raven, awesome like an eagle
Ohh oh let's go!

I was too high for the love-in
Walking barefoot in the Garden of Eden
Stepped on a viper somewhere in Sweden
And I got bit

I met my match, wouldn't let go
It's still attached, stuck to my toe
No shoe will fit, where can I go?
Ohh oh let's go!

Flying ambulance, flying ambulance, flying ambulance, flying ambulance, frying ambulance, flying ambulance

Bring to me the antivenom
And make me a sandwich
Make me a sandwich.

Bring to me the antivenom
And make a sandwich
Make me a sandwich.

Bring to me the antivenom
And make a sandwich
Make me a sandwich.

Bring. To. Me. The. Antivenom.
Make me a sandwich.
Make me a sandwich.---Lyrics submitted by Anonymous.
