Well my baby come back, you know she just got outta jail
Well my baby come back, you know she just got outta jail
She's out three every night, and behaves most the time
Until she grabbed herself her clothes around the morning stand

Well my woman is stong, you know she takes good care of me
Well my baby is strong, you know she takes good care of me
She keeps me in line when she's out doing crime
And she always brings me back a bottle of something to drink

If my baby gets a dollar she gives me twenty cents
If my baby gets a dollar she gives me twenty cents
And though she's gone most the time, you know I really don't mind
Cause if my baby don't treat me well, I'll be unsatisfied---Lyrics submitted by Naeem Yar.
