Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Should have taken warning, it's just
People mourning
Running, hiding, lost
You can't find, find a place to go, so it's

Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh

Should have taken warning it's just
People mourning
Running, hiding, lost
You can't find, find a place to go, so it's

Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh

Someone's taking over
And it look like they're aiming
Right at you
Someone said we'll be dead by morning
Someone cries, leaving

[Repeated:]
Red skies at night

Whoa oh-h-h

Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Red skies at night
Red skies at night
Whoa oh, oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh ---Lyrics submitted by Abner Ramirez.
