There is a song that never will be sung
There is a bell that never will be rung
There is a road that wont be traveled on
Until Jesus comes
And I will be waiting until He comes

There as some things I may not understand
Oh His mystery, His ways, and all His plans
But this I know, someday it will all unfold
But not until Jesus comes
And I will be waiting (yes I will) until Jesus comes

Eyes have not seen and ears have not heard
All the good things God has in store
And neither has it entered into the hearts of man
But hes saving the very best for last, for last

And Ill sing that song that never has been sung
And then Ill ring that bell that never has been rung
Then Ill walk down that road thats never been traveled on
But not until, not until Jesus, not until He comes
But Ill be waiting (yes I will) until Jesus, until He comes

Oh, Ill wait for Him
I wont get discouraged
Im gonna wait for Him
Im gonna carry on
You see, Im gonna wait for Him
No, I wont get weary
Until Jesus, until He comes, until He breaks through the clouds

[vamp]

Im gonna wait, Im gonna wait,
Im gonna wait, Im gonna wait,
Im gonna wait until Jesus comes---Lyrics submitted by Kendrick Koger.
