The blood that Jesus shed for me
Way back on Calvary
The blood that gives me strength
From day to day
It will never lose its power

It soothed my doubts
And it calms my fears
And that same blood
Dries all o' my tears
Oh, the blood that gives me strength
From day to day
It will never lose its power

Oh, I'm glad that it reaches to the highest mountain
And it goes to the lowest valley
Woah, the blood that gives me strength from day to day
It will never lose its power
Woah, I'm glad that it reaches to the highest mountain
Do you believe, that it goes to the lowest valley?
I'm glad, that the blood that gives me strength from day to day
It will never lose its power---
