Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
To the place, where I first received you
Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
Where I first believed

I feel that I'm so far from you, Lord
But still I hear you calling me
Those simple things that I once knew
The memories are drawing me
I must confess, Lord I've been blessed
but yet my soul is not satisfied
Renew my faith, restore my joy
Then dry my weeping eyes

Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
To the place, where I first received you
Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
Where I first believed

I've tried so hard
To make it all alone
I need your help
Just to make it home

Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
To the place, where I first received you
Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
Where I first believed

Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
To the place, where I first received you
Take me back
Take me back, Dear Lord
Where I first believed---Lyrics submitted by John.
