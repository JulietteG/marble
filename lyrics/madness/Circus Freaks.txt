Baby, we are living a life that most could only dream of
And baby, look at the debris of what we have become
Oh can't anybody help us?
Why should anybody care?
I'm so taken in by you
I would follow you oohh to the other side
Our connections are sugar sweet
So strap up, take it all in your stride

Oh can't anybody help us?
Why should anybody care?
Cut throats are going in for the kill
Bumbling flashes snapping at our heels 

We may appear like circus freaks
Juggling with all we have able
But at the end of the day our cards upon the table
Nothing left concealed
Oh, all will be revealed

Baby, we are living a life that most could only imagine
Imagine all the people
And baby, look at the debris of what we have become
Clear all this clutter from the front room dear
Give me a little whistle when the coast is clear

'Cause, we may appear like circus freaks
Balancing upon a tight rope
To a dumb struck helpless crowd
Willing us on, hope against hope
We may appear like circus freaks
Death defying antics down a dead end street
Desperate to avoid the tabloid
Soiled to the souls of our feet 

We may appear like circus freaks
Juggling with all we have able
But at the end of the day our cards upon the table
No more bets

No more bets---Lyrics submitted by Natalie W.
