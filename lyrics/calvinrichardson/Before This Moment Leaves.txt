Tell me where to go
Tell me what I need to say
There's a part of me that's gone
You're the part of me that's gone away, babe

Together were alone
It's like the best of me is gone

Tell me where to go, oh baby
Tell me what I need to say, oh na na
Will you help me with these tears?
I feel like I'm about to break
All the way down, babe

Just tell me that I'm wrong, babe
I want you for the long hall
Right here with me

Tell me where to go
Before this moment leaves---
