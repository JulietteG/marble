When I started drinking, it was just gin
Just one or two every now and then
Soon I didn't know when to say when
That's when it almost did me in
Kinda like you, I had to give that up too

Chorus:
I miss the taste
I miss the high
And the way it made me burn inside
But it knocked me down
On my knees
When I loved it more than it loved me
Kinda like you, I had to give that up too

Finally off the cigarettes
Been three months, I ain't lit one yet
Knew I had to put 'em down
Before the put me in the ground
Kinda like you, I had to give that up too 

Chorus:
I miss the taste
I miss the high
And the way it made me burn inside
But it knocked me down
On my knees
When I loved it more than it loved me
Kinda like you, I had to give that up too

I wish I could have just one or two
But that's just something I can't do
So, I've made my peace with what I am
There's just some things I just can't have
Kinda like you, I had to give that up too---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
