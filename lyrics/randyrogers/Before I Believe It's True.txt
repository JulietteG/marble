I've never seen this place 
but I've been here waitin for you
I've held all of your love forever, tell me you want me to
before I believe it's true, before I believe it's true

Wait just a minute baby, don't make a single move 
prop me up just a little longer
but if I fall, you fall too
before I believe it's true

before  I believe in you and me 
before I let my heart go free 
tell me that you need me like I need you
before I believe it's true, before I believe it's true

I've known for so long now 
how love can change you
baby please confess, love has changed you too
before i believe it's true

before I believe in you and me
before I let my heart go free
tell me that you need me like I need you 
before I believe it's true, before I believe it's true 

before I believe in you and me
before I let my heart go free 
tell me that you want me like I want you 
before you see what no one seen 
before I let my heart go free
tell me that you need me like I need you

before I believe it's true, before I believe it's true---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
