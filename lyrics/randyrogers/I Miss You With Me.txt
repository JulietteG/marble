3 a.m. and I'm all alone, try to call but I'm at your home. Not much has changed here on my end. Sure would be good to see you again. I know we had our fights. Nothing since has felt that right. Lived my life from day to day. If I dont think too much everything is okay. 

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you.. with me.

I still have that same ol' car, still work at that run down bar. Still hang out with that same group of guys, and on Saturday nights, still go that dive. Been two months since I had a drink. Damn good for me, don't you think? Oh, its been a year now since you've gone. Oh I've tried my best, I cant move on.. 

Cause' I miss holding your hand. Miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep. Guess I just miss you with me..

If you give me a second chance, I'll never let you go. Swallowed all my pride and now I got a let you know.. 

I miss holding your hand, miss going on walks, miss being your man. I miss watching you sleep, guess I just miss you.. I guess I miss you.. with me.---Lyrics submitted by courtney.
