All the leaves have turned to rust
The air is getting thin
I can see my breath
The night is rolling in

The sky is grey
Its cold as a stone
Its just the kind of day
I cant stand to be alone

Cause you, youve been on my mind
And I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
Cause I, Im just not the same
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name
But its just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I wasnt thinking about you
When I thought I saw your car
I cant escape you for long
You know I never get too far

Youre everywhere I go
Cause youre everywhere Ive been
Youre everything Ive wanted
And I want you back again

Cause you, youve been on my mind
And I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
Cause I, Im just not the same
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name
But its just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I have to find a way, Thats just how it is
Im stuck here in this place

Cause you, youve been on my mind
And I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
Cause I, Im just not the same
I walk down these streets; I swear I hear your name
But its just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead---Lyrics submitted by veronica.
