These walls, they used to be our home
You and me and everything we had, we had it all
But nothing could compare, who would even dare - I would be amazed if you wanted me to
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you
No, I don't deserve you - All these photographs of the times we had
It kills me to look back knowing how I've changed all that
Why did I change all that - And I would be amazed if you wanted me to 
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you
No, I don't deserve you - I would be amazed if you wanted me to
Stay here one more day
But I don't deserve you (Give up, I don't wanna give up)
On me and you (Give up, I don't wanna give up)
Don't wanna have to - I would be amazed if you wanted me to 
Stay here one more day
'Cause I don't deserve you (Give up, I don't wanna give up)
No, I don't deserve you (Give up, I don't wanna give up)
I don't deserve you (Give up, I don't wanna give up)---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
