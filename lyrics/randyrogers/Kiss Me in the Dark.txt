Sailors sail, cowboys ride, lovers love, when they get the chance
Take it slow, turn down the lights, soft and low let the shadows dance
baby don't hold back 

chorus:
kiss me in the dark, roll me thru the night
hold me like you'll never let me go
hit me with your heart, til the morning light 
let your skin talk to my soul, kiss me in the dark

we'll strip away everything, tonight theres nothing really in our way
ties that bind, the where's and why's take'em off and leave'em all outside
lock it all outside

chorus

Withouit a single word, baby we can say so much
Reveal everything with just one touch

chorus

kiss me in the dark 
yeah---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
