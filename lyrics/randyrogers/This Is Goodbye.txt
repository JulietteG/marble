This is goodbye, the end of you and me
we've set this boat ablaze,and pushed it out to sea
nothing that's on board will survive
this is goodbye......

This is goodbye, not the kind we've had before
we're out of one more try's, there won't be anymore
and all the gray's have turned to black and white's
this is goodbye.......

CHORUS:
This is hard
This is hell
This is pain like I have never felt
This is final, loved has failed
This is walking away from us to save ourselves
This is goodbye.

This is goodbye, in my heart there's no doubt
cause I can feel the broken pieces tryin to cut their way out
and some of them I know I'll never find
This is goodbye.....

CHORUS:
This is hard
This is hell
This is pain like I have never felt
This is final, love has failed
This is walking away from us to save ourselves
This is goodbye.....

This is final, love has failed
This is walking away from us to save ourselves
This is goodbye....

This is goodbye....---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
