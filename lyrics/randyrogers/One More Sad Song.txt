We're on a road to nowhere,
I don't know how we got there;
Some wrong turn somewhere.
Maybe i just stopped trying;
There's just no justifying and now we're dying!

Chorus:
I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but i got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You & me baby will end up being...One more sad song

How will i live without you?
Who will i be in these shoes?
Once i've lost all that i can lose
Even if you forgave me
I don't know if i could make it
But that's our whole problem maybe

Chorus:
I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but i got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You & me baby will end up being...One more sad song

(tag) about someone who had it all let it all go wrong

Chorus:
I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but i got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You & me baby will end up being...One more sad song

Chorus:
I can tell which way that you're leaning
Don't know what it is but i got a feelin'
You're almost all gone
I'm scared that when you start believing
You & me baby will end up being...One more sad song---
