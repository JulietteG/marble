There's something about this time of day
The sun goes home and the shadows fade
And all my thoughts come out to play
I count 'em one by one, and I come undone

When the lights the turn on in the streets tonight
And the moon hangs low, in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why
I'm a million miles away, just out here spinning around
Waiting to touch back down, like a satellite
Like a satellite

Maybe if I could fall asleep
I'll meet you somewhere in my dreams
Promise that you'll look for me
I'll be the one with the empty cup
But then I'll wake up

When the lights turn on in the streets tonight
And the moon hangs low, in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why
I'm a million miles away, just out here spinning around
Waiting to touch back down, like a satellite

I feel like I'm lost out here
Floating around in the atmosphere

When the lights turn on in the streets tonight
And the moon hangs low, in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why
I'm a million miles away

When the lights turn on in the streets tonight
And the moon hangs low, in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why
I'm a million miles away, just out here spinning around
Waiting to touch back down, like a satellite
Like a satellite

When the lights come on in the street tonight
I'll be your satellite---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
