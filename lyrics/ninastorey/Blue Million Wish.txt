Dear G-d, I'm afraid of so much terrible thoughts explode in my touch.
And inside my head I'm demonically possessed, 'cause I see 
fairies with swords slicing villains like bread.

Chorus
I'm weak and I'm proud. I'm tired and insecure.
Stuffing my face like there isn't a cure for
A blue million wish and a blue million curse.
And a blue million blessing, who could rehearse
A moment in time when my blue million hits?
Let's just hope I'm facing in the right direction.

I can handle the fear and the pain and I can handle losing again 
and I'll even handle walking alone but I cannot handle
the weight that it holds.

Chorus

How can I stay strong when my whole world is strung along
by candy coated beads of satiation.
To have is to hold in vain.
To share is to fold the rain.
To care is to watch them crumble away.
I crumble away.

Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
