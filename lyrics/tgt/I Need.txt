[Verse 1: Tank]
I hope you see my heart from here,
And I hope that this will make us strong,
I hope the truth is made you clear,
And I hope that we can learn and move on,
This time the stakes are way too high,
I see what Im about to lose,
Its time to let the old me die,
Mistakes or love I gotta choose.

I know I said that I was gonna change a long time ago,
Thats what I said (I said, I said),
Guess it takes some dirt in order for a real man to grow.

[Hook:]
Now I know,
It aint ever worth your heart,
And it aint ever worth your tears,
And it aint ever worth those scars that might not heal,
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need (now my love), I need (now I know), I need.

[Verse 2: Tyrese]
Tired of being in the same place,
I done ran out of ways to say Im sorry,
Instead of running a judge on the same case,
Tired of being dead last in the same race,
Ill admit it,
Probably shouldve did it,
Cause its breaking down,
I dont know how to fix it,
Weve been here before,
Dont know how to act,
If I let you walk out the door,
I know you aint coming back baby.

I know I said that I was gonna change a long time ago,
Thats what I said (I said, I said),
Guess it takes some dirt in order for a real man to grow.

[Hook:]
Now I know,
It aint ever worth your heart,
And it aint ever worth your tears,
And it aint ever worth those scars that might not heal,
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need (now my love), I need (now I know), I need.

[Verse 3: Ginuwine]
I cant let you go,
Im in love,
I know the things I did was wrong,
Please girl let me make it up,
And your the best Ive ever had,
Baby youre all that I need,
You gave me everything,
And I took it for granted,
So can we go (where we can be all this in love)
Somewhere way too far from giving up (if wrong is wrong),
If wrong is all Ive never been,
But all I want is love again (with you, you, you, you),
And baby I know.

[Hook]
Now I know,
It aint ever worth your heart,
And it aint ever worth your tears,
And it aint ever worth those scars that might not heal,
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need, I need, I need (you),
I need (now my love), I need (now I know), I need. ---
