Wonderful, merciful savior,
Precious redeemer and friend,
Who would have thought that a lamb could rescue the souls of men,
Oh you rescue the souls of men.

Counselor, comforter, keeper,
Spirit we long to embrace,
You offer hope when our hearts have hopelessly lost our way,
Oh weve hopelessly lost our way.

You are the one that we praise,
You are the one we adore,
You give the healing and grace our hearts always hunger for,
Oh our hearts always hunger for.

Almighty, infinite father,
Faithfully loving your own,
Here in our weakness you find us falling before your throne,
Oh were falling before your throne.

You are the one that we praise, 
You are the one we adore,
You give the healing and grace our hearts always hunger for,
Oh our hearts always hunger for.

You are the one that we praise, 
You are the one we adore,
You give the healing and grace our hearts always hunger for,
Oh our hearts always hunger for.---Lyrics submitted by Patricia Richard Husband.
