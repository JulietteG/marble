In prisoners chains
with bleeding stripes
Paul and silas ,prayed
that night, and in their pain
began to see,
their chains were loosed and
they were free.

chorus:
I bless your name,
I bless your name,
I give you honor give you 
praise, you are the life,  the truth,
the way,I bless your name,
I bless your name.

some midnight hour,
if you should find,
your in a prison in your life
reach out and pray,
defy those chains, and
they will fall, in jesus name

chorus2
we bless your name,
we bless your name,
we give you honor, we give you
praise
you are the life the truth, the way,
we bless your name 
we bless your name---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
