Hail, hail to the newborn King
Let our voices sing Him our praises
Hail, hail to the guiding light
That brought us tonight to our Savior

Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah

Come now, let it shine so bright
To the knowing light of the stable
Kneel close to the child so dear
Cast aside your fear and be thankful---Lyrics submitted by Mark Tenerife.
