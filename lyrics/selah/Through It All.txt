I've had many tears and sorrows
I've got questions for tommorrow
there've been times 
I didn't know right from wrong
But in every situation
God gave blessed consolation
that my trials only come to make me strong

I've been to a lot of places
Seen so many faces but,
There's been times 
I felt so all alone

But in that lonely hour
In that precious lonely hour
Jesus let me know that 
I was his own

Through it all
Through it all
I've learnt to trust in Jesus
I've learnt to trust in God
Through it all
Through it all
I've learnt to depend 
Upon His word

So I thank God for the mountains
I thank Him for the valleys
I thank Him for the storms He's brought me through
If never had a problem
I wouldn't know that He could solve them
I wouldn't know what faith in His word could do

Through it all
Through it all
I've learnt to trust in Jesus
I've learnt to trust in God
Through it all
Through it all
I've learnt to depend 
Upon His word---Lyrics submitted by kennedy.
