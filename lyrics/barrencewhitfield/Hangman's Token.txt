Well, I try not to think about it
Cos I'm frustrated to no end
And I feel so agitated
At a loss to comprehend.
Found myself deep inside the ocean
On the shore stood my only friend
Went to wade in the shallow water
And sank straight to the bottom again.

(chorus)
Oaths been broken, catchwords spoken, floor swings open
Pray for an omen, can't make the rope bend, hangman's token.

Now some folks appear to be so helpless
Not a penny to their name
Get accused by them in power
It's a dirty lowdown shame
See that rich man in his mansion
While the poor are made to live in tents
Seems they're only there for the blaming
And it just doesn't make no sense.

(chorus)

Miseries, I tell the bees- what more can I do?
Trembling knees, I aim to please- what more can I do?
A televised pack of lies- what more can I do?

Well, Saint Brigit took her tablet
Left it buried in the snow
And I dug all day just to read it
Now I wish that I didn't know
And they burned down the church this morning
See the smoke, it's a-hanging low
And the sacristy's a cinder
But the priest salvaged all the dough.

(chorus)

Mysteries, I tell the bees- what more can I do?---Lyrics submitted by Head of Manby.
