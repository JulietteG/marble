He was a five-foot nine-inch swarmer
He was a very stout young man
He fought from Flyweight up to Heavy
He ate straight from the frying pan.
He was the famous Frisco fat boy
The first to beat Jack Dempsey twice
His name was Battling Willie Meehan
His critics weren't very nice
He ate a lot of rice...

That's Willie Meehan.

Fat little funny little Willie
The more he fought the more he ate
Although he never did no training
He ate his way to Heavyweight
Wild swing, belated rushes
Counter-punching from inside
You know he threw a lot of leather
He often threw them very wide...

That's Willie Meehan.

September thirteen, nineteen eighteen
And Dempsey lost his last that night
Against the body blows of Willie
The fat King of the Four-Round Fight...

That's Willie Meehan.---Lyrics submitted by Head of Manby.
