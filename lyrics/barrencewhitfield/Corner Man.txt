You know she got a Sunday punch
You know you got to face the feint
Kiss her hand or kiss the canvas
And love her through the standing eight.

I'm the corner man
I'll show you what you're doing wrong, boy, yes I can
Cutman stop the cut!
I'll teach you how to go the distance
Before you're on the ropes again.

Boy, she beat you up
Yeah, she knocked you down
If you want to go off to Queer Street
Don't wait for that bell to sound.

I'm the corner man
I don't give up any water for tomato cans
Cutman stop the cut!
Send her to the neutral corner
Before you're on the ropes again.

You know she's got a Sunday punch
Boy, you better stay awake
Kiss her ass or kiss the canvas
You know you're gonna face the fake.

I'm the corner man
I'll show you what you're doing wrong, boy, yes I can
Cutman stop the cut!
I'll teach you how to go the distance long before
You've fallen through the ropes again.---Lyrics submitted by Head of Manby.
