Somewhere in my lifetime
You've been here with me
Oh, so close to me
Somewhere in my lifetime

Somewhere in my lifetime
I have kissed your lips
Lips so tenderly
They've been kissing me

They were visions of so long ago
You know memories come and go
So they say
People say, yes, they do

Let visions of what
Of what will be
Somewhere in my lifetime
It was you and me, you and me

Somewhere in my lonely dreams
You've been here with me
Oh, so close to me
And I've been loving you
Somewhere in my lifetime

Somewhere in my lifetime
Somewhere in my lifetime
It was you and me---Lyrics submitted by Delores Miller.
