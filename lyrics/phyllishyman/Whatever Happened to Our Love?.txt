when you and i were introduced
it never occured to me,
that one day i would fall inlove
i knew you were nice
but i didn't think twice
until you rang my phone
and you said you wanted us to be alone..alone..

so, i agree to go out with you
and treat me like a queen
i've got to say i had a wonderful time
ohh and the very next day
you sent me flowers 
we talked on the phone for hours and hours
you was so sure 
you made me believed we had a chance

whatever happened to our love?
how could it happened when you were so sure
you made me want you,made me need you
feel so deep inlove with you
look at me now 
whatever happened to our love?

now i'm starting out all over again
and it's all because of you
why did you come around?
just to play with my heart
ohh i blame it on me
i should've known better
it's gonna take time to get myself together
you were so sure 
you made me believed we had a chance

whatever happened to our love?
how could it happened?
when you were so sure
you were persistent
you were consistent
feel so deep inlove with you
look at me now
whatever happened..
look at me now 
whatever happened..
look at me now
whatever happened..
to our love....---Lyrics submitted by rachelle.
