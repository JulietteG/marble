I would breathe for 
I could breathe for you 
If you only let me try 
I would cry for 
I would die for you 
If you only let me say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Mmmm 

We watched 'em grow 
We watched 'em rise 
We watched 'em change 
Right before our very eyes 
And different ways 
Some goin' that way 
Some comin' from here 
Others have just arrived 
Just arrived 
Just arrived 
Oooh 

I've watched you grow 
You're the most beautiful 
Thing I ever seen 
You meant my world 
Each day 
You're wonderful 
No matter how down you get 
You're wonderful 
No matter how broken you feel 
You're wonderful 
Oh oh 

[Solo] 

I could breathe for 
I would breathe for you 
If you only let me try 
I would cry for 
I would die for you 
If you only let me say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Mmmm mmm---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
