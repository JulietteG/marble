Tonight I'm gonna throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna live like my last day
It makes me wanna say...

When you're around I can tell
I'm about to lose myself
I'm about to lose myself
Cuaght up in the moment again
Boy you take my breath away
Boy you take my breath away

I don't care if people wanna say
Stop and stare
We'll just pretend that no one's there
They'll fade away
Boy you make me wanna say wanna say

Tonight I'm gonna throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna live like my last day
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...

From here on out we'll live out loud
You and me against the world
You and me against the world
Don't matter how things turn out
Baby we're together now
Baby we're together now

I don't care if people wanna say
Stop and stare
We'll just pretend that no one's there
They'll fade away
Boy you make me wanna say wanna say

Tonight I'm gonna throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna live like my last day
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...
Ya Ya Ya
It makes me wanna say...

Tonight I'm gonna throw my past away
Tonight I'm gonna live like my last day
It makes me wanna say...---
