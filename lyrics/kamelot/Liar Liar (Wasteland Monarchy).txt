Would you pray if said you were dying
Would you be a little stronger
Or fall down on your knees
Would you stay with me
If you knew that I was lying
Would you walk away
Or turn the other cheek

I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The nature of a truly desperate heart
Give me something real
That I can truly feel
Liar liar on the wall

Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy
Liar liar
Tell me what you see...

Now I'm here and my pain is my companion
Now I know it wasn't meant to heal... the cut
Is way too deep
No more wasted years of sacrificial bleeding
I'm the master of the war inside me

But still... I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The yearning of an undiscovered soul
Give me something real
So that I can truly feel
Liar liar on the wall

Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a Monarchy
Liar liar...
Tell me what you see...

I shine when the sun is down
And carry this heavy crown
I won't compromise
Release me
What we're looking for
Liar liar on the wall

Mirror mirror in the dark
Tell us what we are looking for
Make us see the truth
Liar liar on the wall

Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy
Liar liar...
Tell me what you see...---
