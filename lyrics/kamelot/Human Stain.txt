See the cemetery sky
Carmine red and deep
Watch the oceans rising high
It's the human stain

Talk about the growing hunger
Ask why with deep concern
Don't you think
The human race is ceaselessly vain

But it hurts to be alive my friend
In this silent tide we're driftwood passing by
Don't you wish you were a child again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more

Hear the ticking of a clock
The sound of life itself
No one really wants to die
To save the world

Tell me that you're torn asunder
From how we fail to learn
And tell me
As the earth goes under
Where's your anger now

So it hurts to be alive my friend
In this masquerade where all one day must die
Don't you wish you were unborn again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more

Tic toc
The ticking that could tear asunder
The beating from a heart of stone
The loss of your divine prosperity

Cause it costs to be alive my friend
And this life that someone merely gave to you
That's the price you pay
Minute by minute
You beg for a minute more---Lyrics submitted by NatetheGreat.
