I am your God
Tell me what's on your mind
My demons are haunting me
Eating me alive
I fear the unknown
The darkness before me
Will we ever start anew
Wait and you will see...

Here's to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here's to the fall
Here's to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night

When I'm weak in my faith
Will you still believe in me?
My cynical imagery
Feeds my disbelief
And when I'm lost in the dark
Will you still save me?
God why won't you answer me...
What is left to see?

Here's to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here's to the fall
Here's to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night

Help me to see
Through your masquerade like
Perfect disguise
Open my eyes
Help me to see
Here's to the coming fall...

Here's to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here's to the fall
Here's to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
May our souls survive...---
