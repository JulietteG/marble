Gravity is pulling me
And I don't really wanna be
A child of desolation any more
My inner world is quaking
So tired of my trivial self
A paradise corrupted to the core
Standing on the edge...

Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
It's time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse

Always know that you are not alone...
Take my hand
My gutterchild adventure
You are not alone
I'll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, don't be afraid
You're not alone...

Tumbling in the multitude
On our way to new horizons
Drowning in a mass of refugees
Liberation in demise
Revolution in disguise
Failing to survive these battlefields
We're standing on the edge

Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
It's time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse

Always know that you are not alone
Take my hand
My gutterchild adventure
You are not alone
I'll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, don't be afraid
You're not alone...

You are not alone...
My gutterchild adventure
You are not alone
I'll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Cause you are not alone
Take my hand
My gutterchild adventure
I'll take you to a place where lovers leap
Now close your eyes, don't be afraid
You're not alone...---
