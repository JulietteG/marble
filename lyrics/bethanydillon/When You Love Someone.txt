This morning it was a fight to get up 
Those words still ringin in my head
Never felt like such a fool in front of anyone
I guess thats what you do when you love someone
Thats what you do when you love someone

I was in Nashville drivin home 
I wish Id been in the passengers seat
I just needed you to know Im comin undone,
Thats what you do when you love someone,
Yeah, thats what you do when you love someone

If I fall, ye-eah-eah
Ill try a little harder and get ba-ack up
Please stay by me love
Thats what you do when you love someone
Thats what you do when you love someone

Just, give me time if you need more
Theres no way youd ever really know 
How to protect yourself or predict the outcome 
But you do anything when you love someone
You do anything when you love someone

If I fall, ye-eah-eah
Ill try a little harder and get ba-ack up
Please stay by me love
Thats what you do when you love someone
Thats what you do when you love someone

I just hung up the phone
Youve got a way of changin my day 
And you, proved me wrong, I was convinced it was love
Yeah thats what you do when you love someone
Yeah thats what you do when you love someone

If I fall, ye-eah-eah
Ill try a little harder and get ba-ack up
Please stay by me love
Thats what you do when you love someone
If I fall, (yeah) ye-eah-eah
Ill try a little harder and get ba-ack up
Please stay by me love
Thats what you do when you love someone
Thats what you do when you love someone
Yeah thats what you do when you love someone---Lyrics submitted by Rebekah.
