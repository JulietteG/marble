You broke the silence
A break in the clouds
A ray of hope in the darkness
You dusted off the steeples
Places full of fear
Full of never ending judgment

What is love without much risk?
You were a man of great sorrow
The world that You created
Kept You at a distance
You weren't recognizable

You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible

You bridged the gap
You tore the veil
Almighty God in the flesh
All the plans and schemes
Against Your love would fall
In the light of Your obedience

You're the hero
We've been waiting for
You have done the impossible

A babe cries in the night
The earth shook in awe
The echos of a man's cries
The curse undone
The hero has won---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
