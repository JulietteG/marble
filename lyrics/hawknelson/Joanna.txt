Joanna sits on her porch
What am I to do 
I once was her boy 
but now we're done 
I'm feeling blue
I'm getting out of this town
Starbucks drive through
I reach for my cash and only find pictures of you 

Chorus:
Should I come 
Or should I run
turn around or just move on 
either choice I make I'm scared I'll still be wrong
Take take take until I just can't take it from you (joanna)
fake fake fake until I just can't make it with you (joanna)
say goodbye a hundred time we'll never see it through 
the hardest way to say Joanna I need you 

Took a trip out west with a Saskatoon
to clear all the thoughts in my head
the only thoughts I knew
turned on the radio 
silly thing to do
cause all the songs I hear remind my of you

[chorus]

Take take take until I just can't take it with you (joanna)
fake fake fake until I just can't make it with you (joanna)
say goodbye a hundred time we'll never see it through 
the hardest way to say Joanna I need you 
I need you 
I need you 

They say that love is more than feeling but you gotta hear me out
Take take take until I just can't take it from you (joanna)
fake fake fake until I just can't make it with you (joanna)
say goodbye a hundred time we'll never see it through 
the hardest way to say Joanna
The hardest way to say Joanna I need you
