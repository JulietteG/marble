I walk the line 
Leave it all behind 
I've been waiting forever 
Lets go back in time 
When I could read your mind 
Still I've been waiting 

It took the seasons going by 
To know its not my fault 

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest 
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted 
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter 
Tried to be everything but you 

Its been so long 
Since you've been home 
I used to wait up forever 
I used to say a prayer 
Wishing you were there 
And I'm still waiting 

You told me once 
You'd show up 
But I fell for that 
Before I fell to pieces 
Then I woke up 
To no one, 
Just a picture of Jesus 
And a house left in pieces 


It took the seasons going by 
To know its not my fault 

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest 
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted 
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter 
Tried to be everything but you 

I wanted you 
I need you 
I want to believe you 
I wanted you 
I need you 
I want to believe you

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest 
tried to be everything but you 

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest 
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted 
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter 
Tried to be everything but you---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
