He was a simple boy 
He just like to have fun
He never wanted to be 
Just like his dad was 

He was a dreamer
But he had never had none
Who made the most of his life
But never had one 

Chorus:
Don't you know that 
there's more to than 
what we thought cause  
we would never listen 
we've heard it all before 
but we missed it 
When all we needed was a head on collision

nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah x2

He was a single boy 
He could never slow down 
He always wanted to leave 
But didn't know how
 He was a dreamer 
Who seemed to never break ground 
Who spent most of his life in a small town

Daddy told she could never have 
a late night out with her man
and she sits crying by the window
everytime she gets another A
She makes it another day 
and it's just that simple 

[chorus]

Let's go back to the days
when we young and not restless 
and we still believed 
and had not built our defenses 
I'll tell you one thing for sure 
until we make a decision
we'll never take this world 
unless we make a head on collision

Here we come now
make'em come down
make'em run now 
on to the next town 

here we come now
let's make'em run now
no time to fake now 
everything breaks down x2

Don't you know that there's more to this in life x2---Lyrics submitted by Dawnn.
