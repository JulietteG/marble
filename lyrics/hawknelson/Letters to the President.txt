When we were younger we used to sit on my porch 
And talk smack about girls and professional sports 
Theres a lot of things I wanted to say 
But never got a chance to find a way 
(One) take a good look at all of our high schools 
this is the first reason that I want to write you 
it must be tough when society is messed up 
Gotta save money, please dont take it out on us 
Do they even know? Do they even know? 
If I was brave Id write a letter to the president 
And have him pass it to the leaders of our parliament 
But for now I wont say nothing 
From all the kids who would stand in my residence 
Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence 
But for now I wont say nothing 
Now that were older a brand new story unfolds 
About God and the laws that weve always been told 
And theres a lot of things I wanted to say 
But never got a chance to find a way 
Same-sex marriage in a state where they dont care 
Murder is wrong but the jail times not fair 
Not to mention date rape, felony and car theft 
Break it down and tell me what weve got left 
Do they even know? Do they even know? 
If I was brave Id write a letter to the president 
And have him pass it to the leaders of our parliament 
But for now I wont say nothing 
From all the kids who would stand in my residence 
Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence 
As for now Ill start with something 
Take a good look at Tommy, hes a track star 
Good role model, had a chance to go real far 
Then the school made a budget-cut 
Cut out the track team 
Now instead Tommy is a crack head 
Same-sex marriage in a state where they dont care 
Murder is wrong but the jail times notfair 
Not to mention date rape, felony, and car theft 
Break it down and tell me what weve got left 
If I was brave Id write a letter to the president 
And have him pass it to the leaders of our parliament 
But for now I wont say nothing 
From all the kids who would stand in my residence 
Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence 
As for now Ill start with something 
As for now Ill start with something---Lyrics submitted by talynn.
