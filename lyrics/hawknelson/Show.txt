Uh-uh-everwhere I go
it's all been taken
Pick me up a book about new sensations
T-t-take me to a place
with no frustration
Better back it up before I lose my patience

Here we go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn on your radio
whoaoh
Let's go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn up your radio

C-c-call me on the phone
or two way pager
Won't be comin' home so see ya later
You can keep your cause
and your jet-black ?
Won't see me again until next summer

Here we go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn on your radio
whoaoh
Let's go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn up your radio

C'mon if you're feelin', if you're feelin' alright [repeat many times]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Here we go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn on your radio
whoaoh
Let's go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn up your radio

C'mon if you're feelin', if you're feelin' alright [repeat til end...]

Here we go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn on your radio
whoaoh
Let's go
Let's take 'em to the show whoaoh
C'mon, turn up your radio---Lyrics submitted by mark.
