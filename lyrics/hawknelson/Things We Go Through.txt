billy made a promise
but didn't end though
carrie had a dream 
but she threw it out the window
kevin met a nice girl
who broke his heart and
his friends never told him 
but they knew it from the start and

these are the things we go through
let's take control and be ourselves
let's not waste time wondering about
how we're gonna make it out  

wake up everyone around you
let's rock until the clock strikes 2
stand up for what you believe and shout too
here's another song from the youth that's around you

kyle's parents split up
he thinks it's his fault
little does he know 
that the time was difficult
angry 'cause she left home, 
said she'd had enough
all she really wanted was
somebody else there to love
she's all alone again
it's the same old argument
and she needs a helpling hand 
to help her find the truth

these are the things we go through
let's take control and be ourselves
let's not waste time wondering about
how we're gonna make it out  

wake up everyone around you
let's rock until the clock strikes 2
stand up for what you believe and shout too
here's another song from the youth that's around you

save me, i'm all alone
as i'm coming to the surface
tell me, i've got to know
does my meaning have a purpose
show me, i'm far from home
lost with no sense of direction
take me to your throne
