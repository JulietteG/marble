From Underneath I wanted you
 To see the first thing I ever poured my heart into
 You'll never know the pain that I've been through
 I'm not so sure you'll ever know
 And so I'll make you understand the words that built my life
 Were not from you, but from my father's hand

 Do you remember that cold day in December
 Leaving everything you knew behind
 I may never know how it feels to stand beside you(Or take your hand) 
 When I need some direction
 And I may never know what it's like to see you smile (back at me)
 Or know you'd be proud of me

 From underneath I promise to erase the past
 And let my heart forgive the former you
 Replace the dark of old and start brand new
 I never thought I'd see the day
 I walk toward the end of life and turn the other way
 I'm reaching out to take my Father's hand

 Do you remember that cold day in December
 Leaving everything you knew behind
 I may never know how it feels to stand beside you(Or take your hand) 
 When I need some direction
 And I may never know what it's like to see you smile  (back at me)
 Or know you'd be proud of me---Lyrics submitted by Jesse Greene.
