its a long and lonley road
its a long and lonley road
i took a walk down a country road
i know this might sound dumb
maybe
but i was all alone
if you think that im going somewhere
take my hand ill lead you there
dont wanna have to call you up from a pay phone
its a long and lonely road
its a long and lonely road
if you dont like it then you dont take it
its a long and lonely road
i took a walk down a country road
i know this might sound dumb
maybe
but i was all alone
if you think im going somewhere
take my hand ill lead you there
dont wanna have to call you up from a pay phone
its a lond and lonely road
its a long and lonely road
if you dont like it then please dont take it
its a long and lonely road
i know its so hard for you and i to be apart
im slowly fading you're my lady
that keeps me moving on on
its a long and lonely road
its a long and lonely road
if you dont like it please dont take it
its a long and lonely road

honest promise you will be missed (x6)---Lyrics submitted by Jayk.
