Its coming in when it gets dark
Its not the shame, its not a broken heart
Its not a dripping tap in me
Why does it bother, why does it bother me?

The night was never meant to shine
But I keep hanging on to the times we set fire-

You wont believe me, I keep this little life of mine
You couldnt see me, how do you know whats left behind?
Its not that bad, its not that kind

I hardly notice through the day
On silent streets I hear it anyway
Id make it stop oh if I could
Its just a feeling, its not the love you took

The daytime wasnt made to hide
And I keep hanging on to the times we set fire  to the night

You wont believe me, I keep this little life of mine
You couldnt see me, how do you know whats left behind?
Its not that bad, its not that kind

You wont believe me, I keep this little life of mine
You couldnt see me, how do you know whats left behind?
Its not that bad, its not that kind---Lyrics submitted by Marc in Hamburg.
