I don't know which way the river bends
but i'll follow until the bitter end
across that ocean, bent and broken
just to find you my friend

Sometimes all the wheels can just fall right off
The price is to high to afford the cost
But theirs no need to feel like all is lost

I'll take you home
Right through the storm to your front door
You're not alone you will never have to fear cause
I will always be right here with you (you, you)
I will always be right here with you

You can try
To erase me from the troubled mind
but I won't leave, i'll be right by your side
every time you try to say goodbye to me

Sometimes all the wheels can just fall right off
Sometimes everything you've got is not enough
but theirs no need to feel like all is lost

I'll take you home
Right through the storm to your front door
You're not alone you will never have to fear cause
I will always be right here with you (you, you)
I will always be right here with you

Sometimes all the wheels can just fall right off
its hard to get it going when the going gets tough
But theirs no need to feel like all is lost

I'll take you home
Right through the storm to your front door

I'll take you home
Right through the storm to your front door

You're not alone you will never have to fear cause
I will always be right here with you (you, you)
I will always be right here with you (you, you)
I will always be right here with you---
