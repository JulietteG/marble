Maybe I'm wrong
To want so much 
I feel those kisses falling 
Oh, it's never enough 
Maybe it's a fool 
Who turns to dust 
Never knowing how to hold onto 
Fearing who they love 
Fearing how they love 

Just tell me that it's something new 
A place to lose myself and not feel used 
That's just the old sound 
That's just the sound of the rain 
But it's not coming down again 

Now you've been down 
And hurt inside 
To feel that no-one's waiting 
And your heart's open wide 
But the day isn't long 
And there's so much to live 
Don't tell me how your faith is near to broken 
So much to give 
So much to live 

Just tell me that it's something true 
A place to lose my head and not feel used 
That's just the old sound 
That's just the sound of the rain
But it's not coming down again 
I feel my body moving, 
I feel the sun on my face I do 
I feel my world is changing, 
I feel the sun on my face I do
'Cause baby I'm no-one's fool, 
Baby I'm no-one's fool 
Baby I'm no-one's fool 

Just tell me that it's something new 
A place to lose myself and not feel used 
That's just the old sound 
That's just the sound of the rain 
But it's not coming down again 
Not coming down again
Not coming down again
Not coming down again
