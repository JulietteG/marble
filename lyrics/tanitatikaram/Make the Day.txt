if i could make the day
adjust to where i've been
this holding you close
like a new beginning
if i could say the words
that make you come to me
i'd talk endlessly
i'd talk endlessly

if i can make the sun
shine on everything we do
i'm hoping that you see
what you mean to me
if i can say the words
and own my tenderness
i'd talk endlessly
i'd talk endlessly

you came around last night
you came 'round just in time
and i never thought that i'd be the one
be the one to change your mind

if i could make believe
bring a smile to everyone
by holding you closely
'til the morning comes
if i can find a way
to be free of everything
i'd talk endlessly
i'd talk endlessly

you never know what you'll find
just too scared to open your eyes
and i never thought that i'd be the one
be the one to change your mind---Lyrics submitted by natalie gaffar.
