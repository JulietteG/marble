You say you cant go back again
Looking out at strangers, trying to find a friend
And hopely it will end, this wandering
Now you cant, go back
And pray that people change
Wholl let all the promises for thru our hands
Little lies like sand, until the end
Now you cant go back
You cant go back, again
And pray that people change.

I know the chance will come again
Anyone can see, when you need a friend
Youre a lot like me, when you pretend
But you cant go back
You cant go back
But you cant go back again
And pray that people change.---Lyrics submitted by Javier Lobo.
