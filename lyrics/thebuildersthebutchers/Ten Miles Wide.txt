You got to bury, bury, bury your dyin' mother.
Bury your dyin' mother in the ground, ground, ground.
Because one day (one day) one day (one day)
One day she'll be singin' up in the sky, sky, sky.

Well one day, your sister, (sister) one day your baby sister
One day your sister, she went to the river and drowned, drowned, drowned.
But one day (one day) one day,
One day she'll be dancin' up in the sky, sky, sky.

Well your father, he was lonely, your father was a drunk and lonely.
Your father was a drunk and lonely, said he had a terrible mouth.
But one day, one day,
He'll be dancin' with the devil down below.

Between the prophet, and the Judas,
There runs a river murky.
There runs a river murky, said it's over ten miles wide.
And we could meet out in the middle
And we could swim on up that river 'til we die, die, die.---Lyrics submitted by B.
