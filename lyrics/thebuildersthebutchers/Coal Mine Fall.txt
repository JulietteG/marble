There was a black heart beatin' in a cowboy's chest
When the sun had cooked him through
And the tracks were tears on a cigarette
When the sky had opened up again
Looked like midnight, it was noon.

Our true love'll leave you on your knees in the rain.
Our true love will leave you in the rain.
Our true love'll leave you on your knees in the rain.
Our true love will leave you in the rain.

There was a black bird sittin' on top of the wire
And the coal made the sky turn gray
When the saints become the beggars
And they live down among the fray
And they dream of a golden day.

There was a man on fire in the back of the church
Who speaks in a sorry tone
Not because his lover died
But she left him all alone
To sing with the holy stones.

Our true love'll leave you on your knees in the rain.
Our true love will leave you in the rain.
Our true love'll leave you on your knees in the rain.
Our true love will leave you in the rain.

I been breakin' down these ol' bones
I been waitin' for the fever to break
Does your house look like a home
When it's slidin' on into the lake?

And when the darkness falls
Oh, you'll be ridin' on a southbound train
And cut your coal to burn
And fill your heart with flame

Our true love'll leave you on your knees in the rain.
Our true love will leave you in the rain.
Our true love'll leave you on your knees in the rain.
Our true love will leave you in the rain.

There was a black heart beatin' in a cowboy's chest
If he even had a heart at all
His mother died when he was born
His daddy in a coal mine fall
There's blood on the coal mine wall---Lyrics submitted by B.
