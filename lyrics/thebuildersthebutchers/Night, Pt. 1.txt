Oh, the night (yes, the night)
It comes crawlin' in.
It comes crawlin' in, oh it comes crawlin' in.
Well, the night (yes, the night)
It comes crawlin' in.
The night-time, it comes crawlin' in.

I'm gonna take your heart, and put it in my pocket.
Your heart is in my pocket, and there's a light inside my hand.
I'm gonna take your heart, and put it in my pocket,
When the night-time, it comes crawlin' in.

Well, the night (yes, the night)
It comes crawlin' in.
It comes crawlin' in, oh it comes crawlin' in.
Well, the night (the funky night)
It comes crawlin' in.
The night-time, it comes crawlin' in.

I'm gonna take your heart, and put it in my pocket.
Your heart is in my pocket, and there's a light inside my hand.
I'm gonna take your heart, and put it in my pocket,
When the night-time, it comes crawlin' in.---Lyrics submitted by B.
