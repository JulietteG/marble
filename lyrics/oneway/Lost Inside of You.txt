Every day my need grows stronger for you
Your love became a means of survival
It's gone too far for me to change my mind
I'm drifting out on your love
My life would end if we should part

(CHORUS)
I'm lost  inside of you
Girl I don't know what to do
But love you more

Everyday my need grows stronger for you
Your love became a means of survival
It's gone too far for me to change my mind
I'm drifting out on your love
I drift into each day with you

(Chorus)
I'm lost inside of you
Girl i don't know what to do
but love you more---Lyrics submitted by De'Ainese.
