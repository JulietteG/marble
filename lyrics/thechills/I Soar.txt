He rises with the air
He doesn't have a care
The southern wind is warm in his hair

Breathless at the sight 
The mountains on his right are crimson
As the sunlight's fading

Silver sisters fill the horizon
The cream of autumn's violet skies
At dusk the land will quietly shed its disguise
As both moons rise 
Feigning surprise at their meeting of eyes

He has to talk to someone
Has to talk to someone
He's choking with emotion but there's nothing to say
There's nothing to say
Nothing to say

Below me on the land
The tide of silver sand
Stretches at the shade of my hand

An eyesore in the dust
The carcasses of rust
Are laughing at the careless parking

Eye to eye aglow with horizon
Time to fly away for a while
Chase my shadow over the valley below
I soar alone
Our crumbling homes are all overgrown
They've gone
I saw them go
I watched them leave, my family have flown

I have to talk to someone
Describe it all the someone
Emotions are imploding but there's nothing to say
There's nothing to say
They've all gone away
All gone away

Eye to eye aglow with horizon
Time to fly away for a while
Chase my shadow over the valley below---Lyrics submitted by Public.
