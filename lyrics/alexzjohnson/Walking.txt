Can't stay with you, but I'll miss you
Souls on fire, I can't see through
All this smokey, smoking higher
And I don't know what to do
See this this shadow that stays beside me
In my dreams, it never likes me
I know it's a long road that I've created
I've got it under control

So why am I walking
This I don't know
Why I keep walking in circles
When I've got nowhere to go

Sand pulls quicker, it sinks me deeper
I like this feeling, I let it linger
Where's my education, what was I thinking
Been lying to myself all along
And I knew I was wrong
I could tell in your eyes the love is gone
And I know I can't fix what I have done
So I'll keep walking till I'm numb

And why am I walking
This I don't know
Why I keep walking in circles
When I've got nowhere to go
But I'll do this alone
And every tear I know is mine
And I will feel it in my bones
I'll be okay, just let me hide
Patterns change just like the tide

And why am I walking
This I don't know
And I keep walking in circles
When I've got nowhere, got nowhere to go
And why am I talking
When I have nothing to say
And my head is a maze
And I'm not finding my way, ooh but I

Can't stay with you, but I'll miss you
My souls on fire, I can't see through
All this smokey, smoking higher
My feet won't bring me to you---Lyrics submitted by Erica M.
