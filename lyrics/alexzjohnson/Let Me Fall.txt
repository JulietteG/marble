I feel chained, 
chained down 
you shoved me to the ground
i cant run i cant shout 
just let me out 
you sound heartless
this couldn't mean less but i pushed in your face
and you must,
i have something to say
let me rise
let me fall 
let me breathe 
i wanna lose control im not afraid to lose it all 
let me break 
let me crawl 
because i'll get back up again if you let me fall 
if i burn down in this fire 
i got myself to blame 
i cant stop so give it up 
i need to feel the pain 
can you hear me dont come near me 
you'll just get in my way 
i wont let you man and theres nothing you can say 
let me rise 
let me fall 
let me breathe 
i wanna lose control i'm not afraid to loose it all 
let me break 
let me crawl 
because i will get up again if you let me fall 
uhhh uhhh uhhh 
so you know why so let me die 
and you understand dont need to figure it out 
lift my own while 
let me rise 
let me fall 
let me breathe 
i wanna lose control im not afraid to lose it all 
let me break 
let me crawl cause i will get up again if you let me fall 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
if you let me fall 
if you let me if you let me fall if you let me fall 
i will get up again if you let me fall
yeah yeah yeah yeah 
let me rise 
let me fall 
let me breathe if you let me fall---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
