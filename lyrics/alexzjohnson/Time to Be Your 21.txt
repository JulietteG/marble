You never lied to me, not once
Its not your fault that I can't  trust
Its in my past, its in my path and I can't go there
Making a mess of this game
To see it all go up in flames
So tired of being ruthless and wreckless

Time to be your only 
To almost you're way too young
Time to crash into the sun
Time to be your 21
Time to dream that love will last
Time to drive my car too fast
Time to walk before I run 
Time to be
Ohh time to be your 21

I don't beleive in love and I
I put to the wall
I taste the sweetness there to laugh so hard as it falls
And I could push you there if you don't stop me [X2]
Please stop me

Time to be your only one
To almost be you're way too young
Time to crash into the sun
Time to be your 21
Time to dream that love will last
Time to drive my car too fast
Time to walk before i run
Time to be
Time to be your 21

Its gut wrenching sometimes
Its life threatening sometimes
Seems like nothing can wash it all away

Time to be your only one
To almost be your way too young
Time to crash into the sun
Time to be your 21
Time to dream that love will last
Time to drive my car too fast
Time to walk before I run
Time to be your 21
