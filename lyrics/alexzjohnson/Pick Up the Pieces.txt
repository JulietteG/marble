If I was a drift on an ocean all alone
You came and rescued me
When I was far from home
Rush of love around my heart
Just as I fell apart

[Chorus]
Nobody ever cared as much for me (as much for me)
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked up the pieces and put me back together again

Ooo ya
Careful, we're fragile and easily we break
In your arms I'm certain 
It's all the love we make
Rush of love around my heart 
Just as you take my hand

[Chorus]
Nobody ever cared as much for me (as much for me)
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked the pieces and put me back together

I'll write you name in
Stars across the sky (stars across the sky)
We'll drift away in
To each others eyes
Hey ya (Hey ya) Hoy ya ya ya yaya, oh ya ya

[Chorus]
Nobody ever cared as much for me
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked the pieces and put me back together

Nobody ever cared as much for me (as much for me)
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked the pieces and put me back together again

Nobody ever cared as much for me (as much for me)
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked the pieces and you've put me back together again---Lyrics submitted by kayola.
