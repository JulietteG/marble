If I dont cry,
Do you think I dont feel?
If I look away,
It doesnt mean I dont see,
And just because I want
Someone when I'm alone
Doesn't mean I'm helpless,
That I cant stand on my own.

How far can we go before we break?
How long can I wait?
How strong do you think I am?
How much can I take of this?
Am I rock or a rose or a fist,
Or the breath at the end of a kiss?

How deep do you wanna go,
Cuz I'll go there if I can,
You make it harder than it has to  be,
How strong... how strong, do you think I am?

It's so hard to tell what's in your heart,
What you keep to yourself,
Is tearing me apart,
And should i be afraid,
To dream about you?
And if you feel the same,
What you gonna do?

How far can we go before we break?
How long can I wait?
How strong do you think I am?
How much can I take of this?
Am I rock or a rose or a fist?
Or the breath at the end of a kiss?

How deep do you wanna go,
Cuz I'll go there if i can
You make it harder than it has to be,
How strong... how strong, do you think i am?

Oohh..

If I am moving any closer,
If you let go, and give yourself away,
And if we let this happen to us everything will change!
How strong do you think I am?
How much can I take of this?
Am I rock or a rose or a fist?

Ohh

How deep do you wanna go?
Cuz I'll go there if I can,
You make it harder than it has to be,
How strong, how strong...

How strong do you think I am?
How much can I take of this?
Am I rock or a rose or a fist?
Or the breath at the end of a kiss,

How deep do you wanna go,
Cuz I'll go there if I can,
You make it harder than it has to be,

How strong, how strong, how strong, how strong,
Do you think I am?!---Lyrics submitted by yuval.
