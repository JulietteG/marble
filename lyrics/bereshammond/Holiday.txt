Now will all the nations be gathered at the conference table, yeah
Lets talk about the conditions of this world, yes
If youre not happy with the situation, oh
If youre not feeling proud
Lift your voices, raise your hands and sing it loud, yes

Holiday, holiday
Let the warrin try and take a holiday
Holiday, holiday
Can the warrin try and take a holiday

Are you present Jamaica
Lats stand and be counted
On behalf of the people
Is this what you really want?
Welcome Saudi Arabia
Long time no hear from you
Asia and Australia
Its time we take a stand

Weve got lots to talk about at the conference table, yes
Gonna talk about, were gonna talk about hate, yes
And while were here, lets talk a little about my color, yes
Once and for all, lets get it straight, yes

Holiday, holiday
Let the warrin try and take a holiday
Holiday, holiday
Can the warrin try and take a holiday

Now be seated while I make my speech
As far as I can recall
The few who say they represent the masses dont live our lifestyles at all, no
You dont know how were feeling, no, you dont have a clue
Are you sure you know when were hurting
Or does it really bother you?

And the tempers gonna flare at the conference table, yes
Cause there are some who wont wanna see a change, no
But if at all you say youre working for the people, yes
Then we want to see love come from hate, yes

Holiday, holiday
Let the warrin try and take a holiday
Holiday, holiday
Can the warrin try and take a holiday---Lyrics submitted by Larry Dart.
