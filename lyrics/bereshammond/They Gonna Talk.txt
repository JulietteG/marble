Iyiiiio, OIyiiii, Iyiiiio, Iy 
Some things were meant to be 
so why not let it be 
and stop worrying about it
long as we know whats in our hearts
we know our inner thoughts, hey
no reason for concern no


They gonna talk 
they gonna talk 
they gonna talk 
they gonna say a lot of things about us
said you know that love is not a sin
what you worry what the people say

cho
when they see me with you, hey
wonder what they probbly say
when they find us together
wonder what the people say, 
when they know were in love
worry what they probbly say
hey hey hey hey


you pass them on the streets yes
greet you with a smile hey	
as broad as the nile oy
they will say all kinds of goody goody to you yes
that lingers for a while
oh there in your mind

you wanna go you wanna stay
you think that you can never ever make your mind up bout it
well but if you know that love is deep within
why should you worry what the folks them say

cho
when they see me with you
worry what they probbly say
when they find us together 
wonder what the people say
when they know were in love
wonder what the people say

iyiiiiio, iyiiiii, iyiiiiio, I I I 
oyiiiiio, oiyiiiii, iyiiiiio, 
wonder what the people say

cho
when they see me with you
then you wonder what theyll probbly say
when they find us together 
worry what the people say
when they know were in love
you wonder what the people say
yeahhhh---Lyrics submitted by roxanne.
