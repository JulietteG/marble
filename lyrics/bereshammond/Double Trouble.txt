(Verse 1)
Now look at me 
At a quarter to three
I wanna go home, 
That's where I should be 
Dont know what to do 
Or what I should say 
Gotta make up my mind 
Before night turns to day 

(Hook)
Be early 
She told me 
I'll be waiting for you honey, 
I made something special for you
Now how am I going to enter? 
I can't afford to wake her 
With lipstick stains 
I gotta tip toe


(Chorus)
Now double trouble 
Is waiting 
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm tired, 
I'm sleepy 
Can't take the nagging in my head
Now double trouble 
Is waiting 
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm so tired, 
I wanna go home

(Verse 2)
Now this is my date
Wonder if she's awake or asleep
If I know her well 
She's somewhere taking a peak 
What will story be? 
This one better good
Should I tell her I had a confrontation with Robin Hood?


(Hook) 
Be early 
She told me 
I'll be waiting for you honey, 
I made something special for you
Now how am I going to enter? 
I can't afford to wake her 
With lipstick stains 
I gotta tip toe

(Chorus)
Now double trouble 
Is waiting 
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm tired, 
I'm sleepy 
Can't take the nagging in my head
Now double trouble 
Is waiting 
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm so tired, 
I wanna go home---Lyrics submitted by Pretty.
