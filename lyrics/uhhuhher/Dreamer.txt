You've seen the worst of me now
I'm all alone see
You lost me somehow
And what we're fighting for is peace
Are you still in love with me,
Or someone else?

Well are you such a dreamer?
Put yourself in my shoes
Careful what you wish for love
(oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh)

I've seen the worst of you too
I let it go see
Because I have to
And when I'm falling on my knees
You'll take my hand in yours
What will be, we'll be

Cause are you such a dreamer?
Put yourself in my shoes
Careful what you wish for love

What's the matter with our ways
I'm missing something,
not to blame
But don't you worry,
this will pass
It's only cause my mind's
been spinning
No control,
I've lost my head
All of this is just beginning
Not enough,
it's never enough
I'll only want to keep on dreaming

Cause are you such a dreamer?
Put yourself in my shoes
Careful what you wish for love
(oooh)

Cause are you such a dreamer?
Put yourself in my shoes
Careful what you wish for love
(oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh)---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
