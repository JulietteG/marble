The scene is dead by morning
Slipping past the great divide
It chases over bridges
Spins me out of my own mind

Hollow is how you like it
What you see is what you get
Say you love me again
But you never do (yeah)

I am not singing a love,
singing a love song
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I want to fall away and
waste another day
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

I see I disappoint you
Why don't you find another threat?
This isn't what you thought now
If you fall, won't you tell me in my ear?
You're here to waste their time dear
But you can't waste mine
Oh say you love me again
But you never do (yeah)

I am not singing a love,
singing a love song
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I want to fall away and
waste another day
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

But if you can't save love anyway,
you'll love again
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
I want to fall away and
waste another day
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
