I love it how I walk away
I won't feel at all
Don't tell me what to say
There's no need to tell
Don't want to hear your intellect
Just don't think at all
Cause all your words
are meaningless
Just won't fall,
won't fall for me

Oh, the past it's getting me
There's no end in sight
If I could just get rid of it
I will try, I will try
Don't want to psychoanalyze
I'm just not the type
Cause all those words
are meaningless
I just won't fall,
won't fall for it

Lie down
Just give it up
Dance with me
Lights out
Falling away
Into me
Don't stop
Just let it go
Come with me
Stay down
Cause you're
Burning me up
Dance with me

Oooh, oooh

Lie down
Just give it up
Dance with me
Lights out
Falling away
Into me
Don't stop
Just let it go
Come with me
Stay down
Cause you're
Burning me up
Dance with me---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
