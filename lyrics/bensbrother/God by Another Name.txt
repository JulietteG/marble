What if life wasn't long
And everybody got just a single 
Moment?
If you wasted the moment alone
Spent your while thinking
"Why should i need love?"
Then look above to the sky and
Beyond
Coz you don't know what you've got 
'till it's gone, believe me
Everybody need a lover sometimes
and you are mine
My god by another name
Everybody needs a lover sometimes
And you are mine
My shelter from the rain outside

What if life was a car
And you really didn't know how to 
Start it
Would you sit in your car like a clown
Or get out and walk to the nearest
Crowded bar
And kiss a mouth, Make it smile and
Be proud
That at least you had a good time for
a while
Believe me

Everybody needs a love sometimes
And you are mine
My god by another name
Everybody need a lover sometimes
And you are mine
My shelter form the rain outside

And if you hold on to me now
And never let go
Then i guess at leaast we'll know
The sense that it all made, oh

Coz everybody needs a lover
Sometimes
And you are mine
My god by another name
Everybody needs a lover sometimes
And you are mine
My shelter from the rain outside

But you stayed---
