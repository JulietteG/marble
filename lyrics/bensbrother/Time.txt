A second, A minute, an hour, a day and its gone
Little by little it fritters away try as 
you may youcan never replace it
a moment beauty you stumble 
upon,
As long as you treasure whatever
it is, whatever it is could never
be wasted

So if we all turn to dust
Better to be loved and lost
Coz everything has a cost

So if you're gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it upon me
Just give me some time
I don't want your money

I'd crawl then i'd walk then i'd run
Then i'd stumble and fall
Somewhere between the love and 
the lust
I tried my best i was maladjusted
And i'm not saying that i know 
it all
Maybe i'm a little more self-aware
Still get scared but i've learnt
To trust it

So when it comes to us
I'v weighed up all the odds
I bet that this is love
So if your gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it upon me
Just give me some time
Don't take it from me

I know hard it is
Getting it right
At a time like this
So you better believe
Believe
How right it could be

So if your gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it upon me
Just give me some time
I don't want your money---
