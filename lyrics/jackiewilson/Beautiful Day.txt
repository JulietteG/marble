Spoken intro: 


*Come take an imaginary trip with me, right now, and let's visit some place we haven't been before.*


The sun shines in the world on men, women, and girls and boys, together
Hand and hand and side to side we'll let the lord be are guide together, oooo, ooooo


We walk the streets as sisters and brothers
And we speak when we meet because we love each other
Ooooooo  
It's a beautiful day
Such a beautiful day
Red, white, black, and brown we're all people, we can get along
Can't we?

There's no more war we don't need guns
So lets get together and have big fun
Please

You see we walk the streets as sisters sisters and brothers (We walk)

(And we talk)                               (Love each other) 
We speak when we meet because we love each other  


Oh the song I'm singing is for you, yes it is
But all words lie but together we can make them come true
Won't you take me to what I say 
And lets start right away
And make it a beautiful day yes
Make a beautiful day 

We're not gonna have crime in the streets
We're gonna live in perfect harmony
Red, white, black, and brown, we can all get along
Hand and hand and side by side
We'll let the Lord be our guide 
And make it a beautiful day

La la laaaa la

(Beautiful day)              (Beautiful day)
What a beautiful day

La la la la
It's a beautiful day yeah

(La la)

We're not gonna have crime in the streets
We're gonna live in perfect harmony
Red, white, black and brown
We can all get along
Hand and hand and side by side we'll let the Lord be our guide
Oh, what a beautiful day

La la la laaa

What a beautiful day 

La la la la

(Beautiful day)
It's a beautiful day
