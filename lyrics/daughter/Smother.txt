Im wasted, losing time
Im a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but were not right

In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that Im a suffocator

I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place
to lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave
To follow (x4)

In the darkness I will meet my creators
They will all agree, Im a suffocator

Suffocator (x2)
Oh no
Im sorry if I smothered you (x2)
I sometimes wish Id stayed inside
My mother
Never to come out---Lyrics submitted by Laura Vos.
