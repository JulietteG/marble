Throw me in a landfill
Don't think about the consequences
Throw me in a dirt pit
Don't think about the choices that you make
Throw me in the water 
Don't think about the splash I will create
Leave me at the alter
Knowing all the things you just escaped

Push me out to sea, 
On a little boat that you made out of
The evergreen, that you helped your father cut away.
Leave me on the tracks,
To wait  until the morning train arrives.
Don't you dare look back, 
Walk on by, catch up with the sunrise.

This is torturous
Electricity, between both of us
And this is dangerous
I want you so much, but I hate your guts
I hate you

So leave me in the cold.
Wait until the snow covers me up, 
So I cannot move.
So I'm just embedded in the frost.
Leave me in the rain
Wait until the clothes cling to my frame.
Wipe away your tear stains, 
Thought you said you didn't feel pain.

Well this is torturous
Electricity, between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cos I want you so much, but I hate your guts.
I want you so much, but I hate your guts.

Well this is torturous
Electricity, between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cos I want you so much, but I hate your guts.
I want you so much, but I hate your guts.---Lyrics submitted by RaymondExtreme.
