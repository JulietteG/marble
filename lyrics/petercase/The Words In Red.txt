He heft a leather bound Bible up with two hands
Then he slammed it down over my head
Now he can tell you about the sins of man
But he must of skipped over the words in red

Love your brothers and your sisters, take care of each other
Love your enemies as well as your friends
Tend the poor and the sick and the ones in jail
Give away your wealth, say the words in red

Blessed are the meek, they'll inherit the earth
Blessed are the wine and bread
Blessed are those that hunger and thirst
Blessed are the words in red

Words in red, words in red
These are the words that Jesus said
The words that Jesus told
Worth the wait in the world of gold

Now, he's a sinner-huntin' preacher in the red light zone
At least that's what the papers said
The finger pointing fools are the first to go
And turn their back on the words in red

You can call it myth or a church man's dream
You can damn it all from A to zed
You can bury it deep, you can sell it out cheap
But you can never lose the words in red

Words in red, words in red
These are the words that Jesus said
The words that Jesus told
Worth the weight of the world of gold---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca carter.
