I don't need nobody
Now, everything is gonna be right
I'm walking, through the night
I need love
You don't give me that sugar, I don't feel right

Take it all, take it all back

Take it all, take it all back
Take it all, take it all back

What's the point, you always go mad

What's your point, worrying about tomorrow

Take it all, take it all back

Take it all, take it all back
Take it all, take it all back

Verse 3
I'm walking, through the night
I need love
You're gonna give a dam sugar, but i don't feel right
