This time I realize
You're looking this way
With your real eyes

Your feet can't stop
The peak of that thought
That deep in my thought
The time on my watch
You're the air that I breathe
You're the world that I see
You are, you are

I can never find a way
Or the right things to say
I guess I just didn't know how
You see, the longer that we wait
The more time things can take
I guess we'll have to spell it out

[Chorus]
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, everytime, everything
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, everytime, everything

Your feet can't stop
The peak of that thought
That deep in my thought
The time on my watch
You're the air that I breathe
You're the world that I see
You are, you are

I can never find a way
Or the right things to say
I guess I just didn't know how
You see, the longer that we wait
The more time things can take
I guess we'll have to spell it out

[Chorus]
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, everytime, everything
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, everytime, everything

Girl, I can't stop thinkin about anyone else but you (3x)

I'm scarred(2x)

[Chorus]
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, everytime, everything
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, everytime, everything

Girl, I can't stop thinkin about anyone else but you---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
