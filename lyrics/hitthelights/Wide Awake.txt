Everything is winding down
Man I'm so tired of waiting around
My whole life I've been waiting around
waiting around for something to happen
Everybody wants to go out on the town
But I just want to rest, I just want to rest my head
Sometimes you don't get what you want, when you want it

Wide awake, determined to stay half the night
To keep our hangovers at bay
I shouldn't go but I've lost my judgement
Oh I shouldn't go but I've lost my judgement now

This bottle is my word of thumb
It helps to clear my big day
For ten weeks long this bitter cold
Man what the hell where you drinking

Nobody wants to go out on the town
Yeah they just want to rest, they just want to rest
I can't wait to go out on the town
Yeah they just want to rest
You can rest when your dead

Wide awake, determined to stay half the night
To keep our hangovers at bay
I shouldn't go but I've lost my judgement
Oh I shouldn't go but I've lost my judgement now

How many days 'till you live your life
How many ways can I in mine
How many tries 'till I get it right
No will it ever be enough (will it ever be enough?)

Everybody wants to go out on the town
But i just want to rest, I just want to rest
All my life I've been lost, now I'm found
Hanging out with my friends
Living up our dead ends
Everybody's trying to get away from this town
Yeah I don't want to rest, I think it's for the best
If we get the  hell right out of this town
we will never rest (You can rest when your dead)

Wide awake, determined to stay half the night
To keep our hangovers at bay
I shouldn't go but I've lost my judgement
Oh I shouldn't go but I've lost my judgement now---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
