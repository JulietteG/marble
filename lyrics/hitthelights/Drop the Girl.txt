Drop the girl, shes not worth the time
Shes wasted on her back dragging other boys into her lies
You know shes no good for you
She'd sink lower than a body in the Hudson could ever do

Drop the girl, she's only gunning for your heart
Shes sure to leave you broke and bleeding
Cause shes all about trying to figure out the breakdown
Whoa
And you know shell turn her back on you,
She covers her tracks and buries the clues
Shes only set out to burn you
And you know your better off so cmon

Drop the girl Whooooa
Shes the only reason shes got you believing its love
Drop the girl Whooooa
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and get up

Drop the girl you can taste it on her lips
What she's drinking, who shes been with
Yea shes so turned on (shes so turned on)
How everythings gone wrong
Its all her fault and you know
Shell turn her back on you
She covers her tracks and buries the clues
Shes only set out to burn you
And you know your better off so cmon.

Drop the girl Whooooa
Shes the only reason shes got you believing its love
Drop the girl Whooooa
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and just
Drop the girl from the highest building
You can when you have to 
You gotta see through the scam
Drop the girl Whooooa 
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and just

DROP THE GIRL!

Throw your pride aside and show your friends some faith
(Is there a night where she forgets your name?)
Whos got your back when everything's starting to fall right apart again
(C'mon is that what it takes?)
Throw your pride aside and show your friends some faith
(Is there a night where she forgets your name?)
Whos got your back when everything's starting to fall right apart again
(C'mon is that what it takes?)

Drop the girl, shes no good for you
She'd sink lower than a body in the Hudson could ever do

Drop the girl Whooooa
Shes the only reason shes got you believing its love.
Drop the girl Whooooa
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and just
Drop the girl from the highest building
You can when you have to
You gotta see through the scam
Drop the girl Whooooa 
The bridge is best for burning so send her down in flames and just.---Lyrics submitted by Mallory.
