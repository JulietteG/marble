Eyes closed
And starting to whisper, i speak slow
Dont wanna give you up, ive given up lately
I wish you joy, success and happiness
A better life, it shouldnt lose sense of you
Im setting up to be the better
When you lost the right to think what you do

Breathe in, breathe out
Give it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Once numb, you're conscience comes crashing
Oh keep strong
Take time to find yourself
Until then, I'll be waiting on you to come around
And you will

Breathe in, breathe out
Give it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, who's counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Crashes to crashes, thats what it feels like
Crashes to crashes, i'll be waiting on you to come around
Crashes to crashes, thats what it feels like
Crashes to crashes

Breathe in, breathe out
Live it up, you'll never live this down
This is the last call

Breathe in, breathe out
Give it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, whos counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now

Breathe in, breathe it out
Give it up, you'll never live this down
Last call, lost cause, whos counting
Last call, lost cause, who's counting now---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
