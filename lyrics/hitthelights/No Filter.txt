Ill be at home when youre hearing this
I might be alone but Im over it
So much to say with no time to waste
My only regret: its not to your face
You ended it strangely without a word said
Never replied, never had a chance
For every night I slept myself sick wondering what I did
This is goodbye; I hope you fucking choke on it

You know I thought we had it all
What was it really about?
You keep building your walls
Tell me whos missing you now?
Whos missing you now?

Should I be surprised? Angry? Upset?
Theres always another girl to regret
I could just fall right off the deep end
Drowning myself in all this drinking
But Im in control; Im in a good place
Trying hard to erase memories of your taste
All your favorite songs were never that good
Wishing somehow I could take it all back and turn that goddamn radio off

You know I thought we had it all
What was it really about?
You keep building your walls
Tell me whos missing you now?
Whos missing you now?
Nobodys missing you now
I slept myself sick every night but Im over it

You crave acceptance from strangers through pictures and filters
Attention from people who dont know you
And now that its over, how many will be there to pick you back up?
Cause I see right through, I see right through
I know the real you, I see right through

You know I thought we had it all
What was it really about?
You keep building your walls
Tell me whos missing you now?
Whos missing you now?
Nobodys missing you now
I slept myself sick every night but Im over it

Whos missing you now?
Nobodys missing you now
I slept myself sick every night but Im over it---
