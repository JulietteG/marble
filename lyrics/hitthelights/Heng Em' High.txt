She throws on her makeup
her friends say she's made up
she's everything a scene should be
when she's folding her arms
she holds her applause
just to let you know

She hangs em high everywhere she goes
she bleeds em dry and everybody knows
she takes time to talk about all her famous friends
and what crew they're in so don't get her started

She's out of her mind
over half of the time
crying in alleys while her friends are inside
you wouldn't believe
when she swears she's 18
but everybody knows

She'll never get what she never got
baby lead on...

She hangs em high everywhere she goes
she bleeds em dry and everybody knows
she takes time to talk about all her famous friends
and what crew they're in
she can party harder that you can
you don't understand so don't get her...

You'll never have what you never had in you to start
you'll never get it cause you never know what you want
you take advantage but you never seem to take it to heart
lead on, lead on

You'll never have what you never had in you to start
you'll never get it cause you never know what you want
you take advantage but you never seem to take it to heart
lead on, lead on

Oooooohhhhhhhh (everywhere she goes)
Ooooooohhhhhhh (and everybody knows)
She takes time to talk about (all her friends)

She hangs em high everywhere she goes
she bleeds em dry and everybody knows
she takes time to talk about all her famous friends
and what crew they're in
she can party harder that you can
you don't understand so don't get her...---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
