there were ocean waves
big city lights
lazy summer days
and crazy sleepless nights

somewhere along an open road
we drove ourselves out of our minds
sometimes to do the things you love
you leave the ones you love behind

you danced
you drank
you laughed 
you cried
you went to work
and said goodbye
i've lived
i learnt
stayed up all night
i'll see you when the time is right again

i got old shoes in a brand new town
i wear 'em like they're staring, let the tongues hang out
i'm just too loose for the same old crowd
if i could only see your face before my souls wear out

somewhere out on an open road
you searched until you looked inside
sometimes you've gotta see the world
to find out what you left behind

you danced
you drank
you laughed 
you cried
you went to work
and said goodbye
i've lived
i learnt
stayed up all night
i'll see you when the time is right again

wait for me
(don't wait, don't wait)
wait for me
(don't wait, don't wait)

we walked the floor, the sun, the rise
we packed our bags and waved goodbye
we drove into a great sunset
and lived a life with no regret
we lived a life with no regret

(don't wait, don't wait, don't wait, don't wait)

i can't recall the sun to rise
i'll never know until i try
we made mistakes and learned in time
but on the road we live and die

i can't recall the sun to rise
i'll never know until i try
we made mistakes and learned in time
but on the road we live and die
but on the road we live and die
we live...

(we'll never know...)---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
