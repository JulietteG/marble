I found how to get to her now
I'll whisper in her ear when shes asleep
And begging to love me
When the morning comes she'll never know
Cause right now i think i'm on my way out
I've been tying bells to window screens
So i can hear her leave in the morning
But it never helps and i never know
Where your late to go when your all alone
And why you cant be reached does anybody know
Waking up again are you listening
To anything i'm saying

Tell me where you are
And i'll find you
Tell me what it takes to see this through
Tell me what it takes to get to you
And i'll be there waiting

Ohoh ohoh ohoh whoa

She sees through any move that i use
See i've been falling head over her heels
So when she disappears she knows i'll be here waiting up
So i've vowed the moment that she leaves town
Yeah i'll be hopping trains to get away and try to save face
But i know its never far enough

Still i'll never know
Where your late to go when your all alone
And why you cant be reached does anybody know?
Waking up again are you listening
To anything i say

Tell me where you are
And i'll find you
Tell me what it takes to see this through
Tell me what it takes to get to you
And i'll be there waiting

Waiting for you to come home
Waiting the words were gone
Waiting for you to answer
When i ask you to tell me where you are---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
