Mmmmh 

Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real 

Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell 

Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they only bring you down 

Hey you, you know me, you've touched me, I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see and
Feel me
I'm danger - I'm the stranger 

And I, I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain
I am master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk 

Don't let them inside your mind, yeah
Run away, run away, go! 

No - no 

Don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul 

Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real 

Don't talk to strangers [Don't talk to strangers]
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Yeah 

Run, run, run, run away!---Lyrics submitted by Paul Savenye.
