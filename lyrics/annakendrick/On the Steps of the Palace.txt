He's a very smart Prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
And I'm caught unawares
Well, it means that he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

Alright, what do you want?
Have to make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
Should I give that a thought
What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who I am when I know
That I'm not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if I am
What a Prince would envision?
But then how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which I don't?
So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where everything's wrong?
Or where everything's right
But you know that you'll never belong?

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's my first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary
And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But I've stalled long enough
'Cause I'm still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
I'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose
So I pry up my shoes

Without thinking it through
Things don't have to collide
I know what my decision is
Which is not to decide
I'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who'll be stuck with a shoe
In a stew
In the goo
And I've learned something, too
Something I never knew
On the steps of the palace---
