I got my ticket for the long way round
Two bottles of whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And Im leaving tomorrow, wha-do-ya say?

When Im gone
When Im gone
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone 
Youre gonna miss me by my hair 
You're gonna miss me everywhere,oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Ive got my ticket for the long way round
The one with the prettiest of views
Its got mountains, its got rivers, its got sights to give you shivers
But it sure would be prettier with you

When I'm gone 
When I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me by my walk 
You're gonna miss me by my talk,oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

When Im gone
When Im gone
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone
Youre gonna miss me by my hair 
You're gonna miss me everywhere,oh
You're sure gonna miss me when I'm gone

When I'm gone 
When I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me by my walk 
You're gonna miss me by my talk,oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
