Grab a hold of me
I've got my arms up
Pull me up from this darkness
It's so hard for me to see light at the end of the tunnel

If it's a war you came to see
You will never see a waved white flag in front of me
I can't end up dead, I won't be mislead
I'll keep singing this song inside my head

My feelings rise, on your demise
Do I have to put your name on this grave?
I'll give you one more shot
This addiction came like a freight train (oh)
You're coming off of the rails again
It's hard for you to see the light at the end of the tunnel

If it's a war you came to see
You will never see a waved white flag in front of me
I can't handle that, I won't be this way
I'll keep singing this song inside my head

If it's a war you came to see
You will never see a waved white flag in front of me
I can't end up dead, I won't be mislead
I'll keep singing this song inside my head

On a one way course set for destruction
Full speed ahead
The time has come for you to start things over
Hold on, full speed ahead

All my life, I've been waiting for something
That never came, it never came, but I'm still singing
All my life I've been searching for something
To break these chains, to break these chains, But I'll keep swinging

All my life, I've been waiting for something
That never came, it never came, but I'm still singing
All my life I've been searching for something
To break these chains, to break these chains, But I'll keep swinging

All my life, I've been waiting for something
That never came, it never came, but I'm still singing
All my life I've been searching for something
To break these chains, to break these chains, But I'll keep swinging

All my life, I've been waiting for something
That never came, it never came, but I'm still singing
All my life I've been searching for something
To break these chains, to break these chains, But I'll keep swinging---Lyrics submitted by Tanya.
