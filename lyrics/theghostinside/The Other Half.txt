We believe in a system that has long been broken.
We turn the other cheek without a glimpse of emotion.
Always looking out for number one. Why do you need more while others have none?

Measure my worth by what Ive done, not what Ive become.

I spanned the oceans. Ive seen the skies. Thats all Im ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, arent even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesnt mean that you need.

Weve come so far from the lives that were meant to live.
But theres so much more that I have left to give.
We always borrow time that cant be given back.
We let it slip away and never pick up the slack.

I spanned the oceans. Ive seen the skies. Thats all Im ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, arent even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesnt mean that you need.

Force fed and misled. Now we hang by a thread.
Force fed and misled. But not me, I see red.

You need to hear this.
Measure my worth by what Ive done, not what Ive become.
Are you listening?
Measure my worth by what Ive done, not what Ive become.

Ive spanned the oceans. Ive seen the skies. Thats all Im ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life arent even things at all.
But theyre the things that keep my heart full.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
