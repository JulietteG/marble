Oh, I need a witness
To see the mess I've made
There's a broken lampshade
Ashtrays
Burnt floors
Beds unmade

Are you sleeping? If you are,
Do you dream of what I'm doing?
To you, undo you
I'm through with you
Until I need a round of --

Every time I spend myself
It never runs too low
I can't escape my need for

Sex and violence
Never let you see them
Hand in hand
And one is just the other
The softest touch
Is deeper than the ocean
Give it to me faster
Feel it, feel it
Sex and violence
Ooh, it's gonna make you cry
Sex and violence
Sex and violence
Ooh, it's gonna make you cry
Sex and violence

Oh, I was a real man
Stealing all their trade
I was strong and self-made
Well-paid
So groomed
Persuasive
You were walking home that night
Too kind to be elusive
Where do you live?
What'll you give?
Who are you with?
And how you getting home?

Does anybody know right now
Exactly where you are?
A step inside's a step too far

Sex and violence
Hit me with a love that
Burns so bright
And one is just the other
The sweetest taste is 
Never gonna leave you
Even when it hurts you
Breathe in, breathe in
Sex and violence
Ooh it's gonna make you cry
Sex and violence
Sex and violence
Ooh, it's gonna make you cry
Sex and violence

Violence, violence
Violence, violence
Violence, violence
Violence, violence

Sex and violence
Never let you see them
Hand in hand
And one is just the other
The softest touch is
Deeper than the ocean
Give it to me faster
Feel it, feel it
Sex and violence
Hit me with a love that 
Burns so bright
And one is just the other
The sweetest taste is
Never gonna leave you
Even when it hurts you
Breathe in, breathe in
Violence, violence
Violence, violence
Violence, violence
Violence, violence---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
