I don't mind
If your running around
Giving someone the time
It don't matter
It's all right
Just to know that you love me

I'm laying in bed
with a whole lot of wonder
Going through my head
This dog with a bone
Gets a little bit lonely

I'm too cool to lose my control
Your too cool to go
Later I just don't wanna know
Your out there happenin' at all

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me
Said I'm that kind of guy
When I see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me 
Baby come home

Baby one more pill
Till I close my eyes
To a pain I feel
I can't sleep
Lest your laying beside me

I got no doubt
That would be just fine
If you were living without me
I just can't let you start to deny

9,10,11
Now midnight strikes
I don't know where you been
I still want to make love tonight
When you come stumbling in

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to
It's half quarter to three
Baby come home to me
Said I'm that kind of guy
When I see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home

Baby, what do I do
(what do I do)
Just to keep you from time to two
Baby, what could you say
(what could you say)
To drop my fears away
Was it that red letter day
With no more chips to play
Will you come home
Baby come home

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It's half past quarter to three
Baby come home to me
Said I'm that kind of guy
When I see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby Come Home---Lyrics submitted by jamie.
