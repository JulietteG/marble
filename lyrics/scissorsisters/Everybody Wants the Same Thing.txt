If you're waiting for your wings but you just got legs
And you're feeding all your chickens but they won't lay eggs
When you open up your drawers and see your janky clothes
Just remember life's in love with you but let's suppose
That God ain't gonna drop you no hundred dollar bill
You've got to question your intentions
Cause the bad ones kill

Everybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
No trading places on the chain gang
It doesn't matter how you swing it
Everybody wants the same thing

When your exit sign is coming could be 'round any bend
Now did you live your life proper did you just pretend
That you knew what you was talking about
Which side was your fence
When the hammer comes down it never makes no sense
Chaos is not a virtue, paranoia loads the bases
Just imagine giant rivers overflowing with their faces

Everybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
No trading places on the chain gang
It doesn't matter how you swing it
Everybody wants the same thing

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

What is it that you want?
What is it that you give?
Where do you plan on finding it?
How do you want to live?

Love is what I want
And love is what I give
Right here's where I'm finding it
That's how I'm gonna live

Love is what I want
And love is what I give
Right here's where I'm finding it
That's how I'm gonna live

Said love is what I want
And love is what I give
Right here's where I'm finding it
That's how I'm gonna live

Everybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
No trading places on the chain gang
It doesn't matter how you swing it
Everybody wants the same thing



Everybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
No trading places on the chain gang
It doesn't matter how you swing it
Everybody wants the same thing---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
