I know I'm into you
I don't know what to do
When we talk
I feel like I died twice
Boxers use their fist
Hockey players break their wrist
You break my heart
When you try to play nice

Like a detective without a case
I magnify what you say
And test the implications
It could be you
Or it could be through
Before it even begins
I'm a fish swimming without fins

Better luck next time
Maybe we could have a go
With another kind of love
One that carries on
Better luck next time
Guess I've only one regret
That I didn't get to know you better than I did

You tell me that you're mine
Are you just being kind?
Let's not stretch our imagination
When you look in my eyes
Always get them butterflies
My knees get weak with anticipation

And if I might have a slip of the tongue
Will the fun disappear?
Is the binding coming undone?
You keep me waiting within your grasp
But I can't tell what you feel
And I'm too afraid to ask you

Better luck next time
Maybe we could have a go
With another kind of love
One that carries on
Better luck next time
Guess I've only one regret
That I didn't get to know you better than I did

Better luck next time
Maybe we could have a go
With another kind of love
One that carries on
Better luck next time
Guess I've only one regret
That I didn't get to know you better than I did---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
