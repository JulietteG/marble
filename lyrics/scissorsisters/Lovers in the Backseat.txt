She's quiet when she's down
Strangers from other towns
Nowhere to be found
On this side of the scene

Would you like a cigarette?
Or my hand upon your shoulder?
I think we might have met
Would you like me to come over?

There's lovers in the backseat
Jealous glances now I'm lookin' for another song
On the radio
I'll take you to a side street
In the shadows you can touch one another now
And I'll just watch the show

She's happy when she's proud
Attention well deserved
Exuberant and loud
A disguise can he know?
How much she needs him now
There's static on the sidelines
Can you read my thoughts?
Maybe it's the right time

There's lovers in the backseat
Jealous glances now I'm lookin' for another song
On the radio
I'll take you to a side street
In the shadows you can touch one another now
And I'll just watch the show
Lovers in the backseat
Jealous glances now I'm lookin' for another song
On the radio
I'll take you to a side street
In the shadows you can touch one another now
And I'll just watch the show
Lovers in the backseat
Lovers in the backseat
Lovers in the backseat
Lovers in the backseat
On the radio---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
