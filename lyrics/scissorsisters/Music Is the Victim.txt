I left my heart in San Francisco
It's at some motherfucking disco
The people there were dancin' on it
And that's including Ms Matronic

Hell if music is the victim then so am I
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gone bite
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry
If music is the victim then so am I

Of your bad fun
Money's all gone but you need some
Lover's on the phone but they got none
Daddy ain't home from the dog run
And you're ridin' through the city with a shot gun

I left my bag in Pasadena
Where all them girls was doin' Tina
Them bitches sure was crunked up on it
I said I'd rather smoke some chronic

Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gone bite
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry
If music is the victim then so am I

Of your bad fun
Money's all gone but you need some
Lover's on the phone but they got none
Daddy ain't home from the dog run
And you're ridin' through the city with a shot gun

I left my man in Houston, Texas
Just before he finished breakfast
He said 'Oh baby, fry some more eggs'
But I was runnin' on my own two legs

Hell if Jesus has the power then so do I
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by
If music is the victim then so am I

Of your bad fun
Money's all gone but you need some
Lover's on the phone but they got none
Daddy ain't home from the dog run
And you're ridin' through the city with a shot gun
Ridin' through the city with a shot gun
Ridin' through the city with a shot gun---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
