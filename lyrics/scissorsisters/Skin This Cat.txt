You got my good good lovin'
within your grasp
Don't let it throw you
There's a million million
ways to skin this cat
So let me show you

I got a brand new hook
to hang your hat
Tell me baby baby just where you at
There's a million ways
ways to skin this cat
So let me show you

And if you get it right
Get it right
I'll love you til the ninth life
Get it right, get it right
I'll love you til the ninth life

My beauty was a beast 
before I got to know you
This kitten has a lion's roar
And she will roll you
You're not the first tom
to walk my floor
So get around the block
a few times more
And keep scratch scratchin'
at my back door
And I will show you

That if you get it right
Get it right
I'll love you til the ninth life
Get it right, get it right
I'll love you til the ninth life

Come here kitty kitty
And skin this cat
Come here kitty kitty 
And skin this cat
Come here kitty kitty
And skin this cat (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
