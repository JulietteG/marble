Sailing through the tunnels
In the morning by yourself
Theres a very special feeling
True sensation all is well
If you stand and reach you r arms out wide
Close your eyes and try to fly
Its an underground illusion
Tricking you from side to side

We knew all the answers 
And we shouted them like anthems
Anxious and suspicious that God knew how much we cheated
It cant come quickly enough
And now youve  spent your like waiting for this moment
And when you finally saw it come
It passed you by and left you so defeated

Skyscrapers rise between us
Keeping me from finding you
If the concrete architecture 
Disappeared thered be so few
Of us left to navigate and defend ourselves from the tide
Its an underground illusion tricking you from side to side

Theres no indication of what we were meant to be
Sucking up to strangers, throwing wishes to the sea
It cant come quickly enough
And now youve  spent your like waiting for this moment
And when you finally saw it come
It passed you by and left you so defeated

It cant come quickly enough 
And now youve spent your like waiting for this moment
And when you finally saw it come
It passed you by and left you so defeated

It cant come quickly enough 
And now youve spent your like waiting for this moment
And when you finally saw it come
It passed you by and left you so defeated---Lyrics submitted by Chris Ladd.
