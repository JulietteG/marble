Another town, another school in your trailer park
And I could burn these books alive
I am freaking out
And I left my friends in the sun behind the graveyard with a jar of rum
And I left your hand in the shade
What do I know about love anyway?

Another year, another inch I will be tall enough
And if he hits you again I will beat your man I will put him out
You dont need to cut your life on these razorblades 
All these kitchen knives
You are beautiful
And I packed the Chevrolet
I hear Pittsburgh is better than this town anyway

When your heart is broke, when your eyes are wet  x6
You go

Lets go (x8) today
Lets go (x8) today, today, today---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
