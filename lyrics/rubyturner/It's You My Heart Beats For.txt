Ooooh yeah
The skys the limit that's why they say
You can go as far as you wanna go
If thats the truth can you let me know 
How do I reach that pot of Gold
No use to pretending, my heart is longing 
for my own lullaby
Something to soothe me, making sweet melody
Someone whos really mine

(Chorus)
Oh oooooo
I need somebody to love me
(just a little bit)
Never wanting to let go
With you I wont ask for more
It's you that my heart beats for

Mmmmm
They say that true love so hard to find
But that depends on what you're looking for
Love can reach the stars
and love seems so cold 
Should I take this chance, once more
The search could be over, my feelings rushing through
love is in the air
My heart beats stronger
For many of us it's saying 
Don't let it disappear

Oh oooooo
I need somebody to love me
(Just a little bit)
Never wanting to let go
With you I wont ask for more
You that my heart beats for

How I wanna stay
Wrapped up in the charm
Loving every moment, and kissing the night away
The things I'd do, Your wildest dreams will come true
Its you my heart beats for

Ohoooooooo

(just a little bit)
Hey Oooooooooo
I need someboby to love me
(just a little bit)
a little bit, never let me go
It's you, you, yooooooooooou
You that my heart beats for---Lyrics submitted by Rhea Phillips.
