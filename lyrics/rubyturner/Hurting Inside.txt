-Intro-[Spoken]
I've seen so many women
and fellas too
Hide behind the pain of love
trying to hold up their pride
but it shows in their eyes

but I wake up in the morning
put on my make up
& practise my smile
[hurting inside]
the hot pain I feel inside 
[loves says good bye]
cos now I'm a victim too

{VERSE}
Know a lot of women like that
's been hurt before
by some men that promise
to cherish forever more
wishing that this time
love was for a life time
'nother dreary day
with no sunshine

trying to figure out 
where we went wrong
something that we couldn't give each other
that we needed so strong
suffering lovers
we keep hurting 
each other
but we try to wear it well
but deep inside it really tells

-Chorus-
we just keep on hurting inside
love says goodbye
another lonely heart will cry
but you will survive

hurting inside
love says goodbye
another lonely heart will cry
but you will survive

{VERSE}
Gotta get away
from all the gossip & the scandal
rumours going round
talking to hold it down

second time around
same situation
she find another man
with the moon agin she stands
crying

trying to figure out where we went wrong
something that we couldn't give each other
that we needed so strong
suffering lovers
we keep hurting one &  another
but we try to wear it well
but deep inside it really tells

-Chorus-
we just keep on hurting inside
love says goodbye
another lonely heart will cry
but you will survive
hurting inside

another lonely heart will cry
but you will survive

hurting

we just keep on hurting

we try to wear it well
but deep inside it really tells

-Chorus-
we just keep on hurting inside
love says goodbye
another lonely heart will cry
but you will survive

hurting inside
love says goodbye
another lonely heart will cry
but you will survive

its all over
gotta find somebody new

gotta be strong
[hurting inside]
I gotta find somebody new
suffering lovers
[hurting inside]
hurting one & another
... i will survive

{Fades}
[hurting inside]
...ohh i will survive---Lyrics submitted by Ariana.
