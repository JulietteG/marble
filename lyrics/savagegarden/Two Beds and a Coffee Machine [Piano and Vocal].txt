And she takes another step
Slowly she opens the door
Check that he is sleeping
Pick up all the broken glass
And furniture on the floor
Been up half the night screaming
Now it's time to get away
Pack up the kids in the car

Another bruise to try and hide
Another alibi to write

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on

And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

There are children to think of
Baby's asleep in the backseat
Wonder how they'll ever
make it through this living nightmare
But the mind is an amazing thing
Full of candy dreams and new toys...
... and another cheap Hotel
Two beds and a coffee machine

But there are groceries to buy
And she knows she'll have to go home

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on

And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

Another bruise to try and hide
Another alibi to write
Another lonely highway
In the black of night
But there is hope in the darkness
You know you're gonna make it

Another ditch in the road
Keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on

And the years go by so fast
Silent fortress
Built to last
Wonder how I ever made it---Lyrics submitted by Ingrid.
