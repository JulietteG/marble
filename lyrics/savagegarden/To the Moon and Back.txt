She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory 'bout the bitter one, they're saying

Mama never loved her much and Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but
Somewhere in her private place, she packs her bag for outer space
Now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(And she'll say to him) She's saying

I would fly up to the moon and back if you'll be
If you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?

She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red, then she was colorblind
All her friends, they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined, she's saying

Love is like a barren place, and reaching out for human faith is
It's like a journey I just don't have the map for so
Baby's gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
And send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream) She's saying

I would fly up to the moon and back if you'll be
If you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?

(Hold on, hold on)

Mama never loved her much and Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but
Somewhere in her private place, she packs her bag for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(And she'll say to him) She's saying

I would fly up to the moon and back if you'll be
If you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?

I would fly up to the moon and back if you'll be
If you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby, yeah?---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
