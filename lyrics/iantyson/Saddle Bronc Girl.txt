She's a saddle bronc girl, 
she is one of a kind.
Drives a beat up chevy hedge pack, 
and it moves her down the line.
Big broncer wind, 
in town just up ahead.
Better hold on tight, 
you tapped up just right, 
saddle bronc girl.

If the glory is in the going,
when she might as well get gone.
Oh, she got no way of knowing,
what kinda bronc she's drawn.

On the rodeo road,
she chose the warriors way.
Oh, hold on tight,
it tapped on just right.
Saddle bronc girl.---Lyrics submitted by Marc Smellink.
