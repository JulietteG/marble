All paths follow the beam (x4)
They keep dying but Im still here
All I want to hear is dirt hitting the box
I dont need this
You have become a health risk
Listen for the moan
Better to travel alone
I dont need this
You have become a health risk
I was born on the battlefield
Born into death beneath the wheel
Sirens and screams were my lullabies
I never had the time to learn how to cry
The good times are behind us
If they were every good at all
The future will not find us
You failed me
I failed us all
Abandonment
Sorry is not going to pay the rent
I wanna hear you say it
I wanna see your life sprayed across the walls
Life is the slowest way to die (x4)
I lost you because I wanted to
And they will never end up finding you
And if they do, they wont know its you
Eat it alive
Bury the living
Burn the dead (x2)
As we live, we are surrounded by death. Blinded by the idea that its all thats left.
True life ends when we emerge from the womb.
All clarity comes and is placed in your tomb.---Lyrics submitted by Casey Lejeune.
