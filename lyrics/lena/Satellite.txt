I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear thats blue
And I wore it just the other day
Love you know I'd fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cool
Im gonna love you either way...

Love, Oh, Love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I, Oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
Love my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, Oh, Love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I , Oh, I
Cant go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love oh love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I oh I
Cant go a minute without your love

Where you go, I follow
You set the pace we take it fast or slow
I follow in your wake

Oh oh oh

You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
Its physics... theres no escape

Love my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, Oh, Love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I, Oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, Oh, Love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I, Oh, I
Cant go a minute without your love

Love Love Love
Love
Love
Love ---
