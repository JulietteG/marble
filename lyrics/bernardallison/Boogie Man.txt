I got a funky reputation
Cause I like to get low down
All you loving mothers better lock your daughters
Cause the boogie man's in town

Call me the boogie man
Can't nobody boogie like I can
Call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man

The sheriff's got my number
Cause he locked me up last fall
I taught his daughter how to do the boogie
Now I can't go back at all

Call me the boogie man
Can't nobody boogie like I can
Call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man

I used to play with the travelling band
Down by the county line
I was down there to do some boogie
And I wound up doing time

Call me the boogie man
Can't nobody boogie like I can
Call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man

Tell all your good time women
And __
Just a little taste of my good boogie
Will make you climb the wall

Call me the boogie man
Can't nobody boogie like I can
Call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man---Lyrics submitted by J Stoudemire.
