Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh [x2]

It's amazing the time that its taking for you to come out here
I dont know what you do in there
Only so many ways you change how light will hit your face
Or how you can fix your hair
You only got two eyes, two lips so why
It shouldnt really take long at all
But when you finally smile, cuz its just right
Damn, you look beautiful

You take forever, ever, ever, ever
But youre always worth waiting for
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
I guess Ill wait a little more
Now I know its time I realize Ima be waiting half my life, yeah
With my back up against the door
Cuz you take forever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever everrrr
But you're always worth waiting for

And you lie through your teeth
When you try to convince me that youll be
That youll be out in less than five
Because we both know that the only way that you will ever leave
Is if we set the whole place on fire

You already said you had the perfect dress
So why you gotta try more
No matter how late it gets I must confess
Damn you look beautiful

You take forever, ever, ever, ever
But youre always worth waiting for
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
I guess Ill wait a little more
Now I know its time I realize Ima be spending half my life, yeah
With my back up against the door
Cuz you take forever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever everrrr
But youre always worth waiting for

You take forever, ever, ever, ever
I guess Ill wait a little more
Now now now whoa ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh wha oh oh oh, yeah
Whoa oh wha oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I guess Ill wait a little more---
