Ah 
Ai yeah
Oh no no

Ive got five books sitting at the coffee shop
I just wrote a lyric that make me stop
Think about the world of what I got
Its a beautiful beautiful day

Ive got
Dreams for food and hope for drink
And new chance come in every time I blink
Sunsets dripping of thoughts I think
Its a beautiful beautiful day

(c)
But lately
People keep saying me crazy
And like me in the zoo to waving oh
My lunatic follows dreams

And maybe
I just care more about safety
"About cant ignore but trade these"
Feelings and singing in my head baby singing that 

You can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be change in your mind 
ay yeah

Singing you can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be leave any behind oh

Ive got five books waiting on a "maidnade"
I love seeing films on the middle of the day
Same movie seen in a different way
I dont think that makes me crazy

Ill start work on the absaside
But the clock tic-tac close open at nigh
Id like to write till the early day light
Write music till five
This is my life




(c)
But lately
People keep saying me crazy
And like me in the zoo to waving
My lunatic follows dreams

And maybe
I just care more about safety
"About cant ignore but trade these"
Feelings and singing in my head baby singing that 

You can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be change in your mind 
ay yeah

Singing you can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be leave any behind oh


(b)
Say 
I will way go in a straight exactly forever
This is not so slight disease
We can try and cure
This is one thing in my life
That I know for sure
There is no turning back now
(x2)

Ai yeah

(c)
See lately
People keep saying me crazy
And like me in the zoo to waving oh
Why lunatic follows dreams

And maybe
I just care more about safety
"About cant ignore but trade these"
Feelings and singing in my head baby singing that 

You can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be change in your mind 
ay yeah

Singing you can do this you can do this
You are not a lunatic
Crazy will be leave any behind oh---Lyrics submitted by Candy.
