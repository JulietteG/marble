When I met you, love, I hadn't done the dirty yet,
Call me the unicorn, they said that I didn't exist,
Truth is my heart was torn, the v had a couple of rips
But I was still holding on to the edge with my finger tips

With a little bit of prayer, little bit of porn, sorry,
Couple long nights of sleeping on my own
Waiting for the right one to come along
Waiting for the right one and now I know

That I was holding out for you
Yeah, I've been holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah, they're all haters 'cause they say that we go too loud
I've been holding out for you

And a couple times thought I might not make it
Laying on the bed, both of us half naked
Looking in her eyes something in my heart said save it
Here we go again, another awkward conversation

A little bit of prayer, a little bit of porn, sorry
Couple long nights of sleeping on my own
Waiting for the right one to come along
Waiting for the right one and now I know

That I was holding out for you
Yeah I've been holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah, they're all haters 'cause they say that we go too loud
I've been holding out for you

Cupid's secret is love starts before you meet it [3x]

With a little bit of prayer, little bit of porn, sorry.
Couple long nights of sleeping on my own.
Waiting for the right one to come along
Waiting for the right one and now I know

That I was holding out for you
Yeah, I've been holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah, they're all haters 'cause they say that we go too loud
I've been holding out for you

Holding out for you
Yeah, I was holding out for you
And the neighbors, yeah, they're all haters 'cause they say that we go too loud
Yeah, I've been holding out for you---
