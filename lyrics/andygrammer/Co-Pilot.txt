Girl, it's astounding
The way that you ground me
Just by being around me
Help me stay true
Behind every man is a woman standing
Holding his hand and seeing him through

You're my co-pilot
Always by my side, looking so fly
Baby, you got this
Come to the sky
I know that I'm never flying
In the lightning
Alone

Freedom is over
Rated and over
Do it alone and that goes for me, too
Just like a story
Without an ending
Baby, I'm nothing
Without you

You're my co-pilot
Always by my side, looking so fly
Baby, you got this
Come to the sky
I know that I'm never flying
In the lightning
Alone

Wooah-oh, wooah-oh
And nearly every time that I lean off track
You don't even know but you lead me back-ack-ack-ack

Wooah-oh, wooah-oh
When I'm swimming in the dark
You are the the compass of my heart-art-art

No one can do it alone and

You're my co-pilot
Always by my side, looking so fly
Baby, you got this
Come to sky
I know that I'm never flying
In the lightning
Alone

You're my co-pilot
Always by my side, looking so fly
Baby, you got this
Come to sky
I know that I'm never flying
In the lightning
Alone---
