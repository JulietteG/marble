It doesnt mean youre weak
Or that youve got low self esteem
We all got hearts that forget why they beat
We are brilliant
We are unique
We forget so, effortlessly
And when your questioning your worth
In the way that we all do
And your version of amnesia
Starts to seep on through
And you know that you are great
But you cant remember why
I will be there by your side

I will remind you
I will remind you
I will be, Ill be your memory
I will remind you, I will remind you
All you need, is someone else to see
And theyll remind you

We get a little bit lost
Like ships at sea
We dont remember
Right where were supposed to be
And when youre questioning your worth
From the way that we all do
And your version of amnesia
Starts to seep on through
And you know that you are great
But you cant remember why
I will be there by your side

I will remind you
I will remind you
I will be, Ill be your memory
I will remind you, I will remind you
All you need, is someone else to see
And theyll remind you

A little bit of love from someone you trust
Can bring you back to life
A little bit of love
A little bit of love from someone you trust
Can bring you back to life
A little bit of love
A little bit of love from someone you trust
Can bring you back to life
A little bit of love

I will remind you
I will remind you
I will be, Ill be your memory
I will remind you, I will remind you
All you need, is someone else to see
And theyll remind you ---
