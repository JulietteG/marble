I'm a 5 on a good day 6
I've got plenty of things i need to fix
Bigger chest and dimples in my face
With those I could be pushing a 7 or 8
Guitar in my hand adds a point to my score
No car slides me down to a 4
6 feet with a pair of blue eyes
Brings me back up to a 5
Greater than less than equal too
Were making this way to mathematical 
The value of personality seems to be dead
All walking around with numbered halos on our heads
Threes want fours and fours want fives
Eights think nines have much better lives
And it's a reasonable question to ask
I guess it's all how ya doing the math
And i can sit and i can lie to you
And say this somethin' that i don't do
But i'm a nother number crunchn' fool
Whos calculaters' way overused
Greather than less than equal to
You're making this way to mathematical
The value of personality seems to be dead
All walkin around with numbered halo's on our heads and i'm thinking
just one time
I wish i could have a nine
She'd be hot and she'd be mine just one time
But for every nine theres a two starting back at you
wishing you would do what you wanted the nine to eh
90% of the mental judicial system is based soley on superficial intuition
To me that seems a bit stange
Only talk to people who we think we might be kissn'
That's a lot of ideas to be dismissing
WE leave it to humans to choose the criteria we can't change
It doesn't make sence no doesn't make sense doesn't make sense
For the numbers to be where we are concentrating
In my minor sense i condesense in my minor sense
Asymetrical interactions
Simply evaporating
I'm a five on a good day six
Got plenty of things need to fix
I need a formua or some sort of plan to focus on the soda not the can---Lyrics submitted by Kendall J.
