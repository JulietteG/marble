[Verse 1:]
My mother told me,
She said Andy,
You'll be a man soon,
So understand me.
Most of this world sees,
Women like candy.
You'll be a man who,
Will be standing for me.

[Hook:]
My sisters, my daughters and wives,
Girls who are learning to shine their light.
Dedicate some of your life,
Stand for them all.
Sing it now, me
My sisters, my daughters, and wives,
Girls who are learning to shine their light.
Dedicate some of your life
You will stand for them all,

[Chorus:]
Sing it now
Ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
You don't even have to try.
Oh ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
More than you could realize.

[Verse 2:]
My mother told me,
She said Andy,
I know this song may,
Seem demanding.
But I'll be leaving,
And will be handing,
All of my love to you,
You will be standing for me,

[Hook:]
My sisters, my daughters and wives,
Girls who are learning to shine their light.
Dedicate some of your lives,
Stand for them all,

[Chorus:]
Sing it now,
Ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
You don't even have to try,
Oh ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
More than you could realize.

I'm not sure I'm the best one
To carry this torch,
I'm a mess and my nose is sore
Fallin on my face tryin to
Break the norm,
But I still conform.
And I know you see,
The mistakes I make and wait
Patiently, for me to replace them
And I can't quite seem,
To be the perfect man,
That you needed me to be,
I need you to believe that
I'll be standing here,
Got my sword, I got my shield.
And you keep ringing in my ear,
Oh lord,
Talking bout me,

[Hook:]
My sisters, my daughters, and wives.
Girls who are learning to shine their light.
Dedicate some of your life,
Stand for them all,

[Chorus:]
Sing it now ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
You don't even have to try,
Oh ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
More than you could realize.
Ladies,
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, you don't even have to try,
Sing it ladies
You are beautiful, you are beautiful,
More than you could realize. ---Lyrics submitted by aleixs.
