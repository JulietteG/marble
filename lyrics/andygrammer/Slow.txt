(Verse 1)
A charcoal heart that you can't ignore
Because you've been burned before
You tell me that everything that is good will end
You were building castles in the air
But they fell to the ground there was nothing there
You said you'd never get so close again

And lately, it's yellow lights and you're breaking
Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold
But baby when you find what you're seeking
Something you can believe in you just got to go

(chorus)
So let's not take it slow
Let's not take it slow
I don't want to take it slow
Let's not take it slow

(Verse 2)
I don't want to rush your love
I can never get enough
I'm sitting outside your door
I give you everything you need
Sunshine, the world and all your dreams
So what are we waiting for

But lately, it's yellow lights and you're breaking
Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold
But baby when you find what you're seeking
Something you can believe in you just got to go

(chorus)

(Bridge)
Waiting for the perfect storm
We've been slowly chasing love
Now it's time to cross the line
And I want more

But lately, it's yellow lights and your breaking
Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold
But baby when you find what you're seeking
Something you can believe in you just got to go

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
