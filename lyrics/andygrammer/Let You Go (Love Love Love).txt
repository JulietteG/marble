(Verse 1)
It's like I've been feeling like a helium balloon
You know I'm always on the rise
Or is this love, love, love, love, love?
Dead winter but it feels like June
With a smile I can't hide
Or is this love, love, love, love, love?


No defenses I'm too deep for common sense
Well it's love, love, love, love, love
Oh my I'm so delighted; I don't try to even fight it
I think you should know that I will never let you go

(chorus)
Oh I won't, I won't let you go
I won't let you go
I won't, I won't let you go
I won't let you go
I won't let you go now

(Verse 2)
I've been feeling like you're swimming through my hair
You know you're always on my mind
Or is this love, love, love, love, love?
Dead broke feeling like a millionaire
With a twinkle in my eye
Or is this love, love, love, love, love?

No defenses I'm too deep for common sense
Well it's love, love, love, love, love
Oh my I'm so delighted; I don't try to even fight it
I think you should know, that I will never let you go

(chorus)

(Bridge)
I've been sleeping on a cloud called number nine
Walking on the air and staring at the sky
I can't remember ever feeling so alive
It's like you brought me back to life
Well you turned on all the lights, somehow

No defenses I'm too deep for common sense
Well it's love, love, love, love, love
