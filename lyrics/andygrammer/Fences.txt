Down to earth in the dirt
Used 'em up so I'm out of words
Barely breathing
Still alive as samurais
Cut me up and then down the sides
Stop the bleeding

Did I say, say I know anything? Cause I don't
But I will pay, pay double just to get what I want

I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
I keep swinging
Makes no sense, but I go again
Cause I, I might just be dumb enough
To keep on trying 'til I die
I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah

Steady odds in the eyes
Out of luck, but I roll the dice
Still believing
Keep the faith, no time to pray
Warming up for a Hail Mary
Got that feeling

Did I say, say I know anything? Cause I don't
Yeah, but playing safe, safe isn't really playing at all
At all

I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
I keep swinging
Makes no sense, but I go again
Cause I, I might be just dumb enough
To keep on trying 'til I die
I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences

It's hard when the fire keeps crawling up your sleeves
And it's harder than you ever thought that it could ever be
And a light in the dark is all you wanna see, you wanna see
And it's hard when the fire keeps crawling up your sleeves
And it's harder than you ever thought that it could ever be
And a light in the dark is all you wanna see, all you wanna see

I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
I keep swinging
Makes no sense, but I go again
Cause I, I might be just dumb enough
To keep on trying 'til I die
I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences, ah
I keep swinging
Makes no sense, but I go again
Cause I, I might be just dumb enough
To keep on trying 'til I die
And I keep swinging for the fences, ah, for the fences---
