Being dizzy, fell in love, I'm getting through the day

365 loved and counted to the day
I'm thinking what I did, everything that I've said, that the year got the best of me
One thing about time it waits for nobody, you told me, isn't that what they say
Been banged against it and you know where
Just raised ain't got nothin' to say to nobody
Little lady better get in line, I'm talking this to myself
Better getting on down with the program, sell your life all over
Broke dream in the sun
If you fall like Tom Petty waiting on his rodeo, too old
I'm breaking my rules, do it my way, oh got still stung like a bee

We raced the glow
Shakin' on the floor
I'm trouble, you know
You find us where we fall
We're chasing shadows
We raced the glow
Shakin' on the floor
I'm trouble, you know
You find us where we fall
We're chasing shadows

Always knew I'd be international, no fear of flyin'
Limits is been keepin' apart, just when I'm on an island
Watching through a window, the flashing light on the bed
Neon sign goes red
"You are here" it says, well, at least someone knows where I am

Maybe I won't get it wrong, no patience for myself
Only is, idea's come old, I'm living on the shelf
I will follow in thinkin' the long way if my standards hold me up
Why they eatin' they idols up?
Now, why they eatin' they idols up? Dammit
I give my heart away so that they remember me
I leave em alone in time they'll wanna smother what I say
Around another year I wonder did I go some place
I'ma buckle this one down, this one right here won't walk away

We raced the glow
Shakin' on the floor
I'm trouble, you know
You find us where we fall
We're chasing shadows
We raced the glow
Shakin' on the floor
I'm trouble, you know
You find us where we fall
We're chasing shadows

Always knew I'd be international, no fear of flyin'
Limits is been keepin' apart, just when I'm on an island
Watching through a window, the flashing light on the bed
Neon sign goes red
"You are here" it says, well, at least someone knows where I am

"You are here" it says, well, at least someone knows where I am---
