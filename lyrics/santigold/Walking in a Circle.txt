Walking in a circle
I must have overshot my destiny
Keep hitting the hurdles
They drive them mothers right into me
Think Im a sadist need no rescue
Feel like Im buying into something
When youre in you, just accept the order
You know its futile now to turn around

Walking in a circle
Not gon let them get the best of me
My magic is eternal, I got some tricks, I keep em up my sleeve
Hey zombie, look at what its come to
Youre living in an empty dream
And here I am, right here among you
Awake, but dont know what it means

Im here on my own and here they come
Im Hades, ride home tonight
Here they come to spite

When the lights go out
I am a seer and I know my way out
I always hate it that they make it so complicated
Only when the lights go out
When the lights go out
I disappear and I know what its all about
Its overrated the upgrade is oh it suffocates you
Only when the lights go out

Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle

Walking in a circle
Not gon let them get the best of me
My magic is eternal, I got some tricks, I keep em up my sleeve
Hey zombie, look at what its come to
Youre living in an empty dream
And here I am, right here among you
Awake, but dont know what it means

When the lights go out
I am a seer and I know my way out
I always hate it that they make it so complicated
Only when the lights go out
When the lights go out
I disappear and I know what its all about
Its overrated the upgrade is oh it suffocates you
Only when the lights go out

Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle
Walking in a circle

Now every time I turn around
I cant tell if Im near or far
Been searching for it sometime now
Still no light ahead of me, still no light ahead of me
If I built a fortress, will they call me queen?
If its built of lies it wont mean a thing
Nobodys counting round here no more
Out of touch, what we aiming for
Out of touch, what I came here for?

When the lights go out
I am a seer and I know my way out
I always hate it that they make it so complicated
Only when the lights go out
When the lights go out
I disappear and I know what its all about
Its overrated the upgrade is, oh it suffocates you
Only when the lights go out---
