Walk out on the deck, Manolos and cigarettes
Lookin out from here wondering how far I could get
Running in the circles where the chips are legit
Workin it, I know it aint an easy ticket
And so I take it to the Avenues looking all confident
Tell ya that I used to question what it was, make em incontinent
I once thought theyd all talk about the dress I wore tonight
I mistook all those looks, not for the girl just for the hype

But the one good thing, nipped or tucked
You cannot change your luck
Shake it up, just so the thrill dont stop
Cause when we get stuck
We say thats all it was, all it was

I say come on down, well sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Come on down, well sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself

I got a problem cant get past it
Ill put a man in a casket
I got another thinkin hes in love
I break it to em with a velvet glove
Warning Im hot to trot, you gonna hurt yourself
I know the hunt, it can be beautiful

But the one good thing, nipped or tucked
You cannot change your luck
Shake it up, just so the thrill dont stop
Cause when we get stuck
We say thats all it was, all it was

I say come on down, well sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Come on down, well sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself

Hear what I told ya
Want to make them adore ya
Hear what I told ya
Want to make them adore ya
Hear what I told ya
Want to make them adore ya
Hear what I told ya
Want to make them adore ya

Come on down, well sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Come on down, well sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself

Hear what I told ya (Come on down, well sashay through town)
Want to make them adore ya (They call me the Rendezvous Girl)
Hear what I told ya (Got more power in my calender)
Want to make them adore ya (Than the queen herself)
Hear what I told ya (Come on down, well sashay through town)
Want to make them adore ya (They call me the Rendezvous Girl)
Hear what I told ya (Got more power in my calender)
Want to make them adore ya (Than the queen herself)---
