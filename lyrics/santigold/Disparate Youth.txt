don't look ahead, there's stormy weather
another roadblock in our way
but if we go, we go together
our hand are tied here if we stay

oh, we set our dreams to carry us
in the middle where we were one
now we push right past to find out
or either win what they have lot

oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
our lives worth fighting for
oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
our lives worth fighting for

so let them say we won't do better
lay out the rules that we can't break
they wanna sit and watch you wiggler
their legacy's too hard to take

oh, we set our dreams to carry us
in the middle where we were one
now we push right past to find out
or either win what they have lost

oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
our lives worth fighting for
oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
our lives worth fighting for

in their heads and in their beds
in their eyes it shows
when the freedom breaks
and you ask and they don't know
oh tell me then
i turn my back while the odds all stand beneath me
and they all said i was mislead
but the odds now standing with me

oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
oh, we set our dreams to carry us
in the middle where we were one
now we push right past to find out
or either win what they have lost

oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
our lives worth fighting for
oh ah, oh ah
we know now we won't go
oh ah, oh ah
our lives worth fighting for---
