Oooh woah oh oooh, oooh
I cant get enough of myself

If I wasnt me, I can be sure I'd wanna be
Im pretty major and Ill say it out loud
Living a, living a fantasy
Live in, I live in my vanity
Hey mom, hey do you see me now

I call what I see and if I judge by my selfie
Look at my neighbours I'm the best thing around
Living a, living a fantasy
Live in, I live in my vanity
Hey mom, hey do you see me now

All I wanna do is what I do well
Ain't a gambler but honey I'd put money on myself
All I wanna do is bottle it to sell
Cause my brand of vainglory is much better for your health

Woah oooh oooh
I cant get enough
I don't know about you
But I cant get enough of myself
Woah oooh oooh
I cant get enough
I dont know about you
But I cant get enough of myself

Ha ha, funny me, life of the party, VIP
Got so much flavor, put me on the buffet
Look at them, look at them liking me
Look at them, look, what a sight to see
So hot, they be wiping me down

Who now could it be, calling the paparazzi
Well, since you're here now, baby, fire away
Look at them, look at them liking me
Look at them, look, what a sight to see
So hot, they be wiping me down

All I wanna do is what I do well
Ain't a gambler but honey I'd put money on myself
All I wanna do is bottle it to sell
Cause my brand of vainglory is much better for your health

My lifes a party, Im filling my cup
Listen up, oh-o-oh, listen up, oh-o-oh
