Mama says a what she want, mama says a what she want
If you mess with me, you wrestlin with the deep, I tell you what
Yes, you like a sycophant, hit you like an elephant
Fore you know I got you where I want like a wonder woman

And I know its heavy, heavy, heavy
Cause I shoot straight and I shoot steady, steady, steady
Maybe you wonder, come and get me, get me, get me
You rub me wrong and I get testy, testy, testy

Big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
I got big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
Big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
I got big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one

I got the mouth full of venom
I got the key to the system
I got the beat, let it hit them
I got it all, wanna get some

Mama take a what she want, mama take a what she want
If ya wait and see, with no army she win, get what she want
Baby cry, she hush him up, hubby think he run the show
Go to work, she wreckin shit like a bulldozer, rake it up

And I know its heavy, heavy, heavy
Cause I shoot straight and I shoot steady, steady, steady
Maybe you underestimate me, maybe, maybe
I got it, you can come and get it, get it, get it

Big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
I got big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
Big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
I got big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one

I got the mouth full of venom
I got the key to the system
I got the beat, let it hit them
I got it all, wanna get some

Dont got no time for your huffin
Dont got no time for your bark
Know when I want to, Im take ya
And it dont matter who you are, I gotta tell you

Im big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
I got big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
Big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one
I got big boss, big time, business
Make me your mark and Ill take you one by one

I got the mouth full of venom
I got the key to the system
I got the beat, let it hit them
I got it all, want to get some---
