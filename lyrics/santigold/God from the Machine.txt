You can make it alone if you try
Till it be come home, I know you sing it
You can make it alone if you try
Will never see you fall till you'll make it out

When are you with them let it go
You'll either gonna rock the boat
Or have a [?]
Now you're somewhere removed and think you got it when you're broke
Or are you passionate
Something that you wrote
It's gonna make a good lifeboat
Asylum for the [?]
Crumbling below
[?]
So while we're waiting

You can make it alone if you try
Till it be come on, I know you sing it
You can make it alone if you try
Will never see you fall till you'll make it out [x2]

Is what you know but you can tell us so
Just what it just let it go, for fear they'll turn it down
You can see the [?] smoke and then you know that's something wrong
You're holding on for now
Aiming for the mark, how is it that your score's not high
Now flashlights in the dark
Even with the heart, you know you're better from the start
Don't let it weight you down

You can make it alone if you try
Till it be come on, I know you sing it
You can make it alone if you try
Will never see you fall till you'll make it out [x2]

Oh now you leave them alone, you're on your own

You can make it alone if you try
Till it be come on, I know you sing it
You can make it alone if you try
Will never see you fall till you'll make it out [x2]---
