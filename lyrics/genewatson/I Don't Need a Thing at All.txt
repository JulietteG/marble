Some folks go out dancing
It seems to be their thing
And young girls get up running
When the telephone rings
And people think of lonely things
When leaves begin to fall
But me I don't need a thing at all

Old men get off on checkers
And boys ride off on bikes
But I get off and go on home
When the whistle blows at five
My favorite things are rain storms
And whippoorwills that call
Oh, but I, I don't need a thing at all.

'Cause I got you
And your the thing that makes me happy
Your everything I thought I'd never find.

I guess everybodies got a thing but me
I've got it all
I've got you so I don't need a thing at all... ---Lyrics submitted by debbie jones.
