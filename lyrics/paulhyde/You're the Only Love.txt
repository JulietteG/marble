Won't be home today, I'll be seeing you tomorrow
I just had to say that I've got no more time for sorrow
my love was like a small ship, lost across the sea
just when all my hope was gone you came to rescue me

Soon I'll be gone then I'll be dreaming about you
don't get me wrong I'm only crazy without you
You're the only love (you're the only love)
You're the only love (you're the only love)
This heart has ever known

I'll keep you safe for me, I will be your only lover
and everything's all right, girl there will never be another (oh no)
My love was like a garden turning into stone
all the flowers were gone, the weeds were overgrown
There's one thing I want you to know
I've finally found what I meant to
Now my face is filled with laughter

Soon I'll be gone then I'll be dreaming about you
don't get me wrong I'm only crazy without you
You're the only love (you're the only love)
Yeah yeah...

Soon I'll be gone then I'll be dreaming about you
don't get me wrong I'm only crazy without you
You're the only love (you're the only love)
You're the only love (you're the only love)
You're the only love (you're the only love)
This heart has ever known---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
