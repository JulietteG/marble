Well the lights are on, its time to go
Gotta hit the stage for another show
Knockin the dust off the rust belt tonight
I started out, all by myself
But Im lucky now that Ive found some help to
Knock the dust off the rust belt tonight

Have you seen whats happenin round here?
You ask most people, they dont care
But now is the time we have to do things right
So were knockin the dust off the rust belt tonight

From the C-H-I to the S-T-L
I was born raise a ruckus and do it well
Knockin the dust off the rust belt tonight
Take a jazz band with a country beat
Its Midwestern Swing for your dancin feet
Were gonna knock the dust off the rust belt tonight

A newspaperman said it couldnt be done
But I lived it, I wrote it, in a song I sung
Knockin the dust off the rust belt tonight
This aint your momma and your daddys Midwest
We have what it takes to stand the test
Knockin the dust off the rust belt tonight---
