Last night I dreamt you were a glass of rioja
Wine we drank on the first night we met
If you could cross my tongue, and trace through my veins
You could have gone with me on the morning I left

Oh, la meva maca senorita
You danced the sardana, bare feet on the floor
And when you get tired lay your head on my chest
Please hear my song, dont you cry no more

Oh, my heart is a bird that sings while youre gone
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
The loneliest song that youve ever heard
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Goodbye, Barcelona, so glad Ive been shown ya
Im going, Im leaving the land of the sun
For the far north where I dont want to go
Where the rain it stops for no one
But Im bringing a bottle of rum

I was just thinking about my return
Temptation like oranges lies ripe on the vine
Sagrada Familia grows taller each year
Like my love for you that grows stronger with time---
