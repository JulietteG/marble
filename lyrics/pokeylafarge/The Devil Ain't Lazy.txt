Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
He roams around with sticks and stones
Passes out his moans and groans
Devil aint no lazybones - he works 24 hours a day

Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
No, the Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
Likes to see us fight and fuss
Makes us mean enough to cuss
Then he blames it all on us -  he works 24 hours a day

He travels like a lightning streak
And he strikes from town to town
And if he gets you when youre weak
Hell tear your playhouse down

Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
No, the Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
Tells us he wont hurt a fly
But then he makes us steal and lie
Keeps us sinning until we die  he works 24 hours a day

Instrumentals

Oh, the Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
The Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
Gets his pitchfork out each night
Gives the folks an awful fright
I know he does it just for spite  he works 24 hours a day

Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
Oh, the Devil aint lazy (no sirree)
He tells us how to find success
And I know you wind up in distress (Ill tell you why)
The Devil is an awful mess  he works 24 hours a day

He likes to see things scorch and burn
So, dont make no excuse
If he catches you hell turn you anyway but loose

Nah, the Devil aint lazy
Say, the Devil aint lazy
So, if you think youre strong and brave
Smart enough to not behave
Youve got one foot in the grave  he works 24 hours a day

24 hours a day  yes he does
He works 24 hours a day
He works 24 hours a day---Lyrics submitted by Ken Christopher.
