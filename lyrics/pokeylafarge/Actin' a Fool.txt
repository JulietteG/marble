Some days up, some days down
Think Ill jump into the river and drown
With no means for healing, no cure can be found
If I end up drinking everything in the room
Im just, actin a fool, forgetting you
Actin a fool, forgetting you

Look over the horizon, what do you see?
Another sun is setting on me
Last rays of sunlight, taking my sanity
If you see me howling, howling at the moon
Im just, actin a fool, forgetting you
Actin a fool, forgetting you

Everyone has a story, every song has an end
Now I am finished and I wont sing again
Ill drink myself green, dont mind that money I spend
You were the last thing I had left to lose
Ill be, actin a fool, forgetting you
Actin a fool, forgetting you

Some days up, some days down
Think Ill jump into the river and drown
With no means for healing, no cure can be found
If I end up drinking everything in the room
Im just, actin a fool, forgetting you
Actin a fool, forgetting you
Actin a fool, forgetting you
Im just actin a fool, forgetting you---
