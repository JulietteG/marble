She tried to peel me off the pavement,
Tried to insinuate,
Sometimes I am in danger of going too far,
Said would I like to go for tea and toast,
Get your hand off my thigh,
In the car, she turned to me and said

You're not nineteen forever,
Pull yourselves together,
I know it seems strange,
But things, they change.
Older woman and a younger man,
Both of them doing all they can.

Trying to get your attention all night long,
asked you once, asked you four times,
if you'd like to dance to that song so,
I front crawled the crowd down the stairs,
And then I followed you out, in the rain,
No where to be found,
Never mind, you'll probably never look that pretty again.

You're not nineteen forever,
Pull yourselves together,
I know it seems strange,
But things, they change.
Older woman and an ever so slightly younger man,
God bless the band, they're doing all they can.

You're not nineteen forever,
Pull yourselves together,
I know it seems strange,
But things, they change.
Older woman and an ever so slightly younger man,
God bless the band, they're doing all they can.

You're not nineteen forever,
You're not nineteen forever,
You're not nineteen forever,
It's not big, you're definately not clever.---Lyrics submitted by Jessie-May.
