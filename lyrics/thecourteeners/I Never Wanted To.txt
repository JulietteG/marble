She locked me in with her City centre apartment dryer eye smile
And the way she approached our language
With such precision and ease
I started chanting at the frame of the door
She said get in you berk  put your coat on the floor
Get into that kitchen and start chopping those E's please

But, I never wanted to
didn't know what to do
She was the one that suggested 
She practically molested..... me

Course that's what your friends would say
They never liked me anyway
I sat down, I did not try and hold her hand
Never-mind.... try and get in her sack
Should've seen her face when I said, 'Darling, No.' 
Didn't think she was ever, gonna, ever let me go
The cheeky bitch, even asked for her lighter back

I never wanted to
didn't know what to do
She was the one that suggested 
She practically molested..... me

Instrumental.......

I never wanted to
didn't know what to do
She was the one that suggested 
She practically molested..... me
