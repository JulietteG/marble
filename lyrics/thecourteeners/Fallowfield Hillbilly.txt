So i said is that all that matters anymore ?
Who happened to like that band first
and who likes them more?
Why do you compensate for the fact 
that you clearly so oh very silly
by walking around my town like a fallowfield hillbilly ?

You know who you are

Ive seen the way you look at all of the normal kids
You think that theyve just come out Strangeways
Because they won't bat both eyelids

When you walk past with your eyeliner on, one hand in glove
Theyre here for the music the thing that they love

And it was literally carnage at the back of piccadilly
To see who could buy it first
and does the limtied edition seven inch quench your thirst ?
For an album that will probably let you down
But it doesnt even matter coz' you dont like that band anymore
coz' theyre not underground

Ive seen the way you look at all of the normal kids 
You think that theyve just come out Strangeways 
just because they dont bat both eyelids
when you walk past with your eyeliner on, one hand in glove
im gonna ask you, can you find your own way home are you stuck ?

please dont think that im being a bitch
i just happen to witness a lot of things which
get me annoyed cos you're filling a void
have you got nothing better to do ?

ive seen the way you look at all of the normal kids 
you think that theyve just come out Strangeways
because they won't bat both eyelids

when you walk past with your eyeliner on, one hand in glove
im gonna ask you, can you play guitar my boy ?
can you fu*k---Lyrics submitted by ethan.
