Melody day what have I done? Oh
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
And when you smile it melts away again

Melody day where have you gone? Oh
All thee hope I had has gone away
And what we had has come undone
And when you smile it melts away again

Melody day what have I done? Oh
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
And when you smile it melts away again

Tell them, Oh
Tell them I always knew why, Oh
So long, Oh
So long to say goodbye
