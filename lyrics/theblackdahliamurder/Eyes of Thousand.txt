Paralyzing atrophy locked in her web of mimicry
Suspended inverted waiting to die

Dexterous segmented limbs
Fangs to sink within your skin
They seek to find vacancy
With your withered heart
She lives for the hunt man
And you are the kill
Now feel that venom spread
It hardening your arteries
Ensnared soon to be dead

A shadow of your former
A mere shell of a man
Degenerated tortured hallowed
And spit into the earth again
To terminally lust for
To love one's self to death
Regret the day you heard the tune
That trapped you in the sirens nest

Enchanting the flower of disease
Beware her silken surprise
She'll throttle you down to your knees
She'll suck you dry

Lost inside her eyes of thousand
The deadly kiss of a mistress venomous

Soulless you fell before her
Quenching her ravenous thirst
Strip mining your essence
She'll turn your universe to black
Emasculating glutton for perverse punishment
Lecherous and deviant perfume to mask her scent
To the naked eye immaculate to her victim poisonous
She'll wrap you up so tight she'll suffocate without relent

Enchanting the flower of disease
Beware her silken surprise
She'll throttle you down to your knees
She'll suck you dry---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
