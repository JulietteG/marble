Father I know that you've witnessed a darkness in me
Twas spawned in shadows of the old gallow's tree
I'm but a sad depraved reflection of our inhumanity
The warped exaggeration of the lost and darkest of dreams

Bring forth a wrath of cleansing fire
Here now in mankind's bleakest hour

Born of a casket I'm the heir to a corpse
I've eyes that see maggots through the thin flesh they bore
I shall bloody my hands til the last breath be torn from me
So blindly we walk the winds of these plaged streets
Dead the once fuelling part of me

O lord divine please break this silence
Destroy your race of faceless liars

At the edge of existence
We the clays of intention have ripened in your image
Ah the binds of tradition
Your archaic deception numbs our empty beings
City that stands on a million graves
In a world full of hatred to fear enslaved
Countless the dead slaughtered in your name
Not a utter of your voice have you once repaid

No above no below just a man letting go
When all my earthly desire is disowned
No screaming sirens should sound
No revelations profound
Simply lowered into the ground
That's just what I'll be dead in the dirt
So blindly we walk the winds of these plagued streets
Dead the once fuelling park of me

Bring forth a wrath of cleansing fire
Here now in mankinds bleakest hour
O lord divine please break this silence
Destroy your race of faceless liars
