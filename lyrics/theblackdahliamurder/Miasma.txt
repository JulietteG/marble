In between, we insidious vapor shall teem
looming so loathesome!
And it seems to me like I'm dead inside
Bloated corpse, propped out of tradition!

I can never recall what it was I had ever to strive for 
As a youth,
was it just to exist, autonomously?

No we don't wanna work
We just wanna fuck,
Swallow pills and forget our curses!

No we don't need pigs like you!
We'll follow the laws of our emptying veins.

In this world of nothing for me.
I'd be sooner destroyed.
Vampire youth! Raise your cups to the ne'er waning moon,
let its visage ring true!

To the hearts cold and blue,
we're dying each moment.. FREE!
we're all animals here
Flesh and Blood! Bone and Dream!

We're just impulses here.
Another piece of shit in the storm!

JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF SHIT!

SHIT!

From the smelling of things it appears this shit has come to a boil.
The night-time we shall rule as our own!
While the hollow shall sleep,
we shall bark at the moon.

In this world of nothing for me!
I'd be sooner destroyed!
In this world there is nothing for us but the sound (but the sound)

Vampire youth! Raise your cups to the ne'er waning moon,
let its visage ring true!

To the hearts cold and blue,
we're dying each moment.....

We'll never sleep again!
We'll be going fucking mad!
Sin and Hell is all we will ever know!
Just another piece of shit!---Lyrics submitted by Jon.
