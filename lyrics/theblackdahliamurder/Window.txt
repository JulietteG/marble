I sodomize the young and dying,
This sick hunger is my vice.
my lust To drip my rotten seed upon their cooling flesh so fare,
Of their gurgled screams I could never hear enough.

Bless their puny hearts and their sweet naiveties,
Praise those little lemmings,
But rats unto the piper.
Bless those putrid beasts,
Their innocence my blades eager to meet.
May my song of hatred lead them forever downward.

I fill the mouth with semen while the head still blinks and shakes,
Ten seconds is the window,
Another child has met his fate.
I hold the grisly treasure skyward,
Have a laugh into its face,
Bless all Earths most precious children with my blackened love insane.

Ive come to revel in the horror no words nor nightmare could describe,
The erotic waves of lurid rapture,
That moment when they realize.
Bless those little wonders and their curiosities,
Praise those little maggots but lambs unto my slaughter,
A blessed life so cheap,
Their perfect flesh will be the ideal treat,
May my song of worship bring them ever closer.

I fill the mouth with semen while the head still blinks and shakes,
Ten seconds is the window,
Another child has met his fate.
I hold the grisly treasure skyward,
Have a laugh into its face,
Bless all Earths most precious children with my blackened love insane.

Im insane,

[Solo]

How theyll be hunting for us nightly,
Tirelessly combing to no end,
Your shameful death to be in a shroud of mystery.
Youll never see the light of day again,
Slitting their bellies open wide,
So wide.
A great delight to look inside.
I sit upon their chests until they cease,
Expressionless ejaculating whilst they die.

I fill the mouth with semen while the head still blinks and shakes,
Ten seconds is the window,
Another child has met his fate.
I hold the grisly treasure skyward,
Have a laugh into its face,
Bless all Earths most precious children with my blackened love insane.---Lyrics submitted by luke hall.
