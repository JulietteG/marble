This is a reckoning
A clichd cut of lying tongue
Revenge never goes out of style

Gorilla honing trigger-finger
That makes gorilla man
Ingrained, there's hate within us all

Spiraling I've lost my footing once again
I'm flailing in a tantrum of disgust

When life holds nothing sacred
When the loveless turn to loathe
We'll witness this final threatened pose

(Oh!) Oh, Mother War!
Sleep in your arms tonight, I'm burning
I'm burning for your love
(This) This juggernaut of bronze and alcohol
Machines of vengeance now are born

In vengeance we are born
To our graves these grudges shall be sworn
The ultimate death of emotion never mourned
We'll die before we crawl

Twisted ministers of death
Praying for a bullet hail
Gorilla, suffocate!
Gorilla, maim!
An education in...

Howling!

Ministers of death
We'll be praying,
Praying for this bullet hail
Gorilla, suffocate!
Gorilla, maim!
An education in complete misanthropy

[solo]

(Oh!) Oh, Mother War!
Sleep in your arms tonight, I'm burning
I'm burning for your love
(This) This juggernaut of bronze and alcohol
Machines of vengeance now are born

(Oh!) Oh, Mother War!
Sleep in your arms tonight, I'm burning
I'm burning!

In vengeance we are born
To our fucking graves
The greatest tribe forever,
Forever!---Lyrics submitted by Alexander Hunter.
