Time, just keeps on slipping away
I can feel the hands of the clock
Tick, tick, ticking away
But it's nothing more than my mind
Slowly giving away
We've got so much time, to think about yesterday
Just thinking on yesterday

And she says, stop you know you lift me up dancing
You know how to find me, and you take me away
With your idea of happiness and your heroes in your life
Now there's something I want to, tell you before you
Walk away

Time, brings me to another day
Whether I'm ready or not
Tick, tick, ticking away
But it's nothing more than my mind
This ticking in my head won't stop
We've got so much time, just thinking of yesterday

And she says, stop you know you lift me up dancing
You know how to find me, and you take me away
With your idea of happiness and your heroes in your life
Now there's something I want to, tell you before you
Walk away

I don't know what this happiness will bring but I'll never let you down
All these thoughts will make you feel king so lay me down, down

And she says, stop you know you lift me up dancing
You know how to find me, you take me away
With your idea of happiness and your heroes in your life
Now is something I want to, tell you before you
Walk away.---
