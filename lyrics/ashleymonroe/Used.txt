Used
Like an old piano played for generations slowly fading out of tune
Used
Like the soles on the bottom of my favorite pair of dancing shoes 
I know I'm not some bright and shiny polished up car that's sparkling new
Right off the salesman floor 
Yeah I've got some dents and bruises 
I've been dropped and there's a scar where my heart was broke before
In the end I'll be worth a whole lot more 
Used Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Na Na Na Na 
Used
Like a book read so many times front to back it starts to break in two
Used 
Like a house where a family lived until they died
And there's a soul in every room
I know I'm not some brand new dress hanging there perfectly pressed
That never has been worn
I've got some buttons missing and there's a couple stains 
And places where the fabric has been torn
In the end I'll be worth a whole lot more
Used Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Na Na Na 
Used Na Na Na Na
This fragile heart's been passed around been ignored and been let down 
Been learning since the day that I was born 
Everything it has been through has lead me down this road to you
I can give like I couldn't give before 
In the end I can love a whole lot more 
Used Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Na Na Na Na---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
