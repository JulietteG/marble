I'd kiss you if I dared.
I want to, but I'm scared.
I should have known:
I've been alone too long.

My lips are much too still.
My arms have lost their skill.
My charm has flown:
I've been alone too long.

It's been years since I have whispered 
a foolish love word.
And I'd be afraid I'd sing you a faded song.

But if you smile and then
Say "Darling, try again,"
I'll know you've known:
I've been alone too long.

[instrumental]

But if you smile and then
Say "Darling, try again,"
I'll know you've known:
I've been alone too long.

--words and music by Dorothy Fields, Arthur Schwartz---Lyrics submitted by Jim Parker.
