How many times can I die?
How many times can I break inside?
How many times can I pray, oh, Lord, to take this pain away?
He was the song in my soul.
But now that song will never play.
Instead a silence now falls over me.
How many tears have I felt before I learned to forgive myself?
How many trials can I face before I start to lose my faith?
How many hearts have to mend before the poet rhymes again?
'Cuz the feeling of you covers me.
Refrain:
If I ever love again, it would be with you again.
'Cuz there's nothing that I can do to make me keep me away from you.
If I ever love again, it would be with you again.
'Cuz my life in not complete, baby till you're here with me.
How many times did I try to hold you near when you said goodbye?
How times did you judge before you knew who I really was?
You were the fire in my day
But now the flame has burned away.
And only shades of the past color me.
Refrain.
He was the song in my soul.
But now that song will never play.
Instead, a silence now falls over me.
Refrain.
I can't help myself.
I want you and no one else.
Baby it's the way I feel over you.
Baby till you're here with me...
