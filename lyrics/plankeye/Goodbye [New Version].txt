It's difficult to say goodbye after only one life
The rain will fall down replenishing all of our broken dreams
And this burning tree that's withering will bloom again
Would you believe?

Goodbye, goodbye
Walk away it's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Walk away it's hard to say goodbye

Now all that's left
Pictures on the walls
Memories and stories that are told
The more often told the bigger they get
Create a legacy lest we forget

Goodbye, goodbye
Walk away it's time to say goodbye

No longer can I hold onto this defeated change in heart 
I swear
It's time to sing "fare thee well" to life as we know it

My voice it will be, 
You know I will be, 
Yes it will be still

Something woke me up in the midst of dream and fantasy
Halfway there but He always fills my cup
And He lifts me up oh how He lifts me up

Goodbye, goodbye
Walk away it's time to say goodbye

I never took the time 
To stop and realize 
That death takes many forms
Even while alive---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
