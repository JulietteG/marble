Everybody's taking what they can but they can't decide
They do what they want cause any kind of feeling's alright
And don't be talking maybe, your mama's flying high as a kite
You're just like the next one cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming
If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming
If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming

Everybody's faking like they can, it makes it alright
Tell me what you want to cause I don't know the wrong from the right
Just don't be talking maybe your mama's still high as a kite
And I'm just like the next one cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming
If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming
If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming

...

If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming
If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming
If so,
If so,
We know we'll be coming... ---
