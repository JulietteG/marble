Intro: Down(Down), Down(Down), Down(Down), Down(Down) 

Here I am with all these questions hanging from my ceiling low 
And one day they'll keep telling me I told you so 
Everywhere I turn I see red lights flashing over my head 
Oh no, oh no, oh no 
In a whirl-wind spinning yeah somehow it knocked me off my feet 
But I know better than to let it get the best of me, 
I could give up, I could stay stuck, or I could move on 

So I put one foot front of the other, 
No no no nothing's gonna break my stride, 
I keep climbing, gonna keep fighting until I make it to the other side of down 

In the sky, Im standing under all I see is endless rain 
I think I spot a silver light hiding in the grey 
I might get tossed around, but I'm always bouncing back 
oh.oh.oh 
I could give up, I could stay stuck, or I could move on.

Chorus:
So I put one foot front of the other, 
No no no nothing's gonna break my stride, 
I keep climbing, gonna keep fighting until I make it to the other side of down 

On the other side of down 
It keeps calling me 
Where I wanna be 
On The other side of down 
it keeps calling me 
where I wanna be 
where I wanna be 

Ohhh I put one foot front of the other, 
No no no nothing's gonna break my stride, 
I keep climbing, gonna keep fighting until I make it to the other side of down---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey.
