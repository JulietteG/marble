Desperate, desperate...

You're reaching out, and no one hears you cry
You're freaking out again, cause all your fears remind you
And all the dream has come undone
You feel so small, then lost that you're the only one
You wanna scream, cause you're desperate

[Chorus]
You want somebody, just anybody
To lay the hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason to keep believing
That someday you're gonna see the light

You're in the dark, there's no one left to call
Your sleep's your only friend
But even sleep can't hide you
From all those tears and all the pain
And all the days you wasted pushing them away
It's your life, it's time to face it

[Chorus]
You want somebody, just anybody
To lay the hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason to keep believing
That someday you're gonna see the light

Cause you're desperate, desperate
Desperate, desperate
Cause you're desperate, desperate
Now

You know that things has got to change
You can't go back, you'll find your way
And day by day, you start to come alive

You want somebody, just anybody
To bring some peace to your soul tonight
You want a reason to keep believing
That someday you're gonna see the light

You want somebody, just anybody
To lay the hands on your soul tonight
You want a reason to keep believing
That someday you're gonna see the light---Lyrics submitted by angelina.
