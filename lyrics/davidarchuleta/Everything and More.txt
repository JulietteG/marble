You see a storm heading our way
You know the cold can make things delay, up here it can't do any harm.
The cracks show in the concrete jungle
Tear apart the weakest of hearts, up here you'll be safe in my arms.
Oh.

I know that you're feeling like we're only dreaming
Well don't look down 'cause this is real.

Like a satellite we're flying
Overhead where we see it all.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything and more.
There's no turning back from this point.
Reaching heights like never before.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything, we're everything and more.

Let's try holding each other, found a love to last forever.
Up here gives you wings to stay strong, ooh.
The air is pure that we're breathing.
We're something to believe in, 'cause I feel it's where we both belong.

I know that you're feeling like we're only dreaming
Well don't look down 'cause this is real.

Like a satellite we're flying
Overhead where we see it all.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything and more.
There's no turning back from this point.
Reaching heights like never before.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything, we're everything and more.

Trust me this is worth not falling back to Earth.
Everything and more is up here.

Like a satellite we're flying
Overhead where we see it all.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything and more.
There's no turning back from this point.
Reaching heights like never before.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything and more.

Nothing can touch us, we're everything, we're everything and more.
We're everything and more, hey.---Lyrics submitted by Juni Noviyanti.
