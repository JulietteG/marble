Tell me what you did to me,
Just air beneath my feet.
Didn't even notice we were miles above the ground.
I'm not afraid oh heights,
We crash into the sky,
Didn't know that I could feel the way that I do now

I'm not asking for an explanation.
All I know is that you take me away,
And you show me how to fly...

Nothing brings me down when your around,
It's like zero gravity.
The world just disappears when you're here.
It's zero gravity.
When things get messed up you lift my head up,
and I get lost in the clouds.
There's no sense of time with you and I.
It's zero gravity.

The edges fade away,
'Till there's no more shades of gray.
You only have to whisper anything all.
You opened up my eyes,
You turned my lows to highs,
And that's the only way that I know how to fall.
Not gonna analyze and try to fight it,
Don't even care if it makes no sense at all,
Cause with you I can fly...

Nothing brings me down when your around,
It's zero gravity.
The world just disappears when you're here.
It's zero gravity.
When things get messed up you lift my head up,
and I get lost in the clouds.
There's no sense of time with you and I.
It's zero gravity.

You make it so easy,
To just drift away..
I can't imagine,
Being without you..

Don't think about...
Don't think about...
Don't think about...
Don't think about...
Don't think about it...

Nothing brings me down when your around,
It's like zero gravity.
The world just disappears when you're here.
It's zero gravity.

Nothing brings me down when your around,
It's like zero gravity.
The world just disappears when you're here.
It's zero gravity.
Zero gravity.---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Gray.
