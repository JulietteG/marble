Wasting time, just going mindless
Watching your charades
When you were younger did it occur to you
10 years from then you'd act the same age

I cannot carry on this way
Although I've carried all your every little thing
Carry me away

Did you feel like stomping the roses
Smashing out all the feeling inside of them?
It's bad business
The way you're stomping the roses

I was flipping channels on my television
And it made me feel unwell
One of those complicated soap operas
I almost felt like I was watching myself

I cannot carry on this way
Although I've carried all your every little thing
Carry me away

Did you feel like stomping the roses
Smashing out all the feeling inside of them?
It's bad business
The way you're stomping the roses
Everyone knows it

I know, I know, I know, I know it's over
And I know, I know, I know I've
Always been your token nice guy

I know that you rule your whole world
Thought I could live in it
But I just can't

You know you're stomping the roses
Smashing out all the feeling inside of them
It's bad business
The way you're stomping the roses
Everyone knows it

Stomping the roses
Smashing out all the feeling inside of them
It's bad business
The way you're stomping the roses

Stomping, stomping, yeah
Take it easy, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Amelia Daubs.
