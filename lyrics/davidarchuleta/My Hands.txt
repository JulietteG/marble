Accidentally, on purpose
I dropped my watch behind the tire
Threw my alarm clock inside the fire place, yeah

And I put the parental control on
On the news and the weather channel
Im outside, in my hope, I'm looking for you, oh

If everything stop
Ill listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But its harder to hold on
To your hands in the hands of time
I need your hand
Girl, Im trying to hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
Im trying to hold on

Im standing here, open hands
And I know I cant do this alone
Hold on, hold on
Baby hold on 
(Can you hold on to my hands)
Can you hold on to my hands?
(Don't let go of my hands)
Dont let go

I dont think this is working
Reachin so hard my hands are hurting
Trying to let go in the first place, yeah
And I put the phone on the front along 
Everything that shows time is gone
Im outside in this cold and looking for you

If everything stop
Ill listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But its harder to hold on
To your hands in the hands of time
I need your hand
Girl, Im trying to hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
Im trying to hold on

Im standing here, open hands
And I know I cant do this alone
Hold on, hold on
Baby hold on 

(Hold on to my hands)
Hold on to my hands, ohh
(Dont let go of my hands)
Dont ever let it go
(Can you hold on to my hands)
Can you hold on to my hands, yeah
(Dont let it go)
Don't let it go
Ohhhh

If everything stop
Ill listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But its harder to hold on
To your hands in the hands of time
I need your hand
Girl, Im trying to hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
Im trying to hold on

Im standing here, open hands
And I know I cant do this alone
Hold on, hold on
Baby hold on 

(Hold on to my hands)
Hold on to my hands
(Dont let go of my hands)
Dont let go, ohhh
(Hold on to my hands)
Hold on to my hands
(Dont let go)
Ohhhh

(Hold on to my hands)
Hold on to my hands
(Dont let go of my hands)
Dont let go
(Hold on to my hands)
Hold on to my hands
(Dont let go)
Dont let go---Lyrics submitted by Ella.
