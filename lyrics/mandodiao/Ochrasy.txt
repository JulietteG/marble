I feel dizzy all laid back and I'm to blind too see whats going on outside my lonely window
I'm turning on the TV-screen watch the news for a while then I fall back too sleep again

And I'm dreaming about times, times that are gone, 
times when I lived alone in my own land called Ochrasy
That place was everything too me, the word I maid it up you see, 
It's all there in my fantasy and I believe it 
I'm waking up again and see that war on screen again 
and it makes me wanna go and hide
This world is full of misery, the anger is too big too see 
that's why I had to dream this dream

I was dreaming about times, times that are gone, 
times when I lived alone in my own land called Ochrasy
That place was everything too me, the word I maid it up you see, 
It's all there in my fantasy and I believe it 
now they come again all the soldiers without chain dressed in black and equiped with fire

They can stop our happy days and put us in the graves, 
but never reach the Ochrasy

"whistle"

I was dreamin about times, times that are gone, 
times when I lived alone in my own land called Ochrasy
Ohh, That place was everything too me, 
the word I maid it up you see, It's all there in my fantasy 
and I beleive it I'm waking up again, and see that war on screen again 
and it makes me wanna to go and hide

This world is full of misery, the anger is too big too se thats why I had to dream this drem...---Lyrics submitted by Johanna.
