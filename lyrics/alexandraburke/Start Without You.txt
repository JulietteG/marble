Don't make me start without you... 

RedOne 
I don't want to start without you 
Alexandra 
I don't want to start without you 
Hey... 

Eh, hey, I'm like a beast 
Eh, hey, i'm like a beast 
DJ drop the record, Imma start a stampede 
He drop the record, I start a stampede 
Eh, boy, I push it out 
Eh, boy, I push it out 
Fire, move my body like a merry-go-round 
Front to the back, I'll make you go round 

Get like me 
Get on the dancefloor 
Get like me 
(Don't want to start without you) 

Oh, here I go, drip droppin' way down low 
You're 'bout to miss 
Winding to this 
Don't make me start without you 
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow 
I'm coming up 
Put down your cup 
Don't make me start without you 

Eh, boy, way that I move 
Eh, boy, way that I move 
Body like a weapon that'll make you go boom 
Get like a drum I'll make you go...boom 
Eh, boy, oi where you at? 
Eh, boy, oi where you at? 
You're the only one and I'm all on my back 
The only one I want on my back 


Get like me 
Get on the dancefloor 
Get like me 
(Don't want to start without you) 

Oh, here I go, drip droppin' way down low 
You're 'bout to miss 
Winding to this 
Don't make me start without you 
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow 
I'm coming up 
Put down your cup 
Don't make me start without you 

----RAP---- 

Get like me 
Get on the dancefloor 
Get like me 
Get on the dancefloor 

Oh, here I go, drip droppin' way down low 
You're 'bout to miss 
Winding to this 
Don't make me start without you 
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow 
I'm coming up 
Put down your cup 
Don't make me start without you 

Oh, here I go, drip droppin' way down low 
You're 'bout to miss 
Winding to this 
Don't make me start without you 
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow 
I'm coming up 
Put down your cup 
Don't make me start without you---Lyrics submitted by Tara.
