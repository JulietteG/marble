Hey hey hey Hey hey hey

all the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
we can do it even better in broken heels

i roll my sleeves up
i wrap my hair up
theres no sign on the road
so i never stop
can you catch me
yeah yeah yeah
you'll never catch me
ay ay ay

im fresh out the box
fast like a fox
boss in my shoes tick tock
12 o clock
you better watch me
yeah yeah yeah
sit back and watch me
ay ay ay

you go hard yes you do
but when i go its a magic show
oh oh oh uh oh oh
i get it when i want it
and i get it right

chorus
hey hey hey  hey hey hey
all the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do it
we can do it even better in broken heels  x2
anything you can do i can do better
i can do it in broken heels
anything you can do we can do better
i can do it in broken heels

when you step it up
im 20 levels up
i took the escalator
elevator to the top
how you like me
yeah yeah yeah

ay ay ay

oh you know we rock
we control the block
whatevers goin down
ladies take the biggest cut
we bring the party

we brought the party
ay ay ay

you go hard yes you do
but when i go its a magic show
oh oh oh uh oh oh

chorus
