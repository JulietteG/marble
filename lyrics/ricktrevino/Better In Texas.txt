I left my heart down in Mexico
Some senorita not so long ago
Who I thought about each night and day
Oh, what can I say?

It's such a foolish thing to do
But now I've fallen for somebody new
That sweet Shana as she changed my life
Oh, what a night

Now I know everything is better here in Texas
There's no place like my home, San Antone
Dancing the floor in Helotes
When I saw her standing alone

Now Mexico ain't nothing but a memory
Pleasant as it might've been, it's gone
I'd rather be here north of the border
The place where I belong

Her love is flowing like a Rio Grande
I'm crazy 'bout her, don't you understand?
So now don't look for me in Mexico
Oh, there's no reason to go

Now I know everything is better here in Texas
There's no place like my home, San Antone
Dancing the floor in Helotes
When I saw her standing alone

Now Mexico ain't nothing but a memory
Pleasant as it might've been, it's gone
I'd rather be here north of the border
The place where I belong

Now Mexico ain't nothing but a memory
Pleasant as it might've been, it's gone
I'd rather be here north of the border
The place where I belong

Now I know everything is better here in Texas
There's no place like my home, San Antone
Dancing the floor in Helotes
When I saw her standing alone

Now Mexico ain't nothing but a memory
Pleasant as it might've been, it's gone
I'd rather be here north of the border
The place where I belong

I'd rather be here north of the border
The place where I belong
The place where I belong
Texas is where I belong---Lyrics submitted by Gedupndans Duo.
