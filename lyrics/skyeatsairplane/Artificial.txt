Hand me your lies
Hand me my keys
You have to give it all up
When you realize
What youre leaving behind
I wish I was lost
But this was an alternate destination
Watch life flash before your eyes and
hope for the best
Even in this well-lit room
Where you lay down to rest
You still cast a shadow that stabs you in the back
This all began so well
and was the longest spiral
Downward Ive ever felt. 
You wouldve been the death of me
if I stuck around much longer
These months of sickness felt like I 
was sleeping six feet underground
You cant tell the difference between whats real and not
Find the truth or you will lose yourself forever
I know its not all your fault
I knew early on what I was getting myself into
Go ahead, be my guest, work on everything that closed our door
Everything I worked so hard for
You said you walked the line, but youre the one falling short
Actions speak louder than words.
I cant waste time anymore
When you realize
What youre leaving behind
I wish I was lost
But this was an alternate destination
With no plot
And no path laid out
I swear Im not lost
Im not lost
You were offered the world and turned it down
Shed no tear, and hope to break out on your own
I Refuse to call this place home---Lyrics submitted by mia.
