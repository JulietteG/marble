Yes man! Legalize it! Decriminalize it!
And I man Mr. Banton will advertise it... Sensimelia!

Me send a letter to the residence of the president
with a stamp on the front saying very urgent.
The message inside went something like: Legalize it! Sensimelia!

Sensimelia is a herb that grows naturally
just like any other plant or tree.
Natural as the birds, natural as the bees
and just like them sensi ought to be: Free!
To be grown anywhere that we please
in the city in the town and in the country. Free!
In the hills and in the valley
sensi should be there for everyone to see.

To call sensi a drug is very absurd
it should be known as a natural herb.
So much diseases sensi has cured
that's why doctors use it all round the world.
For glaucoma and fever, rheumatism, arthritis and asthma
insomnia, emphysema and to block epileptic seizure.
To alleviate pain and nausea
associated with the AIDS and cancer.
Some say it is the best stress reliever
Lord knows I am believer.

Give me the ganja cookie, and the herbal tea.
Sensimelia is: Irie!
I don't care what no government say.
Sensimelia is: OK!

Legalize it! Yes man legalize it now!

We want legalization, decriminalization and emancipation
for all those sentenced to incarceration for participation
with the healing of the nation.
It's just another case of political insanity
abusing the rights of humanity.
But we should all plant a seed of this weed that we need
to avoid an ecological calamity.
We can use for paper to save some trees
use it for fuel to save some seas.
Use it for medicines to help fight diseases
and use it for food when we hungry.

Legalize it! Fe we medication.
Legalize it! Lord fe we meditation.
Legalize it! Woe throughout the nation.
Legalize it! Yes we sensimelia.

Yes! From downing street to D. C.
time to paint the white house green.
You know what I mean... Scene!---Lyrics submitted by jOnyx.
