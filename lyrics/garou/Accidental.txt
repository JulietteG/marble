We're all angels that fall from grace 
So you dont have to hide 
your face from me 
Its the burden you wont lay down 
Its the guilt that you carry around 
You can see it coming 
But somehow you cant seem to avoid it 
Avoid this 
Life is accidental and 
Things happen coincidentally 
I never meant to hurt you 
You never meant to hurt me 
But we all get our hands a little dirty 
Nanana dirty 
Nanana 
Let it out and let me inside 
Tell me things that you feel you need to hide 
All your secrets 
cant be worse than mine 
So come closer and hold me tight 
Do you feel the poison running 
From your veins into an empty nothing, nothingness 
Life is accidental and 
Things happen coincidentally 
I never meant to hurt you 
You never meant to hurt me 
But we all get our hands a little dirty 
Nanana dirty 
Nanana 
Dont be down, just look around 
Theres no one perfect in this town 
Dont beat yourself up like everyone else does 
Just turn around 
Goodbye feeling, all guilts turn around 
Turn around 
Do you know that 
Life is accidental and 
Things happen coincidentally 
I never meant to hurt you 
You never meant to hurt me 
But we all get our hands a little dirty---Lyrics submitted by *.
