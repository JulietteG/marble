I don't think I know you, 
don't think I ever will. 
Am I in love with you, 
Well I don't know still. 
It may sound strange 
but I'm warning you 
I may not be that nice. 
Maybe baby 
I'm a heartbreaker 
heart breaker 
heart of ice 
But I'm burnin' 
burnin' 
'cos you set my soul on fire. 
Girl, I dont know what I'll do. 
'Cos I'm burnin' 
I'm burnin' 
I'm burnin' with desire. 
Yes I'm burnin' and it's all because of you. 
We can't be together. 
I'm not that kind of a guy. 
I'll be gone and lost forever, 
and you won't know why. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm only warning you, 
you'd be on your own. 
Maybe baby 
I'm a heartbreaker 
heart breaker 
heart of stone. 
But I'm burnin' 
burnin' 
'cos you set my soul on fire. 
Girl, I dont know what I'll do. 
'Cos I'm burnin' 
I'm burnin' 
I'm burnin' with desire. 
I'm burnin' and it's all because of you. 
Because of you. 
Yes I'm burnin' 
burnin' 
'cos you set my soul on fire. 
Girl, I dont know what I'll do. 
'Cos I'm burnin' 
I'm burnin' 
I'm burnin' with desire. 
Yes I'm burnin' and it's all because of you. 
Because of you.---Lyrics submitted by *.
