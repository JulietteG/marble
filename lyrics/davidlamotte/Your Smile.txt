So you wore out your clothes
wore out your shoes
Sweated in struggle
payed all your duce
And this is you're moment
look what you've done
Feel you're heart pounding
you've already won
And if anyone's wondering
was it all worth a while
You lifted that weight
when your body was soil
Ran for the finish
shot in you score.
You jumped in that water
when the water was cold
took your breath from you
but you empty you're soul
And if anyone's wondering
was it all worth a while..

They can look at your smile
Just look at your smile
Look at your smile - yeah yeah
Look at your smile

Fall into my arms, and I'll wrap them around
Raise up your hands, and wave to the croud
Cause you are a champion, and we are so proud

To look at your smile
Just look at your smile
Look at your smile - hey
Just look at your smile - yeah
Look at your smile - hey
Just look at your smile - yeah---Lyrics submitted by Ben Arne Johnsen.
