(Verse 1)
There's a boy in my mind and he knows that im thinking of him
All my way to the day and the night the stars shine above me
He's been gone for sometime but I know i truly love him
And i'm singing a song, hoping he'll be back when he hears it

(Chorus)
My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning
Shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala, shalala in the evening
Shalala lala, shalala lala just for you

(Verse 2)
If your loves gone away just like mine you feel like crying
Sing along maybe once, maybe twice, lets try it together
Some sweet day no one knows he'll return and you'll be happy
Shout it sweet in a song, listen to your heart it is singing

(Chorusx2)
Shalala lala just for you---Lyrics submitted by katie.
