DIalogue: Hello Party People this is Captain Kim speaking.
Welcome aboard Vengairways.
After take off we'll be pumpin up the sound system.
Cuz We're going to Ibiza.

(Verse 1)
Don't wanna be a bus driver all my life
I'm gonna pack my bags and leave this town
Grab a flight
Fly away on Vengairways
Flyin high in the Ibiza sky
I look up at the sky and i see the clouds
I look down at the ground and i see the rain go down the drain
Fly away on Vengairways
Flyin high in the Ibiza sky

(Chorus)
Woah, We're going to Ibiza
Woah, Back to the island
Woah, We're gonna have a party
Woah, In the Mediterranean sea

(Verse 2)
Be low, Be low, away, away(x4)
Far away from Bismic town and the rain
Its really very nice to be home again
Fly away on Vengairways
Flyin high in the Ibiza sky

(Chorus)
Woah, We're going to Ibiza
Woah, Back to the island
Woah, We're gonna have a party
Woah, In the Mediterranean sea

Be low, Be low, away, away (x2)
Dialogue: Thank you for flyin with Vengairways.
We are now aproaching Ibiza airport.
As you can see the sky is blue.
And the beach is waiting for you.

(Chorus x2)
Woah, We're going to Ibiza
Woah, Back to the island
Woah, We're gonna have a party
Woah, In the Mediterranean sea

Woah
WE'RE GOING TO IBIZA---Lyrics submitted by ayla.
