I sit alone on the edge of my bed, 
think you and the words you said,
keep running through my head,
Do you want to leave or do you 
or do you want to stay cause i can
 still walk away,

Cause i'm down on my knees
Don't you feel anything?
Cause im tried of trying to be everything
 that you can't see,
Make me Believe,
Make me believe

You said i could never love you i'm
not strong enough but you keep running
from the truth in the end its always you,
its always you 

Cause im down on my knees 
Don't you feel anything?
Cause I'm tried of trying to be everything
that you cant see
Make me Believe,
Make me Believe,

Leting go shouldn't be so hard,
But loving you tore me apart,

cause i'm down down on my knees 
and i cant feel anything,
and i'm tried of trying to be everything
that you don't see,
I Need to Believe 
I Need to Believe 

Why can't you ever see everything
 you do to me,
Because we were never meant to be 
I believe that you should Just Believe,
Just Believe,
Just Believe,---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
