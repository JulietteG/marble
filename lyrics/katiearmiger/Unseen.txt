i was right in front of you
standing in clear view
i had so much to show
i was like an open book
you never even looked
so much i wanted you to know
the deepest  part of me,
you never tried to reach
it would have been so easy

all you had to do was pay some attention
all you had to do was look past the surface
but you never noticed much of anything
all you had to do was just try to listen
all you ever did was just catch a glimpse
and the tragedy is that you left so much unseen,
you left so much unseen

you know, my favorite color is blue
but that was something new
and my favorite song
you didn't know my biggest fear
was that you didn't care
to bad this ain't the life i want
to be right by your side
and have the strength to fight
we were close, but so far

all you had to do was pay some attention
all you had to do was look past the surface
but you never noticed much of anything
all you had to do was just try to listen
all you ever did was just catch a glimpse
and the tragedy is that you left so much unseen,
you left so much unseen

all that ever really mattered
was over looked

all you had to do was pay some attention
all you had to do was look past the surface

all you had to do was pay some attention
all you had to do was look past the surface
but you never noticed much of anything
all you had to do was just try to listen
all you ever did was just catch a glimpse
and the tragedy is that you left so much unseen
you left so much unseen
you left so much unseen---Lyrics submitted by Phaun.
