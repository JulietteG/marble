Every single birthday
I promise I am gonna change but
I can never take the first step
Every single New Years 
I promise therell be no more tears but
I can only take what I get

What I get is that you will
Never, never, never let go,
What I feel is that you may 
Never, never, never 
Wanna know, me for, who I, really am

Every single Hanukkah,
I promise I am gonna come
Shimming out of my shell
Every single Rosh Hashanah
Shrouded in a hallelujah
Listen for the holiest knell

What I hear is that you will
Never, never, never let go,
What I fear is that you may 
Never, never, never 
Wanna know, me for, who I, really am

Every single birthday teeth
Sink into a cupcake
Im lonely as a grain of loose sand
Every single New Years
I promise therell be no more tears,
Oh but for a dose of dry land

What I hope is that youll 
Someday, someday, someday let go,
What I wish is that you will 
one day, one day, one day
Wanna know, me for, who I, really am---Lyrics submitted by Meredith King.
