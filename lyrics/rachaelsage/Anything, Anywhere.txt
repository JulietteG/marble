I want you to know me
I want you to smile when I call your name
I want you to never look at anyone else this way
So strange... This thing... We have between us
And its not fair if you've never felt this way
Anything, Anywhere, I will give everything I own away
Always I will sing picturing you singing right back to me
I want you to know that I will always have you ...?
Physically in my arms again
This love is like mercury
The splitting of ? Every time I try to get it down
Anything, Anywhere, I will give everything I own away
Always I will sing picturing you singing right back to me
Too bad the best love hurts so much
So good... the best love hurts so much
I will give everything I own
Always I will sing picturing you 
Anything, Anywhere, I will give everything I own away
Always I will sing picturing you singing right back to me
Singing right back, singing right back, singing right back, back to me
singing right back, singing right back, singing right back to me
Anything, Anywhere, Anything, Anywhere---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
