Every moment that passes
Every second that flies
Life will fog up your glasses
With its shameless advice

But I see the real you
I might see the truth
And I know the reasons why
You keep coming back for proof

Cause youre sharp as a steeple
Strong enough to scratch hell
And your souls as fragile
As a fallen angel

I see the real you
I might see your eyes
And I know the reasons why
You keep waiting for surprise

Has it always been so hard
For you to follow your slow-beating heart, and
Has it always been so tough
To listen for the ones you love

[I see] the real you
I might see your eyes
And I know the reasons why
You keep coming back 

Oh I see the real you
I might see the truth
And I know the reasons why
You keep coming back for proof---Lyrics submitted by Ro.
