I don't know who it was wrote in
 or by who's pen it was signed 
someone said and i quote it 
it's a womans prerogative
 to change her mind 
he may have you in a halter
 harnessed before and behind
 but until you kneel at that alter
 its a womans prerogative 
to change her mind 
promise anything anything at all
 promise everything honey don't swerve
 throw him a curve string him along 
until they show what they've got in
 reserve though his bank shows a 
big balance and he seems heaven
 designed if a boy is short on his 
talents its a woman's prerogative
 to change her mind they say 
president makes the thing alone
 hurray president i can say yes 
when i mean no hard to believe
 what they tell me that is legally
 so so don't fret how much you've 
kissed him if on their couch you've 
reclined don't forget we've got a 
system its a woman's prerogative
 to change her mind she can change her mind---Lyrics submitted by Mimi Coz.
