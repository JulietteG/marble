If I could ever say it right and reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor then you might come to believe in me

The life I lead is not the kind that gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find that you can believe in me

Those other loves that came before mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure and will not believe in me

(Chorus)
Too many hearts have been broken failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something that's spoken
And love's never wrong when it's real

If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing a song
That ends your questioning and makes you believe in me

(Chorus)
And makes you believe in me
Oh, you can believe in me---Lyrics submitted by gregoryyip.
