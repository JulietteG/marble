Well there's too many windows in this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy
And the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside
Nobody living inside...

Gonna pull in the shutters on this heart of mine
Roll up the carpets and pull in the blinds
And retreat to the chambers I left behind
In the hopes that there still may be love left behind
Still may be love left behind

Seek inspiration in daily affairs
Now you're soul is in trouble and requires repairs
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers
Echoes of unanswered prayers

Well there's too many windows in this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grow sturdy
And the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside
Nobody living inside...---Lyrics submitted by Jodine M Kamler.
