This life is heartless and it's rarely just 
Full of sad betrayals and misplaced trust 
And it can suck your spirit just as dry as dust 
And steel your soul if you let it 
Ooh every life contains its sorrows and pains 
Its stormy weather and its rough terrains 
You watch me wrestle with my length of chain 
And smile so bravely as you tell me 

(Chorus) 
Don't lose heart, don't lose heart 
Though it feels like yours will fall apart 
Just remember when the road gets dark 
I will always be beside you 

Well, I spend my life pursuing fortune and fame 
Chasing rainbows in a shadow game 
And I'm not sure what I've lost is worth the gain 
Or why my soul remains so restless 
You've seen me stumble, Lord, you've seen me fall 
You shared my triumphs and you've seen me crawl 
When I think that I could lose it all 
You give me courage and you tell me 

(Chorus) 

When the road gets rocky and the ride gets rough 
And the best you got to give ain't good enough 
There will always be a place inside my love 
Where you can find shelter, where you can find shelter 
Ooh every life contains its sorrows and pains 
Its stormy weather and its rough terrains 
You watch me wrestle with my length of chain 
And smile so bravely as you tell me 

Don't lose heart, oh don't lose heart 
Though it feels like yours will fall apart 
Just remember when the road gets dark 
I will always be beside you 
Well, I will always be beside, beside you---Lyrics submitted by Kat S.
