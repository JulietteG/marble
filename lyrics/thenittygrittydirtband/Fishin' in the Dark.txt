Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and the lightnin' bugs
Are floatin' in the breeze
Baby, get ready

Across the field where the creek
Turns back by the ole stump road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby, get ready, ooo

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow

Stayin' the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's come
And the days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along
Baby, get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night
Baby, get ready, ooo

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow

You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow

You and me going fishin' in the dark---
