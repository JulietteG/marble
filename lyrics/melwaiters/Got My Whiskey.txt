I worked hard all week and its time to take a break
Play me some Marvin Sease or some Marvin Gaye
Call me later because I wont be at home
Im going out tonight because I feel like getting it on

I came out (I came out) to have a good time (yes I did)
That's all (thats all) that's on my mind
Say I got my money (got my money) and I got my whiskey (got my whiskey)
(Because tonight) tonight I'm gonna get.. real tipsy (oh yeah)

I'm not gonna sit around all night long
I'm gonna dance until the morning comes
I'm gonna let all of my troubles go
It's 2 a.m. in the morning
And I'm ready for more

I came out (I came out) to have a good time (yes I did)
That's all (thats all) that's on my mind
Say I got my money (got my money) and I got my whiskey (got my whiskey)
(Because tonight) tonight I'm gonna get.. real tipsy (oh yeah)
(repeat)

You see all you wanna do is go out and have a good time
Youre not going out to pick up anybody right?
All you want to do is let go of some frustrations 
Cause youve had a hard and hell of a week
Got your money, got your ride
Go ahead on and have yourself a good time
You know what I mean might as well come out and say it

I came out (I came out) to have a good time (yes I did)
That's all (thats all) that's on my mind
Say I got my money (got my money) and I got my whiskey (got my whiskey)
(Because tonight) tonight I'm gonna get.. real tipsy (oh yeah)
(repeat)
I worked all week and its time to take a break
Play me some Marvin Sease or some Marvin Gaye
Call me later because I wont be at home
Im going out tonight because I want to get it on

I came out (I came out) to have a good time (yes I did)
That's all (thats all) that's on my mind
Say I got my money (got my money) and I got my whiskey (got my whiskey)
(Because tonight) tonight I'm gonna get.. real tipsy (oh yeah)
