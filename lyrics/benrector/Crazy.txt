You ever get tired of turning on the radio
And asking yourself Who lives that kind of life?
Cause I dont
I need an anthem, I need a song that I can sing
So raise your glass if your life is crazy
Crazy normal

Last night was crazy, yeah we tore it up again
Kicked off our shoes and went to bed by 9pm
We were balling and Netflix
We turned it up to ten
Last night was crazy

I threw my hands up in the air
At that detective show we watch
You drank red wind and I had Britta on the rocks
We made some pasta with our favorite kind of sauce
Last night was crazy, yeah

One, two, yeah were living fast and free
Here on our favorite street
So raise a glass with me, oh
You know were going hard
And that were living large
Right here in out back yard, oh
This life is crazy
This life is crazy

We got off work and met at Bed, Bath and Beyond
You looked at curtains, I bought a birthday card for mom
We wanted tacos, but the taco truck was gone
Last night was crazy, yeah

Then Saturday, slept til 8:30
And felt so reenergized
My car was dirty so I washed it in the drive
Weve got dinner reservation with our friends later tonight
And it might get crazy
We probably wont get crazy
Unless you guys want appetizers (apps for everyone)

Were living fast and free
Here on our favorite street
So raise a glass with me, oh
You know were going hard
And that were living hard
Right here in our backyard, oh
This life is crazy
This life is crazy

I dont know where all these party people at
Youve gotta have a job and get some sleep, you do the math
And someones gotta pay for all those bottle service tabs
And that sounds crazy

And if youre living fast and free
Here on your favorite street
Then raise your glass with me, oh
And if you're going hard
If this is living large, and you know who you are---
