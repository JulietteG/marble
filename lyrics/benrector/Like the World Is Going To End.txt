If we found out that the world
was gonna end on Tuesday morning
What would everybody do
It's funny how the thought of that
can make something real important
And a lot of things pretty worthless too

But I'd be dancin' like a fool
I'd be laughin', I'd be cryin'
Callin' everbody I'd ever hurt and reconcilin'
I'd call everyone I loved
Say what I was scared to say till then
Now that I think about it
Maybe I should always live like the world is gonna end

I'd hit all my favorite resturants
They'd be open for business
Would not care what people thought, yeah

And I'd speak love to everbody
Who came close enough to listen
And if someone done be wrong
I'd call and tell em' I forgot

And then I'd be dancin' like a fool
I'd be laughin', I'd be cryin'
Callin' everbody I'd ever hurt and reconcilin'
I'd call everyone I loved
Say what I was scared to say till then
Now that I think about it
Maybe I should always live like the world is gonna end

We spend most our lives
And almost all our time
One what we don't care about
What we could do without

Every tragedy
Is that we can't see it
We can't see until time is running out

'Cause I'd be dancin' like a fool
I'd eat ice cream every mornin'
I'd call up everyone I loved
And drive them out to California
And we'd say the things
that we've been scared to death to say till then
Now that I think about it
Maybe we should always live like the world is gonna end

Live like the world is gonna end

Live like the world
Live like
Live like
Live like the world is gonna end---
