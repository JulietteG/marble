Well I'll be your rainy day lover. Whenever the sunny days end.
And whatever the weather, we have each other.
And that's how the story will end

Well I'll be your shade tree in summer mmm.
If you'll be my fire when it's cold.
And whatever the season, well, we'll keep on breathing.
Cause we'll have each other to hold.

I'll hold you- I'll sing.

I wanna love you, forever I do.
I wanna spend all of my days with you.
I'll carry your burdens and be the wind at your back.
I wanna spend my forever - forever like that.

Well I'll be the words on the pages.
If you'll be my sweet melody.
And the tune can keep changing, cause I'll keep arranging.
And this is the song that we'll sing.

We'll sing ooo

I wanna love you, forever I do.
I wanna spend all of my days with you.
I'll carry your burdens and be the wind at your back.
I wanna spend my forever - forever like that.

When the rain comes, I'll be your shelter.
When the wind blow, we'll be together.
When the storms they rise, I'll be right here by your side.

And I'll sing-

I'm gonna love you, forever I do.
I'm gonna spend all my days with you.
I'll carry your burdens and be the wind at your back.
I'm gonna spend my forever - forever like that. ---
