I don't wanna be no star
Have fame on the Boulevard
No that's not what I'm looking for

I don't need shiny things
Or love from a movie screen
But I tell you what I really want

Oh oh, oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

I don't live in the hills
And I probably never will
But that won't keep me up at night

Cause she's dancing like a fool
Across my living room
Whenever I'm with you
my heart is singing

Oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

Keep those fancy things
Keep your magazine
I don't even want what I'm chasing
because all I know isn't ordinary love is what we're made for

Oh oh, oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

Oh oh, oh oh gimme an ordinary love
That I touch
That I hold
Gimme an ordinary love

Gimme an ordinary love
Yeah gimme an ordinary love---
