Howard drives a minivan with the cruise ships from Ft. Lauderdale
And it's been that way since 1994
Does his business on a flip phone with the most obnoxious ringtone
I didn't ask but I can tell he's from New York
And he spoke proudly of his daughter and that this fall she'd be in college
And that he always wished he'd gotten his degree
You can tell he came from nothing, built a future out of hustling
And somehow I'm the one you people pay to see

Oh isn't that just the way it goes
You're dealt a good hand and you get celebrated
Oh how am I the only one who knows
I'm half the man of the men who drive me places

Danny showed up early fifteen minutes till five thirty
Making sure that I'd be on my morning flight
He said he'd love to fix computers, but that he can't until he's fluent
So he spends his driving money taking class at night
He wore a neatly ironed dress shirt and he helps his kids with homework
And deep inside I couldn't help but ask myself
Why that at night I'm up on stage, everybody knows my name
While Danny's early picking up somebody else

Oh isn't that just the way it goes
You're dealt a good hand and you get celebrated
Oh how am I the only one who knows
I'm half the man of the men that drive me places

And now everything's not given, I work hard to make my living
But I'll give credit where I think credits due
Maybe you got dealt a good hand
Maybe you play it the best that you can
But I don't know how far you'd walk without those cards
In Howard and Danny's working shoes

But that's just the way it goes
You're dealt a good hand and you get celebrated
Oh how am I the only one who knows
I'm half the man of the men that drive me places---
