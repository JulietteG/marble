Somebody's sleepin'
Where I used to sleep
Somebody else is holdin'
Who used to hold me.
What am I gonna do
With my love now
Somebody else's lovin'
I can't live without.

(chorus)
Here comes another endless night
Laying here, falling apart inside
And there's nothing I can do about...
Somebody else's lovin'
I can't live without.

Somebody's making memories
I wanna make
Somebody else's dream
Is keeping me awake
What am I gonna do
With my love now
Somebody else's lovin'
I can't live without.

(chorus)

How do you stop
Loving the one you love...
When it means giving up
Everything you dreamed of...

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by James Evans.
