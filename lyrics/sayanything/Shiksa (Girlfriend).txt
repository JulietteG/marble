Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
I get a girlfriend now?

I remember it vividly, love
Ive been walking erect since the moment we met
And I caught your eye, to my surprise 
Your white thighs
Hebraic neuroses ceased to be
An angels conversing with me
The new attractive to me 
Is divine

Even if your friends dont understand
No matter what, Ill always be your man
Even if you go, 
You know youll leave me feeling grand

Yeah Yeah

Ill need new contraceptives, 
Green eyes
I found god when you left him, 
Green eyes
Lets spend the night entwined 
Out on the boardwalk in sickly summertime
Like the yin and the yang of the afikomen
Youre the omen 
That all has changed that was deranged
Even if you suck me til Im sore
No matter what, 
Id bleed to be your whore
Even if the cancer grows til we explode, 
Im yours

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
I get a girlfriend, now?

Well from here on forth, 
Im yours.

And even if your whisper eats my ear,
Your voice shall be the only song I long to hear
And even if your fear the end, 
Our sacrament of salmon and Irish beer
We'll still be here

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
I get a girlfriend, now?

Girlfriend now
I have a girlfriend now
No way, no how
Shes my girlfriend now---Lyrics submitted by Kirsten.
