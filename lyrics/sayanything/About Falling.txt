The tide rolls by,
and i wonder why,
i felt inclined to try,
my starry eyes were plucked for sacrifice,
the sea divides but i,
but i don't wanna get lost in the ocean,
and i don't wanna get lost in the ocean now

and as our single climbs the charts,
i feed on the virgin blood from your bleeding heart,
with my pants around my ankles,
claimed my part,
i built the ark,
but i don't wanna get lost in the ocean,
i start spinning around to the motion

but i don't really even care if i'm alone now,
whoa whoa
and i don't even give a damn about falling in love,
falling in love
my body burning by my heavy heart of stone now,
whoa whoa
and i don't really give a damn about falling in love

i don't really even care if i'm alone now,
whoa whoa
i don't even give a damn about falling in love,
falling in love
body burning by my heavy heart of stone now,
whoa whoa
but i don't really give a damn about falling in love,
she sings "why wont you wait for me",
"why aren't you waiting for me",
"why won't you wait for me",
"why aren't you waiting for me"---
