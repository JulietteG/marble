Never thought that I could feel such a slap in the face
Since my semester in New York where I drank it away
Social strategies are taught to bohemian crowds
And my love was like a food stamp handing it out
Oh, though I fell in love with you all faded, grizzled and mature
You left me naked, pining, lying on your bathroom floor
If it makes you jealous tell us just which boy we should adore
When we talk about myself, so I don't mind that he's a bore

He's like a less cute version of you
But he'll have to do
He's like a Wal-Mart version of you
But he'll have to do
He'll have to do

Mountain man brag about your band to me
You've got me hot with all those snide remarks about my poetry
But he gobbles up every single line about the stars
And how they scar my slightly chubby arms like brightly lit cigars

So now he's next to me
But I can feel you in my heart
You're everything
You're everything he'll never be
It's misery
And more specifically 
I miss that day you spit on me

He's like a less cute version of you
But he'll have to do
He's like a Wal-Mart version of you
But he'll have to do
He'll have to do

He's like a less cute version of you
But he'll have to do
He's like a Wal-Mart version of you
But he'll have to do
He'll have to do

He has no inkling of your status or mind
He says the glow that I splattered blinds
You and I are like siamese twins
So let this sick sad game begin

Now you're here again
And he'll wonder where I've been
I'm giving in
But in my own opinion
That's how to be
Though I can hear him singing
"All this envy's killing me"
(it's killing me)

He's like a less cute version of you
But he'll have to do
He's like a Wal-Mart version of you
But he'll have to do
Have to do

He's like a less cute version of you (every time I see)
But he'll have to do (you beside, I die inside)
He's like a Wal-Mart version of you (every time I see)
But he'll have to do (you beside, I die inside)
He'll have to do---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
