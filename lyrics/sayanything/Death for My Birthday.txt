Let me guide you through the story
Of a boy and his curse.
Tiny diamond in his stroller
With his first step, chasing the hearse.
Sipping at a cup that's halfway filled
Looking forward to the day he pays
that drinking bill.

There's no peace, there's no quiet on this earth.
He can finally nestle tightly
in that womb beneath the dirt.
Hurt no more, and when he turned 24
He wrote a note to nail to God's
front door that said...

I want death, death for my birthday.
I want death, death in the worst way.
I want death, death for my birthday
Don't get me wrong cause
I love life, but life has a boyfriend
Bless my soul, I'm out to destroy them
I want death, death for my birthday
For my birthday...

For the high-paying job and the love of his life
He rode a rollercoaster ride of lust
On their wedding night.
They made a baby in unmentionable ways
He was ungrateful as a man could be
On that blessed day.

And underneath, he thought
This is all a phase.
Just a blip in the existence of the structure
Vast and great.'
Praying each night to his cross of a charm
For the one thing he couldn't afford
Just to buy the farm.

I want death, death for my birthday.
I want death, death in the worst way.
I want death, death for my birthday
Don't get me wrong cause
I love life, but life has a boyfriend
Bless my soul, I'm out to destroy them
I want death, death for my birthday
For my birthday ..

Win or lose another friend again
Or watch them start a war that's fought
For ideals that are dead.
I'll never have an argument again
Because my dust will be your salt
My blood will hydrate you all
My heart will be your meal
And I won't ride the cycle of the way
It kills to think and feel no more
No!

I want death, death for my birthday.
I want death, death in the worst way.
I want death, death for my birthday
Don't get me wrong cause
I love life, but life has a boyfriend
Bless my soul, I'm out to destroy them
I want death, death for my birthday
For my birthday ..

One sweet day, his heart ceased to beat
He fell so fast beneath all our feet
Through bugs and snakes, last words he had to say
Were help me claw my way to the surface.
Oh sweet Lord, you know I deserved this
Just one more .. just one more birthday---Lyrics submitted by Mistypool.
