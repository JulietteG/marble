Sweep the black super market! 
Sweep it up with your teeth!
Put your feather in a box! (Take off! Take off!)
Send it off to me!
I smell oxygen, precious. 
Bareback on your horse.
Gallop off course, get off! (Get off! Get off!)
Filled with fury's force.

There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit
You erased it but we saw you fake it
There's blood on the good book, love in the bad brook
Suck out all the nerve and make it yours!

There's a fire in the peach pit
There's a fire in the peach pit
There's a fire in the peach pit
Saw you fake it...

You brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me, brought me, brought me
You brought me, you brought me to my knees

You're so perfect to please us! 
You make all the right noise!
Get the business clothes off! (Take off! Take off!)
And strip down to your voice!
We will show you your future 
and choke the air from your world. (Choke! Choke! Choke!)
You can be our once-twice-thrice-four 
times the goodbye girl!

There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit
You erased it but we saw you fake it
There's a crack in the blank stare, back in the black raised hair
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

There's a fire in the peach pit
There's a fire in the peach pit
There's a fire in the peach pit

You brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me, brought me, brought me
You brought me, you brought me to my knees

I don't know who told you that (who told you that)
I don't know who told you that but it's a lie, believe me
I swear, I shall not deceive thee. (Yeah!)
I don't know who sold you that but it's a fake
I don't know who sold you that baby but it's a fake, remind me
'Cause my eyes see straight behind me.

Never killed nobody
I promise you're my first;
You always remember your first

(Okay, here we fuckin' go!)

You brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me, brought me, brought me
You brought me, you brought me to my knees---Lyrics submitted by rikki.
