Staring out the window of our tour bus 
And it's just the horny driver and us
Sitting and trade wit and smoke and we cuss
Talking bout our friendly border drug bust 
And I know the future's cloudy and gray
Record like mine, give up or go gay
You're looking down on me with blue and black eyes
Pissing down a storm from purple night skies.

Uh-huh-huh. Uh-huh-huuuh Uuh-huuh. Uh-huh-huuh.

And I know their concepts money and tripe 
That all that is large and all that is slight
Is flowing in the stream of holy floodlights
Writing holy books, Lord knows we bite
But if this is your will in my testament
I will bow to no belief that they've bent
Still I'm just a sperm begat from your love
Basking in the bread the blood of your dove...

Uh-huh-huh. Uuh-huh-huuuh Uuuh-huuuh. Uh-huh-huuh.

Can I lie with you in your grave? (2x)

(Can I lie with you in your grave?)
There's a crack in the edge of the end of the world
Where I will sit with my love in it's fluorescent swirl
Eat us up, break it down to the tiniest cell
In a room with the view and a window to hell
With those who bury bodies in their barrels of fun
We'll be marched through museums that display what they've done
We'll be shot up through the sky by a cannon of sin
We'll reluctantly let them in,

So can I lie in your grave in the edge at the end of the world
Where I will sit with my love in this fluorescent swirl
Eat us up, break it down to the tiniest cell
In a room with the view and a window to hell
With those who bury bodies in their barrels of fun
We'll be marched through museums that display what they've done
We'll shot up through the sky by a cannon of sin
We'll reluctantly let them in!

So can I lie in your grave?!
(Can I lie with you in your grave?)
So can I lie in your grave?
So can I lie in your grave...?
