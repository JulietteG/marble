When I like you
It's total revenge
I want to
But I can pretend
That I don't need to be by your side
Again
Wrap me up
In a plastic case
Pat me down
With your warm embrace
I wanna know
Where you lay your face at night
For all these years

You're a problem
That I can't abide
I could sleep well
If only I tried
But I stay up
And dream of a bride to be
Oh me, oh my!!
Give it up
I can't wait no more
I am stuck 
On your bedroom floor
With the thought
That I may not be as great as those
Who came before

There's a man assigned to me
And he checks on my stability
We discuss you every week
Then I rinse and rinse
Repeat
But maybe
I can show you
Baby 
Maybe
I can relax for good
Whao, baby
I can show you
Maybe 
Baby

There's a man assigned to me
and he checks on my stability
We discuss you every week
Then I rinse and rinse repeat
And he charges by the tear
til I weep no more 
Strictly out of fear
That I can't afford your love
And the moon just burns above
OKAY---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
