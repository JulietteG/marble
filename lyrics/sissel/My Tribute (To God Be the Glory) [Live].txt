MY TRIBUTE

HOW CAN I SAY THANKS
FOR THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
THINGS SO UNDESERVED YET YOU GAVE
TO PROVE YOUR LOVE FOR ME
THE VOICES OF A MILLION ANGELS
COULD NOT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE
ALL THAT I AM AND EVER HOPED TO BE
I OWE IT ALL TO THEE

CHORUS:
TO GOD BE THE GLORY, TO GOD BE THE GLORY
TO GOD BE THE GLORY FOR THE THINGS HE HAS DONE
WITH HIS BLOOD HE HAS SAVED ME
WITH HIS POWER HE HAS RAISED ME
TO GOD BE THE GLORY FOR THE THINGS HE HAS DONE

JUST LET ME LIVE MY LIFE
LET IT BE PLEASING LORD, TO THEE
AND SHOULD I GAIN ANY PRAISE
LET IT GO TO CALVARY---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
