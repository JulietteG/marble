Once a day I wink at you,
And you grin
Like a Puma... rrr
I watch as you spend an hour or two
In the bath,
Like a tuna... mmm

One times... I love you
Two times... I love you
Three times, four times, five times
I love you, ooh, you
Ooooh

Twice a week I take a peek,
As you bathe
Like a reptile... woof!
I catch your eye and you throw your sponge
It's a soaking projectile

One times... I love you
Two tim-m-m-mes... I love you
Three times, four times, five times
I love you, love you, I love you
Ooooh

(Guitar solo)

Oh, oh oh!
One tim-m-m-mes... I love you
Two times... I love you
Three times, four times, five times a week
I love you, I love you, you
Ooooh

I... Love... You...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
