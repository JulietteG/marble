Many miles between you and me,
And our love is guaranteed to fail
'Cause a fuck should be multi-sensory,
And you just can't smell an email

Phone sex, cyber sex, ain't all that
I prefer to take my sex in its original format
So you know what you can do with that mouse mat

Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)

Well I need to turn my horse around,
But my baby's got the painters in
S-s-s-sporting a hat of the finest brown,
The colour of a cardinal sin

Honey, I've always had my knockers I fear,
Gimme just an eye-ful of your rear, of your rear, of your rear
Just somewhere to put my beer, yeah

Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex

Brrrring me.... sex

(Guitar solo)

Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex (with a touchy-feely woman)
Physical Sex---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
