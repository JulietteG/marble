I'm gonna build you... a house

I'm a man with two good hands,
Two good hands and a plot of land
I'm on a mission; I've got a vision,
I'm planning permission

I've got twenty-thousand bricks to lay,
Honey I don't have a place to stay
I've just got this canvas tanned,
I need a sheet to mix the cement

Do you think I've lost the plot?
I have not
I've sheltered you from the rain
You and I Will defy the elements again

I need a home in which to revel,
I need a place to keep my spirit level
I know the right guys,
'Cause I used to work in building supplies
Graft in a hundred of those,
Concrete and steel by the wheelbarrow load
Finish at two, who's gonna chop the barroos?
I've got a trowel and I ain't afraid to use it...

Do you think I've lost the plot?
I have not
I've sheltered you from the rain
You and I Will defy the elements again
Woo!
