His actions were slated,
His guts were hated
T'was deemed that his life
Should be truncated

At his demise, the townsfolk plotted
(Aaaaah)
Ambushed, beaten, and garrotted

Curse of the Tollund Man,
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund Man

Accused of witchcraft,
Hung, drawn, and halved
Confronted by death,
To them I just laugh

Executed for unlawful carnage
(Aaaaah)
Buried in peat, just outside Woodbridge

Curse of the Tollund Man,
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund Man

Oooh

Eyes of the Tollund Man,
Rise did the Tollund Man
And unleash the terror upon everyone that he saw

Curse of the Tollund Man,
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund Man
And this evil... must not be...
Unearthed

Curse of the Tollund Man,
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund Man
This evil must not be unearthed---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
