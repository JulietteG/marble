Prawn cocktail, black forest gateau
Eggs and gammon with a bottle of Lambrusco
This is opulent luxury; I'm as happy as a pig in shit could be, oh
You keep your cordon bleu, and your seedless grapes,
And you know where you can stick your cravat...

I just want what every man wants;
A nibble on your vol-au-vents... and a pint

So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)
Wooh

Shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)
Ooh!

I like simple things; meaty pies
I like potato chips and I like my sushi deep fried
Never could pronounce Hors D'oeuvre,
Cannot speak the language of love

I just want what every man wants;
A nibble on your vol-au-vents... and a pint

So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)
Wooh

Shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!

(Guitar solo)

So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)
Oooh

So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)
Wooh!

Shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'till the slugs fall off)

So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Yeah, yeah...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
