I get up (he gets up)
To see you wallow in defeat
I get down (he gets down)
With almost everybody I meet

Except you,
And I fail to see why I should care
That you have had 36 years of pain
To share...

So did what I did what I did, for you;
You've got the best of me
Oh, I did what I did, for you;
You've got the best of me, yeah

I get up (he gets up)
I see you look perpetually
I get down (he gets down)
To watch you fail spectacularly

Oh boy,
And I fail to see why I should care
That you have had 37 years of pain
To share...

I did what I did what I did, for you;
You've got the best of me
Oh I did what I did, for you;
You've got the best of me, eee hee

(Guitar solo)

Did what I did what I did, for you;
You've got the best of me
Oh I did what I did, for you;
You've got the best of me,
Mama mama---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
