[Chorus]
So you say everything's gonna be alright now
But how do you really know
And I know everything's gonna be alright now
Cos that's the seed I sow, whoa, oh
And the universe told me that's how I
That's how I think I know
So you say everything's gonna be alright now (Yeah)
And that's how I know

[Rap Solo]
I got a damsel in distress on my left
Gotta handle with finesse and no stress would be best, yeah
Unless it's all just for the best
In which case, I'll replace baby girl with the next
Child, I never gave up you, you never gave up on me
But time turned tricks and did no favours to we
Time and tide tried to blind our eyes
But they'll never catch us cos we acclimatise
No, our demise is not finalised cos the sign is nigh
I feel the time is right

[Chorus]
So you say everything's gonna be alright now
But how do you really know
And I know everything's gonna be alright now
Cos that's the seed I sow, whoa, oh
And the universe told me that's how I
That's how I think I know
So you say everything's gonna be alright now
And that's how I know (Yeah, yeah)

[Rap Solo]
I've fallen in love with the birds and bees
I got nothin' but hugs for the herbs and trees
Somebody told me everything is gon' be copasetic if you let it be
Kinetic energy has rendered me unstoppable
Unbeatable, undefinable like sunshine, I'm cool
Looked into the future and I saw a sign
It said don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine
So when I tell you everything will be kei te pai
I know cos the universe told me, aiiight

[Chorus]
So you say everything's gonna be alright now
But how do you really know
(Don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine)
And I know everything's gonna be alright now
Cos that's the seed I sow, whoa, oh
(Don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine)
And the universe told me that's how I
That's how I think I know
(Yeah, don't stop, yeah, don't stop, yeah)
So you say everything's gonna be alright now
And that's how I know
(Don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine)

[Rap Solo]
Frustrated with the sound of my voice cos I'm a kiwi
Tryna make it rapping internationally
So I'll sing for you

[Bridge]
Imagine she was the girl in the picture
The one that you always wanted
And then she hit on you, you went steady with her
And then she made you feel so low
But she gave her love, conditional love
And then she made you feel yo-yo
Yeah, you wanted to take this lively heart
And sing about it at this show

Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine)
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine)
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Yeah, don't stop, yeah, don't stop, yeah)
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Don't stop, get it, get it, you'll be fine)
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh---
