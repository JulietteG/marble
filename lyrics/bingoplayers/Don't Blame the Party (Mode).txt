Oh put your drink back up, put your smile on
They say that bad luck never lasts long
Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Oh turn the beat back up, turn the lights on
I know it's so dark at the bottom
Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah
Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Oh put your drink back up, put your smile on
They say that bad luck never lasts long
Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Oh turn the beat back up, turn the lights on
I know it's so dark at the bottom
But don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah
Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah

Oh put your drink back up, put your smile on
They say that bad luck never lasts long
Don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah

Oh turn the beat back up, turn the lights on
I know it's so dark at the bottom
But don't blame the party yeah, yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
