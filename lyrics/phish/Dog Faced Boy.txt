i wont spear a moment on the dog faced boy
i wont lend another hand to the worm-girl of Hanoi 
don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
but ask me and i'll do anything for you

whenever i think of you it only makes me feel sad
whenever i think of you the best friend i ever had

until i gave it all up foe nothing

well i lied and i cheated 
and it made me feel bad

it made me feel guilty for not being true
oh the months i spent trying to explain 
in the end all i could do is turn my head in shame
Whenever i think of you, oh darling it makes me feel sad
because you deserve better and once i was it
but somehow my good intentions 
just got up and git 

so i won't spare a moment on the dog faced boy
i won't lend another hand to the worm-girl of Hanoi
but don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
but if you ask me i'll do anything for you---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
