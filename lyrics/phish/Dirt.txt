Washed up ashore
Washed up Ashore

I'd like to live beneath the dirt
A tinny space to move and breath
Is all the i would ever need

I wanna live beneath the dirt
Where I'd be free from push and shove 
like all those swarming up above
Beneath their heels I spend my time

(Shout your name into the wind)
A riddle in the earth and do

(Shout your name into the wond)
And sometime i will think of you

(Shout your name into the wind)
And if you ever think of me
Kneel down and kiss the earth
And---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
