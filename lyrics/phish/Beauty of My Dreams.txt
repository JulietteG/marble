One day I met the beauty of my dreams
Such petty eyes she had although it seems
Long hair flowin' down behind
I saw it all you know I was so blind

We wound up on her side of town
Bright lights and loud music all around
I gazed into her eyes and she in mine
She had me in a trance it was so fine

And now i cry cry cry
I can't get over her though I tried
I'm blue blue blue
I should have known she never could be true

Well the fun didn't last for very long
I found her house and neighbors say you're wrong
The girl you seek don't live here anymore
Now i know the pain that was in store

Now all I have is a picture in a frame
She left me the same as she came
She made a wreck of me now I find
She's outside but always on my mind

And now I cry cry cry
I can't get over her though I tried
I'm blue blue blue
I should have known she never could be true---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
