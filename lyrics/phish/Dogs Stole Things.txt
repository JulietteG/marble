Dogs stole
Things I need bad
Cats took
What I never had

The creatures they seem
Oh so fine
They sleep all day
To ease your mind
At night they softly
Pad alone 
And look to steal things 
That you own

And now I lay me
Down to sleep
I prey the lord
That I might keep
My soul for one more night
Or two
And hope the creatures never do---Lyrics submitted by Jerry H.
