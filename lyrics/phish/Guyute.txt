guyute was an ugly pig
who walked on me and danced a jig
that he had learned when he was six
then stopped and did some other tricks
like pulling weapons from his coat
and holding them against my throght 
he lectured me in a language strange 
then scampered quickly out of rang

guyute glimpses in my eyes
and manages to hypnotize 
and as i sleep the sleep of death 
he sucks from me my only breath
that i had breathed since i was ten
i hope this happens once again---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
