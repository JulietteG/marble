I feel I never told you
The story of the ghost
That I once knew and talked to
Of whom I'd never boast

'Cause this was my big secret
How I'd get ahead
And never worry
I'll call him instead

His answer came in action
He never spoke a word
Or maybe I laid down the phone
Before he could be heard

I somehow feel forsaken
Like he had closed the door
I guess I just stopped needing him
As much as once before

I feel I never told you 
The story of the ghost

I feel I never told you
The story of the ghost---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
