if time were only part of the equation
and you could draw the boundaries of our cage
you wouldn't pile another stone upon me
but i'd be happy just to watch you age

if everything is in it's own dominion 
and waiting in the shallows as i do
appears as we as water slowly 
trickles out
which isn't nearly fast enough for you

it isn't nearly fast enough for you
it isn't nearly fast enough for you

it's what i was afraid of
i stumbled into view

but it isn't nearly fast enough for you
it isn't nearly fast enogh for you

it isn't nearly fast enough for you
it isn't nearly fast enough for you---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
