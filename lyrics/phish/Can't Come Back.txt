One small step I saw you take
Along the two toward the glow
Words I formed to call you back
You paused and spoke soft and low

Can't come back can't come back
I can't come back can't come back
Can't come back come back

I thought I saw you in your chair
The shadow bent like you were there
I asked the dark what would you think
Of coming back to join me

Can't come back can't come back
I can't come back can't come back
Can't come back come back

Can't come back can't come back
Can't come back come back

Can't come back can't come back
Can't come back come back---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
