Summer, sitting out by the pool
A ray of sunlight getting in my way
Close your eyes and wish it were cool
Every day

And I wish it could be back the other way
But what's dissolved ain't comin' back today
Close your eyes and wish that it were
Close your eyes and wish that it were

Axilla! Axilla! Axilla! Axilla!
Axilla! Axilla! Axilla! Axilla, yeah!

Never understood what my body was for
That's why I always leave it layin' out on the floor
The shape of curiosity
Where different faces fit before
And tracin' my image in the sand
To pass the time from slip to fall
the line I trace begins to weave
A tangled web from wall to wall

Axilla! Axilla! Axilla! Axilla!
Axilla! Axilla! Axilla! Axilla, yeah!

Axilla! Axilla! Axilla! Axilla!
Axilla! Axilla! Axilla! Axilla, yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Toni.
