I look into the finance box just to check my status
Status
I look into the microscope I see Golgi apparatus

Golgi oh woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi ogi ogi ogi ogay

They call him lysosome 'cause he runs so fast
Runs like a junkyard dog with a brain of brass

Golgi oh woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi olgi ogi ogi ogay

I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you

Under the light
Middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong
So I had to...

I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you

Under the light
Middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong
So I had to...

Look into the finance box just to check my status
I look into the microscope I see Golgi apparatus

Golgi oh woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi Golgi Golgi---Lyrics submitted by Jerry H.
