Da doo
Dada

Vespa called me on the phone
He had a case of colic
I said it was because he was
A rubbing alcoholic

Drempken was so proud he was
Such a great romancer
Until I said the world could use
One less beer belly dancer

Mel Catane was pregnant and 
She heard all the expressions
It's just a hot flash or
Or else those fire breathing lessons

I'd sleep I'd dream I'd dream I'd sleep
But sometimes dreaming is too deep
If I could shed one layer now
I'd still remain asleep somehow---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
