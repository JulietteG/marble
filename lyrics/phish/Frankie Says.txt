time is me and i should know
i knew this several months ago
i knew more than i do now
for i've been turned around somehow

relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
with threats and hopes beyond compare

i change the landscape as i pass
meandering from sand to glass
i suction there for one whole day
until the feeling goes away

i don't need these orbits in my life
revolve and cycle through 
don't keep coming back for more

i don't need this circular design
wheel and spin away from me
you've been by here before

i've lost my mind
i've lost my way
i'm bound to lose 
you wonder where i am---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
