i am just a satellite 
so high above the atmosphere
bouncing everything you say
to someone who was meant to hear
sometimes on a rainy day
i lie in bed and dream of you
so blame it on the satellite 
when your message can't get through

i am just a tiny wave
a minor ripple out at sea
moving slowly towards the shore
burdened with uncertainty 
i'm gaining power losing speed
wondering as i near your door
will you hold it open
for the title wave approaching shore

you've become an island
in the hazy world surrounding me
offering a vast reward
each time i safely cross the sea
all too often i become lost
in the fog and haze
clinging still against my will
to promises of clearer days

you've become an island 
in the hazy world surrounding me
offering a vast reward
each time i safely cross the sea
all too often i become lost 
in the fog and haze
clinging still against my will
to promises of clearer days

i am just a raindrop that accelerates 
without control 
losing bits and pieces in decent 
'til i'm no longer whole
i am just a shooting star
above that you might see
until i have your full attention 
i'll be anything but me

anything but me
anything but me

anything but me
anything but me---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
