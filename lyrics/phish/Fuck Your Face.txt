I went down to the guitar store to buy myself some things
I went home to fix this guitar to see if it could sing
When I got done I plugged it in and it made no sound at all
And I was getting pretty pissed so I plugged it in the wall

I guess it's not the singing type it would rather yell and spit
If you don't think you like this guitar you're really asking for shit
'Cause when I get mad I get red and I start to steam
And this guitar is gonna fuck your face 'cause it knows how to scream

Hi I'm bill
I was the one who did the cover art for the Stones
"Sucking in the Seventies" LP---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
