the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road

your car is the thing on the road
that takes you back to your abode

the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road

bummed is what you are
when you go out to your car
and its been towed

i woke up one morning in November 
and i realized i love you
its not your headlights in front
your tailpipe 
or the skylight above you
its the way you cling to the road 
when the wind tries to shove you
i'd never go driving away 
and come back home without you

the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car 
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
your car is the thing on the road 
that takes you back to your abode

the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road
the tires are the things on your car
that make contact with the road

bummed is what you are
when you go back to your car
and its been towed---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
