if you're just staring at your walls
observing echoing foot falls
from tenants wandering distant halls
then this one is for you

if children playing all around
to you is noise not pleasant sound
and you'd lost on the playground 
then this one is for you

all alone the life you lead
a silent diner where you feed
bow your head pretend to read
then this one is for you

slip past strangers in the street
there's no one that you care to meet
longing for your TV seat
than this one is for you---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
