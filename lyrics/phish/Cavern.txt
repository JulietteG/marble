your time is near, the missions clear
its later than you think
before you slip into the night
you'll want something to drink
steal away before the dawn
and bring us back good news
but if you tread in primal soup 
please wipe it from your shoes

just then a porthole pirate scourged
the evening with his cry
and sanctuary bugs deprived
a monkey of its thigh
a dust arose and clogged my nose 
before i could blink twice
despite the stuff that bubbled up
i gave some last advice

the flesh from Satan's dogs
will make the rudiments of gruel

deduct the carrots from your pay 
you worthless swampy fool

exploding then through fields and fen
and swimming in the mire
the septic maidens gargoyle tooth 
demented me with fire
i drifted where the current chose
afloat upon my back
and if perchance a newt slimmed by 
id stuff it in my sack 

soon i felt a bubble form 
somewhere below my skin
but with handy spine of hedge hog
i removed the force within
Suzie then removed her mask
and caused a mighty stir
the angry crowd responded 
taking turns at grabbing her

the foggy caverns musty grime
appeared within my palm

i snatched Ricks fork to scrape it of
the deadly icy calm

the crowd meanwhile had taken sue
and used her like a rag
to mop the slime from where the slug
had slithered with a bag

summing up the moral seems 
a little bit obscure...

give the director a serpent deflector 
a mud rat detector, a ribbon reflector
a cushion convector, a picture of nectar

whatever you do
take care of your shoes---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
