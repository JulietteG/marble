I love to lie and lie to love 
I'm hangin' on they push and shove 
Possession is the motivation 
That is hangin' up the goddamn nation 
Looks like we always end up in a rut 
Everybody now 
Tryin' to make it real compared to what 

Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs 
Twisted children killin' frogs 
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs 
Tired old ladies kissin' dogs 
I hate the human love of that stinking mutt 
I can't use it 
Tryin' to make it real compared to what 

President he's got his war 
Folks don't know just what it's for 
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason 
Have one doubt they call it treason 
We're chicken feathers 
All without one nut goddamn it 
Tryin' to make it real compared to what 

Church on Sunday sleep and nod 
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God 
Preachers fillin' us with fright 
They all tryin' to teach us what they think is right 
They really got to be some kind of nut 
I can't use it 
Tryin' to make it real compared to what 

Where's that bee and where's that honey 
Where's my God and where's my money 
Unreal values a crass distortion 
Unwed mothers need abortion 
Kind of brings to mind old young King Tut 
He did it now 
Tried to make it real compared to what 

Tryin' to make it real compared to what---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
