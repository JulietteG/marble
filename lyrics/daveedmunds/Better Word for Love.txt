Here's another morning, soon she'll be waking up
i watch her and wonder, is there a better word for love
so many times i've told her, it never seems enough
but i keep searching, for a better word for love

mumblin', stumblin', wonderin' when i'll find a way
i know, she knows there's nothing left to say

tonight when i'm out walking, i'll ask the stars above
if out there-somewhere, there's a better word for love

so here's another morning, soon she be waking up
i guess i'll just hold her tight till there's a
better word for love---Lyrics submitted by T.
