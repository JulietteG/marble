When I started out I thought that I would make it double-quick
I had that kind of confidence that I was picked to click
But if you could stand in my shoes you wouldn't feel so smart
'Cause I'm A-1 on the jukebox and nowhere on the chart

My agent gives me spending cash, his pockets seem so deep
I'd live just like a millionaire if it were mine to keep
But money ain't the problem, no, it ain't the smallest part
When you're A-1 on the jukebox and nowhere on the chart

A-1 on the jukebox, played in every bar
A-1 on the jukebox, big Wurlitzer star
I'm nowhere in the hit parade 'cause no one likes my art
And I'm A-1 on the jukebox and nowhere on the chart

I spend a fortune on the trades, they take my every cent
I see my name in black and white but words don't pay the rent
I know that I could fill a room if only I could start
But I'm A-1 on the jukebox and nowhere on the chart---Lyrics submitted by Fred Silver.
