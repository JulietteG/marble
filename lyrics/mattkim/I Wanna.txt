I wanna sleep through the weekend
I wanna try
I wanna walk on my own floor 
Before I die

And now, now the band tunes up
And now remember your lines
And all morning I woke up
And all day long no time

I wanna bring back the bison
I wanna try
I wanna close up the cabinets
Before I die

And now, now the band tunes up
And now remember your lines
And all morning I woke up
And all day long no time---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
