Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)
Tape holds things that cannot stick
and keep leftovers in the fridge
while lessons learned go down the drain
I can't believe in everything
All the bad names gone
And the good ones were all wrong

And so I stayed up all night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking about tomorrow won't change how
I feel today

Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)

Never let your mark erase
'cause broken legs can be replaced
two steps to the finish line
three sips till I finish mine
a straw will always suck it out
close your eyes and use your mouth
And tell me about your song

And so I stayed up night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking about tomorrow won't change how
I feel today

Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
