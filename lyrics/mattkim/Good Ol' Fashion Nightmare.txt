Show me the sidestreets in your life
Train yards like boneyards sharpened knives
Sidewalks are unassuming fields
Concrete and cracks won't cut you deals
Won't cut you deals
Won't cut you

Lost teeth like white jewels of some kind
petty theft for penny crimes
 For penny crimes
And we yell

Ahh like a good ol' fashoned nightmare
Ahhh ahh ahh
Ahh like a good ol' fashioned nightmare
Ahhh ahh ahh

Riding trains to the end of lines
Still we've got nothing but time
The skyline looks brighter tonight
Let's go smash out every light
Your left foot in front of right
In front of right
And we yell

Ahh like a good ol' fashioned nightmare
Ahhh ahh ahh
Ahh like a good ol' fashioned nightmare
Ahhh ahh ahh
Ahh like a good ol' fashioned nightmare
Ahhh ahh ahh
Ahh like a good ol' fashioned nightmare
Ahhh ahh ahh---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
