Verse 1
I play center field
for the home team
you might not see me
from the nose bleeds
i'll sep up on top
the dug out
and shout out
and wave my arms
and hold my tongue 
cause its not me

Chorus 
I wonder how fast is light speed
would life itself stay or follow me

Verse 2
And coach look at me now
 look at me now 
look at me now
and team look at me now 
look at me now 
look at me now
foul ball deep in center 
field ninth inning
two outs look at me now 
look at me now 
look at me now 
look at me now

Chorus
I wonder how fast is light speed 
would life itself stay or follow me
if i caught that one
would it be the same
if i could think 
this is just a game---Lyrics submitted by andre.
