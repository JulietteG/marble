And it all comes down to hope
Came down on me
I'm begging you now
I'm begging you please
Comes down to hope
Came down on me

Someday spare change
Won't feel the same
Stand up real tall
And wait to be called
Thoughts so strong
I feel them when you're gone

Ohh Thoughts so strong 
I feel them when you're gone

And these
Walks in the park
And meetings after dark
A sore sight
For sore eyes
Wild and free
You've got no place to be
Ohh comes down to hope
Came down on me---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
