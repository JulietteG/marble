P-brava, brava, bravissima
M-Christine, Christine
P-Christine
M-Where in the world have you been hiding?
  Really you were perfect
  I only wish I knew your secret, who is your great tutor?
C-(speaking)Meg, when your mother brought me here to live, whenever I'd come down here alone, to light a candle for my father, a voice, from above, & in my dreams, he was always there, you see, when my father lay dying, he told me I would be protected by an angel, an angel of music
M- Christine, do you believe? Do you believe the spirit of your father's coaching you?
C- Whoh else Meg? Who?
C-(singing again)Father once spoke of an angel, I used to dream he'd appear
now as I sing I can sense him, & I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly, somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know his always always with me, he the unseen guiness
M-Christine you must have been dreaming, stories like this can't come true,
Christine your talking in riddles, & it's not like you
C-Angel of music, guide & gardian, grant to me your glory
M(@ the same time as glory)-who is this angel, this
M & C(harmonizing)- Angel of music, hide no longer, secret & strange angel
C- He's with me even now
M-Your hands are cold
C(@ same time as cold)- all around me
M(@ same time as me)- your face Christine, it's white
C(same time as white)- it frightens me
M(same time as me)- don't be frightened---Lyrics submitted by Caity.
