Meg:
Where in the world have you been hinding?
Really, you were perfect!
I only wish I knew your secret;
Who is your great tutor?

Christine:
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly, somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's allways with me
He the unseen genius

Meg:
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true!
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you!

Christine:
Angel of music, gide and guardian
Grant to me your glory

Meg:
Who is this angel, this

Togheter:
Angel of music, hide no longer
Secret and strange angel!

Christine:
He's with me even now

Meg:
Your hands are cold

Christine:
All around me

Meg:
Your face, Christine, it's white

Christine:
It frightenes me

Meg:
Don't be frightened

Phantom:
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion
Basking in my glory
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triomphe!

Christine:
Angel, I hear you
Speak, I listen
Stay by my side, gide me
Angel, my soul was weak, forgive me
Enter at last, master

Phantom:
Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!

Christine:
Angel of music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of music, hide no longer
Come to me strange angel!

Phantom:
I am your angel of music...Come to me angel of music...---Lyrics submitted by Jasmien.
