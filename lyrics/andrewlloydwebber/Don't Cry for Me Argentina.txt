It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
when I tray to explain how I feel
that I still need your love after all that I've done.
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew.
Although she dressed up to the nine at sixes and sevens with you.

I had to let it happen, I had to change
couldn't stay all my life, not it here
looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
so, I chose freedom, running around, trying everything new
but nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it through

Don't cry for me, Argentina
the truth is I never left you
all through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame, I never invited them in
though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
they are illusion, they're not the solution they promise to be
the answer was here all the time: I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
the truth is I never left you
all through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

Have I said too much? 
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true

Don't cry for me, Argentina---Lyrics submitted by Benni Widjonarko Stoffer.
