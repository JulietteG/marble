Raoul:
No more talk of darkness, for-get these wide eyed fears; 
I'm here, noth-ing can harm you, my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears; 
I'm here, with you be-side you, to guard you and to guide you.

Christine:
All I ask is ev-ery wak-ing mo-ment, turn my head with talk of sum-mer-time. 
Say you need me with you now and al-ways;
Pro-mise me that all you say is true, that's all I ask of you.

Raoul:
Let me be your shel-ter, let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you, your fears are far be-hind you.

Christine:
All I want is free-dom, a world with o morre light; 
And you, al-ways be-side me, to hold me and to hide me.

Raoul:
Then say you'll share with me one love, one life-time; 
Let me lead you from your so-li-tude.
Say you need me with you, here be-side you, 
An-y where you go, let me go too. 
Christ-ine, that's all I ask of you.

Christine:
All I ask for is one love, one life-time; 
Say the word and I will fol-low.

Together:
Share each day with me, each night, each morn-ing.

Christine:               Raoul:
Say you love me!               You know I do.

Together:
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
An-y-where you go, let me go too;
Love me, that's all I ask of you.---Lyrics submitted by Emily Rose Smit.
