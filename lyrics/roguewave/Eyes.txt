Missed the last train home
Birds pass by to tell me that I'm not alone

Over pushing myself
To finish this part
Handle a lot
One thing, I miss
It's in your eyes

In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

Have you seen this film?
It reminds me of
Walking through the avenues

Washing my hands
Attachment scared
Land on the ground
One thing I miss
It's in your eyes---
