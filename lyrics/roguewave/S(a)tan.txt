Smashed apart the dishes, and put them in your brains
By your own emission, you're only filled with hate
Did what the devil wishes, and beckoned him to stay
In the bedsheets and plastic as they carried him away

Ah-Ah, Ah-Ah

You're born without a conscience
Or anything love'll do
What brought you to be like that 

But oh, who you gonna forgive
Seconds from his annihilation
Oh, what you got to give
You are nothing but your anger information

You spent up all your money, forgot to buy a bed
You tried to crack me open, but burned yourself instead
Well, I guess that you've proven you're a real son of a bitch
You tore down all the bridges without the fire switch

Oh, who you gonna forgive
Seconds from his annihilation
Oh, what you got to give
You are nothing but your anger information
You are nothing but your anger information
You are nothing but your anger information
You are nothing but the anger information---Lyrics submitted by Jess Kohs.
