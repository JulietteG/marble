MY ROCKIN DAYS
(Kenny ODell)

Recorded by THE CRICKETS

Well, I hung up my rocknroll shoes 
Just about ten years ago
I left my guitar at the pop shop
Cos I thought I was a-getting too o-old
Drivin in my pick-up truck today
I heard a song that was big back then
Well, I guess if you can hang in there long enough
Well, itll all come round again

I thought I'd said goodbye to My Rockin Days
I thought the world had passed me by
I thought the only thing left for me to do
Was just to grow a little older and die
I thought I said goodbye to My Rockin Days
But I can see how wrong Ive been
It just proves if you can hang in there long enough
Well, itll all come round again

Back then they said the music didnt have a melody
You couldnt sing along if you tried
Everybody said it wouldnt be too long
Til it would all roll over and die
My daddy used to tell me, son you gotta get a haircut
The long-haired thing it won't last
Now you can see 'em on the street everyday
They got their hair down to their arse

I thought I'd said goodbye to My Rockin Days
I thought the world had passed me by
I thought the only thing left for me to do
Was just to grow a little older and die
I thought I said goodbye to My Rockin Days
But I can see how wrong Ive been
It just proves if you can hang in there long enough
Well, itll all come round again
Well I guess if you can hang in there long enough
Well, it'll all come around again---Lyrics submitted by John Beecher.
