(feat. Lyle Lovett)

I'll take the long way home tonight
Please don't wake up I'll be alright
Going about my usual day, I had no idea
Cupid and friends had other plans for me, now i see

And so, before I call it a day
I'm making stops along the way
Well I'll be laughing with the moon in sea of delight
and thanking every little bitty star in sight
When I, take the long way home tonight

I'll take the long way home tonight
Please don't wake up I'll be alright
Going about my usual day, I had no idea
Cupid and friends had other plans for me, now i see

And so, first, before this day is through
I've got some things I've gotta do
Well I'll be laughing with the moon in sea of delight
and thanking every little bitty star in sight
When I, take the long way home tonight

Well I'll be winking to the wise owl who always knew
And babbling with the brook about my love for you
When I, take the long way home tonight, tonight
When I, take the long way home tonight---
