Too much time 
Too much space 
Looking for the truth 
Mountains you have had to climb 
Valleys you've been through 
I don't know about where you've been or where you going to 
I will get lost with you 

Oh Father, don't you worry 
I'll never let you down 
Oh Mother, when you need me 
I'll always be around 
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do 
I will get lost with you 

We all get lonely 
Trying to find a place where we should be 
Trying to find someone to set us free 
There are times a friend is all you need 
We all get lonely 
So stick with me 
Aw Yeah 
So stick with me 
We all get lonely 
So stick with me 

Too much shame 
Too much blame 
Non of it is true 
All the weight of your regrets 
We all got a few 
There's not so much to carry 
If you let me carry two 
Yeah I will be there with you 

Oh Father, don't you worry 
I'll never let you down 
Oh Mother, when you need me 
I'll always be around 
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do 
But I'll be there with you 

We all get lonely 
Trying to find a place where we should be 
Trying to find someone to set us free 
There are times a friend is all you need 
We all get lonely 
So stick with me 

We all get lonely 
We all get lonely 
We all get lonely 
Come on baby 

Oh Father, don't you worry 
I'll never let you down 
Oh Mother, when you need me 
I'll always be around 
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do 
But I'll be there with you 

We all get lonely 
Trying to find a place where we should be 
Trying to find someone to set us free 
There are times a friend is all you need 
We all get lonely 
So stick with me 
So stick with me 
Aw yeah---
