Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn
I wish thats how I felt
I just cant hide the fool that I am
as I let you walk away into the sunset
I was just another fine mess
I tried to do the right thing
ended up with nothing good
I blame Hollywood

{Chorus}
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero. (hero)
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth lije De-Niro. (De-Niro)
But it hurts without you and I look like a fool and I dont have a clue what to say when love breaks down....
'Cause this aint Tinseltown.

I made a mistake and I got confused
It's easy to forget
That this is really life, with so much to lose
When I let you walk away 
into the sunset
I wasn't broken-hearted
There'd be a happy ending but
But I ended up with nothing good 
I blame Hollywood

{Chorus}


Tinseltown (x4)

I fell for the lines
You that I would 
Hooray for Hollywood

{Chorus}
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)
I tried to be tough, to cool, to be smooth like De-Niro (De-Niro)
But it hurts without you and I look like a fool and I dont have a clue what to say when love breaks down...cause this aint Tinseltown.---Lyrics submitted by Allie Rich.
