Something's come, feel it down in my bones
Yeah it's been a long time gone, but ya here tonight
Now let's not look back, ya keeping me right on track
Feel the karma coming back, we're gonna be aright

If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win
If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in

Will be living on an all time high
I'm trying to keep it
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run
A change is gonna come
Living on an all time high
I'm gonna live it
First thought we couldn't but it can be done
Change is gonna come

Troubled times, been a good friend of mine
Yeah it's been around a while keeping me down
But through it all, even with a broken soul
Here I am standing tall cause you're around

If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win
If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in

Will be living on an all time high
I'm trying to keep it
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run
A change is gonna come
Living on an all time high
I'm gonna live it
First thought we couldn't but it can be done
Change is gonna come

For every sign that said we'd never find the means to
For every word they said they never heard that they knew
Given time I want some piece of mind
Same as you do
Sing it!

Change is
Coming
You better be waiting
You better be
Ready
Running
Faster, faster it's coming

Will be living on an all time high
I'm trying to keep it
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run
A change is gonna come
Living on an all time high
I'm gonna live it
First thought we couldn't but it can be done
Change is gonna come
