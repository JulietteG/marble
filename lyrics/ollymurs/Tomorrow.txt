You know its hard to be your friend
I hate to let you down again
We dont know how its gonna end
'Cause now you know the secret
I can never mend

'Cause this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow
Hearts are unchanged
Time that is left, is borrowed
And I cant take the way that you look at me
Is there any place you and I could be?
And we could go away
It all could go away

This silence is deafening
This ocean is without an end
And theres something I know
Something I know, we were meant to be
Please listen to me, are you listening?

'Cause this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow
Hearts are unchanged
Time that is left, is borrowed
And I cant take the way that you look at me
Is there any place you and I could be?
And we could go away
It all could go away

Tomorrow, tomorrow

And this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow
And hearts are unchanged
Time that is left, is borrowed
And I cant take the way that you look at me
Is there any place you and I could be?
And we could go away
This all could go away---
