All eyes on us like sunrise
Waiting on the day we break

Don't you want them all to remember our names?
Talk about our love and the trails we blaze
Cause the only thing that the world can't change is you and I

Something in your eyes, something in your eyes
Telling me we're running out of time, running out of time
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight
Can you just stay with me?

Lighting up the sky, lighting up the sky
Promise you that we can burn so bright, we can burn so bright
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight
We can make history

Why wait? Don't need to hear, "okay"
When we can make mistakes, I'll wait

Don't you want them all to remember our names?
Talk about our love and the trails we blaze
Cause the only thing that the world can't change is you and I

Something in your eyes, something in your eyes
Telling me we're running out of time, running out of time
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight
Can you just stay with me?

Lighting up the sky, lighting up the sky
Promise you that we can burn so bright, we can burn so bright
Baby if we only got tonight, only got tonight
We can make history

We don't need anything or anyone
We can rise higher than the sun
The only thing we'll ever need is you and me
So baby just stay with me

We don't need anything or anyone
We can rise higher than the sun
The only thing we'll ever need is you and me
We can make history---
