Have you been good? 
Have you been bad? 
Did you behave? 
It's alright, I hear the night, it's taking back what's mine

Just be patient, I'm a show you something new 
Yeah, that's right, I hear the night, it's taking back what's mine 
Oh, woo 

I can tell that you miss me, 'cause your eyes give it away 
I know you can't resist me 
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, girl, that you're listening 
I need to know that you care 
You know I'm dying to feel it, so show me, show me, show me that you missed me 

Oh

Sorry, I let you, but I make it work the way, (way) 
Yeah, I remember you, I want another taste 
It's alright, I hear the night, it's taking back what's mine 
(Yeah, yeah, giving him up)
