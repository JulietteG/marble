I

My Heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat
Olly Murs Rizzle Kicks (Yeah)

I can see youre not yourself
Even when youre here with me
I know that youre somewhere else
So put another record on
Kiss and leave me on
Nothing really matters when were dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
Cause every time we come this close
My heart skips-skips a beat

Chorus

So come on, spin me around
Now i dont wanna go home
Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know i should, but i cant leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
Thats when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh

II

So hung up, we cant let go
if you really have to leave one more time
just move me slow
So put another record on playing on repeat,
Nothing really matters when were dancing
Cause all you have need to know, is what you do to me,
And every time you hold me close.
My heart skips, skips a beat.

Chorus

So come on, spin me around
Now i dont wanna go home
Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know i should, but i cant leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
Thats when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Rizzle Kicks)
Yeah

Rap

At the start of the night i was like, what?
Lets have a team talk,
Playing with this lady isnt something Id agree for,
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see saw,
Oh, she let me sleep with her,
I figured he figures a sure-sure winner
Plus, Ive got to leave from the back
Im a skipper
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat.
(Skip A Beat)

Chorus

So come on, spin me around
Now i dont wanna go home
Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know i should, but i cant leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
Thats when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Yeah, Yeah)

My Heart skips, skips a beat
(My Heart Skips A Beat)
Oh oh oh oh oh
My heart skips, skips a beat.---Lyrics submitted by Sherwin Manuel.
