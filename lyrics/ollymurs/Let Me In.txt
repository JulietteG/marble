You keep that light on in your window 
Undo the locks and let me in 
I've come seeking by salvation 
Of one who's lost in search of it 
Of one who's lost in search of it 

Let me in and I will save you from the madness 
Let me in and I will keep you from the storm 
With every motion, every moment, that we've owned 
I'll be here to break the fall 

Keep that love light in your window 
Till I'll get back home to you 
Lift my heart and set my soul free 
Tell me love is the only truth 
Tell me love is the only truth 

Let me in and I will save you from the madness 
Let me in and I will keep you from the storm 
With every motion, every moment, that we've owned 
I'll be here to break the fall 

There's an open book stories to be told 
And I'll be here to tell them all 

Let me in and we can fill our lives with magic 
Let me in and we could keep with each other warm 
With every motion, every moment, that we've hold 
I'll be here to break the fall 
I'm always here to break the fall---
