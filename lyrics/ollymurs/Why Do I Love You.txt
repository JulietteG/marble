Your heart beat, so near me, but I can't break in 
How easy you control me, look at the state I'm in 
You've got me jumping like I'm up and down 
I'm inside out again 
You keep me running til the sun goes down 
Til the sun goes round again 

Why do I love you? Why do I care? 
I keep on chasing you, I'm going nowhere 
Why can't I hate you? Why don't I dare? 
Thought I saw an angel but there ain't nothing there 

Why do I love you? Why do I care? 
I keep on chasing you, I'm going nowhere 
Why can't I hate you? Why don't I dare? 
Thought I saw an angel but there ain't 
There ain't nothing there 

You're cold, your heart, I'm in too far 
I love you and I can't pretend 

That your heart beat's so near me, but I can't break in 
You've got me jumping like I'm up and down 
I'm inside out again 
You keep me running til the sun goes down 
Til the sun goes round again 

Why do I love you? Why do I care? 
I keep on chasing you, I'm going nowhere 
Why can't I hate you? Why don't I dare? 
Thought I saw an angel but there ain't nothing there 

Why do I love you? Why do I care? 
I keep on chasing you, I'm going nowhere 
Why can't I hate you? Why don't I dare? 
Thought I saw an angel but there ain't 
There ain't nothing there 

Real hearts don't feel this pain, let it go, let it go 
Real hearts don't feel this strain, let it go, let it go 
Real hearts don't feel this way, let it go, let it go 
This heart, won't ever change 

Why do I love you? Why do I care? 
I keep on chasing you, I'm going nowhere 
Why can't I hate you? Why don't I dare? 
Thought I saw an angel but there ain't nothing there---
