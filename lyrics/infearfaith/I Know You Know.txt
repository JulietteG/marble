Let's get this straight
The moment that you met me was your biggest mistake
One you'll never forget
I can't imagine never meeting you and knowing you
Life without consequence is no life at all
These past few months I've done so terrible things
But you were my worst, you are my biggest mistake

You are the only one
Who's changing me from what is in my heart
You had to know
You had to know

I never want to see you again
You want forgiveness?
Then go find religion
This is my finest hour
Everybody's gone at last
I can't stop

You are the only one
Who's changing me from what is in my heart
I can't fix everything
You're leaving me no choice at all
Today is lost, is lost, is lost!

Taking back all the words that you said
All the things that you've done
It will not change a thing

We're all a part of this
But we can make it alone
And all of the seas have been pulling
What's left to the bond
Creating a place for the lonely
And all the sease falling over my hand
Washing me back to the beginning
I shouldn't have failed to make a change within you
There's a reason why the evil ones prevail

I know you know!

It's been a long time coming
You know you shouldn't be testing me
Be testing me 
(X2)

You honestly, you honestly [You shouldn't be testing me]
Thought that I could change this time
(X2)

It's been a long time coming 
[Taking back all the words that you've said]
You know you shouldn't be testing me 
[All the things you've done]
It's been a long time coming 
[You haven't changed a thing]
