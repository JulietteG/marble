Come out of hiding, show us your face. 
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
Just close your eyes it'll all be ok.
The damage they've caused, is it worth it all?
(Worth it all) (x3)
What's taken away is the price they pay.
For goodness sake let it fade away.
Let go of the past, that tore you apart.
Embrace this chance for a brand new start.
We weren't meant to be one of them,
but to live life, love and give.
They can't fool us anymore. We're far too clever.
We'll leave them with their regrets.
To feel the pain
That's what they get, we're even now!
Let's walk away
Come out of hiding, show us your face. 
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
Just close your eyes it'll all be ok.
The damage they've caused, is it worth it all?
This is what real life tastes like.
So open your eyes and dive right in.
You know you've never seen a love like this...
Buried inside where I can't see.
Through these bars my future lies.
You love this life, but not through my eyes.
Where I can't see
Our time is up, no not that!
We'll leave them with their regrets.
To feel the pain
That's what they get, we're even now!
Let's walk away.
Don't close your eyes, it will all pass you by.---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
