A subdued silence undisturbed by the sound of her breath.
So carefully, brush her hair back from her eyes 
In steady sequence, one by one.
She slips away.

So close your eyes and sleep to dream.
I'm by your side. 
No words to speak.
We'll set our course and make it through.
No matter how far I go my heart remains with you.

And I'm not sure what I'm looking for. 
But it's clear to see the purpose of my exsistance Is laying here in front of me.

So close your eyes and sleep to dream.
I'm by your side. 
No words to speak.
We'll set our course and make it through.
No matter how far I go

And if all else fails you can look up at the sky
Because it's the same one that shines above you and I.
And if all else fails you can close your eyes
And I'll be right beside you.
I'll be the one by your side.

So close your eyes and sleep to dream.
I'm by your side. 
No words to speak.
We'll set our course and make it through.
No matter how far I go
No matter how much this hurts
I wanted you to know, 
My heart remains with you.---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
