Tiger Lily.

We drive tonight,
And you are by my side.
We're talking about our lives,
Like we've known each other forever.
The time flies by,
With the sound of your voice.
Its close to paradise,
With the end surely near.
And if I could only stop the car
And hold onto you,
And never let go (and never let go)
I'll never let go (I'll never let go)
As we round the corner
To your house
You turned to me and said,
"I'll be going through withdrawal of you
For this one night we have spent"
And, I want to speak these words
But I guess I'll just bite my tongue,
And accept "someday, somehow"
As the words that we'll hang from.

And I (I..), i don't want to speak these words.
Because I (because I..), I don't want to make things any worse.
And I (I..), I don't want to speak these words.
Because I, I don't want to make things any worse.

Why does tonight, have to end?
Why don't we hit restart,
And pause it at our favorite parts.
We'll skip the goodbyes.
If I had it my way,
I'd turn the car around and runaway,
Just you and I.

And I (I..), I don't want to speak these words.
Because i (because I..), I don't want to make things any worse. (any worse)
And I (i..), I don't want to speak these words
Because I, I don't want to make things
And I, I don't want to make things any worse---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
