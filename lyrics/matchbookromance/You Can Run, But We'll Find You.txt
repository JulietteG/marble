Have you, 
have you been keeping secrets from me?
Hoped I wouldn't find out, 
And you'd just go free
There's a whole world beside your window pane, 
and I've got scars to prove it, 
but you've should have known
You should have known, you should have know, you should have known

Run,
you can run
You can run, 
but we'll find you

Was it everything you thought it would be?
Keep your world spining, 
left you dizzy
Your apologies with never sooth the sting, 
just keep scraching our eyes out
You should have known, you should have known
You should have known, you should have known

Run,
you can run
You can run,
but we'll find you
Yeah

Run, 
you can run
You can run,
but we'll find you
We'll find you
We'll find you---Lyrics submitted by Kt.
