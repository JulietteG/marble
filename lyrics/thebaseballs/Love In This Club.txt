I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club

You say you searchin' for a nigga
That'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here, baby
And let daddy show you what it feel like

You know all you gotta do is
Tell me what you sippin' on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin'
All night long

Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that shorty I've got a thing for you
Doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it
I can tell by the way you lookin' at me girl

I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club

Listen, you got some friends rollin' with you
Baby, then that's cool
You can leave them with my buddies
Let 'em know that I got you

If you didn't know
You're the only thing that's on my mind
'Cause the way I'm starin' at you
Got me wantin' to give it to you all night

Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side
I can't take it no more
Baby, I'm comin' for you
You keep doin' it on purpose windin' and workin' it
If we close our eyes it could be just me and you

I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club

In this club (ohh)
In this club (oh yeah)
I wanna make love

Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touchin' like this
I know you scared baby
They don't know what we doin'

Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up girl then I swear
I'mma give it to you non stop
And I don't care who's watchin'
Who's Watchin'
Who's Watchin'

Who's Watchin'
Who's Watchin'
Who's Watchin'

I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club
I wanna make love in this club
in this club, in this club---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
