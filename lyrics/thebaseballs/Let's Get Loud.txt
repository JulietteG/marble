Let's get loud

If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way and don't you waste it
(don't you waste it)
Every feelin' every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it
You gotta do it
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it
you gotta do it your way
You gotta do it

Life's a party, make it hot
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm
(Yeah, rythm)
Every minute, every day
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em ('cause I live my life)
You gotta do it (you gotta do it)
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (you gotta prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (prove it)

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you
What you gotta do, no no

Life's meant to be big fun
You're not hurtin' anyone
Nobody loses
(loses)
let the music make you free
be what you wanna be make no excuses
(excuses)

You gotta do it (you gotta do it)
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (you gotta prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it
you gotta do it your way
Come on and prove it (prove it)

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you
What you gotta do, no no---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
