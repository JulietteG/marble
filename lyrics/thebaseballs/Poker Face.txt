I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas please
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got (2x)

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face (Mum mum mum mah) (2x)

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's loveif its not rough it isn't fun, fun

oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got (2x)

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face (Mum mum mum mah) (2x)

I won't tell you that I loev you - kiss or hug you
Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino - Take our bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

CHORUS (3X)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face (she's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face (Mum mum mum mah) (5x)---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
