Walking like a man, hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam, never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop, she's got the look (she's got the look)
Heavenly bound 'cos heaven's got a number
When she's spinning me around, kissing is a colour
Her loving is a wild dog, she's got the look (she's got the look)

She's got the look (she's got the look)
She's got the look (she's got the look)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la, she's got the look

She's got the look

Fire in the ice, naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise, banging on the head drum
Shaking like a mad bull, she's got the look (she's got the look)
Swaying to the band, moving like a hammer
She's a miracle man, loving is the ocean
Kissing is the wet sand, she's got the look (she's got the look)

She's got the look (she's got the look)
She's got the look (she's got the look)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la, she's got the look

Shes got the look (she's got the look)

She's got the look, She's got the look

She's got the look

Walking like a man, hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam, never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop, she's got the look 
Heavenly bound 'cos heaven's got a number
When she's spinning me around, kissing is a colour
Her loving is a wild dog, she's got the look

Shes got the look
She's got the look (she's got the look)

She's got the look (she's got the look)
She's got the look (she's got the look)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la, she's got the look

she's got the look, she's got the look

one, two, one, two, three, four 

Shes got the look
She's got the look (she's got the look)

She's got the look (she's got the look)
She's got the look (she's got the look)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la, she's got the look

She's got the look
