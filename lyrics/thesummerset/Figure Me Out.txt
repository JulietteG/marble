Im a bit too pop for the punk kids
But Im too punk for the pop kids
I dont know just where I fit in
Cause when I open my mouth I know nobodys listenin
To the words of a prophet
Who still cant turn a profit
Cuz I don't fit in with the in crowd
But Im too Hollywood to go back to my hometown
Cause they think that Im famous
When I know Im a fraud
Who got too fucked up on the finer things
To remember who he forgot
But I believe theres more to life than all my problems
Maybe theres still hope for me to start again
Ill get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think its time for me to figure me out
Lets get back to the basics
And take it back to the basement
Where I heard Born to Run for the  first time 
And I stared at my dad in amazement
He said Son, dont stop chasing great and
Keep pounding the pavement
So Id much rather die trying to make something sacred
Then live as another Youtube sensation
Cause I hate that theyre famous
For being something theyre not
While Im too hung up on the things I dont have
To appreciate what Ive got
But I believe theres more to life than all my problems
Maybe theres still hope for me to start again
Ill get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think its time for me to figure me out
So if you hear this song turn it up real loud
Cuz its time for me to figure me out
I believe theres more to life than all my problems
I just wanna fall in love before Im dead
So I can make my parents proud
I hope my feet dont fail me now
I think its time for me to figure me out---
