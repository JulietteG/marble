"Legendary"

When I was a kid, Id fly around and Peter would mention
Dont be afraid to die, 'cause to die would be an awfully big adventure
One day I stopped believing, now my friends say theyre so bored of me
I used to be a real boy with real plans, now Im just reality TV

I used to be your knight in shining armor, and Id rescue you from hell
Lately I stare into the mirror, and I say to myself,

Ive spent too many nights watching How I Met Your Mother alone
Now Im searching for my yellow umbrella, hoping Ill take her home
Maybe I just wanna be legendary
Yeah we all just wanna be legendary, oh

Im done chasing actresses, Im full of love, and theyre all full of shit
Now Im stumbling out the bar. One more fame-monster story, Ill be sick
One day I stopped believing, and all at once the magic had died
I just need to accept, friends grow up and lovers will lie

Oh, I used to be James Dean, now its celebrity rehab hell
I swear that I could be amazing, I just need a little help

Ive spent too many nights watching How I Met Your Mother alone
Now Im searching for my yellow umbrella, hoping Ill take her home
Maybe I just wanna be legendary
Yeah we all just wanna be legendary, oh

Da-da-da-la-la-la-la
Da-da-da-la-la-la-la
Da-da-da-la-la-la-la
Da-da-da-la-la-la-la
Da-da-da-la-la-la-la

(Used to be your knight in shining armor, and Id rescue you from hell,
I swear that I could be amazing, I just need a little help)

I was your knight in shining armor, and I'd rescue you from hell
I swear that I could be amazing

Ive spent too many nights watching How I Met Your Mother alone
Now Im searching for my yellow umbrella, hoping Ill take her home
Maybe I just wanna be legendary
Yeah we all wanna be legendary to somebody
Yeah to somebody, oh, oh.---Lyrics submitted by Jaylyn M.
