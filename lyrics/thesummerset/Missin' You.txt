(Hey)

Woke up in living color
The city turned from grey to gold
Sleeping with your shadow
But now I'm shaking off your ghost
So no more wasted days
Addicted to your face
Now I don't want you and I don't need you anymore

Give me back my records
Throw our memories in the trash
You can keep the sweater
Don't think I ever want it back
You let the stitches break
Now it don't feel the same
Now I don't want you and I don't need you anymore

Hey
Feels like I'm finally living more than ever
Since you've been gone I've never felt so alive
Hell yeah, alright, I ain't missin' you
Hey
Just give me every drink and every number
You know I'm only getting better at night
Hell yeah, alright, I ain't missin' you

There's no bad blood between us
The worst of us is in the past
I'm finally moving forward
Just know I'll always have your back
Heard you're doing great
I'm in a better place
Now I don't want you and I don't need you anymore

Hey!
I ain't missin' you
Hey!
I ain't missin' you
Hell yeah, alright, I ain't missin' you

Hey!
I don't want you, no I don't need you
I don't want you, no I don't need you
I don't want you, no I don't need you
(No, no, no, no)
I don't want you, no

Hey!
I ain't missin' you
Hey!
I ain't missin' you
Hell yeah, alright, I ain't missin' you
Hell yeah, alright
Hell yeah, alright, I ain't missin' you---
