I find a skeleton under your bed
How could you sell me out for a kid like that?
I'm doing everything I can to make you jealous
Are you jealous?

Oh are you nervous, like your freshman year
Still can't shake this nightmare
Get me out of your hair
The truth, I know ...

I heard you're talking shit again
I'm gonna sleep with all your friends
It's too bad
The boys you do, get back at you
You can't forget the monsters in your bed

I put a monster in your bed
Turned out the lights
Tucked him in and said goodnight

I bet you thought I'd throw the fight
Oh you just don't know how low I can go
Like (oh, oh, oh)
You're making me sick, girl (oh, oh)

I heard you're talking shit again
I'm gonna sleep with all your friends
It's too bad
The boys you do, get back at you
You can't forget the monsters in your bed

We'll fall out again
Don't ever wanna see you again
Push all my feelings aside
I'll be alright
Won't let your face keep me up all night

Don't wanna start talking again
Cause I'll go crazy again
Why do this to myself?
Do this to myself

I find a skeleton under your bed
How could you sell me out for a kid like that?
I'm doing everything I can to make you jealous

I heard you're talking shit again
I'm gonna sleep with all your friends
It's too bad
The boys you do, get back at you
You can't forget the monsters in your bed

I heard you're talking shit again (Woah oh oh)
I'm gonna sleep with all your friends
It's too bad
The boys you do, get back at you
You can't forget the monsters in your bed (Oh woah oh oh)
(Yeah)---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
