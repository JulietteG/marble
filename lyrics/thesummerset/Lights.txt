Just keep me close tonight. 
Under the covers, 
she said let's make this right.
Cause we're all we'll ever need,
And we got time.

So keep the lights down low
Oh oh, you know, you do this to me. 
So speak up if you feel the way I feel
We never love like this 

Don't hurry just slow it down now. 
We got time to make our move
Don't hurry just slow it down now. 
Step back, oh its time wasting 

Oh oh

You know, the cold night air
It's not the only thing making me shake 
We could be anywhere
From LA lights, to Arizona skies
Cause we're all we'll ever need 
The two of us on on the silver screen

So stay close, don't forget it, don't forget it
You've got me.

So keep the lights down low
Oh oh, you know, you do this to me. 
So speak up if you feel the way I feel
We never loved like this 

Don't hurry just slow it down now 
We got time to make our move
Don't hurry just slow it down now
Step back, oh its time we're wasting 

So keep the lights down low
Cause this is all we'll ever need
So keep the lights down low
Oh oh... 

Don't hurry just slow it down now 
We got time to make our move
Don't hurry just slow it down now
Step back, oh its time we're wasting 

Don't hurry just slow it down now 
We got time to make our move
Don't hurry just slow it down now
Step back, oh its time we're wasting 

(Oh oh)---
