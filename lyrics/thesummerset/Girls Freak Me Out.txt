Have you heard about the new girl on the block
In her black out benz?
With her old school kicks and her hipster friends
Got a peace sign in hand
She's everything you want and all you hated
Well dressed and overrated
Some girls freak me out

Well, Daddy's little girl knows how to party
She's signing "Pour Some Sugar On Me"
She's well versed in the new pop culture
Always rolls with a camera by her side
Well, some girls just freak me out

She's the sweetest, the sweetest thing
But I know she's no good for me
Gonna take you home and take off your clothes
Baby, I'm nothin' but bad news

Hooked up with the new girl on the block
Wonder where she's been?
Now I'm laughing, drinking with my friends

Body shots 'till the party ends
Yeah, did I clean up the mess?
So go to hell?
Well, some girls just freak me

She's the sweetest, the sweetest thing
But I know she's no good for me
Gonna take you home and take off your clothes
Baby, I'm nothin' but bad news

Some girls freak me out
Some girls freak me out
Some girls freak me out
Freak me out

She's the sweetest, the sweetest thing
But I know she's no good for me
Gonna take you home and take off your clothes
Baby, I'm nothin' but bad news
Nothin' but bad news

She's the sweetest, the sweetest thing
But I know she's no good for me
Gonna take you home and take off your clothes
Baby, I'm nothin' but bad news

Nothin' but bad news
Baby, I'm nothin' but bad news
Nothin' but bad news---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
