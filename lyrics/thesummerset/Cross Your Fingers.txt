Stay up around the clock
Untill you get your fix,
you get your fix

Oh, I'm gonna keep you here all night
If you're ready for this

I'm Gonna give, give,
everything I've got
Keep up, but keep it down
I'm Gonna give, give,
everything I've got
keep it down

Forget the night life
You're my favorite thing
about this town
Come with me
I'll take you home

And you can stay the night
If you cross your fingers

You got a heavy heart, I'm sure
You got me where you want me
You're running circles in my head
Are you restless, are you ruthless?
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready?

I'm Gonna give, give,
everything I've got
Keep up, but keep it down
I'm Gonna give, give,
everything I've got
keep it down

Forget the night life
You're my favorite thing
about this town
Come with me
I'll take you home

And you can stay the night
If you cross your fingers

Stay up around the clock
Keep up, but keep it down
Stay up around the clock
Are you ready?
Are you ready for this?

Forget the night life
You're my favorite thing
about this town
Come with me
I'll take you home

And you can stay the night
If you cross your fingers

Forget the night life
(are you ready for this)
You're my favorite thing
My favorite thing
(You've got me where you want me
You've got me oh...)

You can stay the night,
If you cross your fingers---
