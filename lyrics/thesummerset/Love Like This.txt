I've got a way with counting cards
And you've got a way of breaking hearts
I've got the keys to a real fast car
And you're a real fast girl

I want a love like this
Won't you show me a love like that? 
Whoooa
They say that love's a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life 
For a bitch like this
For a kiss like this

Take off your jeans and your cowboy boots
I like you best in my cheap suit. 
Whooa
I cut the breaks to your racing heart
Cause you're a real fast girl

I want a love like this
Won't you show me a love like that? 
Whoooa
They say that love's a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life 
For a bitch like this
For a kiss like this

Clean up the hotel suite
You've made a mess of me
You've got me on my knees
I'm spinning out

I'm tangled in your sheets
You've got the best of me
We're never coming down
But we're coming

I want a love like this
Won't you show me a love like that?
Whoooa
They say that love's a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life 
For a bitch like

I want a love like this
Won't you show me a love like that?
Whoooa
They say that love's a bitch
Read my lips
I've waited all my life 
For a bitch like

Waited all my life for a love like
Waited all my life for a kiss like this
For a kiss like this
For a kiss like this
For a kiss like this
For a kiss like this---
