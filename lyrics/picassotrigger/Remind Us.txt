I dont know where this is going
Im taking a ride on a wing and a prayer
Follow me there
Well both be surprised
If we forget anything
Hopefully nobody will remind us

Cant bear the news in the evening
Were going to bed and were going to war
All of this for
Anyones guess
If we forget anything
Heaven forbid someone would remind us

Sinners and saints, priests and kings
Are we just using God for our own gain
Whats in a name
Open your eyes
If we forget everything
There will be no one left to remind us

I dont know where this is going
Im taking a ride on a wing and a prayer
Follow me there
Well both be surprised---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
