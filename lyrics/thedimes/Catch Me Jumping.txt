I saw your picture at the booth
And there's a uniform man
Here waiting for you
And you smashed your camera on the wall
For the fear in alcohol
And I was willing to take the fall

But you won't see me floating
You know I'll be sinking in
And you won't catch me running
Try and catch me jumping

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

A man with a badge he wears like a crown
The long arm came down
And you were nowhere to be found
So they checked our bags for a stowaway
And by land and by sea
You couldn't get away
So you took to the air and you
Jumped into the front page

Singin' you won't see me floating
You know I'll be sinking in
And you won't catch me running
Try and catch me jumping

Whoa, whoa, whoa...---Lyrics submitted by Mya.
