I've been living by the corner of the street for years
Where the younger boys and girls meet up
After school trying to act so cool
As their mopeds and their heartbeats speed up

Oh, the times I've wasted
Oh, the times I've wasted

Spending countless days and eves on top
Of the boot and shoe repair shop
Making plans for conquering the world
With my latest brand of indie-rock

Oh, the times I've wasted
Oh, the times I've wasted

But my country drowns in wealth
And I've got excellent health

So I'm a feeling like a bird
I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Till someone's gonna shoot me down

I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Ain't my mind gonna shoot me down

For a life time been thinkin' about life and fate
Been avoiding all the big decisions
Sitting by my computer screen
If I'm tired of it there's television

Oh, the times I've wasted

Sitting by the step for someone to stop
When it looks like I'm waiting for the sky to drop
With everyday that's slippin' away
I'm stuck with just a lil' less time to say

Oh, the times I've wasted
Oh, the times I've wasted

But my country drowns in wealth
And I've got excellent health

So I'm a feeling like a bird
I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Till someone's gonna shoot me down

I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Ain't my mind gonna shoot me down

I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Till someone's gonna shoot me down

Oh, the times I've wasted
Oh, the times I've wasted
Oh, the times I've wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Till someone's gonna shoot me down

I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird
I've been feeling like a bird
Been a bird ever since my birth
Ain't my mind gonna shoot me down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
