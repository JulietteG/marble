Away away, come away with me
where the grass grows wild 
where the wind blows free
away away, come away with me
and I'll build you a home in the meadow.

Chorus:
Come come, then's a wonderous land
for the hopeful heart
for the willing hand
come come, then's a wonderous land
where I'll build you a home in the meadow.

The stars the stars, oh how bright they'll shine 
on a world the lord must have helped design
The stars the stars, oh how bright they'll shine
on that home we will build in the meadow.

Repeat chorus.---Lyrics submitted by Mark Rosenthal.
