Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers.
Our buildings rival the heavens. 
Our bridges span the seas. 

Ingenuity is so cunning. 
Innovation is not ours. 
Creativity is a luxury.

We build with our hands what we have in our hearts. 
Fight the avalanche. You'll be buried every time. 
(We run and run and run.) Keep falling behind. 
Fight the avalanche. You'll be buried every time. 
(We run and run and run.) Always last in line. 

Before lines were lines, before time was time, 
the Author wrote a story in the sky, and earth below. 

Little do we know we have only what we're given. 
Light up the sky. We're going where no man has ever gone. 
Little do we know we have only what we're given. 
Light up the sky. We're going where no man's forgotten. 

All You are is all we want. It burns inside us all. 
We're finding heart in giving soul. 
We're walking home into thin air singing.... 

*Ooh-Waaah-OoOooOoooh-Ooh-Waaah-OooOoooooh...*

We are justice fighters with faces of fire. 
Many walk away, but we stand firm. 
We are justice fighters with faces of fire. 
Our decisions affect our descendants. 
We are justice fighters with faces of fire. 

Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers. 
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing history. 
Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers. 
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing history---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
