Destroy everything cleanse
Wipe away the filth
Set fire to your waste
Burn everything
Back into dirt
Burn everything

Flood, drown the earth
Flood, drown the earth
It's what we deserve

Rehash the poisons
You breathe in the air
Tear down what you say your father created
Constructing buildings over buildings
Conceal history like a shameful scar
This world has lived for a million years with more to come
It's only a matter of time until you choke on your indifference
Struggling to breathe as the water fills your lungs
Trying hard to scream as it rises into your throat

The reckless, the careless
Will reign until the oceans rise

Flood, drown the earth
Flood, drown the earth
It's what we deserve
It's what we deserve
It's what we deserve
It's what we deserve
It's what we deserve

This world has lived for a million years with more to come
It's only a matter of time until you choke on your indifference
Struggling to breathe as the water fills your lungs
Trying hard to scream as it rises into your throat

Wake up
And save yourself
The sea will reclaim
What it worked to create
Wake up
Save yourself
Pick up the pieces
Ask for forgiveness---
