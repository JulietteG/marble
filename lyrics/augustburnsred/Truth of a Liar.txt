Allow what's done to preach new insight to your life
My sight is perfect vision
The past is easiest to see
Clear a path, Stand aside
We're carrying the torch now
Clear a path, Stand aside
Were carrying the torch now
Clear a path, Stand aside
There's no stopping us
Clear a path, Stand aside
Were carrying the torch now
Clear a path, Stand aside
Theres no stopping us
You might think your everything (to everyone) to everyone
Go ahead, Partake it, Justify it
Become engulfed in it
It will eat you alive
This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end
This is not a one way road
Youre headed for the dead end
You might think you're everything to everyone
Well pardon me if I intrude
You might think youre everything (to everyone)
You're not a perfect man in a perfect world
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
All this will be buried, Like the fall of Rome
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
You will come crashing down
The truth hurts, (The truth hurts)
The truth hurts, (The truth hurts)
The truth hurts, (The truth hurts)
But denials what will kill you
All that you loved, All that you treasure, Will pass with time, Will pass with time
Blinded by the inability to see beyond flesh and blood
Blinded by the inability to see beyond flesh and blood
Shifting blame with a log in your eye
Insisting that a string tied to your limbs, Is what's to blame, Is whats to blame
Suck it up and bite the bullet---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
