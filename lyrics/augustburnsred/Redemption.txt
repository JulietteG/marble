I trust in You for life to live
And air to breath
Purity fills my lungs
I trust in You for life to live
And air to breath
Purity fills my lungs

I no longer live in solitude
No longer bound
My heart beats with great devotion
This is the start to a new beginning
I no longer live in solitude
No longer bound
My heart beats with great devotion
This is the start to a new beginning

On my knees
Praying for mercy
Hands raised high
Humble and broken

Wanting Your grace
Wanting Your security
Memories of laying face down
Motionless, with such a hollow feeling inside
Soon I would end this life I was living

I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim
I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim
I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim
I am just a man
With a heart and sinful hands
I am a fallen victim

Lord, show me the way
Let my words be Your words
Let my thoughts be Your thoughts
Let my words be Your words
Lord, show me the way
I ask of You Father
To You, I give my praise
To You, I give my praise
To You, I give my praise

Show me the way
Take me in Your arms
Never let me go

I trust in You
I trust in You
For life to live
For live to live
And to breathe
And to breathe
Purity fills my lungs
Lord, show me the way
As I give myself to you
Never let me go
Hold me with Your everlasting love
Be my strength
Be my voice
My glory
Set me free---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
