Suffocation, suffocate with,
with no room, room to breath, to breath

Forgive us for, now it's too late
This is not, an American dream
This is, no longer, an American dream
This is, no longer, an American dream (American dream)

We are, trying to breath, 
We are trying to breath underwater
Trying to breath, underwater

The few the proud, no longer sing, their song
One nation, under God, it's us against the world
One nation, under God, it's us against the world
It's us, against the world, us against the world
It's us, against the world, us against the world

We've cut the tounge, from society
Forsake, consumption, neverending

We've brainwashed our children, to believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten, still counting their one, two, threes
We've brainwashed our children, to believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten, still counting their one, two, threes

Forgive us for, now it's too late
Forgive us for, leaving the fight

This is not, an American dream, any longer
As we've become spoiled, rotten, still counting our one, two...
Threes

Disease, infesting our young
Beauty, has become the beast
Beauty, has become the, beast

Beauty, has become, the beast
Beauty, has become, the beast
Beauty has become---Lyrics submitted by Antony.
