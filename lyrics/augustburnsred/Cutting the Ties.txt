Silence is a frustrating answer when all you want is a sign.
Silence is a frustrating answer when all you wanted is a sign.

Its hard to be surrounded by the ones that you love when they keep passing you by.
(passing you by)

Beneath the tough facade I know that we are getting through.
None of us are ready to just remember you.

Whenever you are lost, I know that we can find you standing outside screaming at the sky.

Dont let the tears of agony consume your heart.
Let it beat on in hopes and dreams of a new start.

No one knows the weight on your shoulders.
No one knows the burdens you bare. These thoughts wont stop.

Id be so easy to take the easy way out. Id be so easy to take the easy way out.

Compassion is a beautiful thing, so show some for yourself.
Rock solid from the outside looking in.
Rock solid from the outside looking in. Inside youre praying for help.
Rock solid from the outside looking in. Youre praying for help.

Its hard to be surrounded by the ones that you love when they keep passing you by.
(passing you by)

Beneath the tough facade I know that we are getting through.
Life is a gift. Remember this. Remember this.

Break free. Break free. Break free.

I know silence is a hard answer when all you want is a sign.
Patience is a virtue. (a virtue) You will be revived.---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
