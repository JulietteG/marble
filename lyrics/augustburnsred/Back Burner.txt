Convictions to the Back Burner . 2x. 

Remembering whats really important isn't so important after all.

Gather all your possesions, and smile because you got it all. 2x

Smile because you got it all. 2x

Still that empty feeling won't go away. 2x

Your puzzle is missing one very essential peice, and I know you'll keep looking in 
all the wrong places untill it is too late.

Slip on the ice again.

When did you become so cold?

Living for here and now never made so, so much sense.

slip on the ice again.

When did you become so cold?

You think you got all the time in the world but this could all be ending now. 

How far down will you go before it is too late?

Slipping on the ice again, you've become so cold.

Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight. 2x

Your wake up call is set for now, and the trail you have followed has come all the way to the end.

I hope you survive, survive the crash.---Lyrics submitted by matt.
