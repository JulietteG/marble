Closed off, we wake from the dusk... (the dusk)
only to step out into open air, just to see the same clouds opening. (Yeahh)
Into open air... only to step out...

If this is a place people dream of, (people dream of)
insomnia is the only cure - the only antidote.
Youve been deceived into thinking this is the perfect life.
Its an illusion to your perception. Youve been deceived.

I wish time was still ancient so I could bridge the gap (bridge the gap)
between here, between there, between you and I. (between you and I)
Frustration is setting in. I am seeing red. (Im seeing red)
This blessing is a curse. I am seeing red. (I am seeing red)

Counting all the things that I took for granted. Counting down the days.
Watching the clock as it just stands still... to just sail away, sail away, sail away.
Waiting for the morning that takes me home, that takes me home, to take me home.

This bittersweet dream that I dreamt. Oh Pangaea.

All of this is worth every penny - every cent.
I would give back everything just to be back... back home.

This is a bittersweet dream Ive dreamt. Oh Pangaea, where have you gone?
Im at all four corners of this world. Oh Pangaea, what have you done?
This is a bittersweet dream Ive dreamt. Oh Pangaea, where have you gone?
Im at all four corners of this world. Pangaea, what have you done?---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
