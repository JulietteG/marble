Open your closed mind. (Open your closed mind.)
Close your open mouth.
You're pushing more than you're pulling.
Every word that you say passes through my...
Open your closed mind. Close your open mouth.
You're pushing more than you're pulling.

Every word that you say passes through my

EARS

Before it even escapes your lips.

No one learns from someone they hate.
Your mouth is like a grenade.
No one learns from someone they hate.
Your mouth is like a grenade,
Blowing everyone away. Oh.

How many have you pushed away,
And how many have you saved? (2x)

Pick and choose based on a face,
But it's all in the heart.
Pick and choose based on a face,
But it's all in the heart
That carries weight.

Don't judge until you've taken it all in,
'Cause in the end you'll pray to stay above the flames.

Open your closed mind and close your open mouth.
You're pushing more, you're pushing more than you are pulling.
Every word that you say passes through my ears
Before it even escapes, before it even escapes.

Open your closed mind (Open your closed mind)
And close your open mouth.
You're pushing more, you're pushing more
Than you are pulling.

Open your closed mind and close your open mouth.
You're pushing more, you're pushing more
Than you are pulling. (3x)---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
