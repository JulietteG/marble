Shake it off, pick yourself up, they say
Your life, fell apart in your hands, and you've got the scars, to prove it
It's not the first time, and they're getting, deeper

Pull, it together
Button up, your shirt
Roll, down those sleeves
Don't let them see how you've coped

It's not the first time, and they're, getting deeper
More and more, your demeanor, looks like, quicksand
More and more, your demeanor, looks like, quicksand

It seems like, you're giving up
Giving up on everything, you worked for
It seems like, you're giving up
Giving up on everything, you worked for

It's pulling you under, it's gripping around your throat
It's pulling you under, it's gripping around your throat

It seems like, you're giving up on everything
It seems, like you're giving up, on everything

It's pulling you under
It's, pulling, you under

Life, can be, overwhelming
But don't, turn your back on, the strongest crutch,
You've ever had, you've ever had

I have, always been there, to brace your fall
Wave goodbye, to the past
(You've got your whole, life to lead)
Wave goodbye, to the past
(You've got your whole, life to lead)
Wave goodbye, to the past
(You've got your whole, life to lead)
Wave goodbye, to the past
(You've got your whole, life to lead)
(You've got your whole, life to lead)
(You've got your whole, life to lead)
It's time to gain, some, ground---Lyrics submitted by Antony.
