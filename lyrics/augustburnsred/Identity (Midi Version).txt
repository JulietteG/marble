Do you know how it feels to hide
with thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie.
Truth is, you cant decide where my heart resides.

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick.
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am.
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
and cast aside from the man that I am.

Ive never felt so free.
It kills me to hear you say you choose to love me.
I was hoping that would be a given, given our history.
Ive never felt so free, so free

You think Im wrong, you think Im wrong
but I never felt better.

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie.
I thought blood was thicker than water.
You think Im wrong but I never felt better.

I know I disappointed you,
but Ive got nothing to prove.

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick.
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am.
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand,
but now Ive realized this is who I am.
Ive made my decision, youre either with or against me.

Youre either with or against me.

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie.
I thought blood was thicker than water.
You think Im wrong but I never felt better.

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie.

Im standing firm. Its who I am.
You cant keep me, you cant keep me down.
Im moving on. Im living free.
You cant stop me, you cant stop me now.---
