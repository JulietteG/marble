If blood is running through my veins
If Ive been given another day
If I can open my eyes
theres got to be a reason why
In the morning when I wake up
If theres air filling up my lungs
If Im still alive
Theres got to be reason why
Oh, if my hearts still beating

It's only so I can love
The Lord my God with all my heart
So I can love, love anyone with open arms
I wanna live with no regrets when all is said and done
If Im still breathing theres a reason
Its only so I can love

I wasnt made just to take up space
I want to give my life away
Im going to leave a mark
Be a light in the dark
Grace is going to be what Im about
Help people lay their burdens down
Theres only so much time
Before I leave this world behind
Oh, if my hearts still beating

Because He rescued me, He laid down His life
Because He first loved me
Its the reason why I love
Hes the reason why I love---
