Gracious
Slow to anger
Abounding in love
Good to all
All who call upon You
You will rescue and forgive

This is why I live

You lived a life I could never live
You died the death, oh, that I deserve
You rose to life and now You live
That's how You forgive

Forgive me
In Your mercy
I'm unworthy of Your love
I'm running back to all I have in You
My gracious King

This is why I sing

The measure of your love
You came and died for us
Let us not forget
That's how you forgive

You lived a life that I could never live
You died the death that I fully deserve
You rose to life and now you live
You lived a life I could never live
You died the death, oh, that I deserve
You rose to life and now you live
That's how you forgive

You forgive
You forgive
You forgive---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
