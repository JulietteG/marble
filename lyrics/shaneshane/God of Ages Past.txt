If my hope is Christ alone
If where you are is where Im home
If knowing you is my delight
If in God alone Im satisfied

Then you wont you come and break this old heart of stone
Start a fire in these broken bones
Heres my soul it has been exposed to You
Oh God of ages past
Convince my heart at last
Come me of all I have in You

If my bread is your life laid down
If my cup, your blood poured out
If in your midst all joy is found
If where I walk, now holy ground

If You are the one who holds my future
If Your love is what Im searching for
If You are the one, if You are the treasure
If You are the Lord---
