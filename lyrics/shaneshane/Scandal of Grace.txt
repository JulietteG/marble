Grace, what have you done?
Murdered for me on that cross
Accused in absence of wrong
My sin washed away in your blood
Too much to make sense of it all
I know that your love breaks my fall

The scandal of grace
You died in my place
So my soul will live

Oh to be like you
Give all i have just to know you
Jesus, there's no one beside you
Forever the hope in my heart

Death, where is your sting?
Your power is as dead as my sin
The cross has taught me to live in mercy,
My heart now to sing
The day and its troubles shall come
I know that your strength is enough

The scandal of grace
You died in my place
So my soul will live

And it's all because of you, Jesus
It's all because of you, Jesus
It's all because of your love that my soul will live---
