You know by now...after all is said and done...You'll still be the only one
The years may come...the years may go...but my love remains the same....
After all is said and done ... through the heart aches and the fun
I wouldn't trade the times we've shared...my life's complete with you

(You're my inspiration) Your my fascination...Every little thing I need
and I'm so very thankful...to spend forever ....with you

And that's why...after all is said and done...there's just no com-par-i-son
That makes me feel the way I do every time I'm close to you
(You're my friend and lover) ...there could be no other
you bring me joy night and day
and when you really need me...Girl I'm just a heart beat away

Your my richest treasure...you give me so much pleasure
You know you're my number one....and you can always count on me
After all is said and done

(after all...after all) Oooowee baby..... after all is said and done

  >Lead<

Every time I'm close to you.....
(You're my inspiration) Your my fascination...Every little thing I need
and I'm so very thankful...to spend forever ....with you

Your my richest treasure...you give me so much pleasure
You know you're my number one....honey  you can always count on me
After all is said and done

(after all...after all) Oooowee baby..... after all is said and done---Lyrics submitted by Kris Brown.
