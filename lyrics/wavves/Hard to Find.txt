Don't be late, don't be late
It's hard to find
You're being, you're being
This hard to find

And I can't miss you when I know it weakens all my mind
Help me know the hours that I would have left behind

I see you dripping through the light
And everybody ...
I gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
I gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away

Don't be late, don't be late
It's hard to find
You're being, you're being
This hard to find

And I can't miss you when I know it weakens all my mind
Help me know the hours that I would have left behind

I see you dripping through the light
And everybody ...
I gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
I gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away
I see you dripping through the light
And everybody ...
I gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
I gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away---
