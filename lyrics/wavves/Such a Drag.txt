It seems like such a drag
Wait for the sign
In the back of my head
Notes over, notes over
Thunder ...
Won't breathe again
In the back of my head
Notes over, notes over

Walk straight into the sun
Counting steps as I run
Turn my head towards the light
And I walk straight into the sun

Running from the dead
Just breathe it in
In the back of my head
Notes over, notes over
Thunder ...
Just breathe it in
In the back of my head
Notes over, notes over

Walk straight into the sun
Counting steps as I run
Turn my head towards the light
Walk straight into the sun---
