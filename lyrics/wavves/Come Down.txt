You say it's nothing, you feel alright
There's something wrong creeping into your life
You cannot say it, you cannot fight
There's something wrong creeping into your life
The world around you is barely there
There's something wrong creeping into your life
You do not notice, you do not care
There's something wrong creeping into your life

Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down

Just to be something is hard enough
There's no defense, we're good enough
The world around you is barely there
There's something wrong creeping into your life
You do not notice, you do not care
There's something wrong creeping into your life

Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down
Sometimes you'll find
Nothing ever comes down, nothing ever comes down

There's something wrong creeping into your life
There's something wrong creeping into your life---
