I need your guarding hand to guide
me through this sand of time
Then I know I'll be alright
Like a child that never cries

I'm aware of all your rules
But you know that I will run
No matter where I'll follow you
Don't make me go

Take me, take me hold me in your arms
Save me, save me all I need is your love

Maybe you will leave the light on
While I walk into your dream
I can't remember where you came from
See they're breadcrumbs in the snow

I'm aware of your rules
But you know that I will run
No matter where I'll follow you
Don't make me go

Take me, take me hold me in your arms
Save me, save me all I need is your love
Take me, take me hold me in your arms
Save me, save me all I need is your love

Take me, take me hold me in your arms
Save me, save me all I need is your love
Wake me, wake me hold me in your arms
Don't break me, don't break me
I just need a place in your heart
Take me, take me hold me in your arms
Save me, save me all I need is your love

I need your guarding hand my bride
Till the end of my whole life---Lyrics submitted by Raph al Guul.
