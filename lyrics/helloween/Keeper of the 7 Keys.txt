PART 1

Make the people
Hold each others hands
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined

Put on your armor
Ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
Youre leaving the light
Make yourself ready
For the lords of the dark
Theyll watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and the hark

You hear them whispering
In the crowns of the trees
Youre whirling round
But your eyes don t agree
Will o the wisps
Misguiding your path
You cant throw a curse
Without taking their wrath

Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what weve been
Our only hopes your victory
Kill that Satan who wont let us be 
Our only hopes your victory
Kill that Satan who wont let us be - kill!

You re the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world were all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil paid with Lucifers gold
To the throne of the evil paid with Lucifers gold

You can feel cold sweat
Running down your neck
And the dwarfs of falseness
Throw mud at your back

Guided by spells
from the old seers hand
Youre suffering pain
Only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do whats divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

Youre the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world were all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil paid with Lucifers gold
To the throne of the evil paid with Lucifers gold

Throw the first key into the sea of hate
Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each others hands
The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance---Lyrics submitted by Santos.
