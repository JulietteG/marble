Touch, my heart.
Her beauty sways.
The gods;
A gift;
Of loving days.

I've lost you, my lovely
To the depths of an ocean.
My blind faith.
You follow me,
with your hope and devotion.

I sing to your freedom.
I've lost to release you.
No heaven waits for you, my sweet.
I'll follow your denies to hell, and beyond.

Given the chance to lead you home.
No looking back.
No way to know.
The light is ahead.
We're moving slow.
Approaching life,
Where you will be whole.

But I've lost you, my lovely
To the depths of an ocean.
My blind faith.
I follow you,
with my hope and devotion

I'll sing for your freedom.
I've lost to release you.
No heaven waits for us, my sweet.
I'll follow your denies to hell, and beyond.

We will meet again...
We will lie for a day...

Touch, my heart beats;
And beauty sways.
My life,
A song,
A longing daze.

I've found you, my lovely;
In the depths of an ocean.
A story,
Together,
Of hope and devotion.

I found you, my lovely;
In the depths of an ocean.
A story,
Forever,
Of hope and devotion.---Lyrics submitted by Brandy.
