I am the sun, I am the shooting star
I can feel its energy
I am the mouth that doesn't work at all
I can learn the human way
I held the card (of temperance), I felt the human flesh
I could feel its energy
I am the card I am the human flesh
In my life I've seen you fade

I found the pieces in my head
And now I feel the strangest way
And now I feel it in my head
And now I'm feeling everything

I will tell you everything
You'll never understand
I will tell you anything
She wants to be the man
I will tell you anything
How could I trust you now
I will tell you everything
You'll never know me well
You'll never know me well
You'll never know me well
You'll never know me well

(Verse not recorded in liner notes)
I am the sun, I am the shooting star
I can feel its energy
Sometimes my mouth just doesn't work at all
I can learn the human way
I held the card, I felt the human touch
I could feel its energy
I held the card, I am the human touch
It replays in front of you (It replaces part of you?)

I found the pieces in my head
And now I feel the strangest way
And now I feel it in my head
And now I'm feeling everything

I will tell you everything
You always understand
I have demons in my mind
You take me by the hand
I can feel the Virgo
And I can touch it now
I will tell you anything
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell
I'm underneath your spell---Lyrics submitted by AR.
