Far
Weve been travelling far
Without a home
But not without a star

Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream

On the boats and on the planes
Theyre coming to america
Never looking back again
Theyre coming to america

Home, dont it seem so far away
Oh, were travelling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and well say grace
Freedoms light burning warm
Freedoms light burning warm

Everywhere around the world
Theyre coming to america
Every time that flags unfurled
Theyre coming to america

Got a dream to take them there
Theyre coming to america
Got a dream theyve come to share
Theyre coming to america

Theyre coming to america
Theyre coming to america
Theyre coming to america
Theyre coming to america
Today, today, today, today, today

My country tis of thee
(today)
Sweet land of liberty
(today)
Of thee I sing
(today)
Of thee I sing
(today)---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
