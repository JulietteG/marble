Another sunny afternoon denies the worried look thats on my face.
Connected through the years, it somehow took us both in separate ways.
Was on a day that time forgotanother day that time forgot. Oh no, oh no.

Should have held you till the storm went by; we had nothing left to hang on to.
Too many words you said were not the words connecting me to you.
Just another day that time forgotanother day that time forgot. Oh no, oh no.

The two of us, we both just let it die. Didnt see it leave, didnt even try.
I only knew that we were moving on. Suddenly its gone, never knowing why. 
Oh no, oh no.

Dont have a reason I can give, at least not one that I can understand.
Just somehow disappeared it slipped beneath the fingers of my hand.
Was on a day that time forgotanother day that time forgot. Oh no, Oh no.

We had it once but we just let it fall. Should have held it close, could have had it all.
Im thinking about the life we could have made, lost the one we had somewhere along the way.

Oh no, oh no.

I woke up all alone again, a half remembered dream inside my head.
You took me through the day, followed me at night into my bed.
Was on a day that time forgotanother day that time forgot. Oh no, oh no.

Oh no, oh no. (Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Erik.
