Don't look down
Or you're gonna fall
Things are gonna get easier
Much too serious, lighten up
This climb ain't made to be pleasing you
Don't look down or contemplate
You're doin' fine, you're makin' it
Fix both your eyes and concentrate
Step at a time you're takin' it

Don't look down, just don't look down

Don't look down
Give a little more
Just forget how high you been
Every step becomes a floor
Every floor is a little thin
Don't look down or contemplate
You're doin' fine, you're makin' it
Fix both your eyes and concentrate
Step at a time you're takin' it

Don't look down, don't look down.

Don't look down
You're gettin' there
Straight ahead to the very top
Sunny skies and open air
Ain't no glory if you stop
Don't look down or contemplate
You're doin fine, you're makin' it
Fix both your eyes and concentrate
Step at a time you're takin' it

Don't look down, I'm sayin' don't look down

(Instrumental)

Don't look down
I'm beggin' now
Don't let your sense be leavin' you
Keep your mind on the straight ahead
Some other time you'll enjoy the view
Don't look down, don't look down.

Don't look down, don't look down

Don't look, don't look, don't look, 
don't look down

No, don't look down---Lyrics submitted by Debbie.
