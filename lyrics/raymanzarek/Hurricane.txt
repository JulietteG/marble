Lyrics: Jim Caroll
Music: Ray Manzarek

Would you watch me in the hurricane?
Would you shatter in the wind?
Would you sand bag all your destiny?
Would you set the pet bird free?

Would you stroke the eyelid of the storm
Shut down    Radar    Skim on Vice

Would you tape the Xs on the window
Let go    Dive slow    Lay with me?

East Coast, got a hurricane
West Coast, got the same
High high wind, and the heavy rain

People got X marked/on their window panes
Like Moses in Egypt and the blood stains
Like Moses and Pharoah and the bloodstains

Would you shrink in the hurricane?
Would you scream in its force?
Would the foam form a gyro?
Would you worry what be lost?

Would you cut the flower in the hurricane?
Burn stem/ drop hem/ choose your dress?

Would you strap the child to the swing?
Take aim    Feel tame    On the wing

Waitin for the eye of the hurricane
Looking for the eye of the hurricane---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
