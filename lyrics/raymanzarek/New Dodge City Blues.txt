Lyrics: Scott Richardson/ Dream Date Music
Music: Ray Manzarek / International Aten Music (ASCAP)

The wild wild west where the future was born
Is melting down around your ears
Multi-colored cultures giving birth to one tribe
Gonna rule when the smoke finally clears

All the drugs, guns, money and the mayhem
These politicians play for press
It's just more fucking fuel for the media burn
Time to take another acid test

So get ready for the last big showdown
Strap your mind to the mainframe, man
When these new Dodge City blues heat up
Everybody's gonna understand

The sirens are screaming down her freeway
Her television burst into flames
The good guys, bad guys and everyone else
Going to hell playing these greasy games

New Dodge City Blues nuclear info-news
New Dodge City Blues no surrender, no excuse
New Dodge City Blues they're shooting back at me and you
New Dodge City Blues better program in some truth

Well, I'm alive in overdrive, it's the stop, commercial media jive---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
