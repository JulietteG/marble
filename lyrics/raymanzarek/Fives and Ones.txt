Lyrics: Stephen Gordon / David Gionfriddo / Sterile Orphan Publishing
Music: Roy Rogers / Chops Not Chaps Music (BMI)

It's a world full of hunters and bait
It's a world full of mischief and hate
Everybody's got daggers and guns
And keep your pockets full of the fives and ones

People being bought and sold
There's a time to shout-a time to fold
A dead man argues-a wise man runs
Keep your pocket full of Fives and Ones

Pay the founding fathers and the setting sons
When it ail hits the fan- the transaction is done
Be sure your tank is full and your motor runs
And keep your pocket full of Fives and Ones

It's a world full of hunger and feasts
A funky zoo of soul-eating beasts
When feeding time beckons-the smart man runs
And settles his markers with Fives and Ones---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
