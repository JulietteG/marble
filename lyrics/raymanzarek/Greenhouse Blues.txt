Back home, down home - and got those tailgate blues
It's summertime-it's temperature and rapture too
When the kid's games are kicked - it ain't so cool to care
And the flowers get picked for none other than Smokey the Bear
We got ragtime music - we got the uptown tunes
We're out in the suburbs - and we got the greenhouse blues

Barrel over them bridges you wander - and you roam
Down arroyos and ridges - just tryin' to find the road back home
Now it's low ride time-we're payin the roadhouse dues
Back to downtown tunes - and singin' those dark-bar blues
We got ragtime music - we got the uptown tunes
We're back in the suburbs-and we got the greenhouse blues

Back home, down home - and got those tailgate blues
It's summertime - we got temperature and rapture too
Back to down-town tunes and singin those dark -bar blues
Cover record dues, race dues and tastin' the blues
We got ragtime music - we got the uptown tunes
We're back in the suburbs - and w6 got the Greenhouse Blues...---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
