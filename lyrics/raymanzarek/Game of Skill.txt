King Rock stood at the top of the world
With his silver spurs and his dirty girls
I don't care who I hurt or who I thrill
We all know it's just a game of skiII

The Queen of Id with Tier legions of men
Stepped right up and said to him
Do what you want fool, do what you will
We all know it's just a game of skill

King rocked round the Queen
The Queen got real mean
They caused a mighty scene
Now her dress is blood red
Where it once was green

Peter watched from the pearly gates
An act of love on the field of hate
The Devil watched from a far-off hill
Mesmerized by the game of skill

Peter got sick and had to leave
The devil fell down weak in his knees
Do what you want, do what you will
We all know it's just a game of skill

They played it mighty Hard...
They played it mighty Hard
Just wanna get some love in you
Just wanna get some love in you
We all know it's just a game of skill---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
