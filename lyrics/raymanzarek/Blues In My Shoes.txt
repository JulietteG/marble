Lyrics and Music: Roy Rogers / Chops Not Chaps Music (BMI)

I got the blues in my shoes
I can't go walkln'
I got the blues in my shoes
Over you...

You let me down so hard
I just crashed and I burned
From my head to my toes
Another love lesson learned
Since I heard the news
I can't stop thinkin
Since I been refused
I'm still here drinkin'

Like I'm in quicksand, baby
Sinkin' way down deep
Been lost in my mind
I can't even sleep
Ain't nothin to do
I cant help myself
Got the blues in my shoes
And I can't walk so well

I got the Blues ln My Shoes
I can't go walkin'
I got the Blues in My Shoes Over You---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
