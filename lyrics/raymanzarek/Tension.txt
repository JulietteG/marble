Music: Ray Manzarek / International Aten Music (ASCAP)

They give me their word, you know
It was like radio
You get no choices... you just hear their voices
They fill me with mild derision
Like not-having television
Empty voices.... broken choices

They give me two, not one
That's twice as much as Gods first son
But they forgot to mention....
Tension

They give me this money on loan
Then they feed till they're scraping bone
There are no choices...there are no choices
They offer me high black mass
It's like nitrous oxide gas
All these voices and never choices
They give me some agent's gun
They say do what you want to, son...

But they failed to mention
Tension  All that Tension

They melt down the golden calf
They play the gold on my phonograph
You get no choices  When you hear their voices
They talk about law and order
But they're all across the border
Just one more voice...another empty choice

They tell me how well I've done
If I lose then I'm sure they've won
And nobody mentioned
All this tension...---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
