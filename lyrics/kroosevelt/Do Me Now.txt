(feat. Hit Boy)

(Verse)
Fina grab you by your waist, take you for a ride
Kiss you from your neck to your thighs
Grab me with your legs looks me in the eyes
Wanna get your temperature rise

Put you on the table
Or the counter or the floor
Doesn't matter I just want you right now
Whisper in my ear girl, tell me how I turn you on
Tell me that you call me along

And try to kiss you on your neck
While I'm feeling on your booty
Ye we creaming before we even getting to it
It gets a little tighter all up in your mind
Got you going crazy and I know what's next
I know you can't fight it girl

(Pre-Chorus)
Doing what you doing like
Doing what you doing what you doing like
I love the way you do it what you doing like
Keep doing what you doing 'cause you do it right

(Chorus)
Baby I'm horny and I could give you all the things you like
So relax for me , I ain't gonna keep you waiting all night
I got you saying do me now , do me now
Uuuh don't stop
Just do me now, do me now

(Verse)
Said I love the way you touch me baby
You deserve a round of applause
Uh for just what you doing
Uhh I need to keep you around
So say you'll run for me yeah
Go ahead and kiss it , stroke it, bite it
It's a little way I write it
When I stroke it got it feeling like shit rolling
About the goodnight, you know you can't fight it girl

(Pre-Chorus)
Doing what you doing like
Doing what you doing what you doing like
I love the way you do it what you doing like
Keep doing what you doing 'cause you do it right

(Chorus)
Baby I'm horny and I could give you all the things you like
So relax for me , I ain't gonna keep you waiting all night
I got you saying do me now , do me now
Uuuh don't stop
Just do me now, do me now

I love the way you touch it baby (x4)

(Verse : Hit Boy)
Thank you, thank you
Baby I should thank you
Just for being you and how that ass looks from that angle
The body of a goddess and your face of an angel
I'm 'bout to go to church and praise the Lord just 'cause he made you
I see how you work it, take off your skirt quick
Take off your shirt now , busy down that burkin
I know them bitches hating you know how them birds get
But don't be worried about them other hoes flirting
You got my attention, you got my attention
And you bad as fuck girl I should lock you in detention
Wanna go off of the daughter give you pieces of my picture
Whatever it takes to get it I promise you gonna feel it

(Chorus)
Baby I'm horny and I could give you all the things you like
So relax for me , I ain't gonna keep you waiting all night
I got you saying do me now , do me now
 Uuuh don't stop---Lyrics submitted by Adrienah Rice.
