(Elphaba) 
I'm limited
Just look at me 
I'm limited 
And just look at you 
You can do all i couldn't do
Glinda

So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you
You where the only friend 
I've ever had 

(Glinda)
And I've had so many friends 
But only one that mattered

I've heard it said
That people come into our lives 
For a reason bringing something
We must learn and we are lead
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them and we help them in return
Well I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know i'm who I am today because I knew you

Like a commit pulled from orbit 
As it passes the sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better

Because I knew you 
I have been changed
For good

It well may be that we will never meet again
In this life time so let me say before we part 
So much of me is mad of what I learned from you
You'll be with me like a hand print on my heart 
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine by being my friend

Like a ship blown from its mooring 
By a wind off the sea 
Like a seed dropped by a sky bird
In a distant wood 
Who can say if I've been changed for the better 

Because I knew you I have been changed 
For good 

And just to clear the air I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done you blame me for

(Glinda) 
But then I guess we know there's blame to share

(Both) 
And none of it seems to matter anymore

(Glinda)                                             (Elphaba)
Like a commit pulled from orbit         Like a ship blown from it's mooring
As it passes the sun                         By a wind off the sea  
Like a stream that meets a boulder  Like a seed dropped by a bird 
Halfway through the wood                In the wood 

(Both)
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
I do believe I have been changed for the better

(Glinda)
And because I knew you

(Elphaba)
Because I knew you 

(Both)
Because I knew you
I have been changed
For good---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
