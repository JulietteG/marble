In my life, I never thought I'd get a second chance
I thought I was done 
Then I met you
And though, I never dreamed I could learn how to love again
I placed my bet
And you came through
I somehow still lost
I somehow always do
This time feels new

Thank you for finding me 
And thank you for the care
And fuck you for making me
Think that this life might be fair

You promised to love me
A promise you've kept
And I wont be sorry that
You said to leap and I leapt

I won't regret
What I did then 
Though it hurts more than I could imagine back when
All the same even so
I would love you all over again

Am I always starting over
In a brand new story
Am I always back at one
After all I've done
'Cause I've burned all of my bridges
And learned every last lesson too
So how can I start new?

I'll love our children
Both fiercely and well
When they ask about you 
Oh lordy the stories I'll tell

No, I can't just crumble 
And I won't regret the lives I didn't lead
I knew you, I loved you 
let that me all that I need.

Say that its fate 
Say its foretold 
I'm through with fighting 
And i'm much too old 
What the gods have to give 
I'll take and I'll live anymore

If we're always starting over 
Every brand new morning
Then we're always starting out
With the end in doubt
We can leave life for tomorrow 
or grieve all that we thought we do
or make each moment new 


All that has happened is happening now
All that might happen is here some how
All of the choices that made me me
All of the accidents yet to be

All that's ahead 
And all that's behind
It's all in the moment 
I've made up my mind
And know in my heart
And start
And I'll start

Cause we're always starting over
Every life we're living
Yes, we're always just awake
Every step we take
And my love, our life is over
But love, I'll make you one last vow
To start over 
And over 
And over
Somehow
My new life starts right now---Lyrics submitted by Jacob Ritts.
