Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing, sing Halleluiah
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is
Christ our savior is
Christ our savior is born

Silent night (Silent night)
Silent night
Silent night
Silent night
And praise the Lord
Silent night---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
