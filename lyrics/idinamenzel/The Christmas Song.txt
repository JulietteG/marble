Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way (On his way)
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh (Goodies on his sleigh)
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you, oh

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (On an open fire)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (Oh your nose)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir, ooh

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you, ooh
Woah, hm---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
