When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through

When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
