Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Let your heart be light,
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight, hm.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow,
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough,
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now

Have yourself a merry little Christmas (Merry little Christmas)
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away (Miles away), away

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow, oh
Hang a shining star
Up on the highest bough (bough)

And have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
