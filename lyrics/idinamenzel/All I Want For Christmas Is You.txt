I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas baby is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you yeah
You
Is you woo
All I want for Christmas is you (All I want for Christmas is you)
All I want for Christmas is you (All I want for Christmas is you)
Give me more
All I want for Christmas is you
Give me two now
All I want for Christmas is you
I sing all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you
I don't need nobody more than you
I don't need nobody else but you
I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody)
I don't need nobody, but you (I don't need nobody)
All I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
