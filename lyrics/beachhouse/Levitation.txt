You and me with our long hair on the gold one
After midnight we could feel it all
I go anywhere you want to

You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
Cause you blow my mind

On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
There is no right time
There is no right time

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get through it

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now

There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you---
