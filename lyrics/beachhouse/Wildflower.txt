No better color
Look everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side

You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of every light
It turns you on every night

Need a companion
My head in prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
Whats left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours

No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
Whats left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
