Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that's in your mouth

Beyond love
I wanted to find ever since I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands

Beyond love
This thing comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
Our nerves would've seen
No change in his
Vision sprung into dreams
Of a world left without it

I really wanna know
I really do breathe
We really do breathe
We really wanna know

The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there, net up in the corner with the spiders made of night
We really wanna know
Beyond love
Our nerves would've seen
And I can't live without it
Could you ever believe
Beyond love?

I really wanna know
I really wanna know---
