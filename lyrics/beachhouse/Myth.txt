Drifting in and out
See the road you're on
You came rolling down the cheek
Say just what you need
And in between it's never as it seems

Help me to make it
Help me to make it

If you'd build yourself a myth
You'd now just what to give
What comes after this
Momentary bliss
Consequence of what you do to me

Help me to make it
Help me to make it

Found yourself in a new direction
Aeons far from the sun
Can you come when they come to greet you
Let you know you're not the only one

Can't keep hanging on
To all that's dead and gone
If you build yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
Do you lie?
Oh let the ashes fly

Help me to make it
Help me to make it---
