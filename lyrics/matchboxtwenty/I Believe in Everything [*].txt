Verse 1:
I want to make you sing, darlin'
I want to make you run
I want to sew on wings, darlin'
And fly right over the sun

Verse 2:
There's a bustle in the wind, darlin'
There's a bustle in the road
I want to tell you what I see, darlin'
When I look over to you

Chorus:
See I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

No more

Verse 3:
Some people want to bring the change, darlin'
Some people want to be the one
I only want to see your face smilin'
When all our livin' is done

Bridge 1:
Well everyone around us feel their heart is stomping
Crowding up the air with words they cannot know
They hate this world they'll hate this song, ya
So I won't ever belong
No I won't ever belong

Chorus:
Still I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

Bridge 2:
Is every conversation
Gonna make you smile and hold your heart
We'll take this life and make it dark
Because it's hard enough to be the way you are

Chorus:
See I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

Chorus:
Well I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

No more, no more ---
