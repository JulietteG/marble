Im caught up in the push and shove
The daily grind, burning time, spinning wheels;
I wonder what Im doing here
Day to day, year to year, standing still.

Somewhere theres a teacher with a heart never quits
Staying after school to help some inner-city kids,
A mother whos a volunteer, a Soldier in the fight,
And I cant help but ask myself when I lay down at night.

[CHORUS:]
Did I make a difference in somebodys life?
What hurts did I heal?
What wrongs did I right?
Did I raise my voice in defense of the truth?
Did I lend my hand to the destitute?
When my race is run, when my song is sung,
Will I have to wonder
Did I make a difference?
Did I make a difference?

Ive been working hard to make a living
And forgetting what true living is.
Taking more than giving; somethings missing.
Lord how long can I go on like this?

Theres a lonely old man down the street and I should be ashamed,
Ive never been to see him; I dont even know his name.
Theres kids without their supper in my own neighbourhood.
Will I look back someday and say that I did all I could?

[CHORUS]

When my race is run, when my song is sung,
Will I have to wonder
Did I make a difference?
Did I make a difference?
Did I make a difference? ---Lyrics submitted by Sue Dalmann.
