Run, run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the ginger bread man
 You can look, look as hard as you can you can't see me I'm the ginger bread man
 Or the family of man but never mind me I'm just a ginger bread man

 (The weaver :) only hours away could be a man with a million dollars
 Only minutes away could be a guy with a gun
 Only seconds away could be a love that will last forever
 but if it gets away there might not ever be one

 (The dying oilman :) I could be good maybe I'm crazy
 I could be good  maybe I'm mad
 I could be good don't get in my way
 because I could be good but I'm bad 

(The sold out artist :) out in the streets
 And under the sun
 I kissed his feet
 And loaded his gun
 Sooner or later
 Everyone does 
Everybody feeds the fat boy 
Everybody feeds the fat boy 

(The aging musician :) once upon a time I played electric guitar 
And they said I was a rock & roll star
 Now no body calls me on the telephone
 So I sit and watch my tv all alone
 Maybe if I put a bullet in my brain
 Theyd remember me like Kurt Cobain
 And the parasites on MTV
 Would wipe their eyes and act like they knew me
 But I wouldn't be a hero I'd be dead
 Just a corpse beside a note that read
 if you like to pretend that you'll never get old
 You got what it takes to rock n' roll

 (The old woman :) angel answer my prayers
 Answer my prayers tonight 
Tell me if anyone cares 
If I do what I might
 Angel answer my prayers 
And tell me if any one else
 Knows how much I am scared
 That I might murder myself---Lyrics submitted by Tarek.
