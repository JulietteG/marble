When a cold chill begins to burn at your very soul
That's the sweet touch of Love
When just the drop of a name begins to sting your very toe
That's the sweet touch of Love
Just the thought about seeing you would blow my mind
That's the sweet touch of Love
I was about to give up but you came just in time
With your sweet touch of Love

You brought out the best in me,
Made me leave the rest of me behind
Oh yes you did
You delivered me from lonelyness
And onlyness ooh yes
And Oh little girl I want...

One little kiss to let me know girl
That I couldn't live without your love, you know its true
I 've found the joy that I had been missing for so long
It was the sweet touch of Love

When a cold chill begins to thrill your very soul
That's the sweet touch of Love
When just the drop of a name begins to sting your very toe
That's the sweet touch of Love

You know that there's nothing that's sweeter than you
I got to have you early in the morning
And when the icy wind a-blow from the north
I don't need no clothes I don't need no coat

I got you in the morning
I got you late in the afternoon
I got you late in the evening too
I got you

When ever my love come's tumbling down
And you know you got to be there
You can use the rest of this world of mine
And you know you got to be there
When my love come's tumbling down
And you know you got to be there
When my love come's tumbling down
And you know you got to be there---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
