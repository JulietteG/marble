Now is the time

Now is the time for all good men
To get together with one another
Iron out the problems
And iron out the quarrels
And try to live as brothers
And try to find a piece within
Without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world
Just remember we all had mothers
Make this land a better land
In the world in which we live
And help each man be a better man
With the kindness that you give

I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we
If we wanna it yes we can can
I know we can make it work
I know we can make it if we try
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, great, gosh almighty
Yes we can, I know we can can

Take care of the children
The children of the world
They're our strongest hope for the future
The little bitty boys and girls

And make this land a better land
In the world in which we live
And help each man be a better man
With the kindness that you give
And I know we can make it (I know that we can)
I know darn well we can work it out
Yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we
If we wanna it yes we can can
I know we can make it work
I know we can make it if we try
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, great, gosh almighty
Yes we can, I know we can can

Take care of the children
The children of the world
They're our strongest hope for the future
The little bitty boys and girls

Make this land a better land
In the world in which we live
And help each man be a better man
With the kindness that you give
And I know we can make it (I know that we can)
I know darn well we can work it out
Yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we
If we wanna it yes we can can
I know we can make it work
I know we can make it if we try
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, great, gosh almighty
Yes we can, I know we can can---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
