Though you can give no more inspiring false security
I've got the reason to alter belief
Selfish paintings diamonds mutilate
You can't erase the way I'm unappreciated

But I can't sleep tonight
Embrace of the drink
Be hollow, swallow the pain
Splitting the fields
All the noise agitates

The stars have not aligned in your favor
Cross the line of obscenity

Ignoring the signs
The smoke in your eyes
Carelessly

Look to find a way, to love all the past promises, to keep you washed away.

Sever the ties
Broken by the black and white
Now fade away

The stars have not aligned in your favor
Cross the line of obscenity

Ignoring the signs
The smoke in your eyes
Carelessly

Look to find a way, to love all the past promises, to keep you washed away.

Laid in the ground
Were lost far beyond the clouds
Staring in the darks of hell, it's me.

Along the edge of belief
A heart always in the stars will never fade

Decay in the ground
Were lost far beyond the clouds
Pray in the dark for now
Prey on the sounds
And silence the darks around
Reach for a spark of doubt alive---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
