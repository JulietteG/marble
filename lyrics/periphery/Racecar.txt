Freedom beyond or control
Partition, they break out in endless stride
I'm on the floor in travail
Faithful days fall
Memories hold
Free my soul

Seeking within
The curtain call
Fleeing our fate
Every step now recalled
Down the drive
Staying so close
Retraction weighs my soul

We are thunder
We are all the space in tow
Now again
This happening

My handle is honest calculation
Free of the pain
Seeking the glow
We both need it so

Time will give way
Time will formulate

Seeking within
The curtain call
Fleeing our fate
Every step evolved
Don't deny
Staying so close
Creation is our goal

Discretion, the only thing that made me incomplete
Cast the sail, just to spin this fate

Cross the empty sect in flight
Pleasant memories
Redefine all that's left
The sound it makes me scream

I can hear your voice at night
(Your light lost in a waking dream within)

Freedom is not of control
Endless the chase, pushing through
I'm so engulfed
Falling to strain, but I still persist

I'd like to paint this tapestry
With our blood
To represent the symmetry
Finding a sickened result of possibility
Refuse the violent source and pain that made you
Left to deny that it will change with no solitude

Let us take this train
Leaving the form, stretching far beyond what I can see
Chasing the race
Left to complete

My revelation
Reaction creates the fall
Realize
These are broken words

Shattered thoughts amend
See beyond the only present road
Just let go

Counsel to ascend
See beyond the only present hold
Let go
Cannot comprehend
Leave it all to find a moment's love
I am

Working to be
Complete
No more adversity
Growing consciously

My revelation
Reaction is not the call
Rely
On my new self

Rising on my own
Sage advice, embrace wisdom
Hang the past
Take the helm
Fashion a new future to live

In your flame
I see regret

I've awakened
To feel a piece of distant harmony
How could I not see
Possibilities and unlimited passion
Hello luminescent being
Walking outside of my last identity
Celebrate
For in the end
We'll meet inequality

I see light
I see light in your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
