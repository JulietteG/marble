I see a flash
Is this sleep?
Am I in a dream?
The past sees me and it won't let go
Greeted by those I've killed along the way, because I am the destruction
The past sees me and it won't let go

A demon born out of their rite in throes
This is the truth
I am a demon born out of their rite in throes
Soiled by the world of man
I am the destruction
I am fear
I am sin
I am the destruction

This memory ignites
The past sees me
Visions of me grow
Greeted by family
Painting dissolution and a life of an insect
The past it will not let me go
I'm lost within my own soul
A ghost within times of old
The clock turns back but is this real?
Tell me, is this real?
A demon born out of their rite in throes
This is the truth
I am a demon born out of their rite in throes
Soiled by the world of man
I am the destruction
I am fear
Born to destroy
Transcending boundaries of affliction
I've learned from past experience I am a monster
Disgust and horror flash before me in fire burning down below
Holy desire
This stain will never wash off of my grave
Physical life has wandered
Here I stay, in death
Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection
Grant forgiveness
This is only but a dark reflection
Regret is ripping the throat from my neck
Now I can't speak
I wander
Here in death, I weep

Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection
Grant forgiveness
This is only but a dark reflection

Hell bound
Past death
Nothing can save me
Longing for something beyond
Embrace the feeling of a soul within
Realizing this is what we need
Inside the circle that's a mystery to our eyes and what we shall perceive
Stop bleeding on the inside
We are alive, and it's more that enough to paint the walls that are white
Can we show the ones who are blind?
Show them that we're not blind---
