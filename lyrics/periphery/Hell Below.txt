Further I'm hurled down
The colors shift from red to gray
This is a realm of damaged spirits and I can't see the light
Only the gaze of his eyes

The demons drag me down
Clawing for the heavens, they pull
I can feel them violently consuming me
No body, no mind, a spirit left to die
Finally they've collected me
The sound of misery in death has now begun
This is over my death has now begun
Live, die, burn
Fucking live, die, burn

Further I'm hurled down
The colors shift from red to gray
This is a realm of damaged spirits and I can't see the light
Only the gaze of his eyes---
