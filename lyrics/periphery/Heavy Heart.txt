Experience these things.
My chest sinks further in and it gets hard to breathe.
Don't fight it, make this easy.

Sometimes I wish I had wings.
Fly far away from this life.
It's a long road.

As the water beads up on the window, turn the sand song up on the radio.

Such curiosity.
These thoughts go on all day.
It takes hold on me, but fighting isn't easy.

Sometimes I wish I had wings.
Fly far away from this life.
It's a long road.

As the water beads up on the window, turn the sad song up on the radio.
Will the voices haunt when the flesh moves on and the clouds block out the rays?
When the feeling hangs upon a halo, I can only try my best just to let it go.
What's left with me is a memory and the things I have to say.

Resting now, their bodies hit the ground.
Children scream, their mothers bleed hung upside down.
Scarlet robes and sadistic minds surround me.
I've spent all of my life confined in secrecy.
What you see is but a shell of what I am on the inside.

Clouds of blackness strike lightning.
There's nothing above.
I'm falling below.

As the water beads up on the window, turn the sad song up on the radio.
Will the voices haunt when the flesh moves on and the clouds block out the rays?
When the feeling hangs upon a halo, I can only try my best just to let it go.
What's left with me is a memory and the things I have to say.---
