Sometimes there's a crack in the world that I can peer through
And see it for what it really is
Theres an ugly face staring back at demons of everyone
They draw the hatred from inside of me
There were times at the top of the Earth that I wish that I could throw
Everyone and everything
Watch surrounding symphonies of the hypocrites
Abating in the thought of it

Severed dreams of all the weak - quenching thirst inside of me
And the scream it holds the key - unlocking this for all to see

Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe
Far from the leaves, transcend these earthly boundaries
Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe
Far from the leaves, transcend the fucking boundaries

And is it this desire that you're looking for?
Or is insanity is knocking at your door?
And give me just a peace and surely you will find
Everything is better on the other side
But can you look within and find what is in store?
This life is but a scream that has become your whore
It's tearing a hole inside, you'll bury your life

Sometimes there's a hole in the Earth that I can slip through
To get away from the twisting of tongues
There was a love I could greet without tearing up
Feel the desire creeping over me
There were times at the top of the Earth that I wish that I could throw
Everyone and everything
Watch surrounding symphonies of the hypocrites
Abating in the sight of it

Id like a reason just to help them bleed
Give me a reason, come on give it to me
Give me a reason, fucking give me a reason
Ah-Ah give me a reason, come on give it to me

Fly past the trees
Far from the leaves
Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe
Far from the leaves, transcend the earthly boundaries

And is it this desire that you're looking for?
Or is insanity just knocking at your door?
And give me just some peace and surely you will find
Everything is better on the other side
But can you look within and find what is in store?
This life is but a scream that has become your whore
It's tearing a hole inside, you'll bury your life

Yeah, theres a crack in the Earth, theres a crack in the Earth, yeah
Id like a reason just to help them bleed
Give me a reason, come on give it to me---
