Great, another broken surrender and so long
Another slow arriving train has let me down
Led me on
The light comes slow, so one of us may rise and grow
No undertow to think about
I know that some of us may find that road... A way alone

Say you like your lot, we love you when it rains
Like a lot of voices loud they get you down
They lie and they bore us
They won't let us go or let us in

And then it ends, same as always
With lions in my bed, and riots in my head
I surround it like a lover
Break your heart and bless them souls...
Cause we got the love that loves you more

Hey, the swollen sunrise is lovely, almost done
A lake's hold, the mountainside fire wine county life
So like a home
The light has shown, the one of us will come to know... They're not alone

Hey, it's not enough to wait for better days
Not enough, the love and drugs are what I blame
Defined and divorced it
Your summer wind blows it...Yet again

Go hard, go heavy and no less allowed
I give you my breath and know
I give you my every hope
So don't let me down

I Mother Earth is BACK!---
