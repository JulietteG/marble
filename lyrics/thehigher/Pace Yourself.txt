You can't write the same song over again
It's in the same key
Over again, yeah

Because were doing so good
Making up for miles
Just a little while like you would
Underestimating
You know you think were doing so good
I'm glad to be apart of 
The glass that you placed 
Upon you with her heart and gazed and left for danger
In a race to the road
On the way to apathy
It's life's little let down
Spontaneity

You can't write the same song over again
It's in the same key 
Over again, yeah

Because were doing so good
Making up for miles
Just a little while like you would
Underestimating
You know you think were doing so good
I'm glad to be apart of 
The glass that you placed 
Upon you with her heart and gazed and left for danger, danger
In a race to the road 
On the way to apathy
It's life's little let down
Spontaneity, spontaneity yeah

You can't write the same song over again
It's in the same key
Over again, yeah

Because were doing so good
Making up for miles 
Just a little while like you would
Underestimating
You know you think were doing so good
I'm glad to be apart of 
The glass that you placed
Upon you with her heart and gazed and left for danger

It's life's little let down s
It's life's little let down s
Spontaneity, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Ruby.
