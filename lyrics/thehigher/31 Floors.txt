Step back
We all need a little bit of space
And really can you trust that and leave it up to me in any other way
Oh, we fell exhaled and now we'll watch the sunrise
If it's right this control is golden like the sunlight
Make your move

She fell from the 31st floor and wanting more, oh no one saw her move
Isn't that a great surprise? And doesn't that make you
You know you're just so sure of wanting more, but nobody has a clue
You party with a secret smile, doesn't that give you
This taste is bitter except when you're finished all done and lying in bed
This isn't too selfish, right?

This isn't right

Step back
We all need a little bit of space
And really can you trust that and leave it up to me in any other, in any other way

She fell from the 31st floor and wanting more, oh no one saw her move
Isn't that a great surprise? And doesn't that make you
You know you're just so sure of wanting more, but nobody has a clue
You party with a secret smile, doesn't that give you
This taste is bitter except when you're finished all done and lying in bed
This isn't too selfish, right?

Make your move
Make your move
Make your move, whoa
Make your move

She fell from the 31st floor and wanting more, oh no one saw her move
Isn't that a great surprise? And doesn't that make you
You know you're just so sure of wanting more, but nobody has a clue
You party with a secret smile, doesn't that give you
This taste is bitter except when you're finished all done and lying in bed
This isn't too selfish, right? 

Make your move, whoa---Lyrics submitted by charlene.
