The state of the nation - violation!
A broken promise is as good as a lie.
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
and we will burn because we won't unite!

What are we conceding for freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em
I would rather fight,
than let another die.
We're the problem,
but we're also the solution.
ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

If you want come and take it from me.
If you think you can, you still don't know me.
Let me tell you man, I said it, I meant it
and I will always have the right to defend it.

Fifty seconds, a hundred murders.
The bill of rights is a bill of sale.
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails!?

We have made the present absolute.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!

We've seen the fall of the elite,
Bury your life, take your disease,
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!

The wretched are the wounded,
The hungry starved to death,
In a place where no one goes,
The air itself is a final breath,
So discontinue, the anti-septic, care charade,
As a cry of justice comes,
A malignant fire fades.

I am the reason your future suffers,
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation,
I am the remedy, spit in my face.
All your laws and rules are outdated,
All your subjects are doing the kings,
I can rattle off a million other reasons why,
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

We have made the present absolute.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!

We've seen the fall of the elite,
Bury your life, take your disease,
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!
WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!
