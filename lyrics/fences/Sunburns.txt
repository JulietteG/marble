I had a dream I met a girl  
With brunette curls and nature faults  
She didn't seem to care (not) all like me  
Like holding hands and falling backwards on your knees  

And man I loved her like it hurt  
When being buried I'd prefer she be the dirt  
She didn't seem to care (not) all like me  

Baby its coming out
It burns our bodies burns our
The sun is coming out
It burns our bodies burns our

Falling backwards  
Falling backwards  
Falling backwards  
Falling backwards  

Like burning bottles, burning props
I learned to love her and accept her flaws
She didn't seem to care (not) all like me
Like holding hands and jumping fearless in the stream

The day she taught me how to run
to hold my breath and give my body to the sun
She didn't seem to care (not) all, so what

All the lights, all around  
All the lights, all around  
All the lights, all around  
All the lights, all around  

You know I'd love you till it hurts 
(all the lights, all around)---
