Well, this life can be such a devil
So I wrote the songs about angels
I took my coat, I went to the city
I drank and I dropped and isn't it pretty
For you, I would do anything
For you, I would do anything

I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it
I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it

Well, this life can be such a devil
So I wrote the songs about angels
A nightmare stuck in the catcher
I'm weaving ,
So I sat in the car and dreamed about dreaming
For you, I would do anything

For you, I would do anything

I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it
I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it

Chalk it up to bad luck
Just chalk it up to the lightness,
I think that DEATH is coming around
I think that DEATH is coming around

I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it
I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it

I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it
I think that death is coming around
I like it, I like it

Chalk it up to bad luck
Just chalk it up to the lightness
Chalk it up to bad luck
Just chalk it up to the lightness---
