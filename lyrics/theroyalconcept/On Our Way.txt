I'll believe when the walls stop turning 
I'll believe when the storm is through 
I believe I hear them say 
David won't stop writing songs 
I never wanna shake their hands and stay 
I never wanna shake their hands and stay 
Oh no let's go 

We are young, we are one 
Let us shine for what it's worth 
To your place, place, place 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way somehow 
Hold me close, close, close 
We're losing time, time, time 
We're losing time, time, time 
We're falling to the ground 

I'll believe when the sky is burning 
I'll believe when I see the view 
I believe that I say 
David won't stop dreaming now 
And everybody clap your hands and shout 
And everybody clap your hands and shout 

We are young, we are one 
Let us shine for what it's worth 
To your place, place, place 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way somehow 
Hold me close, close, close 
We're losing time, time, time 
We're losing time, time, time 
We're falling to the ground 

We are young, we are one 
Let us shine for what it's worth 
To your place, place, place 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way, way, way 
Hold me close 
We're losing time 
Hold me close 
We're falling to the ground 

Taxi drive the sun is rising 
Damn the sirens, keep ond driving 
Flashing light, oh what a night 
I miss her bed, I lost my head 
And it's sunning, we're still runing 
For her rooftop, our last stop 
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go 

To your place, place, place 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way somehow 
Hold me close, close, close 
We're losing time, time, time 
We're losing time, time, time 
We're falling to the ground 

We are young, we are one 
Let us shine for what it's worth 
To your place, place, place 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way
