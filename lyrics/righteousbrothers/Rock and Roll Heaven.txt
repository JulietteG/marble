If you believe in forever 
Than life is just a one night stand
If theres a Rock and Roll Heaven
Well you know they got a hell of a band (band, band)

Jimmy gave us Rainbows
And Janice took a Piece of our Heart
And Otis brought us all to the Dock of the Bay

Sing a song to Light My Fire
Remember Jim that way
They only found another place, another place to play

Chorus

Remember Bad, Bad Leroy Brown
Hey Jimmy touched us with that song
And time wont change a thing we came to know

And Bobby gave us Mack the Knife
Look out hes back in town
Theyll all be there together when they meet in one big show

Chorus

Theres a spotlight waiting 
No matter who you are

Cause everybodys got a song to sing
Every ones a star! (Everybodys got to be a star)

Chorus
