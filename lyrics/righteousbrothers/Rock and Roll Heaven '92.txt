If you believe in forever, then life is just a one-night stand,
If there's a rock and roll heaven, well you know they got a hell of a band, band, band

Elvis loved us tender, John cried "Give Peace a Chance", 
And Roy introduced us to his Pretty Woman
Jackie took us higher, Ricky walked us down to Lonesome Town, 
Heavens ring, the angels sing, 
When they all start to gather round

If you believe in forever, then life is just a one-night stand,
If there's a rock and roll heaven, well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band

Dennis gave us good vibrations, Marvin sang brother, brother, 
And Sam said what a wonderful world this could be,
And Mama sang Monday, Monday; Stevie Ray Vaughan was on his way,
Heavens smile when once in a while, 
They all gather round to play

If you believe in forever, then life is just a one-night stand,
If there's a rock and roll heaven, well you know they got a hell of a band, band band

There's a spotlight waiting, no matter who you are,
Everybody's got a song to sing, 
Everyone's a star, 
Yes you are

If you believe in forever, then life is just a one-night stand,
If there's a rock and roll heaven, well you know they got a hell of a band

If you believe in forever, then life is just a one-night stand,
If there's a rock and roll heaven, well you know they got a hell of a band
