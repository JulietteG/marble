Come down,
come to the ocean with me
in the,
in the dark

We could,
we could watch the white caps
crashing into the cliffs

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
saw ourselves as sons and as daughters

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters


Oceans
Calm and still as glass
In our,
Our little bay

We climbed down,
Down to the tide pool
And we discovered a different world


Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters


So let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor

Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor

Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor

Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor


Come down,
come to the ocean with me
in the,
in the dark

We could,
we could watch the white caps
crashing into the cliffs


Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters

Runnin' 'round in the black of the water
Saw ourselves as sons and as daughters


Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor

Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor

Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor

Let's go singin' down,
Down to the old harbor---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
