Gentle Shepherd come and feed us
for we need you to help us find our way
Gentle Shepherd come and feed us
for we need your strengh from day to day

There's no other we can turn to
who can help us face another day

Gentle Shepherd come and feed us 
for we need to you to help us find our way

Narrative

There's no other we can turn to
who can help us face another day

Gentle Shepherd come and feed us 
for we need to you to help us find our way---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
