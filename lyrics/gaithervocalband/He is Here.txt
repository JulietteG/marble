I sense an awesome moving of the Holy Spirit
And I see His countenance resting on your face
I know that there are angels hovering all around us
For the presence of the Lord is in this place

Chorus
He is here, Hallelujah!
He is here, Amen!
He is here, Holy, Holy
I will bless His name again
He is here, Listen closely
Hear Him calling out your name
He is here, you can touch Him
You will never be the same


I searched for peace among the shadows, dark and lonely
Gave up on finding that strong and lasting love
I tasted all the things that sin could fear to offer me
But today I feast on manna from above---Lyrics submitted by Olanrewaju.
