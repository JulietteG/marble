They rush on the city, they run on the wall
Great is the army that carries out His word!
   They rush on the city, they run on the wall
   Great is the army that carries out His word!

The Lord utters His voice before His army...
   The Lord utters His voice before His army!

They rush on the city, they run on the wall
Great is the army that carries out His word!
   They rush on the city, they run on the wall
   Great is the army that carries out His word!

The Lord utters His voice before His army...
   The Lord utters His voice before His army!

Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion
   sound the alarm in My Holy mountain...
Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion
   sound the alarm!

Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion
   sound the alarm in my Holy mountain...
Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion
   sound the alarm!

Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion
   sound the alarm in my Holy mountain...
Blow the trumpet in Zion, Zion
   sound the alarm! ... sound the alarm! ... sound the alarm!---Lyrics submitted by Kathryn.
