Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When the angels brought the news of the precious little boy
Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When that news brought joy sweet joy.

Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When the angels brought the news of that precious little boy
Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When that news brought joy sweet joy.

The shepherds watched their flocks by night, nearly fell asleep.
Another lonely quiet night, of watchin all those sheep.
Until a choir of holy angels pierced the night with songs of joy!
Good news I bring For Christ the King, is Marys baby boy!

Mary Was the First One To Carry The Gospel
When the angels brought the news of that precious little boy
Mary Was the First One To Carry The Gospel
When that news brought joy sweet joy.

Hosannah to the highest and Christ his only son.
Gods story wrapped in Swadling clothes. 
The Meek and holy one!
This baby boy will change the hearts of all who can believe.
What the prophets told, has come to pass.
A virgin has conceived!

Mary Was the First One To Carry The Gospel
When the angels brought the news of that precious little boy
Mary Was the First One To Carry The Gospel
When that news brought joy sweet joy.---Lyrics submitted by John.
