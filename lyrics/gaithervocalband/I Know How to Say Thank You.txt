I don't know about the future
I don't understand some things about the past
I don't know why some things happen
I don't know why some things end and others last

I don't know the rhymes and reasons,
I don't understand the words some people pray
When I see your hand of mercy Lord
Protect me from the dangers in my way

I know how to say thank you
I know a blessing when I see one
I'm a recipient of grace, 
through the hours and the days
I know how to say thank you
thank you

There were times today, when angels stood around me
and I couldn't even see
There were times when I was hurting,
and then you stepped in and took the pain for me.

There were moments when you stopped me
So that I could smell the roses by the road
And though I'm not the wisest person,
there are some things without doubt I know

I know how to say thank you
I know a blessing when I see one
I'm a recipient of grace, 
through the hours and the days
I know how to say thank you

I know a blessing when I see one
I'm a recipient of grace, 
through the hours and the days
I know how to say thank you

thank you 
oh - thank you
...I know how to say thank you!---Lyrics submitted by Richard A. Sanders.
