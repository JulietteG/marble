When I saw what lay before me, 
"Lord," I cried, "What will You do?"
I though He would just remove it,
But He gently led me through;

'Cuase without fire there's no refining,
Without pain no relief.
Without flood there's no rescue,
Without testing no belief. 

Through the fire, through the blood,
Through the water, through the flood,
Though the dry and baren places,
Through life's dence and maddening mazes.
Through the pain and through the glory,
We will always tell the story 
Of our God, Whose power and mercy 
Will not fail, to take us through.---Lyrics submitted by R.
