Give Up, let Jesus take over
Oh, give up, let Jesus, take over
Oh give up, let Jesus, take over (oh yes)
And He'll make a way for you

Well, if ya got mountains that you can't climb
Oh, and if ya got rivers that you can't cross
Oh and if ya got valleys that you can't span
Let Jesus, let Jesus take hold of your hand

And if ya got burdens too hard to bare
Oh, and if ya got a load thats more than you'll share
Kneel down and talk to Jesus, 'cuz I know that He cares
And He'll make a way somehow

Give up, and let Jesus take over
Oh, give up, let Jesus, take over
Oh, give up, let Jesus take over
And He'll make a way
And He'll make a way
And He'll make a way for you---Lyrics submitted by Darin.
