I dreamed of a city called Glory
So bright and so fair
When i entered the gates I cried Holy 
the angels all met me there
They carries me from mansion to mansion
and oh the sights I saw
then I said Take me to Jesus
He's the one who died for us all

I bowed on my knees and cried holy,holy,holy
I clapped my hands and sang glory,
Glory to the son of God

As I entered the gates of that city
Oh my loved ones all knew me well
They took me down the streets of heaven
Oh the scenes were too many to tell
I saw Abraham,Jacob and Isaac
O looked and there was Timothy
Oh but I said,Timothy,I want to see Jesus
Cause he's the one who ded for me and he died for you

I bowed on my knees and cried holy,holy,holy
I clapped my hands and sang glory,glory,glory,glory
I clapped my hands and sang glory
I clapped my hands and sang glory
I sang glory to the son of God.---Lyrics submitted by Linda.
