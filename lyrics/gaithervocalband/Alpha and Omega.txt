Alpha and Omega
by: Gaither Vocal Band

I heard a great voice how the heaven say
Behold the tabernacle of God is with men
He shall dwell with in them they shall be his people
And Almighty God will be with them
Oooohhh
He shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
There shall be no more death
Neither sorrow, nor crying and no more pain
The former thing are all passed away.

He that sat upon the throne said behold
I make all things new
He said unto me write this word
For they are faithful and true

And its done.. it is done
It is done.it is done..

He is the alpha and Omega the beginning and the end
The son of God, King of  kings, Lord of lords Hes 
Everything
Messiah, Jehovah the Prince of peace is He
The son of man, Seed of Abraham, second person 
In the trinity..

He is the alpha and Omega the beginning and the end
The son of God, King of  kings, Lord of lords Hes 
Everything
Messiah, Jehovah the Prince of peace is He
The son of man, Seed of Abraham, second person 
In the trinity..---Lyrics submitted by Rodante.
