Carpe Diem
Carpe Diem
This moment in its glory
And its pain
Is a heartbeat eaught in time

Seize the day
Seize the day
Blazing across rhe endless wasted land
Shedding light of eternity

Come ambrace the day
We will never pass 
This way again
Never see this morning
Never again this dawning of the sun

Feeble through we are
Fleeting breath of life
Touch inmortality
Tempus fugit

Carpe Diem
Carpe Diem

This moment in its glory
And its pain
Is a heartbeat eaught in time---Lyrics submitted by Abelardo.
