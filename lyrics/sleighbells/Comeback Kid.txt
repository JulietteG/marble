I know its hard but
Youve gotta deal with it
Why dont you look around
Show me what youre made of
Dont turn around
Go get your gun ready
Everyday theres a way to do it just right

Dont wanna take it and just say it as i saw
Youd never know, just where you gotta go
Dont wanna take it and just say it as i saw
Youd never know, just where you gotta go
Dont run away cause thats the deal with it
You gotta turn around, never let your guard down
Ill see you but i know its gonna save you baby
You always run around breaking all the rules with it

I know you tried so hard, but you cant even win
You gotta try a little harder, youre the comeback kid
I know you tried so hard, but you cant even win
You gotta try a little harder, youre the comeback kid

Youre gone away but, youll come back some day
Youre gone away but, youll come back some day
I know its hard but
Youve gotta deal with it
Why dont you look around
Show me what youre made of
Dont turn around
Go get your gun ready
Everyday theres a way to do it just right

I wanna take it and just say it as i saw
You never know, just where you gotta go
I wanna take it and just say it as i saw
You never know, just where you gotta go

Youre gone away but, youll come back some day
Youre gone away but, youll come back some day
I know you tried so hard, but you cant even win
You gotta try a little harder, youre the comeback kid
I know you tried so hard, but you cant even win
You gotta try a little harder, youre the comeback kid

Youre gone away but, youll come back some day
Youre gone away but, youll come back some day---
