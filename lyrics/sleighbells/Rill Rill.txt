Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart
Sixteen six six six like the pentagon
We are the river flow
And you can never know
You're just a weatherman
We make the wind blow

Keep thinking about every straight face yes
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces
What about them
I'm all about them
Six such straight As
Cut em in the bathroom

So this is it then?
You're here to win friend
Click click saddle up see you on the moon then
And all alone friend
Pick up their phones then
Ring ring call them up
Tell them about the new trends

So this is it then?
You're here to win friend
Click click saddle up see you on the moon then
And all alone friend
Pick up their phones then
Ring ring call them up
Tell them about the new trends

Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart
Sixteen six six six like a heart attack
We form a tarot pack
And I'm aware of that
But we could fist fight drunk like the parent trap

Keep thinking about every straight face yes
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces
We never blink see
And you can see me
We fell asleep in the middle of the fury

So this is it then?
You're here to win friend
Click click saddle up see you on the moon then
You're all alone friend
Pick up their phones then
Ring ring call them up
Tell them about the new trends

So this is it then?
You're here to win friend
Click click saddle up see you on the moon then
You're all alone friend
Pick up their phones then
Ring ring call them up
Tell them about the new trends

Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart
Sixteen six six six like the pentagon
We are the river flow
And you can never know
You're just a weatherman
We make the wind blow

Keep thinking about every straight face yes
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces
What about them
I'm all about them
Six such straight As
Cut em in the bathroom

So this is it then?
You're here to win friend
Click click saddle up see you on the moon then
You're all alone friend
Pick up their phones then
Ring ring call them up
Tell them about the new trends

So this is it then?
You're here to win friend
Click click saddle up see you on the moon then
And all alone friend
Pick up their phones then
Ring ring call them up
