You're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

I will be drunk on cheap beer
Like everyone else around here
You've got the world at your feet
There's nothing out there for me

You don't have to lie
Saying that you'll try
To make it work from a distance
Just leave me here to die
As I watch you climb
Up to the top of your ambitions

You're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

Here in a pale shaded light
Under the trailer park lights
There'll be nothing left for you to see
You won't even recognize me


You don't have to lie
Saying that you'll try
To make it work from a distance
Just leave me here to die
As I watch you climb
Up to the top of your ambitions

You're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

You're high upon the tower
Now don't look down
I will be okay here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine---Lyrics submitted by Yasmine Cruz.
