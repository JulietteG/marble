So serious, all the time
I feel a stray, i feel confined
I can not take, your whispering
Your whispering

I wanna dance without you(dance without you)
For once just let me lose myself
I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
Forever, let me lose myself

So inscure, so up tight
I break my neck, to be polite
I can not take, your whipsering
your whispering

I wanna dance without you(dance without you)
For once just let me lose myself
I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
For once, let me lose myself

How can i make history, with your tough reality
take your hand off me, take your hand off me
Before i suffocate

I wanna dance without you(dance without you)
For once just let me lose myself(lose myself)
I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
For once, let me lose myself---Lyrics submitted by lia.
