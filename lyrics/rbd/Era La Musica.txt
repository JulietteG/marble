It was the first day
And the first day I saw you
Never really thought
That you would be the one
To make the sky turn blue

It was amazing
The way that you captured me
It turned me hard
And made me feel we can be so easily

How enchanting, as we're dancing
My life began to change
Now I don't know what to control
But all that I can say is

Era la musica
That made me run to you
Era la musica
That made my dreams come true
Era la musica
As we danced the night away
Era la musica
That made me love you

So exciting
How did I find someone like you?
Someone that made me feel
That love was really oh so true

It was incredible
The way that this came to be
He took my hand and then began
To take a hold of me

How enchanting, as we're dancing
My life began to change
Now I don't know what to control
But all that I can say was

Era la musica
That made me run to you
Era la musica
That made my dreams come true
Era la musica
As we danced the night away
Era la musica
That made me love you

It was the music that made me love you
The way you move takes my breath away
The way you dance girl is like no other
Was it the music that made me stay?
Stay with me girl I'll show you where we can go
Far away to a place only love goes
Yo no se lo que me esta pasando
A ti te sigo amando

How enchanting, as we're dancing
My life began to change
Now I know what to control
But all that I can say is

Era la musica
That made me run to you
Era la musica
That made my dreams come true
Era la musica
As we danced the night away
Era la musica
That made me love you

Era la musica
That made me run to you
Era la musica
That made my dreams come true
Era la musica
As we danced the night away
Era la musica
That made me love you
