Man if you run down your shadow now,
You can never catch it
I said, a woman is like a shadow,
and a man is like an arrow
So, never let a woman know how much you love
Cause there will be no peace in your life
Man I said!
Never let a woman know how much you care
Cause they will do things to hurt you
And is no joke about it
I said to do what you can for them but not too much
Cause they will hurt you
Give what you can for them but not too much
Cause they will hurt you
Listen what I said to you and no joke about it
Easy come, easy go---Lyrics submitted by Asterios Serdar.
