Left here alone
And unsure of what I feel
Unclear but I see
Just what I'm afraid of

I can't find my way anymore
And I
Cannot heal the wounds I've created
And I can't let go
Of what's killing me

Falling from this edge
I am lost to all I know

I can't breathe anymore
Somehow I'm locked inside this cage
And I try
But I can't fight to stay alive.

Falling from this edge
I am lost to all I know
Time is only fantasy and
Lies the only
Reverie

I've tried
But I can't fight anymore
I'm falling from this edge

I am lost to all I know
Time is only fantasy and
Lies the only
Reverie---Lyrics submitted by Eva-Marie.
