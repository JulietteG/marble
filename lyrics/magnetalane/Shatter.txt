Took you for a ride
Its what you wanted
Did I make you heart believe
You wrote the songs in
Cuz I dont give till I receive
Just being honest
You were so beautiful
The night is august

So what it was up to you now
And its true how I push you out
So what, it was up to you
And its true how
things go round

You took a punch from me
It doesnt matter
And now youll take her heart away
And it wont matter

And though it still amazes me 
What you chase after
Chose to love the man I need
Cuz he wont shatter
Me.. up..

Touching your warm hands 
Felt so private
And now his hands converted me
They gave me silence

Did I hurt you bad enough
Held in my laughter
We were so beautiful
My ever after

So what it was up to you now
And its true how I push you down
So what, it was up to you
And its true how
things go round

You took a punch from me
It doesnt matter,
And now youll take her heart away
And it wont matter

And though it still amazes me 
What you chase after
Chose to love the man I need
Cuz he wont shatter

She says you took a punch from me
It doesnt matter
She knows youll take her heart away
And it wont matter

And though it still amazes me 
What you chased after
Chose to love the man I need
Cuz he wont shatter..
Me..---Lyrics submitted by victor xaxsor.
