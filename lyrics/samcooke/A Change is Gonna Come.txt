I was born by the river, in a little tent,
Oh, and just like the river, I've been runnin' ever since.
It's been a long, a long time comin',
But I know, a change is gonna come.  (oh, yes it will)

It's been too hard livin', but I'm afraid to die,
'Cuz I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky.
It's been a long, a long time comin',
But I know, a change is gonna come.  (oh, yes it will)

I go to the movies, and I go downtown,
But somebody keep telling, don't hang around.
It's been a long, a long time comin',
But I know, a change is gonna come.  (oh , yes it will)

Then, I go to my brother,
And I said brother, help me please.
But he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees.

Oh, there've times that I thought, I couldn't last for long,
But, now I think I'm able to carry on,
It's been a long, a long time comin',
But I know, a change is gonna come.  (oh, yes it will)---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
