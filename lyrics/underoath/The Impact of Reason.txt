Prop open the door
I can actually see my breath tonight
Crack a smile just for the sake of it
This could take awhile,
(A long while)

Silence is golden, especially in this case

I'm not too sure that i want it to be this way
Open mouth, closed eyes
No words are escaping

It's all a blur
It's too dark to see
Ain't it pretty the way it all streaks together at night?
(Together at night)

I think it's time to turn around
I really want to go home tonight
I think it's time to turn around
I really want to go home tonight

I feel like this is going nowhere
I feel like this is going nowhere
Try to think of something quick
And trust the direction of the driver

No lights
No signs
I'm at a loss for words
No lights
No signs
I'm at a loss for words

Now conversation sparks
What an easy way to break the ice
Now conversation sparks
What an easy way to break the ice---Lyrics submitted by tyffani.
