The obscene lie
Enemy controlled designs
The light failing to incite deception

A new time is chosen for endless sleep
Anticipating Visions
A night less destiny

The day of endless light
Consumed in the Darkness
Black iris of the sun
Consumed in the darkness

This time the trickery of light remains
Illuminate dark paths

A new time is chosen for endless sleep
Anticipating Visions
A night less destiny

The day of endless light
Consumed in the Darkness
Black iris of the sun
Consumed in the darkness

[Solo: Werstler]

A stone inside me that defies the truth
A hidden blade, the piercing light of the sun

The day of endless light
Consumed in the Darkness
Black iris of the sun
Consumed in the darkness

Remember, support the band and buy the album.---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
