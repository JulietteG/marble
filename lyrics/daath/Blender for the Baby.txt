Your cells are
Gonna get it
Your strain
Contaminated
Your cells conjoin
Shun the love,
But you're going
To get it

Your system torn
From the straps
Of the gods
The one you
Chose will be
Gone by night
Insect philosophy
You're now dis-
Connected

Odds are nothing
Would never go
Right
Darkness forever
Will hold you
Tight

Long night, dark-
Ness
Kills the inno-
Cent, the world's
End is it immi-
Nent? No one
Wants to take the
Hint,
No one wants
Your baby
Blender for the
Baby
Hanger for the

The baby, bitch
You're fucking
Crazy
Endless season
No safe place
Improper
Methods
Splintered feel-
Ings
Run for cover
Copulating
Whore
Inside infinite
On fire, illumi-
Nating no one

Outside
Natural robot
Doom

All it takes
Let it fall out
The emotion
Charged ciom-
Modity

Dominate
You're so
False
Sucking all
The soul right
Outta me

And then you
Rub it in

Do it some
More
Till I'm over-
Come with all
This haste

And now I'm
Pounding your
Face
Never let go
Lay mother-
Fuckers in
Their place---Lyrics submitted by caleb.
