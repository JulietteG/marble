I have thought that you have come back lately
to tear my soul away from me
Cuz when I see you 
you rip my heart out
but all the same, you're not to blame
baby, baby I love you still

I need your heart beating next to my heart
in love I am
I need your heart beating next to my heart
in love I am

do you remember how I met you child
i was down and i fell for you completely
when i wanted your heart and 
you didn't want me now you do
but now you do

i need your heart beating next to my heart
in love i am
i need your heart dancing next to my heart
in love i am

baby do you love me still
cause i miss you
i miss you
baby
i miss you---Lyrics submitted by Jessie.
