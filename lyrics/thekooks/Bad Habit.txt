I know you've fallen again
The way I fell before
Cause I'm a bad loser
When you get your way

And I know that I'll change
I'm chained again
You've lost your way
There's nothing I want today

Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
And I hope that I change
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

So I won't let the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?

Still small
Small voice of calm
It's the blame into my arms

Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
Oh, Mary, mercy
Would you pray for me?
Would you pray for me?

So I won't let the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?

And if I could make the days of pain
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forget me now?

Ah ah oh, ah ah oh

Cause I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away

So I won't let the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?

And if I could take the pain away
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forgive me now?

I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
Wash the stains away
And I feel quite okay---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
