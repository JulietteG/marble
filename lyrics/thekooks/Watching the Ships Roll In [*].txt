watching the ships roll in
hoping that i will still be his friend
in the morning
watching those ships roll by
wishing that i could move this earth
if i could, for you i would do ..

I've got nothing to say , 
I've got nothing to lay at your feet.
I just keep hoping , hoping you
will be the man , that i couldn't be

Still watching the oceans move 
If only i could show you my soul
and places i've been .
Watching the ocean come
and little girls playing in the sand as i walk ,
longing to listen to you talk

But i've got nothing to say
And i've got nothing to lay at your feet
I just keep hoping , hoping you
will be the man , that i couldn't be---Lyrics submitted by Getu da Pisike.
