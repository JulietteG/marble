Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you dreaming about being about him
Too bad your chances are slim
And its not like Mr. Show
To get shy when they ask him for his auto
There must be something deep down in the middle of down there
Hes not too easily scared
Hes got friends but they got fear
Who dont care too much if he just disappeared
Oh, look there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)
Cause he doesnt like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
He wont remember a thing 'til it started again
Thats how it was 'til the end (yeah) ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
