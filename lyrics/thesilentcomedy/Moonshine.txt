Written by J. John and J. Benjamin

Oh Anna, s something you need?
She answered, The stuffs not cheap its true
But I like it!

My spirits can drive you to drink
That Marshall, dont like what it makes you do
So I hide it!

Oh in the dark of a backwoods night
I blend my mash till the mix is nice

Copper flash and a pilot fire
How the pressures buildin

Up Black Mountain and back off the road
Shielded lanterns, their steps were so discreet
But I spied them!

12 gauge buckshot, smoke in a ring
Rusty padlocks, they guard my boilin wheat
Quite nicely!

Oh how flashes light the sky
Lead shot flies and fumes ignite

Bracelets snap and their fists do fly
I feel them flat as they hit my sides

I see their shapes in the red firelight
But I cant stop or save it

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Anna!---Lyrics submitted by Ottis.
