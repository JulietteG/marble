Written by J. John and J. Benjamin

Your body went black with the bitters drained
Satin got strapped to a wooden base

Hammer heads clap for a liquid lace
Battery brat and a wicked fade

But if the ladle gets licked, then the suspects headed for hell to pay

Scissor-cut slacks and a broken vase
A little high fashion and summer stakes

Hanging my hat where the stumbles stray
Lift a gate latch and youre giving way

But in a fifty-ounce fish, theres a full shot stiff of the everglades---Lyrics submitted by Ottis.
