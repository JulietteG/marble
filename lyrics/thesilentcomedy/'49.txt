Written by J. John and J. Benjamin

We loaded rifles with our ragged britches on
We built the wagons, and we head to Cali-FOR-nia
Ive got a lot to say, so you must sit and take it all

Your father looked at me like a thing that dont belong
Some sorry sailor with no fortune for his daughter
Ill take your words with me - Ill cross the Rockies in the fall

To win my baby  Ill find fortunes fit to take you home

Blood washes glitter from stone
Mad forces, bodies and bones
Blood washes glitter from stone

Four years and seven days since I left what was my home
Return to find you cavortin with another
He bent a knee for you  bought you a ring of solid gold
With that vein my fate pursued, I could have made five hundred more

Youre breaking my patience
Youre breaking my patience
Youre breaking my patience DOWN---Lyrics submitted by Ottis.
