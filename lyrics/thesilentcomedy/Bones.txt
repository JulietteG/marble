Written by J. Benjamin

Your father made a fortune on the pain and torture
Of the labor never paid to build the streets
And as he lay there dyin, he pulled you to him cryin
He said, My dear, their faces starin, back at me
And you said, Father, whatever do you mean?

He said, Theres bones under the road
I buried them deep
And I know, that when I go, theyre waiting for me

Your uneventful husband, he doesnt know he does it
But when you are talking, he looks at your feet
You got your body sunlit, but then the butler done it
He said, Maam Im sorry but you know Im weak
And you said, I thought we werent supposed to speak

Theres bones under the road
Buried for me
Oh know, that when Im old, bones I will be

You have a lovely daughter, you held her underwater
But you wanted her dressed up to greet your guests
They said My dear you look pale, soaked wet and frail
She screamed, Your face is made up to hide a mess
oh why dont you just go on and confess.

That theres bones under the robes, youre wearing for me
Oh I know that when Im old
Bones Ill be---Lyrics submitted by Ottis.
