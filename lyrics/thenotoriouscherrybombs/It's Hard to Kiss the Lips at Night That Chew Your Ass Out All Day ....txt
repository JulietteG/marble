She used to call me Baby, I thought she was such a lady
But my how things have changed since time moved on
I give her my last dollar and now all shell do is holler
Oh, my life has become a country song.

Ive learned she can resist me by the way she always disses me
And comes to bed at night with that cold cream on
Sometimes I might feel frisky, but these days its just too risky
Its hard to kiss the lips at night that chew your ass out all day long

All day long, it goes on and on
If a tree fell in the forest - she didnt hear it, would I still be wrong?
I guess I should admit it, she aint ever gonna quit it
Its hard to kiss the lips at night that chew your ass out all day long 

(Spoken:)
Man I remember when her eyes used to be so blue & shiny,
God you aughtta see what happened to her heiny ("her what?") Heiny.
Man, that thing is big enough to land a small plane on ("small plane?")
I used to roll her in the clover, mmm-mm, but thank GOD those days are over.

Its hard to kiss the lips at night that chew your ass out all day long

All day long, she (goes) on and on
If someday they drop the big one, Id say, Sweet Jesus shes gonna finally leave me alone,
Its all right if we say it, cause the radio won't play it.
Its hard to kiss the lips at night that chew your ass our all day long
Its hard to kiss the lips at night that chew your ass our all day long---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
