You never worried too much 
when we both were young
Youd cover up your heartache, 
cover up alone
The more I saw indifference, 
I knew youd lost your nerve
The more your best intentions 
were just left unheard

Let it out

Always remember me
When you are lost
When youre in need
Always remember us
If youve missed the mark
Even if you fall apart

Never the interference that we run with now
When you see the daylight that will soon go out
We only seemed talk of being misunderstood
When nothing else would matter, 
when what we knew was good ---
