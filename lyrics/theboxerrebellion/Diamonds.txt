Pretty little thing did you feel something
Did you always want me to be something
To mend a broken a heart
From a Devil of shallow nonsense
Turned your world upside down

Whatever said that it'd mean something
Whatever said that it'd mean nothing
And did I look the part
When it's all said and done
When it's all said and done

I'm no good next to Diamonds
When I'm too close to start to fade
Are you angry with me now
Are you angry cause I'm to blame

I'm no good next to Diamonds
When I'm too close to start to fade
Are you angry with me now
Are you angry cause I'm to blame

Never wanna hide the truth from you
Just hang my head what I put you through
I wasn't good enough
When what's done is done love
When it's all said and done

But I'm

No good next to Diamonds
When I'm too close to start to fade
Are you angry with me now
Are you angry cause I'm to blame

Cause I fall away
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was

I'm no good next to Diamonds
When I'm too close to start to fade
Are you angry with me now
Are you angry cause I'm to blame

I'm no good next to Diamonds
When I'm too close to start to fade
Are you angry with me now
Are you angry cause I'm to blame

Cause I fall away
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was

I have no words---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
