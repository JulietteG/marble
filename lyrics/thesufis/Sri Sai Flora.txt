Let me take all of your worries
I could want you 
Please don't hurry
Memories that don't seem too real to me.

Please excuse my occupation
I'm not dull
I just don't bother
Floating through a kaleidoscopic dream.

Sitting high up on a tree top
Feel the wind blow through my hair
Lots of little people down below me.---Lyrics submitted by randomhouse.
