Ride it on baby, into my view
Ride it on baby, into your sight
Ride it on baby, just like you used to do
Did you want me love you?
Well, I'm just here for the car
And you said that you're so low
Well I won't really do you any harm
Won't you ride it on baby, just like you used to do?
There's no love that you're over feeling
And you still wanna be with me
But you're leavin like you said that you would
I'm a-waitin for the car
And you love like you always say now
But you know it won't do you any harm
Ride it on baby, just like you said that you would
Oh then ride it on baby, just like you know it's understood
Ride it on baby, it's still into your view
Ride it on baby, I only wanna be with you
I'm dreamin that you're goin far
And you like takin wine
Won't you ride it on baby?
But you're so heavy-filled with pride
Ride it on baby, just like you said that you would---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
