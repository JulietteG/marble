I've been let down
and I'm still comin 'round.
I've been put down
and I'm still comin 'round for you,
comin 'round for you.

Take away everything, it feels fine.
Catch a shape in the circles of mind.
Make me feel like I belong to you,
make me fell it even if it ain't true.


Catch a train on a silver afternoon,
a thousand miles and I'm gettin there too soon.
Take me there when I should be goin home.
Tell me why I'm still feelin all alone.


I've been let down,
and I'm still comin 'round for you.
I've been put down
and I'm still comin 'round for you,
comin 'round for you.---Lyrics submitted by Violet.
