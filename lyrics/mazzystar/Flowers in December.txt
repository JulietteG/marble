Before I let you down again,
I just want to see you in your eyes.
I wouldn't have taken everything out on you,
I only thought you could understand.

They say every man goes blind in his heart,
And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away.
And I got nothing more to say about it
Nothing more than you would me.

Send me your flowers of your december,
Send me your dreams of your candied wine.
I've got just one thing I can't give you...
Just one more thing of mine

They say every man goes blind in his heart
And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away
And I've been wondering why you let me down
And I've been taking it all for granted...---Lyrics submitted by Awais.
