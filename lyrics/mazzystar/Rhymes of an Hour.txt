Cannot hear what your saying
Could i tell you so
And i can't believe my troubles
And i'm going home
Lie and sleep
Under deep
You know
While the cold winter waiting
While it's turning cold
All these things we were searching
Now we just don't know
Lie and sleep
Under deep
I think you know
For the rhymes of an hour
Now i'm going home
And I can't believe I'm nothing
'Cause I'm coming down
Lie and sleep
Under deep
Do you know?---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
