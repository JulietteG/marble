Look on down from the bridge,
There's still fountains down there.
Look on down from the bridge,
It's still raining up here.

Everybody seems so far away from me,
Everybody just wants to be free.

Look away from the sky,
It's no different when you leave them home.
I can't be sensing truly, now.
I'm just gone...just gone.
I've gotta say goodbye,
How can I say goodbye?
Goodbye...

Maybe I'll just place my hands over you,
And close my eyes real...(something...).
There's a light in your eyes,
And you know...yeah, you know.

Look on down from the bridge,
I'm still waiting for you.---Lyrics submitted by JT.
