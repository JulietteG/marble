After I stuck my hands into your brow
And pulled out somebody else's song
I felt a little unfortunate
A little mistaken
I felt like I've been wasted all the day long
All the day long
All the day long

After I bent myself to my knee
And raised my hands up right above my head
I felt a little lit up
A little bit high
I felt like I've been wasted all the day long
All the day long
All day long...

After I took my eyes from the west
Brought myself back to my place
I felt a little like all right
A little like stoned
I felt like I've been wasted all the day long
All the day long
All the day long---Lyrics submitted by michael.
