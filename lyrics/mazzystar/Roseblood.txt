Everyday you can see
Changes in her hair and smile
I can wait a million days
While her smile goes away
Sometimes i feel deceived
By the slices in her hands
Secrets in her lipstick mouth
Shining on again
Shining on again
Capture her smile and then that's all
You won't know her so it's okay
Funny how things change
Funny how things change---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
