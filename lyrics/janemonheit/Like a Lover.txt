Like a lover, the morning sun
Slowly rises and kisses you awake
Your smile is soft and drowzy
As you let it play upon your face
Oh, how I dream
I might be like the morning sun to you

Like a lover, the river wind
Sighs and ripples its fingers through your hair
Upon your cheek it lingers
Never having known a sweeter place
Oh, how I dream 
I might be like the river wind to you

How I envy a curve that knows your lips
Let it be me - my love
[At a table] that feels your finger tips
Let it be me - let me be your love
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you

Like a lover, the velvet moon
Shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
Its light arrives on tip toe
Gently taking you in its embrace
Oh, how I dream
I might be like the velvet moon to you---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
