I guess I'd like the simple things in life
A little house and someone to call my wife
I see such beauty
As ice-cream melts on your hot, hot lips

Hold on, honey, we got forever to taste
Speed up, sugar, don't forget our friend "Fate"
It could disappear without a trace

You say: let's act like children tonight
The truth be told I've been a child all my life
And I see such lovely
As chocolate melts on your hot, hot skin

Umbrellas and trampolines
There's a hole in your heart
Dear Liza, stop trying to heal the world

Armageddon over gasoline
There's a hole in our sky
Dear Liza, let's just live our own lives

The simple one I desire
