Flick flick flicker drifts the mountains
Thick as thick as thieves of stolen fun
We're like tigers, (rawr) tigers

Sipping champagne with the queen of hearts
Pana-animated little cartoon spiders
We're like diamonds, diamonds
Lazy sunny days

Oh oh my my my (oh oh my my my)
Oh my my my my (oh oh my my my)
Oh oh my my my (oh oh my my my)
You put a spell on me my love
My love

I love living in Jozi town
Spin a little spell my wonderful
Daddy daddy longlegs spiders (spiders)
Lazy sunny days

Oh oh my my my (oh oh my my my)
Oh my my my my (oh oh my my my)
Oh oh my my my (oh oh my my my)
You put a spell on me my love
My love---Lyrics submitted by Justin Nosay.
