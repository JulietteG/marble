Honey you're my favourite
I wonder do you feel the same
Honey youre delicious
I wonder do I taste the same

Im an old romantic, standing here, clutching my bleeding heart
If Im not good enough for love, then Ive had enough, lets make this fast
Who cares Ill find my fish
Im colourful

I get so nervous I stutter stutter
I am so clumsy I fumble stumble
Im not some handsome knight in shining armour
Im colourful
Im colourful

Well honey youre the reason
For the poet-inspired love affair
Honey this is treason
The king is gone Rapunzel let down your hair

Im an old romantic, standing here, clutching my bleeding heart
If Im not good enough for love, then Ive had enough, lets make this fast
Who cares Ill find my fish
Im colourful

I get so nervous I stutter stutter
I am so clumsy I fumble stumble
Im not some handsome knight in shining armour
Im colourful
Im colourful

You lift me up take me higher higher
You fill me up with desire

You lift me up take me higher higher
You fill me up with desire

I get so nervous I stutter stutter
I am so clumsy I fumble stumble
I'm not some romance god but does it matter
Im colourful
Im colourful
Im colourful
Im colourful---Lyrics submitted by George Waitforit Plakojohn.
