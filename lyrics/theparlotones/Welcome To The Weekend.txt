Inquisitive eyes peer from window sills

Screaming tires on a road to nowhere
Traveled for years, never got anywhere
Magnetic excuses kept us from getting there

Contaminated minds fueled by supplements
Our mind's made numb by modern instruments
Today's new thing tomorrow's redundancy
The most loved god is a god of currency
Forced to believe autocratic democracy
Politician don't you ruin our
