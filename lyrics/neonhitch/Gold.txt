(feat. Tyga)

There's no light in this room
It's all right, we got you
You shine like gold

You walk by
Cause a scene, all the girls
They agree, you shine like gold

It's good to meet you, beautiful creature
You got my heartbeat racing like a cheetah
Don't need no lights, so turn them off
Give me a tylenol, because my head keeps spinning like a disco ball
I can tell that your love is blinding
Electric touch, I feel you inside me
And I wanna know, yeah I just gotta know
Can you light me up when we're alone?

There's no light in this room
It's all right, we got you
You shine like gold

You walk by
Cause a scene, all the girls
They agree, you shine like gold

It's like I'm speechless
And I can't speak cause you took the words from me
You are my weakness
You're sweeter than the cinnabon
That body's all I want
You got the whole room glowing
Everybody knows
I can tell that your love is blinding
Electric touch I feel you inside me
And I wanna know,
Yeah I just gotta know
Can you light me up when we're alone?

There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold

You walk by
Cause a scene, all the girls
They agree you shine like gold

[Tyga]
What you want? Diamonds and gold?
Lifestyles of a Penthouse floor?
Right now Im kinda into what you like
So tomorrow night, no regrets, let it all flow
And if you got some bad bitches
I take 'em Nightly courtside, looking at a Laker
Then later she calling me baby Like what comes after labor
Rich-ass neighbors
Gold in a car now we shine like sabers
Two million ladies
Two million light years and I still wouldnt change ya
Waiter, waiter, can I get another shot of that Tron?
Cause Im on a whole nother level called gone
She my queen, Im King Hakeem
No limelight gon ever turn me shady I dream

There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold

You walk by
Cause a scene, all the girls
They agree you shine like gold ---
