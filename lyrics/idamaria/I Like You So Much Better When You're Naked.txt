Oh the clever
things I should say to you
They got stuck somewhere
Stuck between me and you

Oh Im nervous
I dont know what to do
Light a cigarette
I only smoke when Im with you

What the hell do I do this for?
Youre just another guy
OK, youre kind of sexy
But youre not really special

But I wont mind
If you take me home
Come on, take me home

I wont mind
if you take off all your clothes
Come on, take them off

Cause I like you so much better when youre naked
I like me so much better when youre naked
I like you so much better when youre naked
I like me so much better when youre naked---Lyrics submitted by kate.
