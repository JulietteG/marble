How come I'm so afraid of people
Most people are quite nice people
How come I'm so in love with people
Most people are quite stupid people

Maybe I'm afraid someone will see right through me
'Cause I see right through you
Maybe I'm afraid someone will see right through me
'Cause I see right through you

You're just as terrified as I am
Terrified that someone will confirm that you suck
Terrified that someone will tell someone
That you're just a waste of time
Terrified that someone will tell someone
That you're not worth the dirt under your shoes

Maybe I'm afraid someone will see right through me
'Cause I see right through you

You can be my friend and we can pretend
We can point fingers and we can offend

Oh, oh, oh, maybe I'm afraid someone will see right through me
'Cause I see right through you
Maybe I'm afraid someone will see right through me
'Cause I see right through you---Lyrics submitted by Hayden Bagley.
