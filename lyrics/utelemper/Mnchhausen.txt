(1)  I came across a wond'rous tree
as prickly as a porcupine.

This cactus tree bore luscious fruit
and giant roses red as wine.

It rose so high into de sky
its top was far, far out of sight.

Its leaves recoiles from the day
and then they turned to gold at night.

And if you bored into its bark
hot coffee poured out rich and dark.

(*) Liar, liar,liar,liar,liar,liar

I'm sick and tired of lies from you
but how I wish your lies were true.

Liar, liar,liar,liar,liar,liar.

Truth is as hard and tough as nails
that's why we need fairy tales.

I'm all through with logical conclusions
why should I deny ,myself illusions.

-------------------------------------

(2)  I saw a film the other day
that really varied from the norm.

There were no soldiers on parade
and no one marched in uniform.

Its heroes were not supermen
and no one even shot a gun.

The audience still loved the film
though not a single war was won.

But I was really shock to see
this film was made in germany.

Liar, liar,liar,liar,liar,liar.

(3)  I saw a court of law where all
the justices were just again.

Where all the lawyers worked for free
and all of them were honest men.

You could be rich you could de poor
you could be Christian or a Jew.

Your politics did not have sway
on how a judge would rule on you.

Their hearts were young, 
their minds were free,
they judge all men aqually.


(4)  I saw a woman trying hard
to feed her family of ten.

She was so poor and destitude
and worse was pregnant once again.

She knew what they would say in church
she sought a doctor out instead

who told her if she had the child
that she herself might well end dead

Then in a calm and gentle voice 
he said the law says its your choice.

(*)

(5) I saw a brave republic where
one banner flew for all to see.

Its stripes of black and red and gold
proclaim a new democracy.

All banners from the past were banned
the empire's black and white and red.

Yes now the black and red and gold
is flying everywhere instead.

And nowhere will you see those flags
which sport thar thing that zigs and zags.

(*)

(6)  I saw a land that hated war
and melted all its weapons down

to build a boat of love for kids
who planned to sail from town to town
declaring peace for all the world.

Let killing now come to an end
embrace your enemies instead
your former foe is now your friend.

Ev'ry conflict now will cease
and all of us will live in peace
