There's a land that I, have heard about,
So far across, the sea
There's a land that I, have heard about,
So far across, the sea

To have, you on.. my dreamland,
Would be like, heaven to me..
To have you on.. my dreamland,
Would be like heaven to me..

We'll live, together, on that dreamland,
And we'll have, so much fun.
We'll live together, on that dreamland,
And we'll have so, much fun.

We'll get our breakfast, from the trees.
We'll get our honey, from the bees.
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls.
We'll count the stars, in the sky.

And surely, we'll never die.
And surely, we'll never die.
And surely, we'll never die.

Oh, what a time, that will be,
Oh just, you wait, wait, wait and see.
And surely, we'll never die.
And surely, we'll never die.---Lyrics submitted by Miguel Vega.
