Verse 1

I was drawn into myself
Observing all this time
From every angle that I see
My people, you're meeting hell

The brothers have turned to crime
So they die from time to time 

We'd like to ask you leaders
What have you got in mind?

Cho
But I see the fire spreading, it's getting hotter and hot!
The haves will want to be 
In the shoes of the have not
Dem a tun fat cat!
[If the sign is on your door then you will be safe for sure
But if you are in pretence you're on the wrong side of the fence.

Verse 2
Another thing I saw in vision
Right in front these eyes 
Sisters prostituting, selling away their lives
They get but very little pay, the ones who clean the mess
Minority who sits on top raise themselves the best

Cho
But I see the fire spreading, it's getting hotter and hot!
The haves will want to be 
In the shoes of the have not
Dem a tun fat cat!
[If the sign is on your door then you will be safe for sure
But if you are in pretence you're on the wrong side of the fence.

Verse 2
Said Another thing I saw in vision
Right in front these eyes 
Sisters prostituting, selling away their lives
They get but very little pay, the ones who clean the mess
Minority who sits on top raise themselves the best

Cho
But I see the fire spreading, it's getting hotter and hot!
The haves will want to be 
In the shoes of the have not
Dem a tun fat cat!
[If the sign is on your door then you will be safe for sure
But if you are in pretence you're on the wrong side of the fence.---Lyrics submitted by Donmar Blake.
