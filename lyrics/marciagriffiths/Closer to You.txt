I Want to be closer, I Want to be closer
I Want to be closer, Closer to you
I want to be sweeter, I want to be so much sweeter
I want to be sweeter, Sweeter to you

Seeing you is like magic
You make my day, You make my day
Don't know what it is about you 
That makes me feel this way
And I don't know but when you come around
I do sweet silly things as if my mind is unsound

I Want to be closer, I Want to be closer
I Want to be closer, Closer to you
I want to be sweeter, I want to be so much sweeter
I want to be sweeter, Sweeter to you

Right now I'm laughing
Over while we good feelings
I'm out of this world 
That I feel so protected inside
And I don't know what makes me feel this way
I do sweet silly things as if my mind is unsound

I Want to be closer, I Want to be closer
I Want to be closer, Closer to you

Seeing you is like magic
You make my day, You make my day
Don't know what it is about you 
That makes me feel this way
And I don't know but when you come around
I do sweet silly things as if my mind is unsound

I Want to be closer, I Want to be closer
I Want to be closer, Closer to you
I want to be sweeter, I want to be so much sweeter
I want to be sweeter, Sweeter to you

I Want to be closer, I Want to be closer
I Want to be closer, Closer to you
I want to be sweeter, I want to be so much sweeter
I want to be sweeter, Sweeter to you---Lyrics submitted by Paul Grant.
