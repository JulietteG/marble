Sometimes I wonder - where would I be - 
If I didn't have you here with me - my world would be empty
Sometimes I wonder - what would I do -
If I had to live without you - I wouldn't have a clue

Just the thought of losing your love - is painful enough
I hate to think about it - don't wanna live without it  - mmm
I don't ever wanna lose your touch - I need you so much
You're everything to me - I can't live without your love

You're my Heartbeat - you are the man inna mi life - the apple of my eyes
You're my Heartbeat - rude boy you are mi oww - you keep me satisfied
You're my Heartbeat - you are the man inna mi life - the apple of my eyes
You're my Heartbeat - rude boy you are mi oww - you keep me satisfied

There is no question - no doubt in my mind
You are one of a kind - you must be Heaven Sent
I'm glad you love me - the way that you do
We stand the tests of time - we'll make dreams come true

Just the way that you treat me - whenever you see me
Put me on a pedestal - you make me feel brand new
You've got the magic stick - no back-up tricks
Now my life is happier - and I owe it all to you

You're my Heartbeat - you are the man inna mi life - the apple of my eyes
You're my Heartbeat - rude boy you are mi oww - you keep me satisfied
You're my Heartbeat - you are the man inna mi life - the apple of my eyes
You're my Heartbeat - rude boy you are mi oww - you keep me satisfied

Sometimes I wonder - where would I be - 
If I didn't have you here with me - my world would be empty
Sometimes I wonder - what would I do -
If I had to live without you - I wouldn't have a clue

Just the thought of losing your love - is painful enough
I hate to think about it - don't wanna live without it  
I don't ever wanna lose your touch - I need you so much
You're everything to me - I can't live without your love---Lyrics submitted by Lavishn MW.
