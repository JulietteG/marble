I'd like to kiss you once more
Just to hold you once more
Just to find out for sure 
You must leave me now
My darling, tell me, tell me, now..

I'd like to find out from you
Why must you make me feel blue?
I'd like to know what to do to make you feel alright
My darling, never leave my side

I like to kiss you once more
Just to hold you once more
Just to find out for sure 
You must leave me now
My darling, tell me, tell me, now..

I like to find out from you
Why must you make me feel blue?
I like to know what to do to make you feel alright
My darling, never leave my side

I like to kiss you once more
Just to hold you once more
Just to find out for sure 
You must leave me now
My darling, tell me, tell me, now..

I like to find out from you
Why must you make me feel blue?
I like to know what to do to make you feel alright
My darling, never leave my side

Give my love a try, please don't say good bye.. (x2)
Oh, don't make me cry, give my love a try..---Lyrics submitted by Miguel Vega.
