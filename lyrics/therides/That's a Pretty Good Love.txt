Baby, my love is deep
Deep as the bottom of the ocean
Pure as a new born baby
Outshine the sun above
That's a pretty good love

Baby, my love will last
Long as life in my body
I swear to you on the Bible
Any old time you say
That's a pretty good love

Baby, please come on home
Wanna put my arms around you
Squeeze you till you cannot breathe
That's the way I feel about you
That's a pretty good love

Ain't nobody love you like I do
Honey, I know just what to do
I aint much to look at and wont win a prize
But when it comes to loving, Ill open your eyes

Baby, I love you so
You got me begging and pleading
Your love is all I need
There's nothing I wouldn't do
That's a pretty good love

Ain't nobody love you like I do
Honey, I know just what to do
All them other women telling you lies
'Cause when it comes to loving, I'll open your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
