Talked to my baby on the telephone, she said
Stop what you're doing and come on home

I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I get a real good feeling
Talking to you on the phone

She said daddy, don't you worry, don't you cry
You know I love you baby, said you're my heart's desire

I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I get a real good feeling
Talking to you on the phone

She said, daddy don't you worry, don't you cry
You know I love you baby, said you're my heart's desire

I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I get a real good feeling
Talking to you on the phone

Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby

I get a real good feeling
Talking to you on the phone---
