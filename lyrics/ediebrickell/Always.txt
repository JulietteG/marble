Break those chains tonight
Hold your head up high
'Cause you ain't done nothin' wrong
And you always will belong

Ah, ah, ah, always
Ah, ah, ah, always.

Clouds and dogs and trees
Stones and sunlit streets
Demons on dark roads
Shadows at the door

Ah, ah, ah, always
Ah, ah, ah, always.

Break those chains tonight
Hold your head up high
'Cause you ain't done nothin' wrong
And you always will belong.

Ah, ah, ah, always
Ah, ah, ah, always
Ah, ah, ah, always---Lyrics submitted by Valerie Grimes.
