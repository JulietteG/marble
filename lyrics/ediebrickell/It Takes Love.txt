You've been treated bad
Lonely times are what you've had
Fighting is all you know
You have learned what you were shown

It takes love to grow
It takes love to grow

Habits are not like hearts
Breakin' them is very hard
But you got to wanna change
Who can make you do anything?

It takes love to grow
It takes love to grow

Would you forgive me
For leavin' you one day?
Would you forgive yourself
For pushin' me away?

I thought we could be friends
Always, till the end
Games you play hurt me so
Lately I don't know

It takes love to grow
It takes love to grow
It takes love to grow
It takes love to grow---Lyrics submitted by KlausDruselmann.
