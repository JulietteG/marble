What would you do
if this was the last breath you could take
inhale, exhale and then you slip away ay - ay 
aw what would you say...say...say...say....say

Who would you want to see ....ee...ee
right before you close your eyes
and take one good look for the final time .....
Ohoo you say good-bye ...bye ...bye ...bye...bye

Well, I aint no preacher teacher or no Politician
I'm just somebody looking for something that seem to be missing 
I'm not even going to preach in that I qualify
to tell you or somebody else how to live their life

So I'm telling you
all that we got is each other 
Sisters and brothers of all colors (yeah)
I'm telling you
all that we got is each other
It don't cost nothing to love one another

Aint got money but I got good news 
(love is) FR double E  F.R.E.E.
You got to make a choice, so you might as well chose 
(love is)F. r.  double e  F.R.E.E. 

So I'm telling you

Love is worth everything, but it don't cost a thing
love is free

Well I aint no preacher teacher or no Politian
