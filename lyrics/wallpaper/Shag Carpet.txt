OH, I WANNA KNOW
WHATS THE ANSWER
WHAT IS THE ANSWER?
OH, I WANNA KNOW
IF YOU CAN STAND STILL WHEN YOU STAND STILL
OH, I WANNA KNOW
IF ITS PLASTIC BURN WITH THE MATCH STICK?
OH I WANNA KNOW
IF YOU CAN STAND STILL IF YOU STAND STILL

SIDEWAYS WHITE LINES
SUCK-COCK BLUES
NAUGHTY LITTLE HEM LINE
CREEPY PINK HOTEL WITH ME!

DO YOU WANT A DAHLI LAMA?
WAKE UP, CHECK YOUR PULSE AND MAKE-UP
DO YOU WANT A DAHLI LAMA
JOHNNY WAS A MIXER
HE WAS MIXED IN THE APARTMENT WITH ME
OH WITH ME
OH WITH ME

BOMP BOMP BABOMP
BOUNCE ON THE MATTRESS
BOMP BOMP BABOMP
BIRTH, DAZE, DISASTER
