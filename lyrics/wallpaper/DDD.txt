My friends are always telling me,
"You got gangster sensibilities".
I'm like, "DDD. I don't know what you mean.
But I'm really glad you're feelin' me".
My girlfriend, she's always sayin' to me,
"You gotta start paying utilities".
I'm like, "DDD. I don't know what you mean.
But I'm really glad you're feeling me.
I'm REALLY glad you're feeling me!"

Hit Trader Joe's for the 2 buck chuck.
20 some bottles cost 40 some dollars (bucks).
Bennies for days, aint tryin' to show off, but
Gonna throw a party at my girlfriend's loft.
Can't call her 'shortie' cause she's taller than me.
6 foot 3 in NYC for Fashion Week.
Just skipped a beat to emphasize I date models.

My friends are always telling me,
"You got gangster sensibilities".
I'm like, "DDD. I don't know what you mean.
But I'm really glad you're feelin' me".
My girlfriend, she's always sayin' to me,
"You gotta start paying utilities".
I'm like, "DDD. I don't know what you mean.
But I'm really glad you're feeling me.
I'm REALLY glad you're feeling me!"

Invite mad neighbors so we don't get rolled.
Noise violate courtesy 5-0.
Get my stuff in my room then lock the door,
So dudes in hoodies don't be stealin' my cell phone.
Wait. I think somebody stole my iPod.
Damn, somebody definitely stole my iPod.
Homeless dude on the sofa,
Or the rando dude sippin' on wine coola.

Oh yeah!

Somebody rolls up on you.
Tryin' to tell you to do some junk you aint tryin' to do.
Nuh uh. Just gotta be like, "Whatever, Man".

Duh duh duh, duh duh duh. Da da da da da da da. Duh duh duh, duh duh duh. Daba dee dah.

Like a white trash drug dealer.

Duh duh duh, duh duh duh. Daba dee dah.

Like a white drug drug dealer.

Duh duh duh, duh duh duh. Daba dee dah.
Duh duh duh, duh duh duh. Daba dee dah.

Somebody cruises up on you with some bullshit.
Just gotta be like "Whatever, Man. DDD. Peace".---Lyrics submitted by david.
