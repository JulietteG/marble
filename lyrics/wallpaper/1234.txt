Margarita salt the rim
Kick your shoes off and let me in
In the morning when we're done
Text your friends and we maybe can have some fun

And i can scoop them in the minivan
Today is playing perfect
As long as i'm not workin'

1 2 3 fuckin' hell yeah
5 6 7 8 9 times on the wayl

1 2 3 fuckin' hell yeah
5 6 7 8 grey goose lemonade

I got a paycheck and quit my job
Drinking red bull without a cause
We can party at your house
Hope your parents don't come home before we bounce

This is my time your time our time
We got it going after midnight
Drinking in the sunrise

1 2 3 4 i don't give a fuck
I 5 on it if you wanna have 6
You can find me at the 711 round 8 9 o'clock
With 10 11 dudes and my 12 inch reeboks---Lyrics submitted by Sakuon.
