When she got the news
the phone hit the floor
she fell to her knees and cried his name

He had just kissed her lips
both of the kids
their lives will never be the same
the end of her hardest day
the only words she could say was

(Chorus)
I want you to live 
I want you to love 
I want to go back to the way it was
to hear you say my name again 
I want to see your smile again,
I want you to live

It takes all of her strength 
to go through his things
it feels like shes holding him again

The letters he wrote
the books that he read and
some of the shirts still have his scent
the picture in Florida
she holds to her heart and cries out loud

I want you to live 
I want you to love 
I want to go back to the way it was
to hear you say my name again 
I want to see your smile again

Lying awake in the middle of the night
Trying not to let the kids hear her cry
She prays for an answer, some little sign
She closes her eyes 
and swears she hears him say

I want you to live 
I want you to love
I want you to go on and not give up
I want you to live 
I want you to try 
I want you to know that I'm alright
I want you to fall in love again
I want to see you smile again

I want you to live---Lyrics submitted by Sandi.
