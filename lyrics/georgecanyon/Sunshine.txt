I Believe in Life, love and true pursuit of happiness
No ones gunna tell me that a smiles ever meaningless
I find a drop of hope when the rain falls down
Even when the clouds are insisting on sticking around

I believe in holding on tight to your innocence
Taking leaps of faith when it doesnt even make sense
Dont wanna be a tear on a circus clown
I wanna laugh like a kid on the play ground

Baby come on lets go for a ride,
I know a road thatll change your mind
Look what its done to this heart of mine
Im an absolute dedicated follower of Sunshine

I used to be a slave to the ways of the shades of gray
Addicted to the weight of a ball and chain
Everybody telling me to cut it loose
Then I looked up to the sky and saw something I could use

A little bit of prayer a little bit of inspiration
A little something different like a new vibration
Shook me up like a leaf in a hurricane
Woke me up like a fall from an air plane

Baby come on lets go for a ride
I know a road thatll change your mind
Look what its done to this heart of mine
Im an absolute dedicated follower of sunshine

Yeah-eah
Oo-oo

Baby come on lets go for a ride
I know a road thatll change your mind
Look what its done to this heart of mine
Im an absolute dedicated follower of sunshine

I Believe in Life, love and true pursuit of happiness
(Absolute dedicated follower of sunshine)
Absolute dedicated follower of sunshine
