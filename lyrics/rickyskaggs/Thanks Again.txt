Ive sent bouquets For mother day
For father day a shirt and a card
And while the came from the heart 
They all fell short 
Of saying how special you both are
It wasnt till I was up and gone
Married with a couple of kids of my own
Doing what mommas and daddys do
That I realized what I must have put you through

So thanks again for the love in the cradle
And all the changes that kept me dry
Thanks again for the love at our table
And tanning my bottom when I told you a lie
For taking me fishing and flying my kite
And tucking me yes in night after night
To my beautiful live long friends 
Hey mom and daddy thanks again

I was still a young man, At least I think am
But Im watching my own hair turn gray
And your call last Sunday brought to mind
That I owe you a debt that I can never repay
So thanks again for worrying and waiting
When I starting dating on weekend nights 
Thanks again for the love at our table
And tanning my bottom when I told you a lie
Your car for the prom, your letters in Nam
And most of all daddy for marrying mom
To my beautiful lifelong friends
Hey mom and daddy Thanks again
To my beautiful lifelong friends
Hey mom and daddy Thanks again
