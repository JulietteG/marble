Listen up, turn it up and rock it out
party on, I wanna hear you scream and shout
this is real, as real as it gets
I came to get down to get some fucking respect
taking it back to a hardcore level
you better be ready, put your pedal to the metal
taking it back to a hardcore level
you better be ready, put your pedal to the metal. 

Go!!

Whoa I'll never give in
Whoa I'll never give up
Whoa I'll never give in
 I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa I'll never give in
Whoa I'll never give up
Whoa I'll never give in
 I just wanna be, wanna be loved!

I want domination
I want your submission
I see youre not resisting 
To this temptation
Ive got one confession
I love deprivation 
Ive got a jet black heart
Its all fucked up and its falling apart

Whoa I'll never give in
Whoa I'll never give up
Whoa I'll never give in
 I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa I'll never give in
Whoa I'll never give up
Whoa I'll never give in
 I just wanna be, wanna be loved!

Ive got another confession
I fell to temptation
And there is no question
There was some connection
Ive got to follow my heart
No matter how far
Ive gotta roll the dice
Never look back and never think twice

Whoa I'll never give in
Whoa I'll never give up
Whoa I'll never give in
 I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa I'll never give in
Whoa I'll never give up
Whoa I'll never give in
 I just wanna be, wanna be loved!

Take your past and burn it up and let it go
Carry on; Im stronger than youll ever know
Thats the deal; you get no respect 
Youre gonna get yours
You better watch your fucking neck   ---Lyrics submitted by fernando.
