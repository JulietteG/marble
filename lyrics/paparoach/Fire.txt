Die a little everyday
Break the silence when you say
You don't love me anymore
In my face you slam the door

Making up,
Making out
Falling in and falling out
When you kiss me like a stranger
That is when we are in danger

Fly around the fire
In and out of desire
I gotta love you
I gotta have you
Don't wanna let you down again

When I kiss you like a lover
That is when we discover
We are burning in the fire
This love will never tire
When I tell you that I need you
Please believe that I won't leave you
You're a diamond, I'm a heart
Living in this house of cards

Fly around the fire
In and out of desire
I gotta love you
I gotta have you
Don't wanna let you down again
I gotta love you
I gotta have you
Don't wanna let you down again

(music break)

Fly around the fire
In and out of desire
I gotta love you
I gotta have you
Don't wanna let you down again
The Fire
In and out of desire
I gotta love you
I gotta have you
Don't wanna let you down again 
Don't wanna let you down again
Don't wanna let you down again..---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
