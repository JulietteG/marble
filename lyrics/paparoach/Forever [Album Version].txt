in the brightest hour of my darkest day
i realized what is wrong with me
cant get over you 
cant get through to you
its been a helter-skelter romance from the start
take these memories that are haunting me
of a paper man cut into shreds 
by his own pair of scicors
he'll never fogive her
he'll never forgive her


because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever

sitting by a fire on a lonely night
hangin over from another good time
with another girl little dirty girl
you should listen to this story of a life
you're my heroin 
in this moment im lonely 
fulfilling my darkest dreams
all these drugs all these women 
im never forgiven
this broken heart of mine

because days come and go 
but my feelings for you are forever
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever

one last kiss 
before i go 
dry your tears
it is time to let you go

because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever
because days come and go
but my feelings for you are forever

one last kiss 
before i go 
dry your tears
it is time to let you go

one last kiss 
before i go
dry your tears 
it is time to let you go

one last kiss---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa.
