I woke up and i feel like shit
i dont remember last night
im getting sick of this
i hit the bottle when i got off stage
and got bitch drunk stupid 
and i went in a rage
i think i might have got in a fight 
because my knuckles were bloody
and i dont feel alright i hit the bottle 
and i dont even care you say im going to hell
but i am already there 
sick and tired of being sick and tired
i wanna be free from this ball and chain
an be free from this life of pain
an be free from this ball and chain
i wanna be free from you
now im full of guilt and shame
i cant point a fingure cause theres no one to blame
so to say ull never do it again
but when the sun goes down
you are my only friend
i think that im starting to see
i have become everything
i never wanted to be
im really getting sick of myself
cause when i look into the mirror i see sombody else
sick and tired of being sick and tired
i wanna be free from this ball and chain
an be free from this life of pain
an be free from this ball and chain
i wanna be free from you
i wanna be free from this ball and chain
an be free from this life of pain
an be free from this ball and chain
i wanna be free from you
sick and tired of being sick and tired
so sick and tired of being sick and tired
sick and tired of being sick and tired
so sick and tired of being sick and tired
i wanna be free from this ball and chain 
an be free from this life of pain
an be free from this ball and chain 
i wanna be free from you
i wanna be free from this ball and chain
an be free from this life of pain 
an be free from this ball and chain
i wanna be free from you
wanna be free from you---Lyrics submitted by adam.
