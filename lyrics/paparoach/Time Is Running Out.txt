Woaho,Woaho
Yea,Yea
Woaho,Woaho
Yea,Yea

You say Im looking really bad
You say Im looking really sick
And I dont even care I never really did
So when push comes to shove 
And I slap you in the face
Just remember one thing

When its time to feel the void 
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out 
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender

So Im out of control 
And Im out of my mind
Just remember one thing
I think Im just fine 
So catch me when I fall
I wont remember anything at all
So catch me when I fall

When its time to feel the void 
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out 
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender

Woaho,Woaho
Yea,Yea
Woaho,Woaho
Yea,Yea

When its time to feel the void 
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out 
When its time to feel the void 
My whole life has been destroyed
And everyone around me says my time is running out 
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender
I refuse to surrender...---Lyrics submitted by Benoit.
