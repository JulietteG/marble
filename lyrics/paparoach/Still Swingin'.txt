Number One, step it up
Spit the fire, I'll back it up
Count me in, now turn it up
I'm killing it, you're burning up
Never change, never break
I'm the real, you're the fake
Set it up, go underground
You feeling it, this future sound?

Non-stop - devastating everything
On Top - never coming down
I've got - my hands in everything
Non stop -- I'm never coming down

We're just living for today
Keep our light on in the haze
Yeah forever we will stay
We are the ones still swinging
We are a beacon in the dark
The lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging

I'm dangerous, passionate
Watch your back, they're stabbing it
Hold on and hold tight
I slash your faces every night
We don't belong, never will
Never kill, we always thrill
Set me off and I will attack
Cause PRoach is a new black

Non-stop - devastating everything
On Top - never coming down
I've got - my hands in everything
Non stop -- I'm never coming down

We're just living for today
Keep our light on in the haze
Yeah forever we will stay
We are the ones still swinging
We are a beacon in the dark
The lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging

We're the ones still swinging (ones still swinging)

Non-stop - devastating everything
On Top - never coming down
I've got - my hands in everything
Non stop -- I'm never coming down

We're just living for today
Keep our light on in the haze
Yeah forever we will stay
We are the ones still swinging
We are a beacon in the dark
The lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swinging ---
