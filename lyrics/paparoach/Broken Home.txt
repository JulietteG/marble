Broken home
All alone 
Broken home
All alone

I can't seem to fight these feelings
I'm caught in the middle of this
And my wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
I wish I had someone to talk to
Someone I could confide in
I just wanna know the truth
I just wanna know the truth
Want to know the truth

Broken home
I'm All alone

I know my mother loves me
But does my father even care
If I'm sad or angry
You were never ever there
When I needed you
I hope you regret what you did
I think I know the truth
Your father did the same to you
Did the same to you

I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
Crying day and night now
What is wrong with me
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
A weaklin

Broken home
All alone

It feels bad to be alone
Crying by yourself, living in a broken home
How could I tell it so all y'all could feel it
Depression strikes hard just like my old earth would tell it
To me, her son, she told me I'm the one
Pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
Stories that I tell are nonfiction
And you can't take it back cause it's already done

BROKEN HOME
BROKEN HOME

Can't seem to fight these feelings
Caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
Stuck in between my parents
