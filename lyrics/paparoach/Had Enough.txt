Turn the channel on the t.v, another boy, shot tonight.
I can't believe what i am seeing, a body bag, a mother cries.
it seems like this is never ending , I've had enough, so i decide,
the time has come for me to face it. i can't refuse the war inside.

'cause we have had enough, all the violence has touched
every part of our lives, our innocence is gone tonight.

I don't know if i can hide it, i know the truth, its only lies.
The president will deny it, the body count, a steady rise.
in my head there is a riot, to change the world, so no one dies.
the time has come for us to fight it, we can't refuse, the war inside.

'cause we have had enough, all the violence has touched
every part of our lives, our innocence is gone tonight.
'cause we have had enough! all the violence has touched
every part of our lives, our innocence is gone tonight!!

I know, that you, can change the future.
I know, that you, can make it happen.
in my head there is a riot. and i dont think that i can fight it!!

'cause we have had enough, all the violence has touched
every part of our lives, our innocence is gone tonight.
'cause we have had enough! all the violence has touched
every part of our lives, our innocence is gone tonight!!

we have had enough... we have had enough... we have had enough...---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
