my words are weapons
 in which I murder you with
please don't be scared 
please do not turn your head 
we are the future the 21st century dyslexic 
glue sniffing cyber sluts 
with homicidal minds and hand guns

we are insane 
nothing will change 
 we are insane
nothing will change

(chorus)
there is a thin line between what is good
and what is evil
and I will tiptoe down that line
but .. I will feel unstable
my life is a circus and I am 
trippin down that tightrope 
well there is nothing to save me now so 
I will not look down 

there's no beginning 
there is no end 
there is only change
progression backwards 
is this where we 
are heading 
take back your soul 
forget your emptiness

(chorus)

i speak of madness 
my heart and soul 
I cry for people 
who aint got control
lets take our sanity
lets take compassion 
and be responsible 
for every action 
hell no 
no how 
no way no way no way no how 
no way no how

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
