There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit, take my money, take my obsession

I just wanna be heard, loud and clear are my words, comin from within man
Tell em what you heard, it's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind, you can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession, diamond rings get you nothin but a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin, you're a slave to the system
Workin jobs that you hate, for that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed, step back and see
Stop thinkin bout yourself, start thinkin bout

There's no money, there's no possession, only obsession, I don't need that shit 
Take my money, take my possession, take my obsession, I don't need that

Cuz everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul, flip it inside out
It's a big black hole, take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never gonna fill the void, take it away 
And learn the best lesson, the heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possession, only obsession, I don't need that shit 
Take my money, take my possession, take my obsession, I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession, present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair, clock in, you just can't win, just can't win
And the things you own, own you nooooww!

Take my money, take my possession, take my obsession, I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possession, fuck your obsession, I don't need that shit
Money, possession, obsession, I don't need that shit---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
