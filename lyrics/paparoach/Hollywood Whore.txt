Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor,
I'm sorry but the party's over...

Cocaine nose and trendy clothes
Gotta send her to rehab.
She found out she's got no soul
But it really doesn't bother her.
White trash queen, American dream,
Oh what a role model.
Throwing a fit
Making a scene,
Like no tomorrow.

Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor,
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town
Is she's going down
I'm sorry but the party's over NOW.

Awake by noon
Drunk by four.
Sucked up in the showbiz.
Your so lame
Your such a bore.
I wanna kick your teeth in.
Plastic smile to match your style,
We can tell you got a face lift.
You're so vain oh so vile,
You're a number one hit.

Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor,
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town
Is she's going down.
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The cameras are gone,
And nobody screams.
She couldn't survive her fifteen minutes of fame.
Her friends are all gone
She's going insane
She'll never survive without the money and fame.
...It's all going down the drain....

Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor,
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town
Is she's going down.
I'm sorry but the party's over!

Hollywood whore
Passed out on the floor,
I'm sorry but the party's over.
The talk of the town
Is she's going down
I'm sorry but the party's over.

WAKE UP
The party's over
WAKE UP
The party's over
WAKE UP
The party's over
WAKE UP
The party's over NOW.

Hahahaha Don't let the door
Hit ya where the good Lord
