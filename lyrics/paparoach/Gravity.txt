I was there on the day truth died
Blood on my hands, throw 'em up on the sky
I was the number one sinner, no rest
My life was a lie, and my wish was a death
I fell in love with the ways of the world
Money, the fame, the booze, the girls
But I couldn't stay faithful, if I've tried
I turned into a devil, you could see it in my eyes
I blacked out, told you everything I ever did
I couldn't take all the lies I was living with
I broke your heart, woke up the next day
My bag its outside, yellin' get the hell away
You're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
And you cant never change all the things that you did
That's when I knew it, it wouldn't last
You never get away, when you're running from the past

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die, to love another day
We rise again, and loose our gravity

I'm a broken man, I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell that I'm living in
And I cant escape it, this is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
You tore me down, wish that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push away, you only pull me closer
Its only over when we both wanna say its over
I gotta change this is not who I am
I wanna start over wanna try this again
You're everything I need, everything I'm not
So pull the trigger give me one more shot

You love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up just to watch and support me
You promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
Don't matter what you say, I don't know truth from the lies
I helped you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through them
What the hell have we thought, we always knew
You will bleed for me and I will bleed for you

Baby, we can float away---
