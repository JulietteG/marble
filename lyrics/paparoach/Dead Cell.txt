Born with no soul
lack of control
cut from the mold to the anti-social
plug them in and turn them on
process the data
make yourself the bomb

what is your target
what is your reason
do you have emotions
is your heart freezing
seizing this opportunity to speak
ya didn't say nothin' but turn your fucking cheek

dead cell!
dead cell!

sick in the head
living but dead
hear what i said
learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah nutty warrior
nothin's scarier

kids are gettin' sick like malaria
situation gets harrier
throwing up all types of barriers
i'm tellin' ya
the kids are gettin' singled out
let me hear the dead cells shout

dead cell!
dead cell!

born with no soul
lack of control
cut from the mold to the anti-social
plug them in and turn them on
process the data
make yourself the bomb

no soul
no control
cut from the mold to the anti-social
plug them in and turn them on
process the data
make yourself the bomb

stop pointing fingers
cus' we all are guilty
of clean cut lines
and the truth that's filthy
believe what is the root of the word
out comes lie when it's cut into thirds

i don't believe what my eyes behold
NO!
i don't believe what my ears are told
NO!
seizin' this opportunity to speak
i'm sayin' something
don't turn your fuckin' cheek

dead cell! 
dead cell!

born with no soul
lack of control
cut from the mold to the anti-social
plug them in and turn them on
process the data 
make yourself the bomb

no soul
no control
cut from the mold to the anti-social
plug them in and turn them on
process the data
make yourself the bomb

Dead
Cell
Dead
Cell!!!!!!!
dead cell
