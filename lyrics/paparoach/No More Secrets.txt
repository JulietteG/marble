I live the days of war
I live the nights of love
I suffer to survive
I gotta, gotta, gotta stay alive
I hear the battle cries
Their fists are in the sky
I know what I'm fighting for...

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

This is a call to arms
It's time to go to war
It's time to rant and rave
Gotta, gotta, gotta make a change
Down on the devil street
Is where everybody meets
I know what I'm fighting for...

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

Yeah!
What does around comes around, baby!
You'll get yours one day, that's right!

I want it all, I want it now!
Make no mistake, give it to me straight...

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies
Lies, lies, lies!

No more secrets, no more lies
See right through your alibis
Take a look into my eyes
No more secrets, no more lies

Yeah!
What goes around comes around, baby!
You'll get yours one day, that's right!---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
