It feels like I'm looking at life 
Through the telescope because I'm so high 
And the ground never seemed so far away 
Truth shall be told one day 
I'll be under ground one day 

I've got a woman 
That'll put roses on my grave 
I've got a woman 
That'll put roses on my grave 
Roses on my grave 

Feels like I'm looking at life 
Through the telescope because I'm so high 
And the ground never seemed so far away 
Truth shall be told one day 
I'll be under ground one day 

I've got a woman 
That'll put roses on my grave 
I've got a woman 
That'll put roses on my grave 
I've got a woman 
That'll put roses on my grave 
I've got a woman 
That'll put roses on my grave 
Roses on my grave 

Don't forget me 
Don't forget me 
Please, forgive me 
Don't forget me 

It's my redemption (time for redemption) 
Time for redemption (it's my redemption) 
It's my redemption (time for redemption) 
Time for redemption 

I'll see you on the other side 
I'm waiting on the other side 
I'll see you on the other side 
I'm waiting on the other side---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
