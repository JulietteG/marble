I got a one-way ticket on a hell-bound train 
With nothing to lose and nothing to gain 
Nobody ever taught me how to live 
I'm feeling like I'm lost- like I'll never be found 
I'm twisted and I'm turned around 
Nobody ever taught me how to love 

I'm hurting everybody 
I'm hurting myself 
I'm desperate 

So what do you do 
When it all comes down on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

So what do you do 
When it all comes down on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

If you were to tell me that I'd die today 
This is what I'd have to say 
I never really had the time to live 
And if you were to give me just another chance 
Another life, another dance 
All I really wanna do is love 

I'm hurting everybody 
I'm hurting myself 
I'm desperate 

But what do you do 
When it all comes down on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

So what do you do 
When it all comes down on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

When all is said and done 
You could be the one 
With open arms and open eyes 
You're jumping off the edge 
And hoping you can fly 
Accept your fate for what it is 
Into the great unknown
Yeah!

So what do you do 
When it all comes down on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

So what do you do 
When it all comes down on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

So what do you do 
When it's all turned around on you? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

So what do you do? 
What do you do? 
What do you do? 
Do you run and hide 
Or face the truth? 

Got a one-way ticket on a hell-bound train 
With nothing to lose and nothing to gain...---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
