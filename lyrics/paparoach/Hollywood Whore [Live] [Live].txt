Hollywood whore 
Passed out on the floor 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

Cocaine nose and trendy clothes 
Gotta send her to rehab 
She found out she's got no soul 
But it really doesn't bother her 

White trash queen, American dream 
Oh what a role model 
Throwing a fit, making a scene 
Like no tomorrow 

Hollywood whore 
Passed out on the floor 
Can't take it no more 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

The talk of the town 
And she's going down 
I'm sorry but the party's over 
No-o-ow 

Awake by noon, drunk by four 
Sucked up in the showbiz 
Your so lame, your such a bore 
I wanna kick your teeth in 

Plastic smile to match your style 
We can tell you got a face lift 
You're so vain, you're so vile 
You're a number one hit 

Hollywood whore 
Passed out on the floor 
Can't take it no more 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

The talk of the town, 
And she's going down 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

The cameras are gone 
And nobody screams 
She couldn't survive her fifteen minutes of fame 

Her friends are all gone, 
She's going insane 
She'll never survive without the money and fame 

It's all going down the drain 

Hollywood whore 
Passed out on the floor 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

The talk of the town, 
And she's going down 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

Hollywood whore 
Passed out on the floor 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

The talk of the town, 
And she's going down 
I'm sorry but the party's over 

Wake up, the party's over 
Wake up, the party's over 
Wake up, the party's over 
Wake up, the party's over 
No-o-ow 

Ha-ha-ha 
Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya honey 
Ha-ha-ha ---Lyrics submitted by Liam.
