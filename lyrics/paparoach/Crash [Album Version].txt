I refuse to be your victim
I refuse to be your slave 
I keep on burning my bridges 
I keep on fucking up everything 

Running from desperation
God knows where I've been 
I don't know where I'm headed 
But I'm going too fast, I think I'm going to crash 

I'm going to crash 
I'm going to crash, to crash 

It is time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal 
No time for his hesitation
Time to be an animal 

Looking at my reflection
I don't like what I see 
So I ask myself a question 
Do I got what i want or do I got what i need? 

I'm not afraid of the future 
Of spinning right out of control 
I don't know where I'm headed 
But I'm going too fast, I think I'm going to crash 

I'm going to crash 
I'm going to crash, to crash 

It is time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal 
No time for his hesitation
Time to be an animal 

It is time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal 
No time for his hesitation
Time to be an animal 

I refuse to be a victim
I don't want to fall again 
I know where I'm headed 
God knows where I've been... 

I'm going to crash (I'm going to crash)
I'm going to crash (I'm going to crash)
I'm going to crash (I'm going to crash)
I'm going to crash (I'm going to crash)

Yeah!

It is time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal 
No time for his hesitation
Time to be an animal 

It is time for annihilation
It's time to be a criminal 
No time for his hesitation
Time to be an animal 

Live- love- life! 
Live- love- fight!
Live- love- life! 
Live- love- fight!---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
