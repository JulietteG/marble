So full
So warm
Like being dried out
After the storm
Oooooooo huh

New birth
Running, running through my veins
Looks like that clear day finally came
Feeling highhhhhhh
Awwww
Ooooo
So so satisfied

This must be
Must be all there is
Cause only love brings with it joy and tears

Yeah
Listen
I, I wont try
I wont try to understand
There I surrender allllll into your hands
Ooooo
Feeling high
Aw, shucks
So so satisfied

ooooooooo
Yeahhhhhhh

Feeling high
So so satisfied

Heyyyyyy
Hey, hey, hey, heyyyyyy---Lyrics submitted by wendie dixon.
