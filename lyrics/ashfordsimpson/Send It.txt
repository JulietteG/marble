Ever wonder what happens when we cease to try and understand the ways of nature, the natural intent of what life was meant to be.

Ever consider the consequences of thinking you do, and all your ways get in the way of what you were actually meant to see.

So why don't give it another try, if you get the chance, send your romance to the outer limits.  Send it home, where it belongs.

Send it up, see if it'll go.
Send it up, see if it'll show you how you should love.---Lyrics submitted by Ovalla Jobe.
