And the sky was made of amethyst
And all the stars look just like little fish
You should learn when to go
You should learn how to say no

Might last a day yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Well mine is forever

When they get what they want they never want it again
When they get what they want they never want it again

Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything take everything take everything I want you to

And the sky was all violet
I wanna give the violet more violence
Hey, I'm the one with no soul
One above and one below

Go on, take everything take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything take everything I dare you to

I told you from the start just how this would end
When I get what I want I never want it again

Go on, take everything take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything I want you to
Go on take everything take everything take everything take everything---Lyrics submitted by Tasha Hill.
