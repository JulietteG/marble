I walked ten thousand miles, ten thousand miles to see you
And every gasp of breath I grabbed it just to find you
I climbed up every hill to get, to you
I wondered ancient lands to hold, just you
And every single step of the way
I pay
Every single night and, day
I searched for you
through sand storms
and hazy dawns
I reached for you


I stole ten thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds to see you
I robbed convenient stores cause I though they'd make it easier
I lived off rats and toads and I starved for you
I fought off giant bears and I killed them too
And every single step of the way
I pay
Every single night and, Day
I searched for you
Through sand storms 
and Hazy dawns I reached for you
I'm tired and I'm weak, but I'm strong for you
I want to go home, but my love gets me through
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la....
la
