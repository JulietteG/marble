If you're down on your luck, don't get down on yourself
It won't do you no good
'Cause I've been there before, fought a hundred wars
And I'm still fighting for you

Elouise, why'd you leave?
Please confess, confess to me.
Sing my song, patiently
And I'll return, my Elouise.

Let's be Alison,
Let's be David Burn
Let's all learn how to dance
Move your feet in time
Put your hand in mine
We will waltz once again.

Elouise, why'd you leave?
Please confess, confess to me.
Sing my song, patiently
And I'll return, my Elouise.

Elouise, why'd you leave?
Please confess, confess to me.
Song my song, graciously
We will waltz, Elouise. ---
