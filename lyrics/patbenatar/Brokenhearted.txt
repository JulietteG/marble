I see them everyday theyre like shadows
Trying to run from the pain
But you know the pain it always follows
So theres nowhere to go, not really

Sometimes I want to touch them
Try and set them free
But Im afraid I might know them
Or they will recognize me, they will recognizeme

Chorus:
Where do they come from, the brokenhearted?
Do they travel alone when they carry their fate
Do they try to return from where they started
Do they disappear without a trace
Look into the eyes of those who know
Can you tell me, where do they go?

Is there a place that they go to
Thats for them alone
Where memories are sacred
And heartache has no home
I see them there in the moonlight
Searching for a sign
There love is out there waiting
Waiting for the right time, waiting for the righttime

Chrous:

The power of love, gives them strength to carry on
Evvvverrrrrywhere they gooooooooo
MmmmmmmmHmmmmmmm

Guitar Solo:

Where do they go, the brokenhearted?
Do they travel alone when they carry their fate
Do they try to return to where they started
Do they disappear without a trace
Look into the eyes of those who know
Can you tell me, where do they go?
Where do they go, the brokenhearted?
Do they travel alone when they carry their fate
Do they try to return to where they started
Do they disappear without a trace
Look into the eyes of those who know
Where do go, the brokenhearted?
Do they travel alone
Where do they go, the brokenhearted..oooohh
Where do they go---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
