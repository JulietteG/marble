Be Brave, Be Brave, Be Brave, Be Brave

Mmmmhmmm, yeahhh ehhhhhh

I remember the night when destiny finally found us
I remember the holdin on,  the stars were crashing all around us
We thought that the world was endin you it that wasnt true
Cause I still love you, I still love you

Chorus:
Ill be brave for you
And every day I pray for you
We can be strong in each others arms
And Ill be brave, Ill be brave for you

I know that youre afraid, you know that Im afraid too
But you gotta have faith you gotta listen to what your heart is telling you
You know that Loves a funny thing, you just gotta let it be,
Like you and me, you and me

Chorus:

Just look at the sky above us,
Let the sun shine down on us
Stand with me here together
In the light of the now and forever
MmmmmmmmYeaheaaheeahhhhhh

We can be strong in each others arms
Baby hold tight, its gonna be alright
Whatever you do, Ill still love you
