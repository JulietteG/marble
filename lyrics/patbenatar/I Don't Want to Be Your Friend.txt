Did you see me last night?
I was there in the dark
I saw her look at you, the way I used to do, when I still had your heart

I watched you take her hand
There was love in your eyes
I remember when you looked at me that way too, before we said goodbye

Chorus:
I dont want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
I dont think I can pretend, that you mean nothing to me
Its hard enough to say goodbye
even when you know its over
I dont what to be your friend, I want to be your lover

Am I gone from your thoughts,
forgotten somehow?
When you lie there with her, does my memory stir any part of you know

I know that I should concede,
face the truth and all that
I know I should realize, Im not part of your life, anymore, but I cant

Cause I dont want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
I dont think I can pretend, that you mean nothing to me
Its hard enough to say goodbye
even when you know its over
I dont want to be your friend, I want to be your lover

And when I think Ive hurt enough
And I just cant stand the pain
I reminisce about the way it felt to have you everyday
You know that every time I hear your voice, I still get a thrill

(Spoken) And theres nothing I can do about it

Oooooohhhhhh
I dont want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
I dont think I can pretend, that you mean nothing to me
Its hard enough to say goodbye
Even when you know its over
I dont want to be your friend, I want to be your lover
I dont want to be your friend, I want to be your lover
I dont want to be your friend, I want to be youroooohhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
