People like to shake you off and put you down 
Run you all around, drive you crazy
Like to steal the roses right out of your bed
Get inside your head, drive you crazy

Never really knew what love could be, yeah yeah yeah
Never really thought about you and me yaeh yeah yeah
Crazy, I really wanna go crazy
Feel like Im gonna go crazy
Ohh Ohhh Ohhh, crazy
Crazy, I really wanna go crazy
Feel like Im gonna go crazy

Everybody tells you how you ought to be
What they think they see
They cant teach you no
Big welt on your shoulder it dont mean a thing
If thats all they see,
Hey it dont eat you, noo 

Never really knew what love, yeahh eahh eahhh
Only want to think about you and me yeaahhh ehhh
Crazy, I really wanna go crazy
Feel like Im gonna go crazy
Oh Oh OH, crazy
I really wanna go crazy
Feel like Im gonna go crazy

Crazy,  crazy
Hey baby, baby, Whooo oohhh, Whewww
