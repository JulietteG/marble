I'm the one you put all your stories on
She's the one you're keeping a secret from
She believes you
Just like I did at the start
When you wrapped up my heart
And played with my emotions

Tell it to her
Cause I don't wanna hear it
Tell it to her
I know why she would
There's a fool born every minute
When you're in it
It feels so good
Why don't ya tell it to her

She don't know the darker side of you
She don't know what your love will put her through
Your sweet talkin'
Makes her feel so safe and sure
But that won't change what you are
And I'm the one who knows it

Tell it to her
Cause I don't wanna hear it
Tell it to her
I know why she would
There's a fool born every minute
When you're in it
It feels so good
Why don't ya tell it to her
Cause I don't wanna hear it
Tell it to her
I know why she would
There's a fool born every minute
When you're in it 
It feels so good

You're the one who had it all and wanted more
But you can't do it to me anymore

Tell it to her
Cause I don't wanna hear it
Tell it to her
I know why she would
There's a fool born every minute
When you're in it
It feels so good
Why don't ya tell it to her
Cause I don't wanna hear it
Tell it to her
I don't wanna hear it
Tell it to her
Go on and tell it to her
Tell it to her
There's a fool born every minute
Tell it to her
Go on and tell it to her
Tell it to her---Lyrics submitted by T.J..
