Well you're the real tough cookie
With the long history
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me
That's OK,
Lets see how you do it
Put up your dukes,
Lets get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire Away

You come on with a "come on"
You don't fight fair
But that's OK, see if I care
Knock me down, it's all in vain
I'll get right back on my feet again

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire Away

Well, you're the real tough cookie
With the long history
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me
Before I put another notch
In my lipstick case
You better make sure
You put me in my place

Hit me with your best shot
Come On, hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire Away

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire Away---
