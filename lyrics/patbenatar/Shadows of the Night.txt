Were running with the shadows of the night,
So baby take my hand we'll be alright
Surrender all your dreams to me, to night
They'll come true in the end...
[chorus]

I said oh world, it's a cold world,
When you keep it all to yourself.
I said you can't hide, on the inside,
All the pain you ever felt.

Enter my heart but baby dont look back,
Cause we got no pride in that...

[chorus]

You know some times, it feels like,
Its all movin way to fast.
Use every alibi, and words you deny,
That love ain't meant to last.
You can cry tough baby, it's alright
You can let me down easy, but not tonight.

[chorus x2]

And now the hands of time are standin' still,
Midnight angel, won't you say you will.

[chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Glenn Olson.
