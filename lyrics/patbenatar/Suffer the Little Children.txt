Sweet Melissa I often pray for you
I hope your suffering was brief
I hope the angels that watch over all little children
Came for you and took you some place beautiful and sweet

Suffer the little children

Dear Melissa I often think of you
Every time I hold my baby in my arms
I say a prayer for your momma and daddy too
I know they miss you, miss you since you're gone

Suffer the little children
At the hands of evil men
No baby dolls no teddy bears
No lullabies for them
Every mother's nightmare will it ever end
Suffer the little children
At the hands of evil men

You who done the deed better do some praying too
Better hope that God's forgiven like they say
Cause somewhere sombody keeps a list
Of the evils that me do
And your name's right up there
I heard then say

Suffer the little children
At the hands of evil men
No baby dolls no teddy bears
No lullabies for them
Every mother's nightmare will it ever end
Suffer the little children
At the hands of evil men---Lyrics submitted by b0b.
