It seems I loved you for so long
It seems, like all of my life
Just like a child who doesnt belong
Who longing to be by my side became your shadow
And I know you better that I know myself, you know
So why pretend you had somewhere else to go?

Chorus:
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say
Then I watched you plead all the truth away
Somewhere in my heart, theres a place I know
Where all our little dirty secrets go

Nobodys perfect, certainly not us
Weve all.got secrets to keep
I wanna drudge your safe in my heart
Even Id always know where to find me

And I hate you in your innocence, you know
But I hate myself even more for lovin you so

Sometimes I believed, what you had to say
Then I watched you plead all the truch away
Somewhere in my heart, theres a place I know
Where all our little dirty secrets go

Sometimes it hurts so bad that you cry
In those are times you wish you had died
Sometimes the truth is worse than the liesometimes

Sometimes its best to lock it away
In a place thats secret and safe
Sometimes you just pretend you dont know
Sometimes its best to let go

Sometimes I believed, what you had to say
Then I watched you plead all the truth away
Somewhere in my heart, theres a place I know
Where all our little dirty secrets go.
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say
Then I watched you plead all the truth away
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know
Where all our little dirty secrets go.
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say
Then I watched you plead all the truth away
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know
Where all our little dirty secrets go.

Oh oh, oh oh oh a oh
