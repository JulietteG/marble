You think that youre the second coming
Sorry to say, it doesnt do it for me
Must be drag, when youre so stunning
and all that you are, and all that you hope to

Chorus:
You can have it all, take it all, break it all, forsake it all
Want it all, choose it all, use it with no stake at all
Keep it all, trash it all, lead it just like sheep it all
Hate it all, love it all, and still youd have nothin, yeahh yeahhh

You think that you can walk on water
Better be careful it gets mighty deep
Id be afraid of what my thoughts were
You never know whod be willing to make that

You can have it all, take it all, break it all, forsake it all
Want it all, choose it all, use it with no stake at all
Keep it all, trash it all, lead it just like sheep it all
Hate it all, love it all, and still youd have nothin

When you look in the mirror, does it get any clearer
Or are you blinded by your own visions
Or have you ever thought, that maybe you were wrong
Or do you just reside in your Illusion

Gutitar Solo:

You can have it all, take it all, break it all, forsake it all
Want all, choose it all, use it with no stake at all
Keep it all, trash it all, lead it just like sheep it all
Hate it all, love it all, and still youd have nothing
You can have it all, take it all, break it all, forsake it all
Want it all, choose it all, use it with no stake at all
Keep it all, trash it all, lead it just like sheep it all
Hate it all, love it all, and still youd have nothing
You can have it all, take it all, break it all, forsake it all
Want it all, choose it all, use it with no stake at all
Keep it all, trash it all, lead it just like sheep it all
Hate it all, love it all, and still youd have nothing
Oh. Oh. Oh.. Oh, Oh, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, Oh
Oh. Oh..Oh.. Oh, Oh, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, Oh 
Oh. Oh. Oh.. Oh, Oh, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, Oh
Oh. Oh..Oh.. Oh, Oh, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, Oh, Oh---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
