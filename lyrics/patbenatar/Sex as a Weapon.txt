You really do know how to strut that stuff
You really do know how to act tough
Your body's just like a centerfold
A fantasy, anyone would want to hold

Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon

You know you're already my obsession
Stop using sex as a weapon
Love is more than a one way reflection
Stop using sex as a weapon

With looks that kill and a mind that's twisted
I don't know why I can't resist it
I tell myself, look the other way
When you want me to, I, I always stay

Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon

You know you're already my obsession
Stop using sex as a weapon
Love is more than a one way reflection
Stop using sex as a weapon

You play with desire like it was a toy
How much affection can you destroy?
You wrap my heart around your little finger
Sex, sex, sex as a weapon

Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon

You know you're already my obsession
Stop using sex as a weapon
Love is more than a one way reflection
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon

Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex

Stop using sex
Stop using sex
Using sex as a weapon, as a weapon---
