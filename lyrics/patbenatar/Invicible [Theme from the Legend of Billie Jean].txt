This bloody road remains a mystery
This sudden darkness fills the air
What are we waitin for?
Wont anybody help us, what are we waitin for?

We cant afford to be innocent, stand up and face the enemy
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible

This shattered dream you cannot justify
Were gonna scream until were satisfied
What are we runnin for?
Weve go the right to be angry. What are we runnin for
When theres nowhere we can run to anymore?

We cant afford to be innocent, stand up and face the enemy
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible
And with the power of conviction, there is no sacrifice
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible

Solo:

Wont anybody help us? What are we runnin for
When theres nowhere, nowhere we can run to anymore?
We cant afford to be innocent, stand up and face the enemy
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible
And with the power of conviction, there is no sacrifice
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible

Yeaah Yeahhh Yeahhhh
Oooh Oooh Ooohh
Yeah Yeahhh Yeahhhh
Yeah Yeaah Yeaah
Oooh Oooh Oooh

(Fading Out)
We cant afford to be innocent, stand up and face the enemy
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible
We cant afford to be innocent, stand up and face the enemy
Its a do or die situation, we will be invincible---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
