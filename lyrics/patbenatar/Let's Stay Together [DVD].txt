People walkin' 'round, all lost and confused
Ready to throw their lives out in the gutter
Ain't no love between 'em, father to son
Man to woman, brother to brother

You and me we move, in opposite directions
Like two spheres on their separate planes
Ain't nobody loved me better than you done
So why can't we just find a way to, stay together?
(Live)

Let's stay together, life's too hard to make it all alone
An' peace and harmony don't come in packages with bows
An' true love ain't somethin' you find layin' around
Don't you know, let's stay together

Let's stay together, let's stay together

Mothers don't you turn your backs on your children
Children don't you leave the family
Ain't no point in livin', life all by yourself
So why can't we just find a way to, stay together?
(Live)

Let's stay together, life's too hard to make it all alone
An' peace and harmony don't come in packages with bows
An' true love ain't somethin' you find layin' around
Don't you know, let's stay together

Let's stay together, life's too hard to make it all alone
An' peace and harmony don't come in packages with bows
An' true love ain't somethin' you find layin' around
Don't you know, let's stay together

Let's stay together, let's stay together
Let's stay together, let's stay together
Let's stay together

Yeah, peace and love and war and hate
Something's best and something just to get away

Let's stay together, let's stay together
Let's stay together, let's stay together
Let's stay together, let's stay together
Let's stay together---
