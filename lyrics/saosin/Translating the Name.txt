Oh Start Saving Green And Before Breathing
I Have Your Voice On Tape In A Southern Accent, Screaming At Me
I Was Only One, And We Weren't Prepared For One (Before Dreaming)
I Have Your Voice On Tape In A Southern Accent, Screaming At Me

Now Things Look Lovely To You, Holding Back, Now And Forever Sweetheart
Now Things Look Lovely, Lonely Boy, It's Midnight And I'll Deny
You Were Walkin So Peculiar Like (Still So Deadly) You Had Somethin To Hide
You Were Walkin So Peculiar Like (Still So Deadly!!) You Had Somethin To Hide
Sweet Penance For A Sound, It Might Explode In Our Hands

Boredered In A Brown Pigmentation Of
Where The Element Lines Cut Short, Turned In And Stopped
I've Been Watching, Rose Give In and I Then Started, Savoring Sound
I've Been Watching, Rose Give In To It, Severing The Ties Between Mother And Son
I've Been Watching, Rose Give In To It, Severing The Ties Between Mother And Son!!

Now Things Look Lovely To You, Holding Back, Now And Forever Sweetheart
Now Things Look Lovely, Lonely Boy, It's Midnight And I'll Deny
You Were Walkin So Peculiar Like (Still So Deadly) You Had Somethin To Hide
You Were Walkin So Peculiar Like (Still So Deadly!!) You Had Somethin To Hide
Sweet Penance For A Sound, It Might Explode In Our Hands
It Might Explode!!!
Sweet Penance For A Sound, It Might Explode In Our Hands
It Might Explode!!!!!

Oh, I Once Saw Many Place The End
I Promised The World And A Dozen Roses
Oh, I Once Saw Many Place The End
