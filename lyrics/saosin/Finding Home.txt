if only i had truthfully seen,
that night we'll never relive
but you and i could not go and walk away
just close your eyes
you'll never see me crashing down
i see where we had common doubt
i'd be lonely if you weren't so proud

i have seen so many loving faces
they turn back and leave with looks of regret
the road goes and i am finding home in it

But you and i should not play those games
the world is coming to an end
it's just the way i see my face
and i could never believe
(now i can see it)
now i see where things are turning 'round
and i'd be lonely if you weren't so proud

i have seen so many loving faces
they turn back and leave with looks of regret
the road goes and i am finding home in it
the road goes and i am finding home in it

i saw him fly
he's never looked this way
i saw in his eyes
he's never coming down

i have seen so many loving faces
they turn back and leave with looks of regret
the road goes and i am finding home in it
the road goes and i am finding home in it
the road goes and i am finding home in it
[and now you're finally home]
and i am finding home in it
[and now we're finally home]
and i am finding home in it---Lyrics submitted by Brick.
