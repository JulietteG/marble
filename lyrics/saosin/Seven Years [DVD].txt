Taking on seven years the holy ghost had left alone 
Test my arms, kick like crazy, Ive been trying way too long. 
Only push the way off to fight you 
Now Im sorry, Im sorry, Im not sure 
Getting off my chest, the story ends. 

I would find a way without
tell him his eyes see too clear 
I would find a way without you 
tell him his eyes see too clear

that mistake was gold cuz I know
without you, is something that I could never do 
That was right, staple the eyes and seven dates for me to 
Sell machines and tear on 

Seven years, you assured me that Id be fine if I complied 
only push the way off to fight you 
(only push the way off to fight you)
Now Im sorry, Im sorry, Im not sure 
Getting off my chest, the story ends. 

I would find a way without
tell him his eyes see too clear
I would find a way without you
tell him his eyes see too clear

that mistake was gold cuz I know
without you is something that I could never do 
That was why, step on the cold and seven dates for me to 
Sell machines and tear on 

Dont treat me Im to blame 
(I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not sure)
Dont treat me like I ever accused you 
(I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not sure)(x5)---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
