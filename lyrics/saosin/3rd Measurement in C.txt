Taking back, overdone 
Free and safely 
Souvenirs, out of style 
Right in front and right on 
Do it so, I'll be mad, you'll be gone 

And I've said that you've been golden on my bed
Tango with daddy and separate only 
Smile my only rights of passage 

Only you, mark my words 
Upon the stage you strike off 
To get engaged in California 

And I've said that you've been golden on my bed
Tango with daddy and separate only 
Smile my only rights of passage 

Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose 
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose 
I want to know 
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose 
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose 
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose 
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose---Lyrics submitted by Roni.
