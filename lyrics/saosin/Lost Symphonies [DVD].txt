To install the notion that I divided by I
Replace the occasion to speak
I'm not the only lonely one

Until I decide to take my watch off, I still believe that we 
Were just a matter of time, stop getting older everyday, shout for shout's sake

Siren siren, don't do this dance in my ear, 
In fact, I've already lost it all
Do a deadly dance all I've asked for is so little
I've already lost it all

If I decide to sever the plates below
The shore would separate and find only seven plates again
Until I decide to take my watch off, I still believe that we 
Were just a matter of time, stop getting older everyday, shout for shout's sake

Siren siren, don't do this dance in my ear, 
In fact, I've already lost it all
Do a deadly dance all I've asked for so little
I've already lost it...

Before commemorating I hope you still believe
Before commemorating ten feet tall and separate the bow 
Before commemorating I hope you still believe
Before commemorating ten feet tall and separate the bow 
Before commemorating I hope you still believe

(if i decide to sever the plates below, the shore would seperate and find only seven plates again oh i hope you still believe)---Lyrics submitted by Roni.
