Taking back, overdone
Free and safely
Souvenirs, out of style
Right in front and right on
do it so, I'll be mad, you'll be gone

And I'm sad that you'll be gold upon
on my bed
tango with daddy and separate only
smile my only right to passage

Only you, mark my words
upon the stage you strike off
to get engaged in California

And I'm sad that you'll be gold upon
on my bed
tango with daddy and separate only
smile my only right to passage

Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
I want to know
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose
Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose---Lyrics submitted by BLOODb3rryy.
