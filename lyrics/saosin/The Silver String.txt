Who holds the silver string
Lost me to staggered motion
When you run away
Whoever changes shape
Slowing oscillation
I see you there

Alternate the day (and let go)
Scream the last charade and let it be (and safeguard)
The fragment that anchors it all (into the wall)
Separate the wave (let it go)
Drown inside the shade and let it go (and safeguard)
The vision that anchors it all (into the wall)

And I'm forgetting everything you said
For you to bounce right back
Pick up right where you left off
When you run away
Whoever took my place
Slowing oscillation
I see you there
(And how it seemed I should be reborn)

Alternate the day (and let go)
Scream the last charade and let it be (and safeguard)
The fragment that anchors it all (into the wall)
Separate the wave (let it go)
Drown inside the shade and let it go (and safeguard)
The vision that anchors it all (into the wall)

In the outline there's a test
Where it all gets settled in
There's no structure to my atrophy (Oh)
There's a padlock on the chest
Where it all gets hidden in
There's no pattern to my apathy (Oh)
There's impostors in my atrophy (Oh)
There's no structure to my apathy (Oh)

Alternate the day (and let go)
Scream the last charade and let it be (and safeguard)
The fragment that anchors it all (into the wall)
Separate the wave (let it go)
Drown inside the shade and let it go (and safeguard)
The vision that anchors it all (INTO THE WALL!)---
