We've had one chance to take back
But over and over again
(I'll clean your wounds tonight)
So we can rewind it all 'til I come inside
I'll tear in two and never lie to you
('Cause you wouldn't take me home)
Your eyes are yet to be clear now
('Cause you wouldn't take me home)
You were right, I wasn't listening
(I never told you what you were missing)

I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from
I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from

This was the only way we knew how to make everything just OK
(I'll make it up tonight)
The sun was two steps too close with his waking eyes
We'll make believe that everything's all right
('Cause you wouldn't take me home)
Your eyes are yet to be clear now
('Cause you wouldn't take me home)
You were right, I wasn't listening
(I never told you what you were missing)

I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from
I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from
I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from
I never wanted to heal
We are the only ones we are running from

I want to break it off
Where's your song 'cause there's nothing going on
(On)

I never wanted to hear all the things that you told me
I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from
I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)
We are the only ones we are running from
I never wanted to heal
(I never wanted to)---
