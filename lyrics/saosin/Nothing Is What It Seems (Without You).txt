You look like you're letting go
I know that you won't call on me
You look like you're letting go
I know what th instincts are telling me
And you're fading out

It's so hard without you
This wasn't my fault

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
This is all that I remember before you change
You're stuck in a dream with next to nothing 
I'm all alone and nothing's what it seems
Without you next to me

Sometimes it feels like home so safe in th shade
But when th summer fades there's always something missing
And now that im on my own i know why you just
Just couldn't stop and why you had to leave

I never imagined I would feel so lost
I never imagined it would be so hard
I never imagined I would feel so lost
I never imagined this would be so hard---Lyrics submitted by JT.
