boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom 
it makes me go boom boom boom boom boom boom, 
it makes me go boom boom boom boom boom boom, 
BOOMBOX 
boombox 

Never go anywhere with out my 
BOOM BOX 
Sittin' having breakfast, chillin' with my 
BOOM BOX 
Hold up, take a minute, listen to ma 
BOOM BOX 
All the boys gather round just to hear ma 
BOOM BOX 

Aint no way you gonna turn me down, 
Love it when the speakers go Kapow, 
Everybody's lookin' at it, They wish they had it, Never heard anythin' this loud. 

I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
From the car, to ma room to the rooftop, 
I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
All I need is me and my boombox, 

It makes me go boom boom boom boom boom boom, 
yeah it makes me go boom boom boom boom 
It makes me go boom boom boom boom boom 
it makes me go boom boom boom boom 
BOOMBOX 

Walkin' down the street and they follow ma 
BOOMBOX 
Crazy for the beat, boppin to ma 
BOOMBOX 
Under ground train might be fulla 
BOOM BOX 
See the taxi cabs as they pull up 

Aint no way you gonna turn me down, 
Love it when the speakers go Kapow, 
Everybody's lookin' at it, They wish they had it, Never heard anythin' this loud. 

I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
From the car, to ma room to the rooftop, 
I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
All I need is me and my boombox 

It makes me go boom boom boom boom boom boom, 
yeah it makes me go boom boom boom boom 
It makes me go boom boom boom boom boom 
it makes me go boom boom boom boom

I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
From the car, to ma room to the rooftop, 
I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
All I need is me and my boombox 

It makes me go boom boom boom boom boom boom,

It makes me go boom boom boom boom boom

I wanna wanna wanna hear ma boombox, 
From the car, to ma room to the rooftop,
