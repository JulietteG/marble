Maybe in some distant place, everything is already, quietly lost. Or at least there exists a silent place where everything can disappear, melting together in a single, overlapping figure. And as we live our lives we discoverdrawing toward us the thin threads attached to each  what has been lost. I closed my eyes and tried to bring to mind as many beautiful lost things as I could. Drawing them closer, holding on to them. Knowing all the while that their lives are fleeting. Knowing all the while that their lives are fleeting.---Lyrics submitted by Skyler.
