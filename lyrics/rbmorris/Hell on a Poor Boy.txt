In this whole world that we got today
who knows how it goes 
you may rise but you may fall
 thats the way it rose
And him  that gets may be him that gives
What you got will help 
 they say a rich man/ may lose his soul
 by saving all that wealth

 but its hellits hell  on the poor boy
Its hell its hell on the poor boy 
Its hell Its hell on the poor  boy

Its hell on the poor boy
 in a world that dont care 
he keeps a wheel a rolling
 but he dont get nowhere youll find him in some bread line
 or standin at that bar
thats just some way of killing time 
all around the world
but its hellits hell  on the poor boy
Its hell its hell on the poor boy 
Its hell Its hell on the poor  boy

You know he built this city
Every city on this earth 
 every dam /every bridge every church
 and masons just his worth
 he put that wall down in china 
 it was a mountain  they was blocked
 and some poor boy  (got fooled ???????)

but its hellits hell  on the poor boy
Its hell its hell on the poor boy 
Its hell Its hell on the poor  boy---Lyrics submitted by j bernstein.
