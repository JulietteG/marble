Lights go out and I can't be saved 
Tides that I tried to swim against 
You've put me down upon my knees 
Oh I beg, I beg and plead (singing) 
Come out of things unsaid, 
shoot an apple of my head (and a) 
Trouble that can't be named, 
tigers waiting to be tamed (singing) 
You are, you are 

Confusion never stops, 
closing walls and ticking clocks (gonna) 
Come back and take you home, 
I could not stop, 
that you now know (singing) 
Come out upon my seas, 
curse missed opportunities (am I) 
A part of the cure, 
or am I part of the disease (singing) 

You are [x6] 
And nothing else compares 
Oh no nothing else compares 
And nothing else compares 

You are [continues in background] 
Home, home, where I wanted to go [x4]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
