This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed man think
Like a daybreak in spring
The sun on a spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn

But how do I feel in my gloomy depths?

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed man think
Like a daybreak in spring
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn
A black winter day

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed man think
Like a daybreak in spring
The sun on a spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn
A black winter day
No darker than that
Gloomier than an autumn night---Lyrics submitted by Ahmed.
