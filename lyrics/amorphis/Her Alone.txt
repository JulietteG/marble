Only one can make me do my good deeds
only one and the shadow of that one
only one can make me do my evil deeds
only one and the shadow of that one

Her alone I will lend my ear to
only her will I obey
her alone I will always want to serve
only her I will defy

Only one can make me wage all my wars
only one and the shadow of that one
only one can make me do all my deeds
only one and the shadow of that one

My understanding under her advice
birth of my knowing under her advice
my desires I fulfill by revolting---Lyrics submitted by Deyy.
