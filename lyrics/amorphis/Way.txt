Forging the future from the timeless stone
Oh let me know how far I can go
Answering the questions that no one ever asks
Float through the sea of madness
And face the everlasting task

So lonely to wander
So sad to be alone
In the mist of the unknown
Trying to fool myself with dreams that never come true
So hard to stand my ground
Never again will I fail

[Chorus:]
Will you tell me not to wait
Tell me to live for today

As the flowers wither
I will forget my pain
Since the stars have shone
The devil has shown me the way---Lyrics submitted by virdjiniya.
