I was born as all the world here was born
As tones, words and stories of the primeval song
I need no bow, I need no sword
My kingship's known to gods
Let their song go on

I need you to be the guide
The mirror to the sky and sea
Portray all above and below 
The gate of life and death

The sea of my loneliness 
It needs to have a sky
To go with my story 
I also need to have your words

Like a king has his moon
A queen has her sun
To make the song go on

I need you to be the guide
The mirror to the sky and sea
Portray all above and below 
The gate of life and death

I need you to be the guide
The mirror to the sky and sea
Portray all above and below 
The gate of life and death

Make the song go on
The creator of gods
Make the song go on and on 
On and on

[Guitar solo]

I need you to be the guide
The mirror to the sky and sea
Portray all above and below 
The gate of life and death

I need you to be the guide
The mirror to the sky and sea
Portray all above and below 
The gate of life and death

Be my guide of life and death---Lyrics submitted by Clina VL.
