Fate changed
Life healed
Like a wound
How does the kind of life heal
That leaves such a scar
I cover myself, i uncover myself

Now i know how to do things
No longer i'll listen to any talk
Now i know and it's working 
Everything hurts inside of me

Out from the frozen lake
She finally grew in her full might
She grew from a tiny thing
On this lake as i drove there to meet her

Now i know how to do things
No longer i'll listen to any talk
Now i know and it's working
everything hurts inside of me

I cover, i uncover, i cover myself
I cover, i uncover, i cover myself (ter)

Now i know how to do things
No longer i'll listen to any talk
Now i know and it's working
Everything hurts inside of me (bis)---
