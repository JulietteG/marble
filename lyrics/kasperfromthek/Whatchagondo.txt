(FEMALE VOCAL: You are an obsession)
Backstage one night at a show
Two girls in the cage two sliding on the pole (oh)
You know me I'm going with flow
On a scale of 1 to 10 I let the 5th one go
Back again with a throwback track

Walls bare up there
I'm just trying to hang a plaque
My whole crew's been to hell and back
Grey goose got me loose nothing wrong with that
(I will have you)
Matter of fact bring 'em back to the back
Need a groupie with a bootie if she's got it like that
Nibble on my neck, girl
I gotta bite back
The ghost ain't picky give me white or black

Lemme tell you what I want you to do
While the DJs banging on the ones and twos
Keep your homegirls walking on through
Let's party like rock stars
Totally dude

CHORUS (x2)
Tell me what you want to do
I'mma tell you what I want you to do
(What do you want me to do
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession)

The party don't start till we walk in
Got five, ten, fifteen friends
Might bring twenty but it all depends
Club got rules but rules get bent
Might drink Patron, might drink gin
Might get a little bitty sip of that hen
Might do this, might do that
Might get ghost with it and slip out the back

She all rubbing on me hugging on me
Ex-girlfriend looking at me
I'm in trouble homie
I swear, I promise
You know it wasn't me, girl
I'm broke as a joke and I tried to leave
Damn it ain't no fun when the rabbit got a gun
When you're rolling out the club
See the rising sun
Open your eyes, realize what you done
Do I regret it?
Hell no, 'cause damn it was fun
She's aggressive
((CHORUS x2))

Last call for alcohol
Girls still on me and we having a ball
Something about the way she's sipping on a straw
She's crazy sexy, damn she's raw
She told me that she had an obsession
Whispered in my ear with all these confessions
Body all wet got me thinking about sexing
Will you have me girl
That is the question

(I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
You're a rock star
I want to love you
I will find a way to capture you)

((CHORUS x2))

(You're an obsession
You're an obsession
You're an obsession)---Lyrics submitted by kim.
