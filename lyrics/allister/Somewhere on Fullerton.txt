Somewhere Down on Fullerton
Where there's a place, we used to go to get away from it all.
Somewhere Down on Fullerton
Where there's a place, we used to go to get away from it all!

And I'm still trying to figure out why
This feels so wrong when it felt so right.
It felt so right four years ago!

So please don't go away!
I just want you to stay with me forever
Forever I said
Please don't go away!
'Cause all I want is you to stay with me ---Lyrics submitted by Elisa.
