On the outside
All we say is clay that hides the perfect light
But no one really knows
The pain inside

Understand how much it hurts
To be the one who's never seen
The missing pages
In a magazine

No one knows you anymore
You're lost inside the walls you've built
No one knows you anymore
A prison deep within your soul

There is one who sees it all
He'll give you life you've never dreamed
He can see the pain
Underneath you skin

It's hard to see you fading
Nothing that I do can bring you back
I pray to God
That you don't fade away

Your addiction is a symptom
Of a lost and dying soul
And without Jesus
There's no hope at all

No one knows you anymore
You're lost inside the walls you've built
No one knows you anymore
A prison deep within your soul

There is one who sees it all
He'll give you life you've never dreamed
He can see the pain
Underneath your skin

There is so much more
This is not the end
It's all in your hands
Don't throw it away

A beautiful life
With so much to give
The image of God
Underneath your skin

No one knows you anymore
You're lost inside the walls you've built
No one knows you anymore
A prison deep within your soul

There is one who sees it all
He'll give you life you've never dreamed
He can see the pain
Underneath your skin---Lyrics submitted by brooke.
