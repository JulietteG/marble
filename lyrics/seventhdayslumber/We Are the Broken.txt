They keep you hanging on,
Always hiding the truth,
Afraid of what you'll find inside you,
All the pain they put you through, To deny the shame and wrong they do, There is a light inside the darkness,
Can't defeat or destroy and it's time they find out who we are . . .

We are the broken,
All that remains of our past are the scars,
Our eyes are open,
We're not afraid to admit who we are, We are the broken

It's their instinct to deny all the lies and abuse,
The pain you tried to hide is bleeding through,
Their perfect ways and your mistakes, All the plastic smiles from a thousand fakes, You're more than what they said that you could be, so believe . . .

We are the broken,
All that remains of our past are the scars,
Our eyes are open,
We're not afraid to admit who we are,
We are the broken

Our eyes are open, our eyes are open, Our eyes are open, our eyes are open
It's time to find out who we are . . .

We are the broken,
All that remains of our past are the scars,
Our eyes are open,
We're not afraid to admit who we are,
We are the broken,
Now we can see we were loved from the start,
We are the chosen,
We are the beautiful light in the dark . . .---
