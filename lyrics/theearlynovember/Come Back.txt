Looking in your eyes
Praising every moment because you're my only light
Reading through stares at your passion that bears me now
Shedding no little tears
The silence scares us more than leaving could

[Chorus:]
Come back
Please don't leave me now
I'll be all that you need in life
Because I can't live without you and
I know all that you need
I can give you everything
When you're so far you'll forget about me

Waiting by your side
Knowing every moment is closer to your flight
Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now
Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever

[Chorus]

But I'll wait
I could never leave those beautiful eyes
I know you're sorry
I know what you must be going through
And I feel sorry for you

But please don't leave me now [x3]---Lyrics submitted by Rizza.
