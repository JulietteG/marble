I just found a friend,
In one of your lies.
To treat me so nice,
I, can't believe my bones...
When they say,
So many things...
They tell me I am fine,
believe me I, I try...

( Ooo Ooo Ooo, Oh Ooo Ooo Ooo Oh ) 

...Ever so sweet,
You make this seem,
The way things go...
It's not my fault.
And I'll miss,
I'll miss you so good...
All of those nights,
We lost our way back home.

Ever so sweet,
You baked it in cakes for me.
What you left behind,
It hurts my teeth...
Bring in the past with the postcards you sent for me...
Every line,
It brings me right back down.

Can't you see the wall you built for me? (x3)

Cause we're not special
we're not special
we're not special

Well I'm not special
I'm not special

Ever so sweet,
You baked it in cakes for me...
What you left behind,
It hurts my teeth...
Bringing the past with the postcards you sent for me...
Every line...
It brings me right back down.---Lyrics submitted by chino.
