Assume we lie on a serious side
Youre the cold Ive taken home
Inside my lungs, airs consumed by thought
And the pressure keeps them tight

You like it better that way
You like it better that way

To sleep it off
Felt you open up
But you still see me wrong
Deny, deny, well I'm waking up

You like me better that way
You like it better that way

The needle says no, you decide its right
You wait a little longer and design their rights
Design the rights

You like me better that way
You like it better that way---
