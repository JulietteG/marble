Trace my shape here on the wall
Color in my eyes and hair with chalk
And nobody will know that Im gone
Id hate to leave an impression
Its a battle just to talk, feel defeat when I walk
Want to smash and moan but I join the flock
Dont believe in depression
I just gutted myself to prove that Im different
Im different

Drowning your problems into a rat hole
Sooner or later youre gonna start the float
Lets just hope nobody will know
With your drips as lethal as cyanide
Its not much, we might be alright
But after a while nobody can hide

The color is there
And it starts to fade so fast
Yeah, the equal signs on my mouth try to heal
My separated path
I not wish, but yearn to move along
We need to clear the way so my baggage clears the wall
Cover the place with post it notes till I have shown what I had done

Drowning your problems into a rat hole
Sooner or later youre gonna start the float
Lets just hope nobody will know
With your drips as lethal as cyanide
Its not much, we might be alright
But after a while nobody can hide

Until we dont feel anything

Drowning your problems into a rat hole
Sooner or later youre gonna start the float
Lets just hope nobody will know
With your drips as lethal as cyanide
Its not much, we might be alright
But after a while nobody can hide
Until we dont feel anything, anymore---
