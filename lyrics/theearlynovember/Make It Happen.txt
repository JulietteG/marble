Tonight, under lights we sroll.
We're never coming back and i swear, 
I'll never let you go if you come away with me.
They're never gonna know, never gonna know, lets go outta this place make it happen. [2x]
Never gonna know, never gonna know, lets go outta this place make it happen someday!
Find the time, no matter where you are.
When your day it comes again. 
Make it last no matter how so far another day will come again.
I swear, i'll never let you go if you come away with me,
alone all night alone we'll be singing, 
Never gonna know, never gonna know, lets go outta this place make it happen.
Never gonna know, never gonna know, lets go outta this place make it happen someday!
Make it last, it'll be so hard.
You dont know how much this is.
We'll go so far you'll see, its not hard!
We'll go so far you'll see, its not hard!
We'll go so far you'll see, its not so,
We'll go so far you'll see, its not hard.
Never gonna know, never gonna know, lets go outta this place, make it happen. [2x]
Never gonna know, never gonna know, lets go outta this place, make it happen someday.---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
