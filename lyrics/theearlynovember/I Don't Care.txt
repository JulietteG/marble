Screwed my head on straight
Ive got a piercing alibi, oh
Im dull like the knife
Familiar from inside
Hoping to wade though this emotional pesticide
It looks so familiar, we look so familiar, dont look so familiar

Cause I dont care about the scars I wear them out so proud, so proud
So give me something thats not on my list, failure to free air
the original, Im not breathing now. with no help

Im saying that Im sorry for the weight
I cant put down this axe and the lumber stacks high, still no room yet
For you to hold me close like a baby only knowing love, give me something to believe in
You give me something to believe in

I dont care about the looks high brow is facing down, to the ground.
My dirty hands just turned into locked tight fists. failure to see fails.
cliffs, They just lift me off the ground
to help me find you somehow

These night I wait for the last call
When everyones the same, we find a way to fall
Without a drink at all
I screw my head on straight

I dont care about the thin cold air, not coming down. Im never coming down
You give me something to believe in, you give me something to believe in---
