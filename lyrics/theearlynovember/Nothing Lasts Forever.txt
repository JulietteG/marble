 If this is how the story ends, blackened hearts and bitter friends
Broken bonds and busted ties, we have a love we have tonight
We dont have to obey the trend, deny our hearts the bitter end
Nothing has to change this time
If we have tonight

Surrender what you have that their after
Cause everyday its not enough
its a tax to survive the white light
Avoid the right lines
Believe the best views the one everybodys after
Hold on, its not enough that we believe youre strong
Hold on, its not enough to believe
They say nothing lasts forever, its not giving up
I say nothing last forever, but Im giving up

If this is how the story ends, blackened hearts and bitter friends
Broken bonds and busted ties, we have a love we have tonight
We dont have to obey the trend, deny our hearts the bitter end
Nothing has to change this time
If we have tonight

Remember its your past that convicts you
So never give em long enough to predict you
Always must grow, try to let go
Never get lost in how everyone sees you
Hold on, its not enough that we believe youre strong
Hold on, its not enough to believe

If this is how the story ends, blackened hearts and bitter friends
Broken bonds and busted ties, we have a love we have tonight
We dont have to obey the trend, deny our hearts the bitter end
Nothing has to change this time
If we have tonight

We say nothing lasts forever
So nothing lasts forever, well give it up
Nothing lasts forever
If this is how it ends than I am better off without it
You dont fight breaking down, we just let it take control
Let it take control, until it lets you down
So slow---
