We keep running faster now 
But its our souls that lie 
A hundred miles 
Behind the rush of time 
Hides a wounded smile 
But we wont notice  why? 

On your own again? 
On your own again? 

And time 
Will pass me by as I 
Relive each moment 
Why  cant I forget the wrong? 
And do right 

I keep telling myself how 
How its the other fault 
They caused me to try 
Being someone else 
But its not them its me 
Pretending Im not free 

On your own again? 
On your own again? 

And time 
Will pass me by as I 
Relive each moment 
Why  cant I forget the wrong? 
And do right 

(Free and innocent 
Flawed with no regret) X2---Lyrics submitted by Coletta.
