You're too to fall away
You -- call it a day

You say the words
You say the words
To make it all okay

You say the words
You say the words
You thought you'd never say

You say the words
And all the words
Make the tone go numb

You say the words
You say the words
Until the words don't want to come

You're too to fall away
You -- call it a day
You're too to fall away
You -- call it a day

You wanna talk
And say the things you didn't know were there
You wanna talk
You wanna talk
A --- to bear

It's time to go
It's time to go
It's what you need to say

It's time to go
It's time to go
Because you don't know how to stay

You're too to fall away---Lyrics submitted by Llu.
