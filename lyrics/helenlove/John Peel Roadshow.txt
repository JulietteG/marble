I skipped school for the afternoon
I caught the bus in at half-past two
I feel all hot and I feel all cold
Taking my demo to the John Peel Roadshow

She met a boy with a Pastels badge
A demo tape and a record bag
He wouldnt dance cos it was a drag
Theres no way Im dancing, no way

And I gotta give my demo to John Peel
I hope he loves my band
And I gotta give my demo to John Peel
I hope he understands
Take a chance
Be brave
Dont be scared
Give him your tape

Hey he told her he was in a band
And hes gotta get his demo in John Peels hands
But he felt all nervous did she understand?
She said Ill put it in his record box for you

And I gotta give my demo to John Peel
I hope he loves my band
And I gotta give my demo to John Peel
I hope he understands
Take a chance
Be brave
Dont be scared
Give him your tape

She met him at the John Peel Roadshow
Oh what a beautiful night
She met him at the John Peel Roadshow
With the stars shining bright outside
She met him at the John Peel Roadshow
Oh what a beautiful night
She met him at the John Peel Roadshow
With the stars shining bright outside

Late November 1989
Stars were shining such a special time
What a roadshow
What a night

And I gotta give my demo to John Peel
I hope he loves my band
And I gotta give my demo to John Peel
I hope he understands
Take a chance
Be brave
Dont be scared
Give him your tape

Give your demo tape to John Peel (x8)---Lyrics submitted by Monica.
