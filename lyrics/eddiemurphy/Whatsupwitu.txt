(The elephant is dying...)

(E.M)
The sun is gonna shine,
the flowers gonna grow,
the clouds will bring us showers,
the rivers gonna flow.
Men ain't got no power,
he kills nothing but himself,
men is a creation...
men is nothing else, so..

(chorus[M.J])

Wassup...
Wassup...
Wassup with you?
Wassup...
Wassup with you?   (wassup with you!?)
Wassup...
Wassup...
Wassup wth you?
Wassup...
Wassup with you?
(wassup with you!?)

(E.M)
Always into mountains,
always into trees,
always into oceans,
always into seas,
(wassup with you!?)
we can't stop this world...
cause it's not our world...
We can just... junk each other out!

If we're falling,
He's mighty patient...
he's got your number...
beat your disease...

(M.J)
He knows you're falling,
you're falling,
you're falling,
(Falling)

(E.M)
Men is a creation...
Men is nothing else, so...
