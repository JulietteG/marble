Love me like the rain
Don't shy away when I ask you
Nature has it's way of showing life so true

Love me like the rain
Love me soft, love me gentle
I love you, love you, love you

Look under the lightening
No wind gust to blow
No storms are needed, not even snow

Love me like the rain
It is you who I'm asking
I'm trying to explain, It's my world
Please explore it
I love you, love you, love you

Nobody can lay down, Noooo
A law of love, oh oh oh
Nobody can say how it's got to be

Love me like the rain
Love me like the rain
Oh, love me like the rain
rain (repeat 16 times fading out) ---
