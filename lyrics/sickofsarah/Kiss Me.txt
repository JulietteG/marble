Place me down like water when it drips.
I feel nothing, I feel nothing
I feel nothing when it slips
I do this all the time
Molly, Molly press rewind
I know this all too well
I showed a blade for show and tell
And when you tell me twice,
"Hey man your turn, roll the dice"
I read the magazines, oh they got some bad advice

And I know, I know, I know
It's true
And I know, I know, I know
We were exactly where we wanted to be
So kiss me, kiss me
(Whoa) Do it like you did before
Oh, oh and kiss me, kiss me
Cara mia, mi amore

And I'll breathe you in, again
And I'll hold you so close to my skin
We do this all the time
Catch up, catch up, fall behind
Said you can't handle this
We tried it out, still you resist
Said you would change your angle
I'm not sure if you were able
I like the feeling, now throw your cards up on the table

And I know, I know, I know
It's true
And I know, I know, I know
We were exactly where we wanted to be
So kiss me, kiss me
(Whoa) Do it like you did before
Oh, oh and kiss me, kiss me
Throw me on the living room floor

There's always something left to see
It's always colder in your atmosphere
It was never too cold for me, to be

Oh, oh kiss me, kiss me
(Whoa) do it like you did before
Oh, oh kiss me, kiss me
Cara mia, mi amore
Oh, oh and kiss me, kiss me
(Whoa) Do it like you did before
Oh, oh and kiss me, kiss me
Throw me on the living room floor
Cus that's exactly where I wanted to be.---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
