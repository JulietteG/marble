I'll make you wonder
I'll make you wonder now
Give your fingertips a break
I'll take you under
I'll make you wonder now
I'll make you wonder
Give your fingertips a break
I'll take you under
I'll take you under

And when it starts back in tonight
You'll ask me if I want to play
Come and chase me through the night
And feel this fine line escalate

I'll make you wonder
I'll make you wonder now
Give your fingertips a break
I'll take you under
I'll make you wonder
Let me whisper melodies
Pull me in a little more
Pull me close, serenity

If you can't stop me
No you do it, now you'll do it
No you do it again
And when you wake up in yesterday's makeup
You left me with a message
'Can we still be friends?'

And when it starts back in tonight
You'll ask me if I want to play
Come and chase me through the night
And feel this fine line escalate

I can't believe you're..
I can't believe you're gone
I can't believe you're..
I can't believe you're gone

You are my little favorite feeling
Lets sing la la la la la
You were my little favorite feeling
You were my little favorite feeling
Singing whoa oh
I'll catch you at the right time
Not my feeling, not my feeling

You can't stop me
Now you do it, now you do it
Now you'll do it again
And when you wake up
In yesterday's makeup
You left me with a message,
'Can we still be friends?'

And when it starts back in tonight
You'll ask me it I want to play
Come and chase me through the night
And feel me chase your breath away

I can't believe you're..
I can't believe you're gone
I can't believe you're..
I can't believe you're gone---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
