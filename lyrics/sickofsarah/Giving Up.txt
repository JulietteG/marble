Extend my hand for one more drink
I'll let it slide
I haven't touched the surface yet
It was too close for me, I caved.

Now hold me till you fall asleep.
Not makin it easy (No)
We're holding secrets underneath
Not makin it easy (No)

The flowers never grow
I think I'll pick forever, this time
Well I guess I'm giving up again
I guess it's fair, I guess it's fair, I guess it's fair
I just don't...

Ration time and wait for sleep
One will reflect, one will defeat
Imagine me at seventeen,
Depressed and thin, homecoming queen.

And you will always cross my mind.
Not making it easy (No)
And you could leave at any time.
I'm makin it easy, not easy oohh.

The flowers never grow
I think I'll pick forever, this time.
Well I guess I'm giving up again
I guess it's fair, I guess it's fair, I guess it's fair
I just don't care.

We disinvent promises, leave me alone
Wishful thinking was helpless, 
help us find our way home.
And you ask me if I've been there, if I've been there.
I want to take you along
This I know, I want to live forever, this I know.
Well I guess I'm giving up again
I guess it's fair, I guess it's fair, I guess it's fair,
I just don't care.

My heart, I want to live forever
Well I'd love to see your face again
I love you still, I love you still, I love you still
I love you.---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
