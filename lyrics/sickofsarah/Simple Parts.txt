Time goes by so fast
One last breath is all I have
The people come, they fade
I try so hard to shape these words I cannot formulate

It's harder enough to breathe, harder enough to fall
and I'll be sitting on your back porch
Trying to figure out who you are
Made in a factory of simple parts
I know better, you know better
I know better

And when we dance, we dance alone
Follow suit, you're my crystal ball
The people come, they fade
Let's clear the dance floor
Let's dance the night away, disco lemonade

It's harder enough to breathe, harder enough to fall
and I'll be sitting on your back porch
Trying to figure out who you are
Made in a factory of simple parts
I know better, you know better
I know better

That's what you say, say 
(repeat)

Who you are,
I know heads will fall apart
And words transcribed to your heart
In ways, ways, ways, ways I can't complain
And I try too hard
Now, take these words I cannot formulate

It's harder enough to breathe, harder enough to fall
and I'll be sitting on your back porch
Trying to figure out who you are
Made in a factory of simple parts
I know better, you know better
I know better, you know better
I know better---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
