So the sun fades
And the lights break
And the spark is blown away
A million miles from here to there
But no, superman's not anywhere
And the road's about to sleep
And the smoke is thickening
Just like a part of me is dissolving
Collapsing

So we're walkin, but no talkin
Everything is hazy
Like we all are strangers
And the cats took our tongues away
His lips were very still
Let the words out if you will
Because I'm running, I'm running out of time
We're running, we're running out of time

And then it happened, Oh
I heard in the breakdown
And if it ever lets go
No, you know there's no stopping now
And then it happened, Oh
I heard in the breakdown
Oh, oh, oh
And if it ever lets go
No, you know there's no stopping now

So we stepped up
And we checked in
Another bed I'm sleepin in
Another smoke-filled crowded room
Another mirror I look into
This feeling takes a while
Laugh it off and you make me smile
But I'm running, I'm running out of time
We're running, we're running out of time

And then it happened, Oh
I heard in the breakdown
Oh, oh, oh
And if it ever lets go
No, you know there's no stopping now
And then it happened, Oh
I heard in the breakdown
Oh, oh, oh
And if it ever lets go
No, you know there's no stopping now

And you know exactly what I was looking for
Yes, you knew exactly what I was looking for

And then it happened, Oh
I heard in the breakdown
Oh, oh, oh
And if it ever lets go
No, you know there's no stopping now
And then it happened, Oh
I heard in the breakdown
Oh, oh, oh
And if it ever lets go
No, you know there's no stopping now---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
