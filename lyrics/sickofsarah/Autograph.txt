You had a heart of gold.
You had a heart of stone.
I had a heart attack.
I pulled you in, you pushed me back.
You're not so innocent, you're just a hypocrite.
Now turn me on, let me loose,
blow me off, what's your excuse?

And I'm not messing around, I want your autograph
I want to touch you, yeah.
And I'm not messing around, messing around
I want your autograph, autograph.

Your bones are pliable, so endeniable.
Cannot commit to words, cus words are indescribable.
And if I had my way, I'd eat you everyday
Now come a little closer, listen to the words I've got to say.


And I'm not messing around, I want your autograph
I want to touch you, yeah.
And I'm not messing around, messing around
I want your autograph.

And you'll just screw with my soul
Your words, they twist and fold,
I need to learn to swallow them whole
I'll swallow them whole
I want your autograph, autograph.

You can't quite sleep in the middle of the night,
You're touching yourself, whoa, whoa.
And if you could see everything that I see, oh, whoa.
I can't quite take this, I cant quite break this, oh, whoah.
And you can't quite take this, you can quite break this, oh, ohh.

And I'm not messing around, I want your autograph
I want to touch you and fuck you, yeah.
I'm not messing around
I want your autograph.
You'll just screw with my soul,
Your words they twist and fold
I need to learn to swallow you whole
Oh, I'll swallow you whole
I want your autograph.
