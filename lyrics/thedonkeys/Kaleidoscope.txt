And I lost transmission,
Across the seventh sun.
I'm gonna die,
But i'm not the first one.
Lost feeling in my left leg;
There goes my arm.
What went wrong
in the cabin?

Jupiter is on the right.

And I'm out here all alone
Skipping like a stone,
But i lost you in the week
Laying with God cheek to cheek.
You wished i was home
On a shooting star
Before we know there was you
Looking at me from afar.

Jupiter is on the right.

And I lost transmission
Across the seventh sun.
I'm gonna die,
But I'm not the first one.
The further away it is
The closer we get.
Our life has no end;
Death makes us infinite.

Jupiter is on the right. . .---Lyrics submitted by Gabe Gustaffson.
