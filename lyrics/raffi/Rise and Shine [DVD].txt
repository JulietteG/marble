Rise with the bluebird
Shine like the sun
Now's the time to rise and shine

Rise and shine 
The world's been turning and
Everone is waking
Rise and Shine
On this day new day
The morning light is breaking

Rise with the rest of us
Shine like a pearl
Rise and show your love
All around the world
Rise with the bluebird
shine like the sun
Now's the time to Rise and shine

Rise and Shine
Today is calling and
This is what it's saying
Rise and shine
Your friends are waking
It's time for work and playing

Rise with the rest of us
Shine like a pearl
Rise and show your love
All around the world
Rise with the bluebird
Shine like the sun
Now's the time to Rise and shine---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
