Joshua Giraffe was born in a zoo, he lived there to;
for two years and a half he hasn't had a bath.
"My Mommy doesn't lick me, even when I'm sticky 
from candy floss, candy apples, popcorn, 
soft drinks jelly beans and gum drops.  
There must be something better than living in this cage,
but I'm really not too sure 'cause I'm rather short in age."

Joshua Giraffe was feeling kind of sad, things were going bad;
how liittle life he'd had; wasting away with no room to play
rapped in a zoo, with Buffalo poo.
So, he went next door to the elephant and asked him what to do.
"I'm wasting away with no room to play, I'm trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo."

The elephant was very old and grey, and he had a huge balloon bottom 
and he said,
"Never fear Joshua, for a vision will appear!"

That night a dream came true to Joshua...
and Joshua saw animals like crazy monkeys...
and a whole pile of hippie potosteropouses...
and fifty moths...and frogs, size 12...
and sleazy lizards...and a tribe of nasty saviars, 
but Joshua wasn't afraid 'cause he sang himself this song:
"nothing can go wrongo, I'm in the Congo"...
but even in his dream he knew he'd never get away, not even for a day.
Then a peanut hit him on the nose.

Joshua Giraffe was back in the zoo, what could he do,
awakened from his dream, he'd seen
alligators, crocodiles, tree sloths, anacondas, cobras, and large winged moths;
orangutangs, gorillas, baboons eating grapes, gibbons, rude mandrills and just plain apes.

But Joshua was lucky, he had some special friends;
and that day they went to the zoo, he was up tight,
so they waited til the night and they chopped his cage in two
he discovered he could fly and he soared into th sky, with them wrapped around his neck,
and they haven't come back yet, so if you see them get a net...
foo ni chel lo ho ho....ho ho ho...

That's right, they haven't come back yet,
but when they do, they say they are going to free all the animals from their cages,
no matter how new or modern
and even some pets too!
so if on your way home today, you happen to find;
a baboon basking in the balcony,
or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby,
or a python perched in the pantry,
a wildebeast in the w.c.,
with a turtle twirling in the tub
don't be afraid, just say you're a friend of their friend
Joshua giraffe, Joshua, Joshuua---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
