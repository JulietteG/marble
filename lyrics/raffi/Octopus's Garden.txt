I'd like to be, under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends, to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be, under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm, below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Restin' our head, on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and we dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would sing, and we dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you

In an octopus's garden with you

In an octopus's garden with you---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
