This little light of mine
I'm gonna  et it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

I'm gonna take this light around the world
And I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna take this light around the world
And I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna take this light around the world 
And I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine 
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine 
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

I won't let anyone blow it out
I'm gonna let it shine
I won't let anyone blow it out
I'm gonna let it shine
I won't let anyone blow it out
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

This little light of mine 
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

(end with)
Every day, every day
I'm gonna let my little light shine---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
