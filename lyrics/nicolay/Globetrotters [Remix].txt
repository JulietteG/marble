world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
South Hill to Hong Kong, smokin' a bong
world wide all over the globe 
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
T-Dot to LA puffin' a J.

Hey yo, i smoke weed globally, and every weed spot they knowin' me
its like a second home to me yo
and when Im overseas you know Im smoking nothing but hash
in Baghdad, they gettin' mad if you dont puff it and pass
and out in Asia Im amazed, I wasnt getting no ass
the whole time, my own mind was thinking nothing but grass
cuz out in China it be hard to find a doobie at all
and if you do believe its true then itd be too damn small
so they smoke it in a pipe trying to hide the fact
thats why I love it in Toronto cause the dimes are fat
When Im in L.A., I'm getting high on it daily
smoking straight out of Oakland
got the bomb, thats what they tell me
but its harder when you gotta stay impartisan
when i get retarded at Harvard I wear a cardigan
if you think youre smarter than the P.I.G. dont bother,
the globetrotter, here to blow the fucking spot up

world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
South Hill to Hong Kong, smoking a bong
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe

Hey yo, in Africa they pass to the right
thats so mess, my whole life, i been taught to pass to the left
and out in Germany they heard the P.I.G. was the man
because i showed this bitch some of my shit from Iran
and all my peoples out in Italy be giving me love
Luigi thought that it was easy, tried to spin me a dub
and asked me if i like to get high
I told him dammit man
I get more bomb than Afghanistan
now understand where I'm coming from
Im down with runnin' one in Antartica
sparkin' up until the summer comes
in Las Vegas, we bet the spot blazes,
get the picture, I like to puff spliffs in high places
in Australia they giving me a didgeridoo
for a hash pipe, the vibes are too shitty to brew
who knows last night, I couldve been in your city too
you dont ask right, you want me to rhyme then give me a doob

world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
South Hill to Iraq I be rollin' a sack
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
T-Dot to Detroit I be smoking a joint

world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
South Hill to Hong Kong, smokin' a bong
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
world wide all over the globe
