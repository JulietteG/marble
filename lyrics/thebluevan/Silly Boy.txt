I might be wrong but I might be right
Anyhow I know I tried
I better leave, I better leave
I better stop

I like her taste when it fills my soul
I'll tell you something I've never told anyone
Not anyone, not anyone

Everyone's got a bleeding heart
I don't know where or when to start
I better bleed, I better bleed
I better stop
I better bleed, I better bleed
I better stop

Silly boys
You ran away
Your unemployed
You'd waste away

Silly boys
You ran away
Your unemployed
You'd waste away

Silly boys you run away to far
Remember this remember where you are

Life is good
It's what I see that
Makes me want to disagree
I better leave, I better leave
I better not

You might be wrong cause you know I'm right
If you lose your way you just follow mine
I better leave, I better leave
I better stop
I better leave, I better leave
I better stop

Silly boys
You ran away
Your unemployed
You'd waste away

Silly boys
You ran away
Your unemployed
You'd waste away

You run away, you're unemployed, waste away

Silly boys
You ran away
Your unemployed
You'd waste away---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
