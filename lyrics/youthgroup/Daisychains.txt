listen now my sweet anne 
i never meant to cause you pain
we coulda spent all summer sittin here
makin daisy chains
i lie awake at night starin off my roof
now your gone
for weeks ive had your pretty face hangin in my brain
its suspended like the reflection in a window pane
you hang just like a ghost over city streets
now your gone
oh listen now my sweet anne i never meant
to cause you pain we coulda spent
all summer here makin daisy chains
i lie awake at night starin off my roof
now your gone---Lyrics submitted by Kimmy.
