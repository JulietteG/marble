Let's dance in style let's dance for a while, 
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies, 
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst, 
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever, 
Don't have the power but we never say never, 
Sitting in the sandpit life is a short trip, 
Music's for the sad man

Can you imagine when this race is run, 
Turn our golden faces into the sun, 
Praising our leaders getting in tune, 
The music's played by the mad man

Forever young, I wanna be forever young, 
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever forever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young, 
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever forever

Some are like water some are like the heat, 
Some are the melodies some are the beat, 
Sooner or later they'll all be gone, 
Why don't they stay young?
It's hard to get old without a cause, 
I don't want to perish like a fading voice, 
Youth is like diamonds in the sun, 
And diamonds are forever, 
So many adventures couldn't happened today, 
So many songs that we forgot to play, 
So many dreams swinging out in the blue, 
We let them come true
Forever young I wanna be forever young, 
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever, forever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young, 
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever, forever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young, 
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever, forever
Forever young, I wanna to be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever, forever...---Lyrics submitted by Lala.
