ooh ah ah ahh
             ooh ah ah ahh

Rollin' around like a big rubber ball, writing this song 'bout some thing that I saw, Tryin' to stand like some big tall tough man, finding out fast that im sinking in sand 

(Chorus) 
All I got is nothin' but a little bit of love, Im gonna give it to the people then they'll see.
Then they'll see...

Spinin' the tops as the tables they turn, made some mistakes but they still didn't learn. Covered my tracks, thought i was fine, no self control now i'm here in line

(Chorus)
All I got is nothin' but a little bit of love, Im gonna give it to the people then they'll see.
Then they'll see... aww... they'll see... aww... 

(Chorus)
All I got is nothin' but a little bit of love, Im gonna give it to the people then they'll see.
Then they'll see... aw haha aww...
ohh aw haha aww...---Lyrics submitted by Spencer.
