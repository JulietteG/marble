I want to be just like you

I've got these pictures keep on rolling 'round my head
I want to hang them on the wall above my bed
And it's so easy to step aside
And walk in line like all the rest
I never did that well on tests

I don't watch TV 'cause it's just a box of lies
It makes me want to stick a toothpick in my mind
While the world goes down the drain
I eat my popcorn from a bag
Some people say that i've gone mad

I got
I gotta go down to the schoolhouse
And get some...
And and and get some shoes
And and and get the right haircut
Get the right haircut

You're so cool
Yeah
So cool

Yeah
You're so cool
Yeah
I wanna be just like you
So cool

I wanna be just like you
Yeah
So Cool
Yeah

You're so cool
Yeah
So Cool
So Cool
So Cool---Lyrics submitted by Biskit.
