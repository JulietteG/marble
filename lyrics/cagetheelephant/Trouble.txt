We were at the table by the window the view,
Casting shadows,
Sun was pushed through,
Spoke a lot of words I don't know if I spoke the truth.

Got so much to lose,
Got so much to prove,
God don't let me lose my mind.

Trouble on my left,
Trouble on my right,
I've been facing trouble almost all my life.
My sweet love won't you pull me through.
Everywhere I look I catch against the you.
I said it was love and I did it for laughter.

Will I come to pass or will I pass the test.
You know what they say, yeah, the wicked get no rest.
You can take my heart any place any time.

Got so much to lose,
Got so much to prove,
God don't let me lose my mind.

Trouble on my left,
Trouble on my right,
I've been facing trouble almost all my life.
My sweet love won't you pull me through.
Everywhere I look I catch against the you.
I said it was love and I did it for laughter.

Trouble on my left,

My sweet love won't you pull me through.
Everywhere I look I catch against the you.
