She's a stone cold straight-faced killer and a lover
And she won't put up with another brood who only wants to bruise her
Take her love and then abuse her

She won't take no more, won't take no more
Won't take no more, won't take no more

Oh no ain't it a drag
If you take a swing, she swing back
She say I'm not your punchin' bag

Heaven help ya 'm telling the truth
Heaven help ya she's coming for you
Heaven help ya the girl likes to fight
Afraid of nothing and she carries a knife

She said oh no I'm not your punchin' bag
I'm not your punchin' bag
I'm not your punchin' bag

What kind of man are you?
Instead of kisses you gave bruises
No more time for cheap excuses
If I were you, I would be leaving
Best you go while you're still breathing
She won't take no more, won't take no more
Won't take no more, won't take no more

Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Last time, last time you're ever gonna

Oh no ain't it a drag
Everywhere you go, better watch your bag
Cause I'm not your punchin' bag---
