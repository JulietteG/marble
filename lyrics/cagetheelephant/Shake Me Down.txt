Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around
who knows now

Softly laying on the ground, ooooh
Not a lot of people left around oooh
oooh

In my life 
I have seen
People walk into the sea
Just to find memories
Plagued by constant misery

Their eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down
Cut my hair on a silver cloud
Broken sound
Softly laying on the ground oooh
Not a lot of people left around oooh
oooh

In my past bittersweet
There's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood
Broken dreams

Lonely times indeed
With eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now
It's time for me to let go
Way down had to find a place to lay low
Lampshade turned around into a light post

Walk around the corner
Never saw it coming still
I try to make a move

I almost stoped me from belief
I don't wanna know the future
But i'm rolling like thunder

Even on a cloudy day (6x)

I'll keep my eyes on the-(2x)
I'll keep my eyes on the sun

Shake down
Not a lot of people left around
ooooh ooooh---Lyrics submitted by Ruth.
