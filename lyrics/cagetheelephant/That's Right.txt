Let your hair down, let's unwind
Take your problems, leave them behind
You got your troubles and I got mine
Baby that's right, baby that's right

I get in trouble cause I speak my mind
Sometimes I like it when I make you cry
Baby that's right, baby that's right

I know tomorrow we may have regrets
But as for right now where's the party at?
We'll stay up all night waiting for the sun to shine, sun to shine
Baby that's right, baby that's right, baby that's right, ahh
Take a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of wine
Take all your problems, leave them far behind
I say I'm sorry almost every time
Baby that's right, baby that's right

Wait 'til tomorrow then we can reflect
But as for right now where's the party at?
We'll stay up all night waiting for the sun to shine, sun to shine
Baby that's right, baby that's right, baby that's right
Ahh, ahh, ooh, ooh---
