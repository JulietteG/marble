In the depths of my mind I laid sleeping
Well I had such a dream when I woke I was weeping
The vision I saw danced around me
And my heart saw the things that my eyes couldn't see

Oh the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky blood, red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screaming

Come one, come all
Come see it believe it
The truth, will shine
If you open you eyes
And you'll see, it move
As it moves on the masses
The weak, will rise and give birth to the sky
Yeah, give birth to the sky

No it didn't stop there it consumed me
And it crushed me with joy as it's beauty swept through me
I was moved by the weight of it all
I'd been touched by the light yes I know what I saw

Oh the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees As the stars started screaming

Come one, come all
Come see it believe it
The truth, will shine
If you open you eyes
And you'll see, it move
As it moves on the masses
The weak, will rise and give birth to the sky
Yeah, give birth to the sky

I saw the dreamers dreaming
I heard the people singing
The dinosaurs are dieing
The mind control's subsiding

I saw a new path beaten
Free thinkers freely thinking
Can't stop a thought from breathing
It moves like fire

The sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screaming

Come one, come all
Come see it believe it
The truth, will shine
If you open you eyes
And you'll see, it move
As it moves on the masses
The weak, will rise and give birth to the sky
Yeah, give birth to the sky---Lyrics submitted by Ed.
