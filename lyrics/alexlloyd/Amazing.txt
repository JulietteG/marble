When all you want to do is rock,
But you dont want to bear the shock no more.
When its just swell that fills your eyes,
Belated feelings that you have denied.
When every wolf is at your door, just like a hundred times before,
But you dont want to leave the end.

Cause you were amazing and we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it, cause we were amazing things.

Rebuilding bridges in your mind, your eagerness now is on the line,
The plastic mountain at your feet, divided streets now as you look to find a seat.
When every wolf is at your door, just like a hundred times before,
But you dont want to see the end.

Cause you were amazing and we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it, cause we were amazing things.

And I really didnt want that push today,
No, I really didnt want to end this way.
But the things that seem to bind us,
Are the things we put behind us on this day.

Cause you were amazing and we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it, cause we were amazing things.

Cause you were amazing and we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it, cause we were amazing things.---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlyn.
