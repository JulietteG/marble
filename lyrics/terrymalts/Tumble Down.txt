Up on the hill I held your hand
Both of us so drunk we couldn't stand
Making our way in the moonlight 
Wondering what death will be like

Tumble down
The hill with me
Don't be afraid
Of what you cannot see

Up on the hill your hand in mine
We had ourselves a real cool time
Coughing our way on the hillside
Wondering what comes after life

Tumble down 
Hill with me
Don't be afraid
Of what you cannot see---Lyrics submitted by Derrek Putz.
