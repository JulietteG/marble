I used to be so down
No fun to hang around

I, I got a new distraction
I, I got a new distraction

I used to be so down
You couldn't console me
No fun to hang around 
That's what people told me

I, I got a new distraction
I, I got a new distraction

I used to be so down
I was going nowhere
No fun to hang around
Acting like I did care

I, I got a new distraction
I, I got a new distraction

I used to be so down
No fun to hang around
I used to be so down
No fun to hang around---Lyrics submitted by Derrek Putz.
