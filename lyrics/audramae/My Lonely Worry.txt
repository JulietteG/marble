When you're alone
Do you imagine you're
Dancin' with me.
Whisperin' passionate notions,
In my ear,
Of love set to motion.
Holdin' me near.

When you're away,
I sing the melodies
We used to play
And you come back to me,
Heaven in your voice
I wasn't ready.
You left me no choice.

And my lonely worry
Is I'm too late
For love's impatient belief.
Don't go findin' someone 
To pass your time
And leave you blind to me.

Oh how I'm longing to be
Lyin' beside you,
It's only in my mind
You disappear when I 
Open my eyes.

And my lonely worry
Is I'm too late
For love's impatient belief.
Don't go findin' someone 
To pass your time
And leave you blind to me.

And my lonely worry
Is I'm too late
For love's impatient belief.
Don't go findin' someone 
To pass your time
And leave you blind to me.
Don't close you mind to me.---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
