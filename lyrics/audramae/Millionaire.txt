When I was a little girl
My mama cried, "If only we had
Cold, hard cash."
Barbie dolls and lemonade,
We sold it all, and all we made
Was gone so fast.

Who wants to be a millionare?
Who wants some money to borrow?
Oh, rich man today
Is a poor man tomorrow.

Swimmin' pools and limousines
And cover shot on magazines
And I don't care.
Every answer came to me like
Pictures of my memories
But I'm not there.

Who wants to be a millionare?
Who wants some money to borrow?
Oh, rich man today
Is a poor man tomorrow. 

You know
Money don't grow
On trees,
You know.
And they say,
"You're never gonna run out of money."

Who wants to be a millionare?
Who wants some money to borrow?
Oh, rich man today
Is a poor man tomorrow.

Barbie dolls and lemonade,
We sold it all, and all we made
Was gone so fast.---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
