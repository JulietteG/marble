For certain you go onwards,
For certain you will fight
For certain you will meet your death
And meet the stars this night.
Take you blade and armour,
I'll cloak my face and hide
You'll fight your nation's battle,
And I'll battle at your side.

(Ahhhh, Ahhhh,)

What nation meets (needs) no army,
What army meet no foe,
What soldier travels far and wide,
While wives are free to go'
What would I do to keep you'
I'll cloak my face and hide
I'll veil myself in black and steel,
And battle at your side.

(Ahh, ahhh,)

No mercy have I for you,
No God can save my soul.
I't love and life I fight for
With blade and gun in tow.

(Hey, ahhh)

My darling, please forgive me
I'm feared in every town.
I'm stopless now to save you,
The bandida's coming 'round.
What would I do to keep you'
I'll cloak my face and hide
I'll veil myself in black and steel,
And battle at your side.
