I used to be
The lucky one.
My only task,
To bask in the sun.
My golden years
Came so suddenly.
Now I just try to pretend
It doesn't torture me.

Loosin' all I ever wanted. 
Learning' what I really need,
I made lighting in a bottle 
But I forgot the recipe.

If you had seen
My golden hair
Fallin' down around
My shoulder, bare,
You'de have done for me
What ever I asked you to.
Now when you look at me 
I feel you seein' through.
My golden years
Came so suddenly.
Now I just try to pretend
It doesn't torture me.

Loosin' all I ever wanted. 
Learning' what I really need,
I made lighting in a bottle 
But I forgot the recipe.

Oh, I made lightning in a bottle,
But I... forgot the recipe.

Why won't the time
Come back to me?
And why didn't I
Grab ahold and seize
All the days I spent
Lying' there, in the sun,
prayin' for some way
To make a little fun?---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
