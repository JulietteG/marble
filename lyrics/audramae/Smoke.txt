Fire on the hill.
Blood on the ground.
Not what you see
On the good side of town.
Not what you'd think.
Gone in a blink of an eye.
Did he know?

Silent and still,
His broken prayer
Falls from his lips,
Vanishing in thin air.
Falls to his knees, 
Breathing his sweet lullaby.
And he knows

But could he tell?
Stuck like a horse
On a carousel.
All of the plans 
That he made himself
May as well be smoke.

What's left undone
Pours from his side.
Soul fades away
As an ambulance cries.
So close to home.
There all alone in the dark
And he knows

Last night,
Somebody's baby,
Last night.
Somebody's baby died.---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
