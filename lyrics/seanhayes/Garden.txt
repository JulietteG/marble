When the morning breaks
We will be out walking

We will watch the sun
Rise above the wall

We will ask ourselves
What road to take

We will catch our hearts
You and I
decide

(oh oh oh, oh oh.)

Where to take our journey
(oh oh oh, oh oh)

How high to fly

(oh oh oh, oh oh.)

Love to love our turning

(ohhhhh, oh oh.)
You and I(you and i)



Take the road we take
Then we improvise

When the road it breaks
There will be surprises

Live to grow with fate
Wake to see your Time

Catch your heart with mine
You and I decide
(oh oh oh, oh oh.)

Where to take our journey 
(oh oh oh, oh oh.)

how high to fly
(oh oh oh, oh oh.)

love to love our turning
(ohhhhhhh, oh oh)

You and I, you and I

You and I, you and I

You and I, You and I


Garden
grows around
us 

You and I, You and I

Garden
grows around
us 

You and I, you and I---Lyrics submitted by Britani.
