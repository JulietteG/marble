Three in the morning closing in
Living in pain, living in sin
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out

Red walls looking for distraction
Red walls looking for distraction
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Simple simple man you're gonna make it out

Two Seabee, cigarette smoke
Sunday night is long and cold
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
It's all over man, you're gonna make it out

Broken hand, a broken wall
broken love, crash and fall
Simple simple man you're gonna make it out
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out

Get up girl, heard you sing
Get up girl, sing for me
Keep it simple now you're gonna make it out
It's all over man, you're gonna make it out

Fire is burning me inside out
Fire is burning me inside out...

It's all over, just like that
A fire comes and you can't strike back
It's all over, just like that
A fire comes and you can't strike back
It's all over, just like that
When the fire comes you can't strike back now
It's all over, just like that
A fire comes and you can't strike back

Desire is burning me inside out
Desire is burning me inside out...---Lyrics submitted by Alex Osborne.
