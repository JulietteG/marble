It started out a dream
Young Bobby, 17
When he spotted sweet Sarah Bluehard(spelling?)
He boldly came around 
She gently turned him down
Said they prob'ly wouldn't share hearts
Bobby kept his head on straight 
Walked up to her gate
Saying, "I have come to court you"
She couldn't turn him down

They dated for a while
Then Bobbly with a smile
Said that soon they would be married
A twinkle in her eye, 
Sweet Sarah with a sigh 
Said they prob'ly wouldn't marry 
Bobby kept his head on straight
Said just don't be late 
For I know you really love me
She couldn't turn him down

Now Bobby's got a wife
He's happy with his life
But sweet Sarah wants a baby
She wants a girl and boy
To be their daddy's joy
But her Bobby just said maybe
Bobby's got his head on straight
Sarah couldn't wait
Now there's Joe and little Mary
He couldn't turn her down---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
