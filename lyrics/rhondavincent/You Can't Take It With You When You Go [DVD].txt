Watch where you're standing,when you close the door.  Cause if your on the wrong side it won't open anymore.  Be sure before you leave me, that it's the only way.  Take off your coat and think about, what I'm about to say.

I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul completely.  You've got my dreams, you've got everything that I need if you leave me alone.  I'll give you my love for the rest of my life but I want to make sure you know.  You can't take it with you when you go.

I hear what you're saying but I don't believe it's you.  Tellin' me thats it's all over, after all  we've been through.  If you found a new love then just tell me so.  And I'll make it easy, so she'll never know.
