Well the streets are on fire
But at least I've got you, babe
And my brain's getting tired
But at least I've got you, babe
Ah, my income is low
But at least I've got you, babe
And my car's gotta go
But at least I've got you, babe

'Cause without you
I'd have nothing to do

The atmosphere's screwed
But at least I've got you, babe
The economy, too
But at least I've got you, babe
Our wells are all dry
But at least I've got you, babe
And the trees say goodbye
But at least I've got you, babe

'Cause without you
I'd have nothing to do

And no matter how hard I try
I just can't give up and die
So in the mean time while I choose
At least I can escape to you

Well it's all coming down
But at least I've got you, babe
I can't relate to my home town
But at least I've got you, babe
I wanna change things so bad
But at least I've got you, babe
Well the whole world makes me mad
But at least I've got you, babe

'Cause without you
I'd have nothing to do
Yeah without you
I'd have nothing to do---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
