Tom Tonnerelli is-a prone to frustration
Suki isn't too self-assured
Sadie is the lady with the 50 neuroses
To whom Doctor Sloan referred

Poor Moriani he can't help himself
'Cause Anna keeps letting him down
Well Gore smells trouble from a mile away
So he walks with his nose to the ground

Please light a candle for poor Molten Eddie
And please say a prayer for Elaine
She's got a brain like a gyroscope
It spins when you call out her name

Try not to notice as you pass Tiny Tony
He only comes up to your knees
Well don't ask Alice what's been bugging her now
She'll explode like TNT

I don't know
The how and the why
I don't know
I'm just passin' by
I don't know 
The how and the why
I don't know

Sabco the strangler
He longs to repent
He always wears a box on his head
Lisa Cupatissa thinks she has a disease
So she checks herself to see if she's dead
Mickey the Magician made a fatal mistake
He turned himself into a drag
Now Monahara only wants to talk to somebody
But his throat only opens to gag

I don't know
What can I do?
I don't know
I'm just passin' through
I don't know
What can I do?
I don't know

I
I 
I just wish
I just wish
I wish that I could

I don't know---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
