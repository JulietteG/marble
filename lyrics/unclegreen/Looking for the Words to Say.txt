I saw something on the ceiling
And it captured my gaze
As it led to a doorway that led to a maze and I
Followed it down and it swalloed me whole and it
Grafted myself to the wall
It grafted myself to the wall

I saw something at the window
And it opened up my eyes
As it lured me into following
I was fully hypnotized and I
Drifted to my room
In the middle of the sea where
No one could get to me
Where no one could get to me

And you wonder where I went to
And you wonder why, you wonder what I've done
Well I was just looking
For the words to say
For the words to say

Well I thought I heard a voice call out my name (Matthew)
So I left you there sleeping
And I walked down the stairs and I 
Opened the door, and with all my mind I
Hurled myself into the night
I hurled my self into the night

And you wonder where I went to
And you wonder why, you wonder what I've done
Well I was just looking
For the words to say
Just the words to say---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
