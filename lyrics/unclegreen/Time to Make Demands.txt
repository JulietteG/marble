You want the helpful hand
You get the spiked punch
You want the Holiday
You get the cold lunch

You want the pick-me-up
You get the tranquilizer
You want the genuine
You get the synthesizer

Whoa! 
Whoa!
It's time to make demands

You want the second shot
You get the last chance
You want the truth, but
You get irrelevance

You want the good word
You get the hard facts
You want the Boardwalk
You get the Income Tax

Whoa!
Whoa!
It's time to make demands

Well it's said that to get what you want
never let them change your mind
'Cause they'll feed you all this crap
Just like they're doin' something kind
Well it's up to you to make the offer no one can refuse

You want the sure fire
You get the false alarm
You want the gentle touch
You get the strong arm

You want the open road
You get the set of shackles
You want the pedigree
You get the pack of jackals

Whoa! Whoa!
It's time to make demands
It's time to make demands

Well it's time (to make demands)
It's time (to make demands)
It's time (to make deamnds)
It's time (to make demands)
Well it's time (to make demands)
It's time (to make demands)
It's time time time time (to make demands)---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
