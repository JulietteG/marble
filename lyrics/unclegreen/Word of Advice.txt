These things must be fixed 
before you can break them again.
Take a Word of Advice from a monster
you might call a friend.
You're breaking my heart with your runaway train
on a track leading straight to Gibraltar.
It's smart to be steady and strong,
but it's nicer to falter.

I gave you a harness to wear in the worst situations.
'Cause I've always believed you should savor your best limitations.
Embrace a mistake
Hug a "What did I do?"
Kiss an error
And tell them you care.
'Cause it's smart to be wary, but Jesus
it gets you nowhere.

Well, they may keep you sane
but it takes more than brains
to be happy.
Use your skin and your bones
and your muscular tongues
to ring out, sing out, whoa now, now

Sharpen your senses and use all your fingers as feelers
Take a Word of Advice from a monster you might call a healer.
Sunrise, sunset
they're a blur of corruptions
they wait at your door for a duel.
Well, it's smart to play Mission Control
but don't be a fool.

'Cause they may keep you sane
but it takes more than brains
to be happy.
Use your skin and your bones
and your muscular tongues
to ring out, sing out, well....

Sharpen your senses and use all your fingers as feelers
Take a Word of Advice from a monster you might call a healer.
Sunrise, sunset
they're a blur of corruptions
they wait at your door for a duel.
Well, it's smart to play Mission Control
but don't be a fool.

Yes, it's smart to play Mission Control,
but don't be a fool.---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
