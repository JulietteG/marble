Your picture hangs on the door
It's hung there a thousand times before
It reminds me of a day not long ago
You were wearing that dress that I know

Like the dress that you wore today
Like the dress that you wore today

I met you in our favorite cafe
It rained and the whole sky was gray
And it's raining again today
Yeah it's raining again today

And I wonder are we one or
Am I asking the wrong questions again?
And the time flies
And the gray skies
Grow dark with my wandering whims

Later back in my room
No one around
The chiming of the grandfather clock
Was the only sound

But the clock doesn't chime today
No, the clock doesn't chime today

Not today

Today
Today
Today---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
