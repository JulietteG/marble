If I have to take a hammer and hit you on the head
Then that's just what I'll have to do
If the both of us are better off dead
That's not up to me, that's up to you

If you wanna keep me quiet, just give me a reason 
So I don't have to tell you what I feel
If you wanna keep me talking, just gimme a tragic
And I'll tell you all about the real deal
It's coming back to me
Yeah, the real deal
Is coming back to me

I don't care how hard you try
You don't understand where I'm coming from
Though you might think that I'm a-waving goodbye
I'm only looking for some time to catch up
On what I've missed
And the cobwebs tell me time
Is the only thing that I've missed

It's all coming back to me
When I'm asleep at night
And now it's five o'clock
And it's coming back to me
As the clouds pass before my sight
Yeah it's all coming back to me
As the waves crash over my head
Yeah, it' five o'clock
And it's coming back to me
As I lie awake
In my bed

If I have to take a hammer and hit you on the head
Then that's just what I'll have to do
If the both of us are better off dead
That's not up to me, that's up to you
Man, I'm doing all I can
For you, man, I'm doing all I can
All I can
All I can
Yeah, all I can
All I can---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
