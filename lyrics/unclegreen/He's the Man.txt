Salvation
lies at the end of the eclipse
Frustration
crushes in it's grip

He's the one with all the answers
He's the Man
He's the end to all our problems
He's the Man

Almation
strong in the wake of misdeed
Frustration
ends from those in need

He's the golden opportunity
He's the Man
He's the one to save both you and me
He's the Man

I think I'm finally satisfied
I think they finally heard our cries
I think that He's the best thing yet to come along

A Temptation
is His perfect and solemn vow
Frustration
is ended for all of us now

He's the wonderful arrival
He's the Man
He's guaranteed survival
He's the Man

I think I'm finally satisfied
I think they finally heard our cries
I think that He's the best thing yet to come along

He's the Man (frustration)
He's the Man (salvation)
He's the Man (frustration)
He's the Man (salvation)
Yeah - He's the Man (frustration)
Well - He's the Man (salvation)
Hey, Hey He's the Man (frustration)
He's the Man (salvation)---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
