Nebkheperure
Wake up little holy one
Been a long time
Since you stood beneath the sun
Look at what's been done

When you open up your eyes
you'll be surprised
Just remember that
Kingdoms fall and rise
And it isn't a reflection on you
You did everything that you could do

Nebkheperure
Now it's time to rise and shine
We've collected
Everything you left behind
It'll blow your mind

Was a place called Rome
It came and went
It was strange and wild and magnificent
But the party didn't last too long
'Cause the took a breath and they were gone

But maybe 
Maybe you're still dreaming
Maybe you're not anywhere
Now listen
Can you hear the silence
Calling you to join them there?

Nebkheperure
Isn't it a little strange?
Look around you
Everything's been rearranged
Given all new names

In a far away museum
You'll find your throne
But everybody that you loved 
has come and gone
While you slept away the years underground
But I wouldn't let it get you down

Cause maybe
Maybe you're still dreaming
Maybe you're not anywhere
Now listen
Can you hear the silence
Calling you to join them there?---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
