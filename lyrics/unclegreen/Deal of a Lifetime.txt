Anywhere that he turn
Fall out the wrong side of bed
He nail a Do Not Disturb sign
Into the back of his head
He read the morning paper
He watch the evening news
It's evil versus evil
He like to pick and choose

Yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah
It's the deal of a lifetime

Well, he tell 'em what to do
at the sound of the tone
He tell 'em leave a message
He tell 'em leave me alone
It's going 'round the office
It's just a crazy hunch
When he's in the store room
They say he's out to lunch

Yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah
It's the deal of a lifetime

Hey!
You know I really hate to mention
I hate to throw a monkey wrench in
But it isn't like a pension
What you're thinking of as heaven now

He got himself a motto
To tell the people he meet
The nature of survival
Is in admitting defeat
Well, it takes a lot of chutzpah
It take a lot of nerve
To go and ask for nothin'
And get just what you deserve

Yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah
It's the deal of a lifetime

Of a lifetime (It's the deal)
Of a lifetime (It's the deal)
Of a lifetime (It's the deal)
Of a lifetime (It's the deal)
Of a lifetime (It's the deal)
Of a lifetime (It's the deal)---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
