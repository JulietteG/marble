I know all about you
And I know what you're going through
I can read your situation
I can see your point of view

For twenty years we've shared this bed
And it hasn't worn well on you
You seem too happy with the tired routines
I can tell what you're up to, but

Don't forget about me
I know all about you
Don't forget about me
I know all about you

I know all about you
I've been through your highs and lows
Has something gotten into you
Well I wonder where she blows, well

Don't forget about me
I know all about you
Don't forget about me
I know all about you

I know all about you
Every weakness that you can't explain (I know all about you)
You took me down every peak and valley
Every landscape in your brain

And now I know the way to your heart
Well I can hit your jugular vein
So do you wanna take a walk with me?
A wild ride down memory lane, because

Well you can throw me any valid excuse
But in the end you'll take the blame
'Cause I know all about you, darlin'
And I know you know the same, same, so

Don't forget about me
I know all about you
Don't forget about me
I know all about you
Don't forget about me
I know all about you---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
