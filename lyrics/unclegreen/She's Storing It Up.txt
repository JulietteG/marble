I know the game and I can't win
She shuts her mouth and just gives in
With each and every mortal sin
She knows exactly where I've been
I know she's storing it up

She says no matter what I do
I'm making no demands on you
With everything I've put her through
I know what she's been driven to
I know she's storing it up

And when the time is advantageous
Then I know she'll be courageous
Play her cards, and let me down
She'll bury this baby right into the ground

Her forgiveness makes me furious
Because she's making me notorious
And she'll appear victorious
I know she will emerge victorious
I know she's storing it up

And when the time is advantageous
That's when I know she'll be courageous
Play her cards, and let me down
She'll bury this baby right into the ground

Oh no
yeah
I know she storing it up---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
