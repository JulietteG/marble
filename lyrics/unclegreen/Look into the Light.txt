I don't really wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna think about it
What I want is something you don't have
And I'm gonna learn to live without it

(I am) wising up
(I can) come to grips
(I know) that I should
Look into the light

I don't really wanna talk about it
Everything's been discussed too much
What I want is something you don't have
It's an issue that we just can't touch

(I am) rising up
(I can) come to grips
(I know) that I should
Look into the light

The words just don't cut it
The words all fall short
Each word I speak now
I want to abort
We're pretending that
We agree
But's that's the foundation
That shakes under me
That shakes under me, yeah

I don't really wanna talk about it
I can see there's nothing left to say
What I want is something you don't have
And I'm gonna give it up one day

(I am) rising up
(I can) come to grips
(I know) that I should
Look into the light
Look into the light
Look into the light

I don't really wanna talk about it (Look into the light)
I don't even wanna think about it (Look into the light)
I don't really wanna talk about it (Look into the light)
I don't even wanna think about it (Look into the light)
Think about it
Think about it (Look into the light)
Think about
Think about (Look into the light)
Think about it
Think about it---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
