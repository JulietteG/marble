There's a whole lotta crap
Comin' out of your yap
I caught a little bit of it
And it landed in my lap
I'm gonna stick it in the post box
With all your other junk and trash
And I hope upon receipt, they will shove it up your ass

Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?

There's a whole lotta shit
Comin' off of your lips
You've got a thousand nasty words
At your fingertips
I think you're proud of what you do
I think you think that you're a talent
But you're a fucking Moussolini
With a giant rubber mallet

Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?

I don't mind, I don't care, It's not right, It's not right, It's not fair
I don't care, It's not fair, It's not right, I don't mind
It's not fair, It's not fair, It's not right, I don't care

There's a whole lotta waste
Comin' off of your face
You're just a walking contradiction
You're just a genuine disgrace
And in another hundred years
Well, we both will be forgotten
But my corpse will be beautiful
And your corpse will be rotten

Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?

I don't mind, I don't care, It's not right, It's not right, It's not fair
I don't care, It's not fair, It's not right, I don't mind
It's not fair, It's not fair, It's not right, I don't care

Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?
Wassamatta with you?---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
