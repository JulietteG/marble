The point of a landslide
Disturbing and damaging
You're speaking in tongues-tied
You're not saying anything
You light up a switchboard
And choke on the frequency
You're crackin the pavement
You don't really mean to be, yeah

Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth

A blaze in the basement
It rise up an artery
To scramble the input
To blend with the scenery
The blur of a landscape
The burst of a symphony
Ya spit up a phrase that
results in a tradegy, yeah

Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth

You know
That you just can't make that sound
So you
Gotta close it, close it down

The heart of the problem
Of screaming intensity
The size of an eyeball
The force of ferocity
Ya break out in pin pricks
Ya hide in a cavity
You cough up a word but
It's subject to gravity, yeah

Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth
Misfit mouth

You know
That you just can't make that sound
So you
Gotta close it, close it down---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
