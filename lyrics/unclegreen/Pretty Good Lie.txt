I had an urge
Or maybe it was just a thought
I don't know what

I had a plan
I thought it was the way to go
Now I know the truth

It was a pretty good lie
It got me by, but now I have to leave
It was a pretty good lie
But now I need another to believe

I took it on
I wrote it and I played it out
Without a doubt

It took awhile
To recognize it as a dream
It didn't seem to be

It was a pretty good lie
It got me by, but now I have to leave
It was a pretty good lie
But now I need another to believe

And so it goes
I'm out of work, the day was done
No light, no sun

And so I lie
I lie awke upon my bed
Clear my head, again

It was a pretty good lie
It got me by, but now I have to leave
It was a pretty good lie
But now I need another to believe

I need another to believe---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
