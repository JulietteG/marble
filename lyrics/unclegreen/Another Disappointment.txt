When the meager foundation that's keeping me up just collapses
And I can't restrain my doubts to momentary lapses
It's then that I have to admit
(I hate to admit it)
It's then that I have to admit
(I hate to admit it)
It's then that I have to admit
Every day is just another disappointment
Every day is just another disappointment

When the tenuous motor that runs my mind shuts down
And I lose whatever voice I thought I had found
It's then that I have to admit
(I hate to admit it)
It's then that I have to admit
(I hate to admit it)
It's then that I have to admit
Everywhere is just another disappointment
Everywhere is just another disappointment

Well just one time I like to see
the sun burst in the sky
And set to blaze the clouds as they roll by
Well just one time I'd love to see
the lightning strike the ground
And spread into this world that runs me down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

No
No, oh

My precarious notion of faith starts disappating
All around me the powers that be start understating
And it's then that I have to admit
(I hate to admit it)
It's then that I have to admit
(I hate to admit it)
It's then that I have to admit
Every dream is just another disappointment
Every dream is just another disappointment
And everywhere is just another disappointment
And every day is just another disappointment---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
