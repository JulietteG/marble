As he's slippin' in between her sheets
She sighs, "Could you turn on the lights, so I can see your eyes?"
He thinks, "There's nothin' to read there."
"I don't think you can find what it is that you need there."

Placing his head in the heat of her neck
He gives nothing more than the least she expects
It's not so easy to be so controlled
But it's something he'll master before he grows old

He knows if she could she would take him somewhere
Where his dreams would be free to get tangled up in her hair
When she says she could free him, he doesn't doubt it
He tells himself, "I don't wanna know about it."
"No, no. I don't wanna know about it."

Well just look at the trick the magician conceives
How she eats from his hand, when there's nothing to feed
When she wants him, he slices a meager percent
Like it's all that he's got, like it's all that she meant
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

He knows if she could she would take him somewhere
Where his dreams would be free to get tangled up in her hair
When she says she could free him, he doesn't doubt it
He tells himself, "I don't wanna know about it."
"No, no. I don't wanna know about it."

Slpping in between her legs, he decides
It's a good place to be, it's a great place to hide
From the love that he's had, from the love that could be
"From the love that keeps looking to level me!"
Hey, hey, hey ,hey, yeah

He knows if she could she would take him somewhere
Where his dreams would be free to get tangled up in her hair
When she says she could free him, he doesn't doubt it
He tells himself, "I don't wanna know about it."

I don't wanna know about it
I don't wanna know about it
I don't wanna know about it
Hey yeah---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
