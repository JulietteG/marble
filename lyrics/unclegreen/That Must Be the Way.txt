I don't mind
I know I'm thinking it
I just hate
I just hate hearing it

But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
'Cause that's the way it is with me
'Cause that's the way it is with me

I don't mind
I know I'm thinking it
I just hate
I just hate feeling it

But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
'Cause that's the way it is with me
'Cause that's the way it is with me

I don't want
Any sympathy
If it can't 
Be real
I don't want
Want you here with me
Like some
Big deal
I don't want
To know
Where all of this is coming from
'Cause I don't
Wanna know
How much decisions I've left undone

I don't mind
I know I'm singing it
I just hate
I just hate hearing it

But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
But that must be the way that it is (with everyone)
'Cause that's the way it is with me
'Cause that's the way it is with me

I could start
To apologize
Once again
I even want to
I could play
Like it was my fault again
And try
To please you
I could do
Any of
The same old million things I've thought of before
'Cause the sun
Always burns me
But I've always gone back for more---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
