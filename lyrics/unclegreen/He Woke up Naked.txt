He woke up naked beside something bad
It's eyes were all swolen, it's face was so sad
He said something futile, he leapt from the bed
But he heard a voice singing inside his head

How can you live with what you've done?
How could you hope that you could?
How could you think these condolences would do any good?
Would do any good?

He woke up naked beside something old
It's figure was lifeless, it's flesh was so cold (so cold)
It stared at the ceiling as though it were dead
It whispered remotely, and here's what it said

How can you live with what you've done?
How could you hope that you could?
How could you think these condolences would do any good?
Would do any good?

Sooner or later, the truth is told
But you'd never live to be so bold (to be so bold)
You'll wake up naked beside some thing real
You just might have guessed this is how it would feel

He woke up naked beside something vivid
It's snout was snarling, it's gaze was livid
It tore at his flesh, it left him in threads
And this is the way the obituary read

How can you live with what you've done?
How could you hope that you could?
How could you think these condolences would do any good?
Would do any good?

It won't do no good
(He woke up naked beside something bad)
It won't do no good
(He woke up naked beside something old)
It won't do no good
(He woke up naked beside something sad)
It won't do no good
(He woke up naked beside something cold)
It won't do no good---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
