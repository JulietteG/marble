Take that poor puppy
Tie him down to the wall
To keep him from a-runnin' away
You trained it to practice undying devotion
You trained it to sit up and say

Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
And nobody else

Doctors agree to use all of their skills
To take Sally's brain from her head
Replacing it gently, with hardly a take
In no more the time that was said

Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
And nobody else

Denny Morelli went video crazy
And he taped six hours of fish
He wired their mouths to open and close
And the outcome  turned out something like this

Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
Well it's You (You!), You (You!), You (You!), You (You!)
You, and nobody else
And nobody else---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
