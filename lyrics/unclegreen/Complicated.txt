I don't know how it got started
Well I just don't understand
We've created something bigger than we
Ever really planned

Well what was our intention?
I swear, I just don't know
This isn't how it all began
So many years ago

We must have had a plan
We must have had a dream
But somehow I've forgotten
What it was supposed to mean

And now it's 
Complicated
The paths have all been chosen
Complicated
The webs have all been woven
Complicated
And there ain't no turning back

Oh would you please remind me?
I forgot what we did it for
Now this just leads to that
Just leads to more and more and more

We must have had a plan
We must have had a dream
But somehow I've forgotten
What it was supposed to mean

And now it's 
Complicated
The paths have all been chosen
Complicated
The webs have all been woven
Complicated
And there ain't no turning back

No there's no tunring back
No turning back
No there's no turning back---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
