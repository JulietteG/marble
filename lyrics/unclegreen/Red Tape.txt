Sky full of clutter and it's
raining on me, 
it's just a sticky situation
so inevitably
I have been
Walkin' the streets, and I'm not
Gettin' anywhere, my
Feet just stick to the ground, my
head just sticks in the air

And it seems so convoluted
there doesn't seem to be an escape
Between you and me, baby
There's just a sea of, sea of, sea of
Red Tape

Close my eyes, and lately
I see red, and all the 
conversations just go
through my head, remember

Hold on tight, I swear I
won't let go, you ought to
pinch me when I'm dreamin'
wake me up, and let me know

'Cause it's all so convoluted
there doesn't seem to be an escape
Between you and me, baby
There's just a sea of, sea of, sea of
Red Tape

Red Tape - runnin' through my ears when you're talkin' to me
Red Tape - rushin' through my veins when you look my way
Red Tape - gushin' out of my mouth when I try to speak
Red Tape - screwin' up all th words that I try to say

Sky full of clutter, and it's
rainin' on me, 
it's just a sticky situation, 
so inevitably, I have been
Walkin' the streets, and I'm not
Gettin' anywher, my
feet just stick to the ground, my
head just sticks in the air and it

Seems so convoluted
there doesn't seem to be an escape
Between you and me, baby
There's just a sea of, sea of, sea of
Red Tape---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
