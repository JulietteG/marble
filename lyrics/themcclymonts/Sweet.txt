Here's the situation , I'll try to make it brief 
I was sittin' all alone , enjoying my own company
And I don't remember offering you a seat

But I come with a warnin' and a tag upon my sleeve
I'm not good with borin' so why you borin' me
And I don't like you starrin' at me like that

You wanna see sweet , well there's a bowl of sugar honey
Quit hangin' off shoulder kissin' on me
Well I would rather be hung over 
Lyin' on the couch with a Tshirt on sippin' on a little ice tea

Sweeeeettt , to me that's sweeeeet 

I've got a reputation of breakin' a man's heart
Pulling them to pieces and leave them in the dark
But I can't help that I was brought up like that 

Oh you wanna see sweet , well there's a bowl of sugar honey
Quit hangin' off shoulder kissin' on me
Well I would rather be hung over 
Lyin' on the couch with a Tshirt on sippin' on a little ice tea

Sweeeeettt , to me that's sweeeeet

Sweeeeeeettt

You wanna see sweet , well there's a bowl of sugar honey
Quit hangin' off shoulder kissin' on me
Well I would rather be hung over 
Lyin' on the couch with a Tshirt on sitting with the dogs with the TV on , sippin' on a little ice tea

Sweeeeettt , to me that's sweeeet 
Ooooh yeahhh sweeeettt , oooohhooohhhh
