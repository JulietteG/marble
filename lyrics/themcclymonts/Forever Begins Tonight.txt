I knew the moment I met you
My future finally found me
And it's true, the piece that was missing was you
I cried, the day you ask me to be your wife
I couldn't imagine our love
Will start with a kiss and I do
As you draw me close, I catch my breath

And when we dance, we'll dance forever
In each other arms, stronger together
The day has arrived, start the rest of our lives
Side by side
Forever begins tonight

I knew never give up
And love you to death do as apart
I swear this is my promise to you
Your eyes ain't burn, I found home

And when we dance, we'll dance forever
In each other arms, stronger together
The day has arrived, start the rest of our lives
Side by side
Forever begins tonight

Let's wait and see
Hold me tight
Side by side
Forever begins tonight

And when we dance, we'll dance forever
In each other arms, stronger together
The day has arrived, start the rest of our lives
Side by side

And when we dance, we'll dance forever
In each other arms, stronger together
The day has arrived, start the rest of our lives
Side by side
Forever begins tonight

Forever begins tonight

I knew the moment I met you
And it's true
All I needed was you---
