Drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip
Drip, Drip, Drip
Drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip

I shouldnt laugh, but I know Im a failure in your eyes
I know its daft, but I guess I know it deep inside
It feels like were ready to crack these days, you and I
When its just the two of us, only the two of us, I could die

You left my heart like an abandoned car
Old and worn and no use at all
But I used to be free
Were gonna separate ourselves tonight
Were always running scared but holding knives
But theres a black chandelier
Its casting shadows and lies

Drip, drip, drip

Ill sit in silence for the rest of my life if youd like
Dressing our wounds with industrial gloves made of wire
Feel it penetrating the skin, we begin to relax
When its just the two of us, and a cute little cup of cyanide

You left my heart like an abandoned car
Old and worn and no use at all
But I used to be free

Were gonna separate ourselves tonight
Were always running scared but holding knives
But theres a black chandelier
Its casting shadows and lies
Were gonna separate ourselves tonight
Were always running scared but holding knives
But theres a black chandelier

You left my heart like an abandoned car
Old and worn and no use at all
But I used to be free

Were gonna separate ourselves tonight
Were always running scared but holding knives
But theres a black chandelier
Its casting shadows and lies
Were gonna separate ourselves tonight
Were always running scared but holding knives
But theres a black chandelier
Its casting shadows and lies---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
