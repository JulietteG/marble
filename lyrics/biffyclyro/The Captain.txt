[instrumental]
Whoo!
[short instrumental]

Angels fall to the floor
Like they would if I was Captain.
"Silver children" she roared,
"I'm not the Son of God"

Somebody help me sing:
Can anybody hear me?

Liars and lovers combine tonight,
We're gonna make a scene

Somebody help me sing:
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!               x2

Help me be captain of,
Our crippled disguises.
I won't show what's underneath,
It's time for surprises.

I can't climb up your ladder,
I can't ride your horse.
I've swallowed half an hourglass,
So now the lanscape is swollen up.

I gave birth to a fire,
It's like its features were burning.
I'm in control,
I am the son of God.

Somebody help me sing,
Can anybody hear me?
Line up your soldiers one final time,
We're gonna have a ball.

Somebody help me sing,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!               x2

Help me be Captain of,
Our crippled disguises.
I won't show what's underneath,
It's time for surprises.

I can't climb up your ladder,
I can't ride your horse.
I've swallowed half an hourglass,
So now the landscape is swollen up.

Let's lock death away.                    x8---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
