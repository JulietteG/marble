You say "I love you boy",
I know you lie
I trust you all the same,
I don't know why
'Cause when my back is turned,
My bruises shine
Our broken fairytale,
So hard to hide

I still believe,
It's you and me 'till the end of time

When we colide we come together,
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise,
I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard

Sitting in a wishing hole,
Hoping it stays right
Feet cast in solid stone,
I got Gilligan's eyes

I still believe,
It's you and me 'till the end of time

When we colide we come together,
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise,
I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard

'Cause you said,
"Our love is letting us go"
Guess what...

Our future is for,
Many of horror
Our future's for,
Many of horror

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa...

I still believe,
It's you and me 'till the end of time

When we colide we come together,
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise,
I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
