The son of Henry, I'm the first in line
To the throne, smell my mustard gas
I slash swords through your wooden spine
Well it touched my heart and it broke my hand
I made love at the side of the road
The rain's lashing better row this boat fast
This pretty river is particularly sinister
Close your eyes and take my hand

I want to scream one last death medley
I am looking for a reason to secure a forward motion

Love that golden rule, that golden rule
We need that golden rule, that golden rule
Secrets are the truth, they are the truth
We need that silver rule, that silver rule

I'm face to face with a ball and chain
My bulbous head's flapping til its red
I tell my secrets and expose my pain
I've had a broken heart and I won't do it again
The son of Henry, I'm the first in line
To the throne, smell my mustard gas
I slash swords through your wooden spine
Well it touched my heart and it broke my hand

I want to scream one last death medley
I am looking for a reason to secure a forward motion

We love that golden rule, that golden rule
We need that golden rule, that golden rule
Secrets are the truth, they are the truth
We need that silver rule, that silver rule---Lyrics submitted by Denis.
