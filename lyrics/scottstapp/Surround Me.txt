They say no man's an island but I tend to disagree
I guess they've never seen my island,
And where it lies at sea
I'm lost inside my memory.
I'm still in disbelief.
If I could paint a picture for you this is what you'd see

I'm down on my knees
Begging you to rescue me
Please stop me
Don't let me run
Surround me...Surround me...now

A wounded man sounds desperate when he's lost all his belief
Can you look into my eyes and say you won't betray me
We're running out of time
How precious time can be
I'm counting all the moments of the times you could have helped me

I'm down on my knees
Begging you to rescue me
Please stop me
Don't let me run
Surround me...Surround me

I'm down on my knees
Begging you to rescue me
Please stop me
Don't let me run
Surround me...Surround me

Surround me now---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
