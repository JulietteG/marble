Two kids found dead in the water 
Beside each other
I don't think they drowned
Ring up the mother and father
From the gutter
They didn't want kids around 
Hell no I ain't on your side
But I'm sticking around until I die
Feeling bad 'cause you bought her and then sold her
To the order
Of caring takes too much time
If you want some weight on your shoulders 
Create a border
I'd rather be blind---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
