Do this for me one last time,
I promise I will keep my clothes on,
Never ask you again, 
Never ask you again.

I know these tiny pleasure ain't free,
But I dig it when you stand with me,
In the corner of a crowded room,
In the corner of a crowded room.

Your body in the water,
From my hotel room window,
I saw you swimming,
Tan lines on your back.

Your body in the water,
From my hotel room window,
I saw you swimming,
Hair falls down your back


[Interlude]


The husband says he knows Karate,
The light shake of the snow globe tells me,
you're a caller of things by their name,
You're a caller of things by their name.

Do this for me one last time,
I promise I will keep my clothes on,
Never ask you again,
Never ask you again.

Your body in the water, 
From my hotel window,
I saw you swimming
Tan lines on your back,

Your body in the water,
From my hotel room window,
I saw you swimming,
Hair falls down your back---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
