(Pre-Chrous) 
I'll follow my dreams 
You'd think they we're nightmares 
The way they scream 
I'll make them believe 
Someday(X2) 
I'm gonna be the next big thing 

(1st Verse) 
I never doubt my dreams 
Always live 'em out 
Imma tell the world 
They gotta hear me out 
Just give me one mic 
So I can scream it loud 
And I just need someone 
That I can make proud 
"Cuz I can't wait for that Someday 
And that Someday it is coming 
I wanna share my life with someone 
Who loves me just for me 
I wanna wish up to the stars I can 
I wanna see the lights & the crowd in the stands 
See myself there like a dream in the past 
And everything I want Imma get it at last 
And I know that there's no limit 
We perusing all our dreams and 
We gon make it 
And tell the world that the best is yet to come can you hear me? Oh 

(Pre-Chrous) 
I'll follow my dreams 
You'd think they we're nightmares 
The way they scream 
I'll make them believe 
Someday(X2) 
I'm gonna be the next big thing 

(Chrous) 
Someday I'll be the next big thing (X3) 
Someday(X2) 
I'm gonna be the next big thing 

(2nd Verse) 
Now that I'm older I think about it 
I was really having fun too cool about it 
I guess moms was predicting the future 
She knew that one day I was gon move ya 
But now I see everything a little different 
The world looks bigger and the sky is the limit 
I'm always looking out for myself and family 
They gonna be surprised shouting out "oh we" 
I got it 
Everything my momma wanted from me I got it 
Anybody come and take it from me I got it 
'Cuz it's all I'm so close I can dream about it 
I can feel I got it music I'm all about it 
I'm here to make a change I'mma be about it 
I didn't come this far to stop now 
And I can't rest til I get my dreams found out 

(Pre-Chrous) 
I'll follow my dreams 
You'd think they we're nightmares 
The way they scream 
I'll make them believe 
Someday(X2) 
I'm gonna be the next big thing 

(Chrous) 
Someday I'll be the next big thing (X3) 
Someday(X2) 

(3rd Verse) 
One day I'm gon be king of the palace 
When I reigned I'll be in the Metalloids 
Everything will be OK 
Every single day all day 
You can follow me if you wanna go 
I'mma take the lead I got the star role 
Twinkle in the night like the star goes 
When you see us you know 
(Chrous) 
The next big thing 
Someday I'll be the next big thing (X3) 
Someday(X2) 
I'm gonna be the next big thing ---
