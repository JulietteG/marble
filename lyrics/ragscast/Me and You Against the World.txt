You can go the distance.
Me And You Against The World.
Sky is the limit.
Push to the finish.
Me And You Against The World.
We did it for love.
We tried and we won.
We'll never give up.
It's Me And You Against The World.

What I know right now, this guy came so far to my heart.
He got a key.
I was lost then you found me.
Through all the glamour.
That's the lights and the cameras.
Honestly, all you saw was me.
You didn't care what they said.
You stood by me instead.
Together, we're a stronger team, oh.

Put your heart in it.
You can go the distance.
Me And You Against The World.
Sky is the limit.
Push to the finish.
Me And You Against The World.
We did it for love.
We tried and we won.
We'll never give up.
It's Me And You Against The World.

I know from my dreams, they say I'm crazy.
No matter what, we go around.
It feels like we both are certain.
It's the real thing, nothing beats the feeling.
Only our hearts can know.
Who cares what they say?
They can't get in our way.
Two dreamers just dreaming alo-o-one.

Put your heart in it.
You can go the distance.
Me And You Against The World.
Sky is the limit.
Push to the finish.
Me And You Against The World.
We did it for love.
We tried and we won.
We'll never give up.
It's Me And You Against The World.

We fight together.
We're down forever.
Me And You Against The World.
We stick together and it gets better.
Me And You Against The World.

Put your heart in it.
You can go the distance.
Me And You Against The World.
Sky is the limit.
Push to the finish.
Me And You Against The World.
We did it for love.
We tried and we won.
We'll never give up.
It's Me And You Against The World.

Put your heart in it.
You can go the distance.
