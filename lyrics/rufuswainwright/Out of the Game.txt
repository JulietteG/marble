I'm out of the game 
I've been out for a long time Now
I'm looking for something 
Can't be found on the main tracks no
Im out of the game
I've been out for a long time now
I'm looking for something
Cant be found on the main tracks no

Look at you,look at you,look at you,look at you 
Sucker does your mama know
What your doing 

Look at you,look at you,look at you,look at you 
Sucker does your mama know

What your doing 

Your only a child
With the mind of a senile man
Your only a young thing
About to sleep with a sea of men
Just hanging around 
Wearing something from god knows where
Just having a ball
Making all of the thin cards fall

Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Suckers does your mama know what you're doing
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Suckers does your mama know what you're doing

Say come over here
Let me smell you for one last for one last time
Before you go out there
And ruin all of the world once mine
I'm out of the game
Ive been out for a long time now
I'm looking for something 
That can't be found on the main drag no

Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Suckers does your mama know what you're doing
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Suckers does your mama know what you're doing---Lyrics submitted by chloe jones.
