No giving up, right
Just figure out what it takes
(I should be learning the rules instead of burning the tapes)
I know it ain't right
I'm bending it 'til it brakes
(If I had listened to you, we wouldn't be in this place)
I may be uptight
But you ain't no piece of cake
(And now quit actin' a fool, but you won't go when you face?)
Give it up, right
I hope I got what it takes
(You were tryin' to be cool by lettin' up off the brakes)

I don't have anywhere else to go
(Well girl you can get it, but shake that attitude)
Now I don't care if you wanted to know
(Cause the atmosphere we're creatin' we've never seen it before)

I can't even lie
I love it when our worlds collide
In the end

(See, I'm like, I'm like) All black and half white
Without a moment to waste
(I want to know what to do but I don't to wait)
No more than half right
As long as its never fake
(Even when tellin' the truth became a fatal mistake)

I don't have anywhere else to go
(And girl you can get it, but shake that attitude)
And I don't care if you wanted to know
(Cause the atmosphere we're creatin' we've never seen it before)

And now I can't even lie
I love it when our-- you know,
And now I can't even lie
I love it when our worlds collide
When we almost died
But we still survive
In the end

You see,
I can't even lie
I love it when our-- said I know that you know,
I can't even lie
I love it when our worlds collide
When we almost died
But we still survive
In the end---Lyrics submitted by Hope.
