I got a message from you
You sent it over to me 
I played it back on my phone
You had me feeling confused
Cause I was hanging with you 
When I was feeling at home
the words were strong 
and aimed to get at what I grown

But I expected from you and see the things that you do and how you never come home

But How would you know?

When we were playing in bars you had me feeling like it was all a  favor to me
It had me borrowing cars and asking people for rides and could they do it for free

That day I thought those things would never
After a couple of years I came to grips with my fears and realized I was wrong

But how would you, How would you know?

A crutch is not a crutch when its a promise to myself
I hope you recognize before there's someone else who might not ever let you know

But how would you know?

When people come up to me and want to talk about you
they say forgive and forget

Its just so easy to say 
And all the same walk away with out a trace of regret

But they don't know about the messages you left
I think if everyone knew about the things that you do
They'd lose a lot of respect
(Lot of respect, but how would you know)

How would you know?

A crutch is not a crutch when its a promise to myself
I hope you recognize before there's someone else who might not ever let you know

But how would you know?---Lyrics submitted by Mike Dash.
