You choose the humble and raise them high,
You choose the weak and make them strong,
You heal our brokenness inside, and give us life.

The same love that set the captives free,
The same love that opened eyes to see
Is calling us all by name,
You are calling us all by name.

The same God that spread the heavens wide,
The same God that was crucified,
Is calling us all by name,
You are calling us all by name.

You take the faithless one aside,
And speak the words, You are mine!
You call the cynic and the proud,
Come to me, now!

The same love that set the captives free,
The same love that opened eyes to see
Is calling us all by name,
You are calling us all by name.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Youre calling, Youre calling,
Youre calling us to the cross.

Youre calling
Youre calling
Youre calling

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Youre calling, Youre calling,
Youre calling us to the cross.

Youre calling---Lyrics submitted by Marlene Sparrow.
