I have fought the good fight
I have finished the race
I have kept the faith
I have kept the faith

And now there is in store for me
The crown of righteousness
Which the Lord the righteous judge
Will award to me on that day
And not only to me but also to all
Who have longed for His appearing---Lyrics submitted by Roxane Christy.
