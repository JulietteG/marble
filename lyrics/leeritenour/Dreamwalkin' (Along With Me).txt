i know when I am far away
that no one else can see
a beautiful place where i can stay
where there's no reality

i close my eyes and think of you
and its like you'd never gone
imagined you're here to share the view
and i can't live in any world without your love

Ref.
I wish that you could be dreamwalkin along with me 3x

Beauty is very hard to find
so i live in fantasy
far from the world i left behind
where there's only tragedy

i know a place where miracles
can happen everyday
i dreamed of a world so wonderful
where im walking hand in hand
with you my love

repeat ref.
bridge.

when your world is on the rush
just go for a dreamwalk.
