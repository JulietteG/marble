Nihilists with good imaginations

I am satisfied hiding in a friend's appartment
Only leaving once a day to buy some groceries
Daytime, I'm so absent minded
Nighttime, meeting new anxieties
So am I erasing myself?
Hope I'm not erasing myself

I guess it would be nice
To give my heart to a god, but which one,
Which one do I chose?
All the churches filled with losers
Psycho or confused.
I just want to hold the divine in mind
And forget, all of the beauty's wasted.

Lets fall back to earth and do something pleasant, say it 
We fell back to earth like gravity's bitches
Physics makes us all into bitches

I guess it would be nice to help in your escape
From patterns you parents designed
All the party people dancing for the indie star
But he the worst faker by far in the set
I forget, all the beauty's wasted

I guess it would be nice
Show me that things could be nice
I guess it could be nice (your trapped)
Show me that things could be nice

You've got my back in the city
You've got my back 'cause I don't want to panic
You've got my back in the city
You've got my back 'cause I don't want to panic.---Lyrics submitted by Hetty.
