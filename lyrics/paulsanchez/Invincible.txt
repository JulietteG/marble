I wish to hell i knew someone in Tokyo
I'd call 'em right now
It's late here and I'm all alone
I keep thinking that I got somewhere to go
I don't know how
I'm too tired to find my way home
I close my eyes and start rememberin'
The way we were back then

Chorus
We were invincible
It was our time and our day
We were invincible
And no one can take it away

I wish I had a ticket for an airplane
Somewhere unknown
A place I've not seen before
To a country with a language I can't even name
Where there's no phones and no one to call anymore
I close my eyes and start rememberin' 
The way we were back then

Repeat chorus

Time, time, time plays tricks on you
If you want it to
Line, line, line-crossing's what I'll do 
To get through to you

Desperation mingles with uncertainty
Night's nearly gone
I hope soon I'll be asleep
Head is spinning words are winning once again
I thought I heard you say

We were invincible
It was our time and our day
We were invincible
And no one can take it away
We were invincible, invincible we were invincible 
We thought we were invincible---Lyrics submitted by Antoine D.
