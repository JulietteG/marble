You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

[Verse 1 - Flo Rida]:
 Hey
 Hopped out of that house with my swagger
 Hop in that with girl, I got places to go!
 People to see, time is precious
 I look at my crowd and they out of control
 Just like my mind where Im going
 No women, no shorties, no nothin but clothes
 No stoppin now, my parolees on role
 I like my jewelry, thats always on gold
 I know the storm is comin
 my pockets keep tellin me its gonna shower
 Call up my homies thats home
 Then pop in the night cuz its meant to be ours
 We keep a fade away shot cuz we ballin
 its platinum patron that be ours
 Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
 Girl you too drunk with all that and power clubs

[Chorus - Flo Rida (Kesha)]:
 You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down
 From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down

[Verse 2 - Flo Rida]:
 Hey
 Shawty must know I'm not playin
 My money love her like a numba one fan
 Dont look at my mouth, let her talk to my fans
 My Benjamin Franklin
 A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
 My paper planes makin a dance
 Get dirty all night, thats part of my thing
 Keep building castles thats made out of sand
 Shes amazing, the fire blazing
 Hotter than Cajun
 Girl wont you move a lil closer
 Time to get paid, its maximum wage
 That body belong on a poster
 Im in a daze, that bottom is wavin at me
 Like damn it I know you
 You wanna show like a gun out of holster
 Tell me whatever and Ill be your roper ..

[Chorus - Flo Rida (Kesha)]:
 You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down
 From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down

[Verse 3 - Flo Rida]:
 Im feelin my money
 Im out of control
 Somebody help me
 Shes takin my bank roll
 But Im king of the club
 And Im wearin the crown
 Poppin these bottles
 Touchin these models
 Watchin they asses go down down (down, down...)

You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)---Lyrics submitted by mohamin.
