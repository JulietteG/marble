And we gotta couple of rounds of new dough
Everybody lookin' around like uh oh

Winnin' a bet that can't shut you down
Come embrace the way you makin' it sound
Workin' the middle again
Makin' it jiggle again
Hello let's go just know
I love the way you do it
How you take it to the floor
Show 'em how you do it
Like yo ready for the flow
Baby you can do it 50 times in a row
Them rows get ready for yo pose
Lights, camera, action
Lose control
Ain't got the price these shoes are pro
All types of magic lose the clothes
Gotta party like yo girl
Make yo booty go stupid, girl
So hot that I love them grr
Off top shawty mark my words
