You know I know how
To make em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Ha-ha! Can't nothing handle me right now! I see you D. Guetta. Let's get 'em!)

[Verse 1:]
Hey
I own the night and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stunting go wild can't handle this plan
Life of the club arrogant like yeah!
Top like money so the girls just melt
One too many all know me like Twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standing on chairs
Fall out cause that's the business
All out it's so ridiculous
Zone out so much attention
Scream out I'm in the building (hey!)
They watching I notice
I'm rocking I'm rolling
I'm holding, I know it
You know it

You know I know how
To make em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)

[Verse 2:]
Hey
Still feeling myself I'm like outta control
Can't stop now more shots let's go
Ten more rounds can I get a K.O.
Paparazzi trying to make me pose
Came to party till I came no more
Celebrate cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies taking off their clothes
Grand finale' like superbowl
Go hard I run the show
That's right while I got money to blow
More lights more ice when I walk in the door
No hype do it big all over the globe
Yeah!
I said it
Go tell it
Confetti
Who ready?
I'm ready!
You ready!
Let's get it!

You know I know how
To make em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)

[Verse 3:]
You got me watching now (hey)
Got my attention now (hey)
Got everybody in the club wanting to know now
I am a ladies man
Come be my lady and...
We can both soar high
Bring ya body here let me switch up your atmosphere
Take you out of the club and up in my new lair
Fly you around the world
What you want baby girl
Are you ready to go now!

You know I know how
To make em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
Let's celebrate now
(Put your hands up!)
You know who shut it down! ---Lyrics submitted by Dipankar Lahkar.
