Nelly Furtado:
When I say jump, you say how high
I aint never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane
This party got me insane
So jump jump jump jump

Flo Rida:
Now Im gonna take it to the roof
Everybody with me got they own parachute
You aint scared of heights when you sippin on Goose
Party all night like Im flyin' jet blew?
You aint never seen nobody get this loose
Shawty actin naughty with her body, what it do
Jump to this man, bump to this man
Stop to this man, crunk to this man
Got another hit man
Hold up, I wanna go up, dont wanna throw up
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us
Dance, the boy got us all feelin high
Ask, the shawty, Im a astronaut
High rollin baby like Im jumpin on fire
Super Bowl pimp good Year on tire
Can I be a bird, I gotta be fly
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words

Nelly Furtado:
When I say jump, you say how high
I aint never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane
This party got me insane
This party got me insane
So jump jump jump jump

When I say jump, you say how high
I aint never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane
This party got me insane
This party got me insane
So jump jump jump jump

Flo Rida
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air
Up up and away take it off like mere
NBA ballin, I dont care
Now what do you do when you see you
A shawty and she make it bounce in the room
Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady
can I get on your hot air balloon
Sky high, still clubbin like Im part of the mile high
Ears poppin, Bubbalicious help me get right
Keep poppin in position after midnight
Moese? fried chicken up in NY
Jigga what, dont it feel good
Houston We gonna jump ship, all aboard
Come around me, and well parlay, were throwed
Cali is jumpin, hit the switch on the 64

Nelly Furtado:
When I say jump, you say how high
I aint never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane
this party got me insane
This party got me insane
So jump jump jump jump

Flo Rida:
Come on and jump, jump, jump (x3)
[All my ladies] get down, get down, get down
[All my ladies] get down, get down, get down
[All the fellas] jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
[All the fellas, the ladies, the fellas, the ladies, let me see you]

Nelly Furtado:
When I say jump, you say how high
I aint never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane
This party got me insane
So jump jump jump jump

When I say jump, you say how high
I aint never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane
This party got me insane
So jump jump jump jump

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down---Lyrics submitted by glenn.
