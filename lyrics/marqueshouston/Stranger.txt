Stranger 
Marques Houston

Girl youd better quit looking at me like that
You know your man is gonna kill you damn
You see he wanna love you and I promise hell never change
So you go in here and you wonder
Why didnt you get my number
I need to understand
How you can be

Chorus:

Be so strange, be so strange
You can be so strange, be so strange, strange,strange
You far from a stranger, stranger, stranger
Swear that I know you 
Stranger, stranger promise that I need you
Say you far from a stranger
Miss the way that I feel (way that I feel)
Stranger
Wanna get to know you better
stranger, stranger
Swear that I know you 
Stranger, stranger promise that I need you
stranger
Miss the way that I feel
Stranger
Wanna get to know you better

See I let you go again
When I see you at the supermarket
You had your son in a stroller 
So, I said theres no way I can disrespect him
He wouldnt be cool if he did the same thing to me
You got closer to me and I said..

Chorus:

Be so strange (damn youll be fine and my name is Marques), be so strange
You can be so strange(Meet me at a club and we roll) , be so strange, strange,strange
You far from a stranger, stranger
Swear that I know you 
Stranger, stranger promise that I need you
Stranger
Miss the way that I feel (way that I feel)
Stranger
Wanna get to know you better
Stranger, stranger
Swear that I know you 
Stranger, stranger promise that I need you
Stranger
Miss the way that I feel
Stranger
Wanna get to know you better
