love her,but I love you 
Don't know if I want Keyshia, Felicia or Emma 
There's something bout each one of them 
All of them special 
Been all around the world 
There's so many girls with different qualities 
Everyone seem to have something I want 


Who I need that one 
Couple things slide out but I swear that shes the one 
Think I'm sure tell me what this grown man should do 
I gotta have her but I want you to 
I'm so confused 

Chorus 
I love her, I love you 
But I love her and her too 
They all could be the one 
So how can I pick one, one, one, one 
When I love them all (x2) 


I love her but baby I love you 
Good with love, but moneys feeling nothing I can do 
Give me dear If only she could dress like you 
And you could walk the way she does O-O-ooooo 

Who 
I need that one 
Couple things slide out but I swear that shes the one 
Think I'm sure 
Tell me what this grown man should do 
I gotta have her but I want you to 
I'm so confused 

Chorus 
I love her, I love you 
But I love her and her too 
They all could be the one 
So how can I pick one, one, one, one (x2) 


Jim Jones 
I gotta have it, now what I'm gone do 
I gotta have her but I want her too 
So now I need help with my obsessions 
Im working on my addictions 
By stopping for all the pretty girls 
In the cars I be whippin 

In my position, Im balling like the Pistons 
Im on fire I stop drop and I roll and I watch em get it 
They see the moon is like a vampire bit em 
I scoop em, hit em, and dip em turn em 
Into honey dippas 

The money gettas is what the ladies be callin us 
Acting like they ignoring us 
Really they be on all of us 

And all of us 
We can take a flight 
you, you, you and her 
And We can make it right 

I love her, I love you 
But I love her and her too 
They all could be the one 
So how can I pick one, one, one, one 
When I love them all (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Cem.
