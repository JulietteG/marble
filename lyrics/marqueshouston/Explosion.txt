Mattress music
Take one

[Verse 1]
Here we are you and me all alone in this room
Doing things that only grown folks do 
Im grabbing you, you grabbing me 
Your bodys here I cant believe it either one of us can even breathe
Now I am like a rocket
Going into orbit
And girl you are the cockpit
So come let me explore it
Shall we count down down down down
5,4,3,2,1

[Chorus]
Explosion Explosion Explosion
Explosion Explosion Explosion
When our bodys get to touchin
Baby dont hold back
I love it when were making contact
Explosion Explosion Explosion

[Verse 2]
Here we are you and me all alone in this room
Doing things that only grown folks do 
Ill lick lick lick lick lick lick lick lick lick until I cover every inch of you 
Now I am like a rocket
Going into orbit
Girl you are the cockpit 
So come let me explore it
Shall we count down down down down
5,4,3,2,1

[Chorus]
Explosion Explosion Explosion
Explosion Explosion Explosion
When our bodys get to touchin
Baby dont hold back
I love it when were making contact
Explosion Explosion Explosion

[Bridge]
Feels like big bombs going off all around ya
And everythings falling down around ya
Oh baby 
But we cant be fake
See the look on your face
And its telling me that you love it
Telling me that you need it
Oh girl here it comes again 

[Chorus]
Explosion Explosion Explosion
Explosion Explosion Explosion
When our bodys get to touchin
Baby dont hold back
I love it when were making contact
Explosion Explosion Explosion---Lyrics submitted by mistress.
