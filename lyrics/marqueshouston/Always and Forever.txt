i don't wanna be calling your phone,
i don't care what time you get home,
and i hate the fact you live so damn close to me.
i don't like that i can't stop thinking about you,
and i hate that you walk like you do.
Oh baby

chorus
but its just something about ya,
and i just can't take it (x2)

its your thighs, your lips, your calves, your lips, 
its your hair, did i mention your lips?

why i behold you?
why do i want you,
always and forever, always and forever.

cuz girl you got it,
i'm gon keep it,
ooo you got me trippin on you,
so thats why i wabt you always and forever

i don't wanna be pickin you up, 
taking you on dates and shit
i dont wanna be paying your bills, 
getting you all spoiled and shit
dont want you to decorate my house,
but i can't help it.
girl you make me feel so comfortable,
i'll be damned if i let you go.

chorus
but its just something about ya,
and i just can't take it (x2)

its your thighs, your lips, your calves, your lips, 
its your hair, did i mention your lips?

why i behold you?
why do i want you,
always and forever, always and forever.

cuz girl you got it,
i'm gon keep it,
ooo you got me trippin on you,
so thats why i want you always and forever

I try hard, to keep my cool but i
cant live, i can't, i shake cause i'm
so strung on you
but its cool cause im gettin all my hits from you
And girl it gets to me the way that Im feelin
Its so crazy cause I don't know how Im dealin
girl if i lose you i'm done,
cuz i know you're that one

why i behold you?
why do i want you,
always and forever, always and forever.

cuz girl you got it,
i'm gon keep it,
ooo you got me trippin on you,
so thats why i want you always and forever---Lyrics submitted by ashlynn.
