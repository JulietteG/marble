verse1:
Tell me were the hell you get the nerve commin
 back asking for a second chance (oo) after you
 left me alone for the next man (oh no) aint it funny
 now im making money now you showin up after im blowing up-up
 baby i use to love you but now the party's over

chorus: you shoulda thought about it for
 youd said good bye(shoulda thought about it) 
and the same thing that
 make you laugh can make you cry 
(make you cry make you cry)but the
 grass was much greener on the other side
 and the same thing that make you laugh
 can make you cry

verse2:
oooh you thought it was all good when
 you left me in the hood he told you he'd
 buy you things that i never could you ooo

 but you realized too late (hold note)

chorus:
shoulda thought about it for u said good bye
(should thought about it ooh nooo)

 but the grass was much greener on the (oooh yeah oh yeah) other
 side and the same thing that make you laugh
 can make u cry

 on the other side and the same thing that make you laugh
