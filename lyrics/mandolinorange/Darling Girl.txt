It's a darling girl, my darling girl with eyes as dark as night
and a heart so true but just so strong, set to live a darling life
As years roll by, she'll grow up fine and she'll sing a silent song
But she'll find your piano and she'll find her wings
and she'll sing all the days ...

I'm waiting on a ghost
To show her love in arms
and sweet Marie I can see your faint light shining down on me

Well go call on her brother and her sister too
go call on all the town 
Tell them all today, your darling girl is to wear a wedding gown

And though it all came so fast, ten years soon will pass 
before there's room for three
My sister will grow, my mother will know 
soon there will be room for me.

I'm waiting on a ghost
To show her love in arms
and sweet Marie I can see your faint light shining down on me

Like an old toy top spins and stops
Or tag ... in the ball
A long summer's wait come walking down
She'll be buried in the fall

And now she sleeps with you Marie
bittersweet is this old world
They tell me soon my sister too will have a darling girl

I'm waiting on a ghost
to show her love in arms
and sweet marie I can see your faint light shining down on me---Lyrics submitted by Aiyana Adshead.
