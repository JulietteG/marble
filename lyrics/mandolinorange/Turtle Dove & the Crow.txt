She came along like she was hiding some deep secret
Now shes gone and I carry on to keep it
The cows are grazing boys the fishins getting good
Fates an old woodpecker and Im an old chunk of wood

Some mysteries well never know 
Turtle dove and the crow
Made a nest

Weve shared a line etched in stone between two youths
I aim to pack my grave some day and go see her
Gonna climb that latter drink up while she holds the door
Just got to drop me a line this side of the Jordan

Some mysteries well never know 
Turtle dove and the crow
Made a nest

She came along like she was hiding some deep secret
She saw the future boys and I was her ticket
The American dream suited us just fine
Ima lay down wreaths in my time of dying---Lyrics submitted by John B.
