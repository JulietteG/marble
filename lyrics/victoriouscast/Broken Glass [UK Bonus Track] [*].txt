It's fun to run, it's fun to play,
It's fun to make things out of clay,
It's fun to fill your car with gas,
It's fun to break.... things made of glass!

But Broken glass can cut your hand,
And then you'll bleed across the land,
Ask any women, child or man,
The dangers could pass
With broken glass
Broken Glass....

But broken glass is not a food
So don't listen to some dude
Who says put cheese on broken glass,
And make a sand-a-wich!
Out of broken glass....

Broken Glass isn't good for you tummy
Although you may think it's kind of yumy
Don't eat that glass, don't be a dummy,
Just stay in school and don't eat broken glass,
Don't eat broken gla-ass

Let's sing a song about broken glass,
I'll help you write it after class,
There is no song that can surpass
The song we sing,
About broken glass...

[HARMONICA SOLO!]

Let's sing a song about broken glass,
I'll help you write it after class,
There is no song that can surpass
The song we sing,
[Spoken:] About broken glass...---Lyrics submitted by sarah lozz.
