I call you up when I know he's at home
I jump out of my skin when he picks up the phone
Why can I tell if he's looking at me?
Should I give him a smile? Should I get up and leave?

I know it's strange, I don't know what I'm thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3

I don't want to
But I want to
Cause I just can't get him
Out of my mind!

Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
My best friend's brother is the one for me
BFB! BFB! 
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

I kinda think that I might be his type
Cause when you're not around, he's been acting too shy
Sometimes I feel like he might make a move
Is this all in my head? I don't know what to do!

I know it's strange, I don't know what he's thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3

I don't want to
But I want to
Cause I just can't get him 
Out of my mind!

Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
My best friend's brother is the one for me
BFB! BFB! My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
BFB! BFB! My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

Cause he's such a dream (yeah)
And you know what I mean
If you weren't relaateeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed!

Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3

I don't want to
But I want to
Cause I just can't get him
Out of my mind!

Yeah-e-ah-e-ah-e-ah!
My best friend's brother is the one for me
BFB! BFB! My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
BFB! BFB! My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
