I know, you see
Somehow the world will change for me
And be so wonderful

Here I am
Once again
Feeling lost, but now and then

Live life
Breathe air
I know somehow were going to get there
And feel so wonderful

When you figure out how
Youre lost in the moment, you disappear
Its all for real
Im telling you just how I feel

You dont have to be afraid to put your dream in action
Youre never gonna fade, youll be the main attraction
Wake up the members of my nation
Its your time to be
Not a fantasy (not a fantasy)
Just remember me (just remember me)
When it turns out right (When it turns out right)

Cause theres no chance unless you take one
And the time see
Now if you live in your imagination
Tomorrow youll be everybodys fascination
You see the brighter side of every situation

In my victory (In my victory)
Just remember me
When I make it shine
Leave it all to me
Leave it all to me
When I make it shine
Just leave it all to me

When you live in your imagination (Leave it all to me)
When I make it shine

Leave it
Make it
Leave it
Make it
Leave it
Make it
Leave it

When I make it shine
Just leave it all to me---Lyrics submitted by drayton.
