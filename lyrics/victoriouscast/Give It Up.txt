Someday I let you in
Treat you right
Drive you out of your mind
oh
You never met a chick like me
Burn so bright
Im gonna make you blind

Always want what you cant have
But is it so bad if you dont get what you wanted
Make you feel good
As Im with you
Let me shape you
Lets get it started
Give it up
You cant win
Cause I know where youve been
Such a Shame
You dont put up a fight
Its a game
That we play
at the end of the night
Its the same old story
But you never get it right
Give it up
Yeahhhhhhhh oh oh

Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby baby

Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby baby

Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Baby
Yes you are my baby
and Ill make you crazy tonight

Look at me boy cause I got you where I want you
Isnt it so exciting
Wanna shake you
Wanna break you
Take a backseat boy
Cuz now Im driving

Give it up
You cant win
Cause I know where youve been
Such a Shame
You dont put up a fight
Its a game
That we play
at the end of the night
Its the same old story
But you never get it right
Give it up
Woahhhhhhhhh ohhhh yeah!---Lyrics submitted by corinne.
