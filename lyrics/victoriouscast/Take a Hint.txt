Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
I can always see em coming, from the left and from the right
I dont want to be a priss, I just try to be polite
But it always seems to bite me in the-

Ask me for my number, yeah, you put me on the spot
You think that we should hook-up, but I think that we should not
You had me at hello, then you opened up your mouth
And that is when it started going south
Oh!

Get your hands off my hips, fore Ill punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my Hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you cant buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La.
T-take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La.

I guess you still dont get it, so lets take it from the top
You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was Stop
And if I only had a dime for every name that you just dropped
Youd be here and Id be on a yacht
Oh!

Get your hands off my hips, fore Ill punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my Hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you cant buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La.
T-take a hint, take a hint
La, La, La.

What about no dont you get
So go and tell your friends Im not really interested
Its about time that youre leavin Im gonna count to three and
Open my eyes and
Youll be gone

One
Get your hands off my
Two.
Or Ill punch you in the
Three.
Stop your staring at my Hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
I am not your missing link
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint 

Get your hands off my hips, fore Ill punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my Hey!
Take a hint, take a hint---Lyrics submitted by Julia Johnson.
