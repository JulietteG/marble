You had it all
the day you told me 
told me you want me
i had it all
but let you fool me 
fool me completely

Yeah i was so stupid
to give you all my attention
cause the way you played me
expose your true intention

Yeah one day!
i'll have you beggin' 
on your knees for me

Yeah one day!
i'll have you crawlin' 
like a centipede

You mess with me
and mess with her
so i'll make sure you
get what you deserve

Yeah one day!
you'll be beggin' 
on your knees for me

So watch your back
cause you don't know 
when or wear i could 
get you

I've set the trap
and when i'm done
then you'll know
what I've been through

So oh mister player
do you feel like
the man now

And i bet you're nervous
cause this song makes 
you freak out

Yeah one day!
i'll have you beggin' 
on your knees for me

Yeah one day!
i'll have you crawlin' 
like a centipede

You mess with me
and mess with her
so i'll make sure you
get what you deserve

Yeah one day!
i'll have you beggin' 
on your knees for me

I know i'm bein' bitter
but i'm gonna drive 
you under cause 
you just don't don't 
deserve happy ever
after 

But what you 
did to me after you
told me you never
felt that way and 
it's only just a game!
(you had it all)

Yeah one day!
i'll have you beggin' 
on your knees for me

Yeah one day!
i'll have you crawlin'
like a centipede

You mess with me (yeah)
and mess with her (yeah)
so i'll make sure you
get what you deserve(yeah)

Yeah one day!
i'll have you beggin' 
on your knees for me
