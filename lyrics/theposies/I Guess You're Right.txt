I guess your right
And theres nothing I would say to you this time
You told me just what I have to live for
And theres no flight in my fight
And more than that 
Its so alright
Its so alright

If I meet more than your eye
I guess your right
If I wake up in your mind
I guess your right

I guess your smart
Cause im taken by you
Taking me apart
I could best believe that died to live for
For the hour dictates the need
And I am speaking like ive spoken only for

If I meet more than your eye
I guess your right 
If I wake up in your mind
I guess your right
If I sink into your sleep and make it deep
I guess your right
If I never let you go I know you so and your so right

If I meet more than your eye
I guess your right
If I wake up in your mind
I guess your right
Can I crawl around your bones and make my home
Would that be right
If I never let you go I know you so and your so right

Take it as a sign
Taking every sound you hear
Take every sound

Take my desire take it all take it as proof
Take me in this life ive taken you---Lyrics submitted by sade.
