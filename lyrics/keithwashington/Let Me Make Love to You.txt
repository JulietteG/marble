VERSE, 1 Keith Washington 

SOFT AND WARM YOU WANT ME
IT FEELS SO GOOD, YOU GIVE IT TO ME
OH MY LOVE I FEEL YOURE BODY HEAT
COME CUDDLE UP WITH ME LADY
AND I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU NEED
DONT YOU WORRY CAUSE YOU MINE TONIGHT
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LET ME TAKE CONTROL 
I LL DO IT NICE AND SLOW

I LIKE THE WAY THAT YOU MAKE ME FEEL
COME ON SUGAR LET ME DO IT TO YOU (mhhh)
I GURRANTEE THAT I WONT LET UP
TILL THE BREAK OF DAWN, SO LETS GET IT ON.

                                       CHORUS

LET ME MAKE LOVE TO YOU (I CAN MAKE YOU FEEL SO GOOD)
LET ME MAKE LOVE TO YOU (I WANT TO LOVE YOU I want to love lady)


VERSE, 2 Shante Moore

Work my way up and down your spine
Babe your body and this love of mine
Satisfy you and that is what I will do
Until the night has grew, so dim the lights
Baby lock the door lets lay down right here on the floor
Close your eyes now baby dont you move
Cause Ive got plans for you

I am taking over this body now, baby hold on real tight
For the ride of your life hey..
I will satisfy every part of you and I wont let you go 
Till the sun creeps through (repeat chorus )

                         Closing (both singing)

OH baby lets play those games tonight
We will reach up, tease one another
And I wont let go, I will make you scream
I will make you beg for more
The thing you say to me just makes wanna be in love---Lyrics submitted by Veronica.
