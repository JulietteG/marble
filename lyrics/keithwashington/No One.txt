Hey..ooh ooh
If there was a way to start all over
I would not hesitate
Not a moment

You know my life hasn't been the same
Like a fool I let you step away
But dont let my mistake come between us
So dont let go
I need a chance
To prove myself and start again

My heart says, my mind knows
Youre the one for me, baby

No one knows me, baby, not like you do
Youre the only one
And no one loves me, baby, not like you do
We were meant to be together

Yes I do admit
It should never have come to this
But I never knew how much Id miss your love
Girl no matter where I go
My mind keeps coming back to you
If I made you cry
Try to realize

I need you now
I know for sure
Cuz no one else has loved me more
This time is the right time
And Ill never let you go

No one knows me, baby, not like you do
Youre the only one
And no one loves me, baby, not like you do
We were meant to be together

All Im asking for is a chance
To prove that I love you
and I would give my wealth
and all Ive known
everything I have
But I know that

No one else can give me all I need, baby
and no other woman can please me sugar
Youre all that matters
Thats the reason why, why I gotta have you ... back in my life..oh

No one knows me, baby, not like you do, sugar
Youre the only one - and I mean it
Yes I need you in my life
Lord knows youll make everything alright
Cuz Youre the only one ( several times )

No one.. no one.. not like you do..
You're the only thing that I ever needed in my life
I admit that I was wrong baby girl
Come on back home sugar
I`m cold without you baby ---Lyrics submitted by CEDRICK BILLING.
