I am a troubled mind, I am a calloused heart
A failing engine from driving way too hard
Trying way too hard
I pulled a .38 out of my bleeding heart
I killed my selfishness for bringing me this far
This far away from you

When the daylight breaks through the buildings of Chicago
I will stand alone in the valley of tomorrow

Oh, this is the way I wanna go down
(This is the last time) I'm starting over with you
This is the way I wanna go out (This is the last time)

I never second-guesssed the little voice I heard
It's just a whisper, that sounded like a scream
I aint never felt so free

When the daylight breaks through the buildings of Chicago
I will stand alone in the valley of tomorrow

Oh, this is the way I wanna go down
(This is the last time) I'm starting over with you
This is the way I wanna go out
(This is the last time) I'm starting over with you

I never second-guesssed the little voice I heard
It's just a whisper---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
