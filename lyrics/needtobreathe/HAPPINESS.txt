Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness

I got a homesick heart but a long ways left to go
I've been doing my part but I ain't got much to show
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness
Chasing that life, moving on cause I had to prove
There ain't no life worth doing what I did to you
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness

I've been working all night, maybe you could help me to believe
This song ain't nothing if this song can't set you free
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness

Sometimes you leave the ones you love
But if it's love, they won't give up
Cause they know a war's raging and you gotta choose
These days are tough, these days are long
Sometimes it's hard, you carry on
But I hear a voice singing and I know it's true

I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

Singing oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness
Oh, happiness
Singing oh, happiness---
