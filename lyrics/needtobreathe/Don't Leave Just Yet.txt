Weve lost our love somehow, its proof without a doubt 
You give up everything you have to get what you want
I know we dont separate, but my sins are in the way
And I know that you dont let me get away to far
Oh oh

I begged for one more chance about a million times and I
Come back and ask you for forgiveness again
Its easy to forget the glory in the way we met but you
Always remind me of the love that we had
Lets give this one more chance before we say goodbye

Dont leave just I was mistaken
My hands are tied and my time is wasted
And I just want you to know that it need you now
Dont leave just yet

We're all the same, we all take the back door
We might be to blame
But ill be the one to come back, cause I dont want to come 
Back to see you get away 

Lets give this one more chance before we say goodbye
Dont leave just I was mistaken
My hands are tied and my time is wasted
And I just want you to know that it need you now
Dont leave just yet---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
