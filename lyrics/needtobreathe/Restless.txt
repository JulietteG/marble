Just before you called
I thought we were doing fine
But I was wrong
Your voice came down the line
Forced me to the thought of life
If you were gone

Were just tired of talking to the busy sounds
The hardest heart still breaks when it goes without
Were all the ghosts of who we used to be and
We might know, if we could see

Dont look now cause I cant escape
I get so restless
We wont know until its too late
But Ill have years to think of
The way Id do the things I did 
Just to chase the pain away
Were here now and I can change
But Im still restless

Push, the urge away
To wake up feeling just the same as yesterday
Time, it heals the pain
But painful is the angry heart when time remains

Were just tired of walking through the faceless crowd
We keep our lonely eyes locked on the ground
And if my legs could run me into you
Then we might know, we might know 

Dont look now cause I cant escape
I get so restless
We wont know until its too late
But Ill have years to think of
The way Id do the things I did 
Just to chase the pain away
Were here now and I can change
But Im still restless (X3)---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
