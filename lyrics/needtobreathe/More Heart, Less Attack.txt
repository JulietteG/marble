Be the light in the crack
Be the one thats been there on a camels back
Slow to anger quick to laugh
Be more heart and less attack

Be the wheels not the track
Be the wanderer thats coming back
Leave the past right where its at
Be more heart and less attack

The more you take the less you have
Cuz its you in the mirror staring back
Quick to let go slow to react
Be more heart and less attack

Ever growing steadfast
And if need be the one thats in the gap
Be the never turning back
Twice the heart any man could have

Be the wheels not the track
Be the wanderer thats coming back
Leave the past right where its at
Be more heart and less attack
Be more heart and less attack
Be more heart and less attack

I stuck my hat out I caught the rain drops
I drank the water I felt my veins block
Im nearly sanctified Im nearly broken
Im down the river Im near the open

I stuck my hat out I caught the rain drops
I drank the water I felt my veins block
Im near the sanctified Im near broken
Im down the river Im near the open

Im down the river to where Im going---
