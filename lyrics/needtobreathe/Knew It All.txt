Don't look back now
We thought we had it won
All that we'd left 
Is the smoking of a gun

Fear is not the only device 
That lonliness could leave us to fight
But you're gone (you're gone)
I told myself you'd be the one
But you're gone (you're gone)
I knew it all along

My heart was kept
falling from the place you left
My eyes have seen
The favor move from you to me

Fear is not the only device 
That lonliness could leave us to fight
But you're gone (you're gone)
I told myself you'd be the one
But you're gone (you're gone)
I knew it all along

Oooooh It's alright, it's alright (x4)
But you're gone (you're gone)
I told myself you'd be the one
But you're gone (you're gone)
I knew it all along 

But you're gone (you're gone)
I told myself you'd be the one
But you're gone (you're gone)
I knew it all along---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
