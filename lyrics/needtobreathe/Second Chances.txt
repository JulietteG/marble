All my past is color
Placed inside my hands
Empty is the canvas
Patiently I plan
Stars are bright above me
Thats not where I am
Greens will be behind me
Blues will make the man

I cant help but fear Ive done this wrong
Cause seldom second chances come along

Greys are all around me
Fading into black
Stars were bright above me
Wont you bring them back

I cant help but fear Ive done this wrong
Cause seldom second chances come along
If time can break us, will it make us strong
Cause seldom second chances come along---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
