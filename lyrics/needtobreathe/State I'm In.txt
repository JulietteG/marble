When I woke this morning
it was already night
Saw a number on the phone
that I don't recognize I know

I've been across this land like ten times now
I've seen every little corner of your two bit town
I know
Where I'm going

Bright lights they won't leave me alone
Need a shadow or a hole in the wall
Baby I don't know
I don't know what kind of state I'm in
We've got a ways to go
Been around this whole town by now
I can't tell you how you're supposed to get out
Baby I don't know
I don't know what kind of state I'm in
We've got a ways to go

When I woke this morning it was already night
Saw a number on the phone
that I don't recognize I know
I've been across this land like ten times now
I've seen every little corner
of your two bit town I know
Where I'm going

I'm an ordinary man a wheel on the cage
I've never been this lost
but I don't wanna have to stay
In the morning I'm leaving
And I don't know where I'm going---
