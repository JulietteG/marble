Wont you take this cup from me 
cuz fear has stolen all my sleep
if tomorrow means my death
I pray you'll save their souls with it 

let the songs i sign bring joy to you 
let the words i say profess my love
let the notes i chose be your favorite tune
Father let my heart be after you 

in this hour of time i see
who i am is not just me 
give me strenght to die myself, 
so love can live to tell the tale 

let the songs i sign bring joy to you 
let the words i say profess my love
let the notes i chose be your favorite tune
fater let my heart be after you 

Father let my heart be after you 
in everything I do 

let the songs i sign bring joy to you 
let the words i say profess my love
let the notes i chose be your favorite tune
fater let my heart be after you---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
