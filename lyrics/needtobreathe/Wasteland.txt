I am the first one in line to die
When the cavalry comes
Yeah it feels like the great divide
has already come
Yeah I'm wastin' my way through days
losing youth along the way

Oh if God, is on my side
Oh if God, is on my side
Oh if God, is on my side
Who could be against me?

There was a greatness I felt for a while
But somehow it changed
Some kind of blindness I used to protect me
From all of my stains
Yeah I wish this was vertigo
It just feels like I'm fallin' slow
Oh if God, is on my side
Then who can be against me?

Yeah in this wasteland
Where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that
I need to get by

Yeah in this wasteland
Where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that
I need to shine

All of these people I meet
It seems like they're fine
Yeah in some ways I hope that they're not
And their hearts are like mine
Yeah its wrong when it seems like work
To belong, All I feel is hurt

Oh if God, is on my side
Yeah if God, is on my side
Oh if God, is on my side
Who could be against me?

Yeah in this wasteland
Where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And its all that
I need to get by

Yeah in this wasteland
Where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that
I need to shine

Oh if God, is on my side
Yeah if God, is on my side
Oh if God, is on my side
Then who could be against me?---
