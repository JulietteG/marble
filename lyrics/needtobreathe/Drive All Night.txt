I ain't lookin' for a free ride home, back to the middle,
I need a new locale, I need a girl who calls me baby,
I need to know if she can save me.

I need somewhere I can drive all night, out into the darkness,
Follow the headlights down, I gotta know where they can take me,
I gottta know if they can save me.

Focus in every word, Change my path,
Maybe I could leave a mark,
Try and prove the poets wrong
There must be time, Maybe we could be the song to march us on

I ain't lookin' for a free ride home, back to the middle,
I need a new locale, I need a girl that calls me baby,
I need to know if she can save me.

I need somewhere I can drive all night, out into the darkness,
Follow the headlights down, I need to know where they can take me
I gottta know if they can save me.

Woah...Woah...

Beg the book to turn the page
I get stuck where the villains get away.
Somewhere in this wretched tale, there must be a line where the victim gets his way, just one time.
Oh I'll get mine.

I ain't lookin' for a free ride home, back to the middle,
I need a new locale, I need a girl that calls me baby,
I gotta know if she can save me.

I need somewhere I can drive all night, out into the darkness,
Follow the headlights down, I need to know where they can take me,
I gottta know if they can save me.

Drive All Night (yeah Baby Just), Hold On Tight (Oh and you can) , Close your eyes (yeah and), we can say goodbye.  
(We can) Drive All Night (yeah Just), Hold On Tight (Baby just) , Close your eyes (yeah and), we can say goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by Michele Matney.
