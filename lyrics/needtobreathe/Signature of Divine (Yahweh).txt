Cathedrals have tried in vain 
To show the image of your face
We are by your design
Signature of divine
We'll always sing your name,
Forever and today

Yaweh, yaweh
Great is your glory
You go before me 
Oh, we sing
Holy, holy
Your way is lovely
So high above me
Yahweh!

The fortunes of kings and queens 
Are wasted chasing what we've seen
Cuz we are by your reprieve  
Beauty framed by your suffering
We'll always sing your name
Forever and today

Chorus

Take me, and pull me through
Cuz i can't move without you
I won't leave you alone,
You say it will be ok

Chorus x2

Ancient of days, Yaweh!---Lyrics submitted by Renee Roll.
