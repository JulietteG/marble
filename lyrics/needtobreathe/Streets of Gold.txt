I want you to know
Im leaving to let you go
One day well walk upon
Streets of gold

I dont remember seeing fear in your eyes
When you were fading
The day we said our goodbyes
Its easy to say that theres a reason for this
Much harder to know
That what we say is true

Everything we hold could someday slip away

I want you to know
Im leaving to let you go
And someday well walk upon
The streets of gold

Running through your veins was a slow-ticking clock
Counting down the days
And no one could make it stop
All of the time that it takes to figure it out
Could be the moments
That you cant live without

Everything we hold could someday slip away

I want you to know
Im leaving to let you go
And someday well walk upon
The streets of gold

The trouble with love is that it comes to an end
Ive got a feeling Im gonna find you again
Just in a place where love cant die 

I want you to know
Im leaving to let you go
And someday well walk upon
The streets of gold

I want you to know
Im leaving to let you go
And someday well walk upon
The streets of gold
Streets of Gold---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
