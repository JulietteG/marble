Before the Truth will come to fill our eyes
The wool comes down in the form of fire
And when the the answers and the Truth have cut their ties

Will you still find me
Will you still see me
Through smoke

I was born in a house in a town just like your own
I was raised to believe in the power of the unknown
'Cause when the answers and the Truth take different sides

Will you still find me
Will you still see me
Through smoke

Through smoke (x3)

When their whispers have painted pictures that 
Make you doubt what you once believed in
Paper stories that hide the Glory 
to keep us searching
Through smoke

Who do you believe when you can't get through (through smoke) 
When everything you know seems so untrue (through smoke) 
When I'm lost in a place that I thought I knew (through smoke) 
Give me some way that I might find You (through smoke) 

Who do you believe (through smoke) 
Everything you know (through smoke)  
When I'm lost in a place (through smoke) 
Give me some way...---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
