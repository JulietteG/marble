I'm down in a hole, baby
You're lockin' me up, you're lockin' me up
I got bound by a cold lady
She's lockin' me up, she's lockin' me up

I am  a down in a hole, baby
About to give up, just about to give up
I got bound by a cold lady
She's lockin' me up, she's lockin' me up

And this pain, this pain I feel
Won't set me free from you

'Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow, but I was caught off guard

Well I'm helpless, and I'm hurting
I'm affixed to your moves and you're shakin' me down
You got me locked up in the doghouse
You had to chain me up 'cause I was fallin' for you
I am a helpless situation
It cuts to the bone and I'm coming for more
So if you need me I'll be waiting
For the girl that I love just a pickin' me out

This lockless cage you trapped me in
Has brought me to my knees

Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I'm a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow, but I was caught off guard
Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
Takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I'm a prisoner of your heart

Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I am a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow, but I was caught off guard
Cause I'm a prisoner of your heart
 I was takin' it slow, but then I locked up hard
I'm a prisoner of your heart
I was takin' it slow, but I was caught off guard---Lyrics submitted by Brent.
