Ramblers in the wilderness we cant find what we need
Get a little restless from the searching
Get a little worn down in between
Like a bull chasing the matador is the man left to his own schemes
Everybody needs someone beside em shining like a lighthouse from the sea

Brother let me be your shelter
Ill never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When youre low
Brother let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home

Face down in the desert now theres a cage locked around my heart
I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were
Now my hands cant reach that far
I aint made for a robbery I could never take this world alone
I know that in my weakness I am stronger
Its your love that brings me home---
