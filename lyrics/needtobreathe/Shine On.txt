somewhere between the end and the point where we begin
there's a fire burning brightly thats found it way to dim
when the feelings gone
shine on shine on
and onto something new as long i know we're do, i will remember you
shine on shine on
and let the others see you've got your victory
will you remember me?
i was with you in the valley and up upon that hill
so i'll take just one more step in front of you
for i am with you still, you still
and your not alone
shine on shine on
and onto something new as long i know we'lll do 
i will remember you
shine on shine on
and let the others see you've got you victory
will you remember me?
can you see my hands are open?
i'm waiting just ahead
and what you think you needed all now, but you needed me instead
shine on 
shine on
shine
oh shine on
won't you?
won't you shine on?
shine on shine on
and onto something new as long i know we'll do
i will remember you
shine on shine on
and let the others see you got your victory
will you remember me?
somewhere between the end and the point where we begin---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
