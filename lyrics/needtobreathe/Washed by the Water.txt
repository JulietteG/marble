Daddy was a preacher
She was his wife
Just tryin to make the world a little better
You know, shine a light

People started talking
Just to hear their own voice
Those people tried to accuse my father
Say he made the wrong choice

Though it might be painful
You know that time will always tell
Those people have long since gone
My father never failed

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
Even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water
Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
Even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even when the Earth crumbles under my feet
Even when the ones I love, turn around and crucify me
I won't ever ever let you down
won't fall, won't fall, won't fall as long as you're around me
Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
Even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water
Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
Even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water
Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
Even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
Even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water---Lyrics submitted by Sally.
