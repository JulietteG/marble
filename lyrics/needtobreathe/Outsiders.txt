Short falls and little sins
Close calls and no one wins.
Stand tall we're running in
I'm wearing thin
Oh, why are we keeping score?

'Cause if your not laughing, who is laughing now
I've been wondering if we start sinking,
could we stand our ground?
And through everything we've learned,
We've finally come to terms.....

We are the Outsiders.

I'm not leaving without a fight.
I've got my holster around my side
Just cause I'm wrong,
It don't make you right.
now you ain't right.
Oh, why are we keeping score?

'cause if your not laughing, who is laughing now
I've been wondering if we start sinking, 
could we stand our ground.
And through everything we've learned,
We've finally come to terms....

We are the Outsiders.

On the outside, you're free to roam.
On the outside, we found a home.
On the outside, there's more to see.
On the outside, we choose to be.---Lyrics submitted by Christy.
