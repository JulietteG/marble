If you don't know
just how you feel
dont say those three things that 
you know I want to hear
if you dont know 
just what to think
then put your thought away and 
keep them out of reach 

Haley dont hurt me
if you dont know 
I could of move on a long time ago
your undecided, your eyes do show
Haley dont hurt me, if you dont know 

if you dont know just where we are 
if so just step away before we get to far 
if you dont know just where you stand
dont brace the fall,cuz you may never want to land

haley dont hurt me if you dont know 
i could of move on a long time ago 
your undecided , your eyes do show 
haley dont hurt me if you dont know

we're on and off again  its more than I can stand
Just let me know if your for real this time 
you voice is stuck again reminding me of when 
we talked away into the night

haley dont hurt me if you dont know 
i could of move on a long time ago 
your undecided , your eyes do show 
haley dont hurt me if you dont know---Lyrics submitted by Ailsa.
