If i could love you forever
If i could love you everyday
If i could take your hand would you understand
And let me show you the way

If we could dance this dance forever
If we could laugh without the words
If i give you my life will you be my wife
Or is that to obsered

But oh, we could have a lark, a lark
Picknicking in the park, the park
On saturday night if you feel alright
We'll go the pictures when it's dark

If i were a plumber would you love me
If you were a waitress i'd love you
Could you picture us on the number nine bus
to canning town we two

Just me and you 

(Instrumental break)

But oh, we could have a lark, a lark
Picknicking in the park, the park
On saturday night if you feel alright
We'll go the pictures when it's dark

Yes we could walk our walk's together
Say we could raise a family
When i come home from work i'll change my shirt
And sit by the fireside for tea

Just you and me---Lyrics submitted by Chanelle.
