Verse 1 
Knew the signs wasnt right 
I was stupid, for a while 
Swept away, by you 
And now I feel like a fool 

Chorus 
So confused 
My hearts bruised 
Was I ever loved by you? 
Out of reach, so far 
I never had your heart 
Out of reach, couldnt see 
We were never met to be 

Verse 2 
Catch myself, from despair 
I could drown if I stay here 
Keeping busy, everyday 
I know I will be ok 

Chorus 
But Im 
So confused 
My hearts bruised 
Was I ever loved by you? 
Out of reach, so far 
I never had your heart 
Out of reach, couldnt see 
We were never met to be 

Bridge 
So much hurt, so much pain 
Takes a while to regain 
What is lost inside 
And I hope that in time 
Youll be out of my mind 
Ill be over you 

Chorus 
And know Im 
So confused 
My hearts bruised 
Was I ever loved by you? 
Out of reach, so far 
I never had your heart 
Out of reach, couldnt see 
We were never met to be 
Out of reach, so far, 
You never gave your heart 
In my reach, I can see 
Theres a life out there for me---Lyrics submitted by reine.
