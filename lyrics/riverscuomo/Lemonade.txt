Would you like some lemonade?
No, this ain't no minute maid
Just today I picked them fresh
From the tree that I love best
Couldn't let them rot away
Like my father used to say

Oh, happy day
Lemonade

Long ago, I didn't know
Didn't care and couldn't grow
On my way in such a fuss
Passed the tree to catch the bus
'Til the day I couldn't pass
Fallen lemons in my path
So with my mom, I now agree
And use the lemons life gives me

Oh, happy day
Oh, Lemonade
Happy Day
Oh, lemonade
Happy Day
Hey, lemonade
Happy Day

Hard times come to me (x3)
Ohhhhh..  Lemonade---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
