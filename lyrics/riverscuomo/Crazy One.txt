Crazy one
I think I'm coming undone
I think I lost and you won
I wanna see you again

Baby doll
I'm still afraid of it all
I'm hopin' that you would call
I wanna see you again

A friend to tender friend
A heart to tender heart
A love that never ends
A love that never starts

Crazy one
I think I'm coming undone
I think I lost and you won
I wanna see you again

A friend to tender friend
A heart to tender heart
A love that never ends
A love that never starts

Crazy one
I think I'm coming undone
I think I lost and you won
I wanna see you again

Baby doll
I'm still afraid of it all
I'm hoping that you would call
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
