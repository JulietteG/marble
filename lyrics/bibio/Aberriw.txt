Damsel fly meander down
The river looks like skin tonight
Ebb and flow
Where willows grow
And skimming stones take flight
Rainbows occurring in my eyelashes
That no one else can see
Minnows wait and then flitter free
When confronted with my hand
Pond skaters scatter
And the daydream-relaxed eyes see
The mesmerizing circular flickers
Of the ripples on the water
Glistening between the holes
In my fishing net---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
