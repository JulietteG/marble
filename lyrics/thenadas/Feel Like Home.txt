What is a skyline  
Chilled to the bone alone and hurting
The end of my life
I've never seen you look so pretty

[chorus]
Reaching out to open arms
I was gone, you've come so far
And you and me, I'm where I need to be

I'll be alright if you're okay
You feel like home to me
I'll love the night, I'll love the day
You feel like home...  You feel like home.

When I see you
Can't help but think of what to say
So I can feel you
Feel you coming back to me to say

[chorus]
Reaching out to open arms
I was gone, you've come so far
And you and me, I'm where I need to be

I'll be alright if you're okay
You feel like home to me
I'll love the night, I'll love the day
You feel like home...  You feel like home.
Cause you feel like home - you feel like home.

Beneath the high rise
You are my place inside this city
You opened my eyes
I've never seen you look so pretty

[chorus]
Reaching out to open arms
I was gone, you've come so far
And you and me, I'm where I need to be

I'll be alright if you're okay
You feel like home to me
I'll love the night, I'll love the day
You feel like home...  You feel like home.

I'll be alright if you're okay
You feel like home to me
I'll love the night, I'll love the day
You feel like home...  You feel like home.

You feel like home...  You feel like home.  
You feel like you are home...  You feel like home.---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
