let it go, let the good take hold,
im a brother from the west that was bless with a soul 
let me take u by the place 
you probably dont know 
we still live in cali, got a style cultural,
we was, known for the 60's for panthers and hippies, 
now we known for murders pimps and 360's,
side show high speed chases too,
and a crack epidemic that'll turn you blue,
and an AIDS epidemic that could end ya too,
its the ya baby bruba and i thought you knew
Oakland double ao the lao to the zay the zay to the skull a.k.a as the bay 
unique so to speak in a whole lot of ways,
we hardly get the love cuz were close to L.A.
we got our own slang but everybody took it,
now we goin dumb down the ave drivin crooked

chorus 
it the way in the bay,
in the bay, in the bay,
in the bay, in the bay, 
in the baaaaaayyyy

and little cutie cole from the northern pacific,
beach always cold so dont get the gang twisted
thugs are possessed to the def pacin biscuits 
weed on my sleege and the tree is terrific 
we got canibus clubs, phillipinos and blacks, latinos from all over the map
chinese and vietnamese so dont get jacked 
simoens indians tongans tai's, its the bay hommie and we multiply
we never act shy when its time to rock  
and we claim tupac as a source of pride (i say we claim tupac as a source of pride)
let it go, let me bless the flow, 
my people here we go here we go here we here we here we yo
from the streets to the beach
flat lands to peaks 
to the freaks in the jeeps drivin bye beep beep
to the heat meet the seat 
to the cops on the beat 
to the rich 
to the sweet 
to the poor and the weak 
to the youth and the priest
HB 3rd street telegraph to the ave 
north to the to the dt

its the way in the bay
(repete chorus) twice---Lyrics submitted by rob.
