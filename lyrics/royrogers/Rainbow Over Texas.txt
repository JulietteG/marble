Theres a Rainbow over Texas
Theres a sunbeam peeking from behind each cloud
The prairie breeze seems to say out loud
Good Morning to You

Theres a Rainbow over Texas
With the sagebrush singing out the way it should
You cant help feelin just downright good
Good Morning to You

Theres a bluebird high in the branches serenading his lady fair
And you know for certain all the dogies are flirtin
Just because theres spring in the air

Theres a Rainbow over Texas
See the skies are clearing and Im here to say
Its gonna be just a real nice day
Good Morning to you

Theres a bluebird high in the branches serenading his lady fair
And you know for certain all the dogies are flirtin
Just because theres spring in the air

Theres a Rainbow over Texas
With the country side awake and feeling great
Everythings first rate in the Lone Star State
Good morning to you---Lyrics submitted by Michaela Dunaway.
