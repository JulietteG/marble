Another day newspapers say
Life what'd you do to me
I'm always here, you're always there

Hope that's my company

Yeah stars have only so many wishes though
They can't tell what we already know
See I'm just gathering all my eyes can see through
I'm bearing witness to you

I'm bearing witness to you

Familiar words the evening stirs
Life what'd you say to me

I'm promised here, you're precious there
Love you're my destiny

[chorus]

Somedays I surrender
Somedays I resolve
But everyday I'd conquer
With your love
With you love

[chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
