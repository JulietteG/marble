Julian:
Round one I couldnt believe it, you came and knocked me out,
with those killer eyes
You stopped my heart from beating without saying a word
Took me by surprise

Will:
Youre like a rush to my head, Im out of breath
I cant keep up this time
Youre always one step ahead, leave me for dead
Girl youre the best thats why

All:
You make me want to stand out tonight,
Turn out the lights, give up the fight,
I surrender, you got me good,
I knew that you would, did the best that I could,
But girl you move like a butterfly,
Butterfly then you sting like a bee,
I tried to be bulletproof, you got to me
Gonna stand out tonight, turn out the lights, give up the fight,
I surrender

Trent:
Round two, think Im only dreaming
This just cant be for real
Youre right here with me
I just dont wanna wait to take me from this place to where I wanna be

Will:
Youre like a rush to my head, Im out of breath
I cant keep up this time
Youre always one step ahead, leave me for dead
Girl youre the best thats why

All:
You make me want to stand out tonight,
Turn out the lights, give up the fight,
I surrender, you got me good,
I knew that you would, did the best that I could,
But girl you move like a butterfly,
Butterfly then you sting like a bee,
I tried to be bulletproof, you got to me
Gonna stand out tonight, turn out the lights,
Give up the fight, I surrender

Will: (RAP)
Ding ding like a bell ring, throw the towel in
Shes one step ahead of anything I bring
I mean Im not afraid to admit to defeat
She completes me, completely Im free just to be
who I am, so whenever I go down just believe in these
dreams or reality, the reason Im breathing
Im taken, so baby just take me, down with the love Ive been chasing

Jayden:
You make me want to stand out tonight,
Turn out the lights,
Give up the fight,

All:
I surrender, you got me good,
I knew that you would, did the best that I could,
But girl you move like a butterfly,
Butterfly then you sting like a bee,
I tried to be bulletproof, you got to me.
Gonna stand out tonight,
Turn out the lights,
Give up the fight, I surrender
Surrender---
