Couldnt have given you more. 
I tried to love you like you loved me. 
Maybe for wrong reasons....maybe. 
At first it was beautiful. 
Every girl has a fairytale. 
But then you wake up and see 
its not all its cracked up to be. 
It turned into screaming days and solo nights. 
Just wasnt right (yeah...) 
I didnt really wanna see you, 
was happy when you were leaving yeah... 
I liked how it felt when I was by myself. 
And thats the way I wanna be, 
So please, dont beg and plead, 
Just let it be. 
Just let it be... 

[Chorus]

I gotta go. I gotta leave. 
So please dont make it hard for me. 
Ive gave enough, Im tired of love, 
I gotta let it go... [2x]

Couldnt have given you more, 
Gave you everything. 
There wasnt anything that you were denied (yeah). 
But you should never give it all... 
cause sometimes theres nothing left 
but bitterness and regret, 
and it just aint worth it. 

Cause then theres the sudden change 
Out of nowhere, it seems. 
Never know I could be so mean, 
But thats just how far you pushed me (yeah). 

You say it just isnt fair 
and you didnt know. 
You need to take responsibility for your own, 
cause youre grown. 
And you known (yeah) 

[Chorus]

I gotta go. I gotta leave. 
So please dont make it hard for me. 
Ive gave enough, Im tired of love, 
I gotta let it go... [2x]

Now I take the blame 
for trying to stay and work it out. 
Shoulda left before it got complicated, 
Shoulda left when there was still some happiness. 

Yes I take the blame 
for having faith in the relationship. 
I thought it made me complete, 
but the truth is, 
Im complete without it. 

Yeah-eah
(Gotta Let Go-ooo-ooo-oo)

[Chorus]

I gotta go. I gotta leave. 
So please dont make it hard for me. 
Ive gave enough, Im tired of love, 
I gotta let it go... [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Monica.
