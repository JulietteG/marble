I dont want to waste an entire album on you
Ive been there done that yeah
And I dont want to tell who, what, when, where, why and how
Cause who cares, no nobody cares
But I hope you soon find out how to love
Once upon a time you wanted to learn
I though I could teach you but you were more afraid than willing
So when it comes dont push it away 
One day you will find it is the greatest gift
And I hope you dont take advantage of it again

Chorus

Hold her when she wants to be held
Dont yell at her when she is only trying to love you oh oh oh
Take her to her favorite place more often than not
Dont take her kindness for weakness 
Cause Im sure shell love you alot
Support her in all that she does
Dont tear her down lift her up
Cause that is the worse thing you can do to someone you love
Put her high on a pedestal and tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful oh oh oh

I used to think that I could not bare  you to be with anyone but me
But Ive been there done that yeah
And since then  Ive come to think silly of that whole mentality
I still want to find love too, though it wont be with you
I wish for everyone to one day find happiness and love
Including you,  yeah
And I dont want to go into details cause Ive said enough
And its not my intent to hurt you no

But I hope you soon  find out how to love
Once upon a time you wanted to learn
I though I could teach you but you were more afraid than willing
So when it comes dont push it away 
One day you will find it is the greatest gift
And I hope you dont take advantage of it again

Chorus
Hold her when she wants to be held
Dont yell at her when she is only trying to love you oh oh oh
Take her to her favorite place more often than not
Dont take her kindness for weakness 
Cause Im sure shell love you alot
Support her in all that she does
Dont tear her down lift her up
Cause that is the worse thing you can do to someone you love
Put her high on a pedestal and tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful oh oh oh

Tell her when she looks beautiful
Oo oo yeah, Tell her, ummm
Tell her when she looks beautiful---Lyrics submitted by nakira.
