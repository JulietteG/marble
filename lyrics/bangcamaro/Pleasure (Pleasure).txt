Rock it right!
Bring the night!
We don't care as long as you come tonight!

We can tell that you're watching us, baby
We're on a roll
We can tell that you're watching us, honey!
We're in control

Pleasure! (Pleasure!)
Let your feelings come alive!
Pleasure! (Pleasure! ooh yeah!)
Until the daymoon-rise!

Rock it up!
Lock it down!
We're going all night, so baby keep your boots on the ground!

We can tell that you're watching us, baby!
We're on a roll
We can tell that you're watching us, honey!
We're in control

Pleasure! (Pleasure!)
Let your feelings come alive!
Pleasure! (Pleasure! ooh yeah!)
Until the daymoon-rise!

[Guitar solo]

Rock it up! (Rock it up!)
Lock it down! (Lock it down!)
Rock it right! (Rock it right!)
Bring the night! (Bring the night!)

Pleasure! (Pleasure!)
Let your feelings come alive!
Pleasure! (Pleasure! ooh yeah!)
Until the daymoon-riiiiise!---Lyrics submitted by austin.
