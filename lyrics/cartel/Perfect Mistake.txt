Wake me up, I've been dreaming
Feels just like any other day
I'd sit you down, here goes nothing
And you're not gonna like what I say

Get out, oh just get out

'Get out, get out' thats what she said (What she said)
You drive me crazy
I can't believe that's what you did
Don't call me baby
And I know I'm wrong
I knew all along that you'd find out
I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now

Wake me up, I've been dreaming
Cause I haven't heard from you in days
Amazing how this fire just follows me around
And its only you that burns it away

So get out, oh just get out

'Get out, get out' thats what she said (What she said)
You drive me crazy
I can't believe that's what you did
Don't call me baby
And I know I'm wrong
I knew all along that you'd find out
I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now

I see your face every time I close my eyes
Its getting worse you say it comes as no surprise

Why am I hell-bent on losing 
When I can't get you out of my head

'Get out, get out' that's what she said
You drive me crazy
I can't believe tha's what you did
Don't call me baby
And I know I'm wrong
I knew all along that you'd find out
I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now

Oh, I'm the perfect mistake I'm hoping you'll make right now
Oh, you'll make right now---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
