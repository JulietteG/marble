Smooth like a rolling crystal ball
Heading for a sideline
Straight towards the fall
No one will get through
No one will get through at all

The night sky illuminates it all
Like a distant firefight
Always orchestral
The sun is coming soon
Just to pass by you
By you

And I will hide myself away
Save all of these people for another day
And I will hide myself away
Just to spite them all for another day

The moon comes down on me again
Soon this lonely dream now slowly will begin
Giving me this pain
This paralyzing pain again

The night sky illuminates it all
Like a distant firefight
Always orchestral
Time is coming soon
Just to pass by you
Pass by you

And I will hide myself away
Save all of these people for another day
And I will hide myself away
Just to spite them all for another day

Smooth like a rolling crystal ball
Heading for a sideline
Straight towards the fall
No one will get through
No one will get through at all

And I will hide myself away
Save all of these people for another day
And I will hide myself away
Just to spite them all for another day

And I will hide myself away
Much to the chagrin on everyone this day
And I am not much a friend this way
No, I'm not fit to wear that hat today---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
