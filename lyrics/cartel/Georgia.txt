There's somethin 'bout that Georgia summer afternoons
When the sun goes down and the air gets cool
And its, home to me yeah, well its home to me
And I've been missin that place to much it seems
Gave up any home just to find my dreams 
And its weighin on me oh its weighin on me
Hey there its weighin on me

"Chourse"
But I'm only just one second short of callin this my aim
If I gave you somethin different would you call it the same?
But I'm only just one person who am, I to disagree
If I gave you simple reasons would you still be questioning me?

Oh oh
ohohohhhh
ohohhhohhhhh
ohhohhhohwoh
ohoh
I climbed a mountain simply lookin for advice
But all I found were children playin, innocent and nice
Everyone was peaceful, everyone polite
No one to whisper dreams once thought to be a part of life

"Chourse"
But I'm only just one second short of callin this my aim
If I gave you somethin different would you call it the same?
But I'm only just one person who am, I to disagree
If I gave you simple reasons would you still be questioning me?

Oh oh
ohohohhhh
ohohhhohhhhh
ohhohhhohwoh
ohoh
I found a poor man once, he was the age of 53
He spoke about the government and the thought of bein free
What good does us reason if we fail to see?
What good does us freedom if we fail to be free?---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
