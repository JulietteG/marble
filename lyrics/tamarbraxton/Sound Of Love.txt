Candles lit, now, lights down low
My body is calling for only us
You make feel like I'm the only girl
It's so undiscribable

Just hold my body and don't ever let go
Just kiss the places that keeps me wanting more

And take me higher love
And take me till love had enough
Make me scream I'm all yours
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
The sounds of make love
Make love to you baby

It's me and you
We're all alone
You, you got me on a temper I've never known
You make me feel like it's no one in the world
It's just us tonight, tonight
Just hold my body and don't ever let go
Just kiss the places that keeps me wanting more

And take me higher love
And take me till love had enough
Make me scream I'm all yours
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
The sounds of make love

I Want you to say you love me
Plus I'm here till I hear you name me
Cant deal without you
I'm living, continue

Take me higher love
And take me till love had enough
Make me scream I'm all yours
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
The sounds of make love

And take me higher love
And take me till love had enough
Make me scream I'm all yours
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
Cause ain't nothing wrong with that
The sounds of make love

The sounds of love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
