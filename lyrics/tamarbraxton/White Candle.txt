Love don't never mean well when you're living it alone
And everybody knows a broken heart's gotta mend on its own
In life, I know anything worth having ain't easy
But that don't mean that we should make things more difficult

I can feel the distance between us
Stand inside the sun never felt so far apart
And you ain't making it better
When it's gone, it's gone forever
I was running out of love

White candle
White candle
White candle
Don't let our love die
Cause I don't wanna watch us burn out
Don't wanna add fuel to the flame
Is this how love turns out
Don't let our love die
White candle
White candle
White candle
Don't let our love melt away

Ain't gonna point fingers, cause I know it takes two
And ain't no sense in fighting cause we got nothing to prove
If it's worth it to break it, didn't mean a thing at all
Is it too late, can we make it. Light a fire with our hearts and let it burn

Cause I can feel the distance between us
Stay inside the side or else fall apart
Baby and you know we ain't making it better
When it's gone, it's gone forever
I was running out of love

White candle
White candle
White candle
Don't let our love die
Cause I don't wanna watch us burn out
Don't wanna add fuel to the flame
Is this how love turns out
Don't let our love die
White candle
White candle
White candle
Don't let our love melt away

Away, that's the story of our love oh yeah
Just a broken heart, trying to make it back again
Can we fix it baby
Can we fix it babe

White candle
White candle
White candle
Don't let us die
Cause I don't wanna watch us burn out
Don't wanna add fuel to the flame
Is this how love turns out
Don't let our love die
White candle
White candle
White candle
Don't let our love melt away

White candle for our love---Lyrics submitted by Cristi Williams.
