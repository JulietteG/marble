Don't you say it was me
I don't wanna hear it
You say you miss me
I don't wanna feel it, I don't wanna feel it
If you really want it to be
Oh, If you really want it to be
You would make a woman out of me
Oh, I'll be the woman you believe in

You don't want my love I swear you don't want it
You don't want my trust I swear you don't want it
Gave you my other one, I swear you don't want it
You don't want it bad enough, I'mma take it back

I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no

If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love
It's like you threw a curve me
Can't you see I'm hurting
oh, It's gonna be hard for me
I know this where your heart been
That I am way hard wind, tryna let go of you
But I don't really know if I can do it
Close the door on you
You don't really wanna see me do it, nooo

I tried a thousand times
Sold my heart a thousand lies
You won't let me say goodbye
You don't wanna see me do it, nooo

I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no

If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love no no

If you can't give me all your love
I don't want your love no no no

No baby, it's all clear
You leave me here
Wondering, dreaming, still believing
What you say boy, i'm not for it baby
I don't know who you think you're playing
Boy you know I'm the only one you're needing
Truth of the matter is you don't think I really have the strength to leave
But I don't want no

PIECES
Oh no no no
I don't want your pieces
I'm tired of giving all my love
I don't want your pieces
Oh no no no no
I don't want your pieces
Oh oh oh noooo

I deserve more, than just a little part
I don't want nothing, if I can't have it all
I ain't even gonna play, but something I can keep
I want the whole thing, don't forget about me---Lyrics submitted by Lola Thompson.
