(feat. Future)

Do you feel it in your heart?
Do you, do you feel it?
Do you feel it? like I feel it?
Do you feel it in your soul?
Do you, do you feel it?
Do you feel it? like I feel it?
When you know when it's right
You don't let go
You don't let go
We've been through so many things
Ups and downs and in-betweens
If you mean for more love for me
I give you more, just let me know

It's like a love when you never tell somebody
Same love and put you through hell sometimes
You don't give it up to nobody when you love somebody
When you love somebody

And when it breaks your heart
Do you, do you feel it?
Do you feel it? like I feel it?
I took your haze when you're gone
Do you, do you feel it?
Do you feel it? like I feel it?
When you cry, you cry and try
You try some more
You try some more

We've been through so many things
Ups and downs and in-betweens
If you mean for more love for me
I give you more, just let me know

It's like a love when you never tell somebody
Same love and put you through hell sometimes
You don't give it up to nobody when you love somebody
When you love somebody

There's nothing off this few love
You say your kisses make you sugar
Give it to you, give it to love
When you don't really like it there
Can't go deeper baby
That's for my love again and again and again
Turn away more, not anymore

It's like a love when you never tell somebody
Same love and put you through hell sometimes
You don't give it up to nobody when you love somebody
When you love somebody

Let me know
Let me know
Cause I love you
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know ---
