You slept on my couch before
I gave you some good love every night
I made sure you had everything that you wanted
Now this new chick you on
She'll do right, she'll do right
You asked for gas, money, 'cause you never had your own
You on this new fish, like I ain't put you on

I ain't tripping, don't phase me now
I ain't tripping, don't phase me now
I ain't tripping, don't phase me now
I ain't tripping, don't phase me now

Baby I know the real you
Baby I know the real you
Baby I know the real you
Baby I know the real you

Don't flex
Baby I know the real you
Don't flex
Baby I know the real you
Baby don't flex
Baby I know the real you
Don't flex

I know when your momma stay
Your sister keep asking bout me
Don't front, for the 'gram babe
Them pictures be all about me
There's something about you that I just can't explain
Got me all in my feelings
While you're playing this game
I was round, I was down for you
And we both know it's true
Why you acting brand new?

What's this about
Tryna figure it out
How you flip and then change on me
You gon' make me go crazy (crazy)
Acting like you worrying about me
Like I'm trying to work it out
The last thing I'm thinking 'bout
You and your leased benze can both be out
My oh my
You're just a lie, you lie
Why you gotta lie?
You ain't got a credit card, or pot to piss in, the window to throw it out
