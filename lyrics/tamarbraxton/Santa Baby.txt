Santa baby, just slip a Sable under the tree for me;
I've been an awful good girl, Santa baby,
hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue;
I'll wait up for you, dear; Santa baby,
So hurry down the chimney tonight.

Think of all the fun I've missed;
Think of all the boys that I haven't kissed;
Next year I could be just as good... 
if you check off my Christmas list;

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot;
Been an angel all year; Santa baby,
hurry down the chimney tonight.

Santa honey, this really one thing I need...
The deed... to a platinum mine, Santa baby,
hurry down the chimney tonight.

Come and trim my Christmas tree 
decorations bought at Tiffany;
I really do believe in you;
Let's see if you believe in me...

Santa baby, forgot to mention one thing... A ring...
I don't mean on the phone; Santa baby,
hurry down the chimney tonight

Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
