I gave my heart many times before
I've been used, and lied to
I thought it'd never change
Till I got on my knees and I prayed
Crying please take this pain away
Oh lord I need you in my life
You came and made everything right

And I think where would I be if I didn't have you by my side
I'm so blessed
And all I can say is thank you lord
Thank you lord thank you thank you lord

Temptation, sadness  I've been through it all
I've lost friends, thinking they would always be here when I call
So I get on my knees and I pray
Crying please take this pain away
Cause lord I need you in my life
You came and you made everything right

And I say where would I be if I didn't have you by my side
I'm so blessed
And all I can say is thank you for all of your blessings
You're keeping me safe in your arms
Even when I know I don't deserve it
You're always there to catch me when I fall

Where would I be if I didn't have you by my side
I'm so blessed
Where would I be if I didn't have you by my side
I'm so blessed
And all I can say is (Thank you Lord) thank you Lord
(Thank you Lord) Thank you
(Thank you Lord)
I just wanna say thank you
Thank you lord---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
