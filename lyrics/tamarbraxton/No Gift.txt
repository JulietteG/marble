Hurry, it's Christmas Eve.
Does Santa have what I need?
In his sleigh, oh I can't wait
Hear me, games out angel
Will it be the one that I know?
Wrapped in a bow, oh I hope so.

There's gifts that shine
Gifts that wind
One so big that it just can't be mine
Everything [?] is here except just for one thing.

Under the tree there's a million things
From toys for the children to diamond rings
Everyone's smiling, outside is snow
I'd rather be under the mistletoe
It's you and me.
You would think I wouldn't want anything
But to tell the truth
That won't do
Cause no gift compares to you

Sun rise, today is the day
Will he be waiting for me?
With good cheer, I been good all year
I'll be so filled with joy
Once I hear his voice
Santa please get it right
Or Christmas will see me cry

There's gifts that shine
Gifts that wind
One so big that it just can't be mine
Everything is here except just for one thing.

Under the tree (Under the tree) there's a million things (Million things)
From toys for the children to diamond rings (Ohh)
Everyone's smiling, outside is snow
I'd rather be (Under the) under the mistletoe (Under mistletoe)
It's you and me.
You would think I wouldn't want anything (Want anything)
But to tell the truth
That won't do (That won't do)
Cause no gift compares (No gift compares to you) to you

The silent night
Wouldn't be right
If I don't have my baby by my side
If there was anything
I would do anything
He's all I need
Any old gift won't suffice if you're not here tonight

Under the tree there's a million things
From toys for the children to diamond rings
Everyone's smiling, outside is snow
I'd rather be under the mistletoe
With you and me.
You would think I wouldn't want anything
But to tell the truth
It won't do (That won't do)
Cause no gift compares (No gift compares to you) to
You-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
