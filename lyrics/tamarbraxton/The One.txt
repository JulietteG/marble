[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah
On the track
Go

[Verse 1:]
You know very well who you are
You're the only one, you've got my heart
And you've had a few, boy one too many
But I'm the only one to make you whole

[Chorus:]
I reminisced the way we kissed
It felt so personal
You took the chance to get my love and now you know

(It was all a dream)

That I don't need no one baby
With out you I'm incomplete
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me

I don't want nobody else
Baby all I need is you
(You're the one I want)
And I don't want nobody else
Baby all I need is you
(You're the one I want)

[Verse 2:]
You know very well, you're a star
Cuz I don't go that far, look where we are
And ain't none like you, one in a million
But I'm the only one to count you ooooooh

[Chorus:]
I reminisced the way we kissed
It felt so personal
You took the chance to get my love and now you know

(It was all a dream)

That I don't need no one baby (I don't need no one)
With out you I'm incomplete (incomplete)
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me (put it all on me yeah)

I don't want nobody else
Baby all I need is you
(You're the one I want)
And I don't want nobody else
Baby all I need is you
(You're the one I want)

I reminisced the way we kissed
It felt so personal
You took the chance to get my love and now you know

That I don't need no one baby (no baby)
With out you I'm incomplete (incomplete)
My love is just like the bar (like a bar)
Put it all on me (put it all on me yeah, yeah)
Put it all on me
All on me
Whoooo! ---
