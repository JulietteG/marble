I wish that we were always high
I wish that we could swim around the sky

They say if you believe then you won't fall
We'll leave these messy lives and rise above it all

You never love if you never trust
How do we love when you fall like dust

I'll be the match that holds your fire
I'll be the note that sings from your wire

If I can give you all my love

The light we use when we get lost
The light we choose and never mind the cost

Well that's what we hope to see in each other's eyes
It's what we hope to feel on our highest highs

If I can give you all my love---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
