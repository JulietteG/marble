You say your eyes have lost the price
A love that can't be won
Now your stare that doesn't care 
Nowhere to run

When you're bright the future's light
In the dark it weighs a ton
Where I can't breathe and I can't leave
Nowhere to run

You let all your dreams dissolve
Softly the night takes the sun
The twilight's call fills us all
Nowhere to run

When you can't move
What can't be moved
Let's just say it's no fun
Nowhere to run
Nowhere
Nowhere to run---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
