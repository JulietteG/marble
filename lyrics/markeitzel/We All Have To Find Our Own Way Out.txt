We all have two choices
Be a stiff or move
Be a stranger to your skin
Or live in the groove
But you don't want nothing
You're beyond all care
And you know what, I don't love you
Enough for your despair

We all have to find (x3)
Our own way out

You talk of suicide
Well hurray
And yeah, that used to be me
But now what do I say
Everyone needs a hand
To help them down
You know what, I'll hold your hand
But I won't drown

We all have to find (x3)
Our own way out

Lonely is the soul
Who pays and pays
Lonely the hero's role
You always play
Like a broken child star
Proud of some crappy show
But you know what, I hate drama
And I don't wanna know

We all have to find (x3)
Our own way out---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
