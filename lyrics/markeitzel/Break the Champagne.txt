I wish you liked the songs I sing
All you see is a fool cursing the dark
For a goddamn sign from the goddamn sky
That my life isn't falling apart

I don't blame you, hon, not at all
My boo hoo voice just annoys
I don't care if you life or die
But I wouldn't wanna steal your joy

You'll go your way, I'll go mine
You can't value a life by its worth
We all bend to a hidden hand
Like smoke blows away from the earth

So stay in touch
I love you much
We'll break the champagne 
Across the bow
Cut the ribbon
Let it go

Let me serenade your gayla parade
I'll become a romantic delight
We're the pride they brush aside
We're the dust that hangs in the light

Stay in touch
I love you much
We'll break the champagne 
Across the bow
Cut the ribbon
Let it go---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
