Surely you remember, this old resort hotel
Its pink and white all over and historical as Hell
F. Scott and Zelda stayed here and you and me as well
At least thats how the story goes, the porters like to tell

A cold hard rain comes falling down
It wasn't like this last time around
There's no calm center to this storm
oh baby, why don't you quit leaving me alone

There's nothing on the TV, no message on the phone
Nothing but an awful lot of nothing going on
And every radio station plays the same forsaken song
Youd think I would've had the sense to leave this place alone

Well some dreams die with dignity
They fade out clean and quietly
Some won't let you let them go
ah baby, why don't you quit leaving me alone

Same old corner bedroom, seven stories up
That overlooks the window, that overlooks the gulf
The same old sleazy porter with the after hours stuff
I think I'll kick the walls around and beat myself up

Well some dreams die with dignity
They fade out clean and quietly
Some won't let you let them go
ah baby, why don't you quit leaving me ...

A cold hard rain comes pouring down
It wasnt like this last time around
Theres no calm center to this storm
ah baby, why don't you quit leaving me alone---Lyrics submitted by Felisha Elliott.
