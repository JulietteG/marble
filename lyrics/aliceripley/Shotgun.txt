suitcase
end table
radio
a box full of shoes and records
ready to go

take me along 
I wanna ride shotgun
I wanna laugh at your jokes
I wanna know you better than anyone
but anyone can see why you'd run

I packed
a small bag
can't you see
a truck full of things
you cherish
what about me

take me along 
I wanna ride shotgun
I wanna laugh at your jokes
I wanna know you better than anyone
but anyone can see why you'd run

when I
tried to find
a substitute
a box full of hearts
and letters
he wasn't you

take me along 
I wanna ride shotgun
I wanna laugh at your jokes
I wanna know you better than anyone
but anyone can see why you'd run

waiting
couldn't sleep
Christmas eve
you sent a box
of presents
but I still believe

you'll take me along 
I wanna ride shotgun
I wanna laugh at your jokes
I wanna know you better than anyone
but anyone can see why you'd run---Lyrics submitted by Nicole Wright.
