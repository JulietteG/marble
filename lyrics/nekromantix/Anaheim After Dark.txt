The day is over the gates are shut
The park is closed and there's no signs of life
We're tied together by a true lovers knot
I'm no more still forever you'll be my wife.

During day a playground for the young
At night a gateway to the other side
Even in death our love is really strong
I'm gone forever but you'll always be my bride

[chorus]

In this twilight zone
Just you and I
It's peaceful and quiet
In Anaheim After Dark
We're all alone
Under the midnight sky
True love & kisses
In Anaheim After Dark

Each night we meet at this place
Watching the sun set and the moon rise
The memories of me you embrace
I ceased to exist but this wedlock never dies

In this twilight zone
Just you and I
It's peaceful and quiet
In Anaheim After Dark
We're all alone
Under the midnight sky
True love & kisses
In Anaheim After Dark---Lyrics submitted by cinthia.
