The stripper mummy's death dance causes shiver and earthquakes
Out of the tomb comes sexy zombies, dead corpses awakes
The restless headless horseman is looking for his hat
A guana smelling witch is eating coffinnails with a bat
Upstairs the frenzy she-devils tempts with wild mad sin, you know
I recommend infernal torment demented bondage are go

Back in that old haunted cathouse
Where everybody used to go - All pleasures were for free
Back in that old haunted cathouse
If only I could turn back time, that's where I would be

Bloody Mary and King Kong is kissing while lost souls cry
Hand in hand watching meteors and stars on the midnight sky
A ghastly crew of wicked men arrive in the batmobile
Klingon's drunk flying their UFO - Oooh, what a thrill

Back in that old haunted cathouse
Where all my friends used to go - All pleasures were for free
Back in that old haunted cathouse
If only I could turn back time, that's where I would be

Back in that old haunted cathouse
Where all my friends used to go - All pleasures were for free
Back in that old haunted cathouse
If only I could turn back time, that's where I would be

Back in that old haunted cathouse
If only I could turn back time, that's where I would be
Back in that old haunted cathouse
If only I could turn back time, that's where I would be

Back in that...(this is where things get a little out of control!)...old haunted cathouse.---Lyrics submitted by benjamin.
