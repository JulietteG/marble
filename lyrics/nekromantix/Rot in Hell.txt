Don't you fucking hate,
waiting forever,
just to have your fries served cold?
(That sucks!)
Or being on the phone
forced to listen to crap music,
when they put you on damn hold,
(Piece of shit!)
Mother-fuckers,
Cock-suckers,
Hell's Bells and Buckets of blood

You're nothing less than a twat,
and if you waste my time,
I'll dance on your grave,
you worthless bag of slime
why don't you suck my cojones and creep back into your cave!
Fuck you beeatch!
I hope you rot in hell

Tell what is worse,
than being stuck in traffic,
just to see some jerk cut in,
(Fuck that!)
Or when your done in the rest-room
and theres no more paper
(shit!)
Tooth-brush fell into the garbage bin
Motherfuckers,
Cocksuckers,
Hell's Bells and buckets of blood

you're nothing less than a cunt
and I don't need you in my life
I'll turn your guts into a tie or a scarf,
to end this bloody strife,
why don't you go choke the chicken
before you make me barf!
Hasta la Vista baby
I hope you rot in hell

I can't ignore it and it gets on my nerves
(Fuck that! Fuck that!)
I can't get over how some people think,
stay off my back there is no room for you in my world,
I hope you rot in hell,
I HOPE YOU ROT, IN, HELL!---Lyrics submitted by martin.
