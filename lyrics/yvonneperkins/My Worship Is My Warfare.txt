Verse: 
The enemy hit me with a hard blow
pulled the rug right out from under my feet, you know
he came after everything that was dear to me
attacked my home, family and ministry

Chorus: 
My worship is my warfare, my worship is my warfare
it is a mighty weapon against the enemy I do declare
my worship is my warfare, my worship is my warfare

Verse: 
Oh, how he laughed and danced all over the place
when he saw the tears running down my face
I knew I would have to win this battle on my knees
the tears of a warrior would soon bring him to defeat

Chorus: 
My worship is my warfare, my worship is my warfare
it is a mighty weapon against the enemy I do declare
my worship is my wafare, my worship is my wafare

Bridge: 
Listen carefully to me I will teach you the sound of worship warfare
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to God Almighty
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to God Almighty 
hallelujah, lord you worthy
all power belongs to you my mighty king 
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to God Almighty
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to God Almighty 
hallelujah, lord you worthy, I give you praise and 
honor. All power belongs to you my mighty king

Verse: 
The sound of my worship brought terror to his face
now I was the one laughing an dancing all over the place
I learned a long time ago there is power in my praise
when I worship God he sends his angels quickly to my aid

Chorus: 
My worship is my warfare, my worship is my warfare
it is a mighty weapon against the enemy I do declare
my worship is my warfare, my worship is my warfare---Lyrics submitted by Yvonne Perkins.
