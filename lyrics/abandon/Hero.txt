He walked the dirty streets
Famous for nothing
He said, "Come follow me"
And they came

A face like all the rest
But something was different
The Son of God would lead the way
And soon they all would say

There He goes, a Hero, a Savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world

He spoke with clarity
Walked across the sea
A single word
Would calm the storm

His touch could heal the sick
But He was called a hypocrite
Laid behind the stone
His death was shortly mourned
He left the curtain torn

And there He goes, a Hero, a Savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world

He chose to take the cross
Shed tears for the lost
The broken and the needy
Forgiving those who were and will be

The angel made it clear
He told them have no fear
He's not here, He's not here

There He goes, a Hero, a Savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world, the Savior of the world
The Savior of the world---Lyrics submitted by john.
