Patiently I wait 
And all I can say
I need so much more of you
VERSE 1
In your light I'll stay
And I want you to drop me into your arms full of love
Take me where I can't go alone

CHORUS
Give this soul what it needs
I want life from you in me
Jesus your love lifts me up
You're all that I've been searching for
Everything I have is yours
Jesus your love lifts me up

VERSE2
I wait here for you to speak
Words that give new life to me
I know I could never have to much
when I am in a desperate place
You give light  to my escape
and carry me when I am weak
Oh Lord it's you I seek

CHORUS

BRIDGE
Hold me close
When I fall down
I'm crying out 
With out a sound

Hold me close
When I fall down
I'm crying out 
Save me now
