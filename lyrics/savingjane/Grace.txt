I don't wanna see, I don't wanna see anything.
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be lost again.
I don't wanna walk, I don't wanna walk far from You.
I just wanna live, I just wanna live like You do.
As I stumble to the light of grace,
You said You'd always have a place... for me.
Got a little scared, got a little scared in the woods,
And everywhere I turn, everywhere I turn nothing's good.
Then I saw a little light, saw a little light shine for me,
And I found a little path, found a little path at my feet.
As I fumble with the gift of my free will,
He says hush now, listen to my voice, be still.
My refuge, my Father.
The only Living Water.
I'm weary, I'm broken.
I've cracked my heart wide open.
Unholy, unworthy,
And still You reassure me.
You knew me,
Before I new myself.
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be lost again.---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
