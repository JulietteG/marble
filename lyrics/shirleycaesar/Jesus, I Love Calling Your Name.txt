Chorus: 
Jesus, Jesus, I love calling Your name. 
Jesus, Jesus, everyday Your name is the same.

Verse 1: 
When the troubles surround me, 
and I didnt have to despair; 
Lord, You told me that Youd be right there. 
Seems like all my problems, they have just begun; 
but Im not gonna worry about it no more, Youve already won. 

Chorus: 
Jesus, Jesus, I love calling Your name. 
Jesus, Jesus, everyday Your name is the same.

Verse 2: 
I remember the time when I felt so all alone, 
when I needed You, Jesus, all I had to do was call. 
I called You in the morning, 
I called You late at night, 
but when I went on my knees and called You, Lord, 
You made everything alright. 

Chorus: 
Jesus, Jesus, I love calling Your name. 
Jesus, Jesus, everyday Your name is the same.---Lyrics submitted by Janet Price.
