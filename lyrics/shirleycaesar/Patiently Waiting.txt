Verse 1
Don't be weary, don't be dismayed,
God's going to wipe all of your tears away;
for He knows all your suffering and He knows all pain,
He knows your every weakness, God knows all about your strain.

Chorus
He's working it out,
He's working it out,
I don't know what you've been going through,
but He knows what it's all about.

He's working it out,
He's working it out,
keep patiently waiting,
keep patiently waiting,
keep patiently waiting
for I know He'll bring you out.

Verse 2
You've been searching for an answer and no one seems to know.
In a world of confusion, that's filled with more confusion,
then you begin to wonder, 'what's the use of my going on''

Chorus

Bridge
Hold on, don't you ever give up,
let my Jesus in, I guarantee He knows.
Though the road is rough and the going gets tough,
the hills are hard to climb, looking for peace of mind.

Vamp
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

Ending
Keep patiently waiting,
keep patiently waiting,
keep patiently waiting
for I know He'll bring you out.---Lyrics submitted by emmalewis.
