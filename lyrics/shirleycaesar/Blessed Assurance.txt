Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine, mine, mine, mine 
Oh, what a foretaste, a foretaste of glory divine, oh yes 
And an Heir to Salvation, yes, Amen, I've been purchased by God 
So glad, born of His Spirit, oh glory 
I'm just washed in His blood 
This is my story, this is my, my song, thank God for my song 
I'm praising my Savior all the day long, Alleluia 
This is my story, I'm mighty glad I've got a song, yes I have 
I'm praising my Savior I don't ever get tired of praisin' Him 
All the day long, Alleluia 
Perfect submission 
Oh, perfect delight, that's what it is in my life 
Visions of rapture, look at it bursting on my sight 
You know what, you know what 
Now the angels are descending, yes, they are 
Praying from up above, yeah, whoa yeah, yes 
Echoes of mercy, mercy suits my case 
And whispers of love, Alleluia, Alleluia 
This is my story, oh this is my song 
I'm praising my Savior, Alleluia 
And praising Him all the day long 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh this is my story, yes it is, yes it is, yes it is 
I've got my song, Alleluia 
Praisin' my Savior, all the day long 
Praisin' my Savior, all the day long 
Praisin' my Savior, all the day 
All the day long, all day long---
