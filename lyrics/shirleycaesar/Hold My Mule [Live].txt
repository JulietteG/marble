I feel like praising, praising him
I feel like praising, praising him
I feel like praising, praising him
Praise Him in the morning,
Praise Him all day long,
I feel like praising, praising Him.
If you don't wanna praise him don't hinder me
If you don't wanna praise him don't hinder me
Praise Him in the morning,
Praise Him all day long,
I feel like praising, praising Him.

Come on and praise the Lord while you have a chance
Come on and praise the Lord while you have a chance
Praise him in the morning
Praise him all day long
I feel like praising praising him---Lyrics submitted by carolyn.
