God will make a way
I know that He will, Ive seen it and He will
God will bring you, bring you out
I know that He will, Ive seen it and I know He will
If you just let Him make a way

God will make a way
I know that He will, Ive seen it and He will
Ive seen it and I know He will
God will make a way
I know He will, Ive seen it and He will
Make a way

God will, yes, Hell make a way
He knows exactly what youve been feeling now
So dont you doubt and dont you give up now
For the God I serve is already working it out

God will bring you out, for He knows the way
I know that He will, He knows a way out of your problems
Ive seen it and He will
He knows a way out of your situation
God will, God will, God will bring you out
I know that He will, oh, Ive seen it and I know that He will
Make a way
So you see Im trying, He made a way for me

I understand just what youve been going through
Listen, it is not the time for you to give up now
You've been praying and your miracle is on the way

God will, God will make a way
Wont you let Him?
Yes, He will
Ive tried it for myself
Ive seen it and He will
I know that, I know that, I know He will
God will, wont you try him?
Make a way, yes He will
I know that He will, Ive tried it for myself
Ive seen it and He will
Lord will make a way
I know He will, yes He will
Brother James you see I tried it for myself
And I dare you to try the Lord
Hell be your friend, Hell be right beside you
When youre sick and cant get well
When the doctors gives you bad news 
But I know that He will
Watch this: Jesus, step right in
Hell be right there, I know He will
Oh yeah, He will---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
