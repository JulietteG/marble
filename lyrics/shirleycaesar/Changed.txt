I know i've been changed
(hey hey) i know i've been changed
(you know) that i've been changed
(you know) the angels in heaven done signed my name

(chorus)
I know i've been changed
I know i've been changed
I know i've been change
The angels in heaven done signed my name

Good lord now i (i know i've been changed)
Come on help me ya'll
I said that (i know i've been changed)
I know i've
Oooh weee i (i know i've been changed)
I know the angel (the angels in heaven done signed my name)

Wait a minute
Well if you don't know believe that
I've been redeemed you know the angel (angels in heaven done signed my name)

Aah yes

Well follow me down to that old jordan stream
You know the angel (angels in heaven done signed my name)

I stepped in the water
And the wa wa wa wa wa water was cold
You know the angel (angels in heaven done signed my name)
Yes they have

Well it chilled my body but not my soul
You know (angels in heaven done signed my name)
God lord now (i know i've been changed) (come on church)
I said that (i know i've been changed) (i know)
Changed, angels (angeles in heaven done signed my name)
Wait a minute

Somebody said how can a brown cow
Eat green grass and give you white milk
(ugh) if you think that's something
God's chemical laboratory of redemption
Took my my black soul and dipped in red blood
And i came out white as snow

(ooh the angel) in heaven done singed my name
Yes they did yes
Oh lord hey Lord---Lyrics submitted by Mardie.
