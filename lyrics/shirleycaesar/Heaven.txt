When the Lord shall crack the sky
Im going to my home on high, Heaven
To a city called Heaven
Im going there
(repeat)

Where the streets are paved with gold
And the half has never been told
Verse1:
See the Lord doesnt want
Any man to perish
Hes so kind
Take advantage of your time
Well it wont be long
Well be going home, over to Heaven
Choir: To a city called Heaven
Im going there

Repeat Chorus

Verse2:
John said he saw a new Heaven
And he saw a brand new earth
Prepared all Gods children
So prepare to meet the Lord
Nothing but the pure in heart
Shall see God, over in Heaven
To a city called Heaven
Im going there

Repeat Chorus

Vamp:
Im going there (8x)
Love over there
Joy over there
(4x)
Im going there (8x)
To a city called Heaven,
Im going there---Lyrics submitted by Shelia  Drake.
