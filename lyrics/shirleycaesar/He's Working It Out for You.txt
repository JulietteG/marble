Verse 1: 
Though the pressures of life seems to weigh you down, 
and you dont know which way to turn; 
God is concerned and Hes working it out for you. 

Verse 2: 
The child thats on cocaine, through prayer he can change. 
That marriage thats on the verge of breaking up, 
although sometimes you have to walk alone. 
Now you ask yourself, is there a word from the Lord, 
you need a blessing and you need it right away; 
God is concerned and Hes working it out for you. 

Verse 3: 
No peace in the home, and no peace on the job, 
the bills are due, and your health is failing too; 
God is concerned and Hes working it out for you. 

Chorus: 
Hes working it out, 
Hes working it out for you. 

He's working it out, 
He's working it out for. 

God cares, 
Im so glad to know He cares, 
I'm so glad to know He cares, 
and Hes working it out for you.---Lyrics submitted by Clarissa.
