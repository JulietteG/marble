Fixing to find you in this treacherous terrain
There's landslide, and landmines, it's a jungle that we made
You're not the king of it no more
I'm not the girl that you'd die for
None of us is better than the other
None of us is better than the other

It draws blood
The sweet sting
But it's poison that we know
I thank God you found me
And God knows how I let you go

Are we a kingdom worth saving
Is it a shadow I'm chasing
I know I'll never see you in another
You know you'll never see me in another

To lose you, really lose you
I'm gonna have to lose myself
I'm gonna have to lose myself
No matter how long it will hurt like this
White knuckle into the apocalypse
Gotta go crazy, crazy to lose you

Day flies, and night falls
I break out my artillery
I suit up for night crawls
I go out, disguised as me

No matter how much I flaunt it
I can't go home 'cause it's haunted
I don't know if my heart can still afford this
Sleeping in a bed that was our fortress

To lose you, really lose you
I'm gonna have to lose myself
I'm gonna have to lose myself
No matter how long it will hurt like this
White knuckle into the apocalypse
Gotta go crazy, crazy to lose you

Used to love listening to sad songs
I'd trace my finger all along
The silver linings
Now I don't listen to sad songs
course my old world is blowing up behind me
It's gone for good
A better world will find me

To lose you, really lose you
I'm gonna have to lose myself
I'm gonna have to lose myself
No matter how long it will hurt like this
White knuckle into the apocalypse
Gotta go crazy, crazy to lose you

No matter how long it will hurt like this
White knuckle into the apocalypse
Gotta go crazy, crazy to lose you---
