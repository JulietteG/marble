Chain me free
Lose the key, right now

She was from my home town,
I'd never met her
Ditched her boyfriends
'cause I was better
She showed me pictures in her car...
pictures of the Beach Boys
and Kelly Slater
Bounced from the party
'cause the girls all hate her
She said she wants to see the stars

She's had some fast times
First times always last times
Out in the foxglove, I'm in...

Chain me free
or let it all fall
We can be all, we can be all, I said
What's in your head?
Lose the key
or please don't call
We can be all, we can be all, I said
She kissed me dead.

She calls me during Loveline
and gets the machine
She wants to see me
but not to be seen
As if she's got some mystery
I missed her for a few weeks
before I called her
Still didn't get it,
so this is how I stalled her:
Even though you're seventeen,
I've got to tell you
you're too old for me

She's had some fast times
First times always last times
Out in the foxglove, was that?..

You're all drugged out and delirious
Don't close your eyes - are you hearing this?
I'm about to say something
that I swore I'd never say
I gotta get it out before I get away
I gotta get away before I get it out
I gotta get away before I get it out
I gotta get away before I get it out

Chain me free
Lose the key---
