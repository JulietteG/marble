If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you
Ohhh, If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me
If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me

Always, thinking.
Don't you feel nostalgic for our future?
When you'll look back and reminisce
Where you were when you heard me say

If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me
If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me

Always thinking
A little bit of mystery in your posture
A little bit of brash, little bit quiet
Not sure till you heard, you heard, you heard me say
Today, well you heard me say

If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me
If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me
Always thinking
Of me...

After work I look by where you sunk
Six stops past my block
Until now I never had enough no,
To talk such big talk.

If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you

Ohhhhhhhhh

If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me
If I were you (if I were you)
If I were you babe, I'd be, I'd be thinking of me
Always thinking
Of me---
