Whoa oh whoa oh
So so so so so when you got no place to go
It don't matter that your watch runs slow
So chalk one more hour destroyed
And sing it whoa oh whoa oh
I can't afford to sleep
By my own accord Im a borderline creep
My old friends are all employed

Lookin' out the window at a brick wall
I swore that I would be
the first one to make this zip code
fucking history
Lookin' out the window at the same wall
I never thought Id be
With no future
Stuck in this mode
Stuck in history

These pages fill up too slow
I've got a red-5 fever and nowhere to go
So stamp one more day destroyed
And sing it whoa oh whoa oh
The company I keep
is the reflection of a borderline creep
Naked and paranoid

Lookin' out the window at a brick wall
I swore that I would be
The first one to make this zip code
Fucking history
Lookin' out the window at the same wall
I never thought I'd be
With no future
Stuck in this mode
Stuck in history

Who am I to deny getting shrink-wrapped?
I'm a borderline creep
Real world bitch slapped

Whoa oh whoa oh

Lookin' out the window at a brick wall
I swore that I would be
The first one to make this zip code
Fucking history

Whoa oh whoa oh---
