Day out, day in
It's the alarm versus me
and the snooze button wins.
I've been waking all my life
to become what I'm going to be.
I'm a crone, la da da da da da
A headstone

Day out, day in
and begin again

Day out, day in
recycle bins
cash out, cash in
debit pins
day out, day in
the paper cuts my skin again
skin again

Cash out, cash in
I can burn all I earn
on some weakness or whim
without thinking
I'm a mark for their marketing plans
I'm Americancer
A Myspace romancer

Cash out, cash in
and begin again

Day out, day in
recycle bins
Cash out, cash in
debit pins
Day out, day in
the paper cuts my skin again
skin again

Day out, day in
Vitamins
give out, give in
Vicodins
Day out, day in
the paper cuts my skin again
skin again
skin again
skin again

All ye, all ye, come home free
Olly Olly oxen free
Day in, day out
I call time out

All ye, all ye, come home free
Olly Olly oxen free
Day in, day out
I call time out
I call time out

Give out, give in
If a man's hands show his trade does it suit me then
This papercut skin that makes me wince with each hand
I'm required to
shake, shake, shake, shake

Day out, day in
recycle bins
cash out, cash in
debit pins
Day out, day in
the paper cuts my skin again
skin again

Day out, day in
Vitamins
give out, give in
Vicodins
Day out, day in
the paper cuts my skin again
skin again
skin again
skin again

I call time out
Olly Olly oxen free---
