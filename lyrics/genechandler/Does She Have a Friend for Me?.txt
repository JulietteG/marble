She's so easy to look at, she's got style, she's got grace
I would do anything just to be in your place
You're my best friend you know that i would do you no wrong
There's a moon out tonight I don't wanna be alone

Ask her, ask her
Does she have a friend for me
Does she, does she
Does she have a friend for me

We could fly down to ginos
Maybe date and a show
We could come back to my place
Where the lights are down low
I know love is a gamble, got my eyes open wide
Spin my heart like a wheel
I feel lucky tonight

Ask her, ask her 
Does she have a friend for me
Does she, does she
Does she have a friend for me
I just wanna know

Cause that pretty little thing you got there
All i know is somethin' would happen
Does she (does she does she) oh does she
I got a little money in  my pocket
And i wanna...............
Is that one out there for me

You could do me the favor 
Get me sick off the blues
Here's a dime for the phone
I don't think she'd refuse
You're my best friend i know that
You would do me no wrong
I just want me a woman i could call my own

(2x)
Ask her ask her
Does she have a friend for me
Does she does she 
Does she have a friend for me

I just wanna know

Cause that pretty little thing you got there
All i know is somethin' would happen
Does she (does she does she) oh does she
I got a little money in my pocket
And i wanna...........
Is that one out there for me

(2x)
Ask her ask her
Does she have a friend for me
Does she does she 
Does she have a friend for me---Lyrics submitted by MARI ALDAMA.
