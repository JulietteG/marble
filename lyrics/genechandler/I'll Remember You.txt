Girl when I look back on yesterday
There's a memory that will never, ever fade away
I guess that I'll be here forever loving you
Even though you're his, there's nothing I can do
Well I'll remember you girl, when our love was true girl
We shared some memories.
Whoa ho ho, I'll remember you and I'll remember you

If I remember nothing else, I'll remember you
The times we shared and the things we used to do
You were mine and you made my life so bold
We shared a love no words can yet unfold
And we shared more than time girl, your life was mine girl and my life was yours girl
I'll remember you and I'll remember you yeah, yeah, yeah

Even though we have gone our separate way
I see your face everywhere, everyday
And even when I'm sad girl, I think of you girl
And I'll always, I'll always, I'll always, I'll always I'll remember you
And I'll remember you and I'll remember you
The way you walk, the way you talk, the way you smile
I'll remember you and I'll remember you
When you talk, when you walk, when you smile I'll remember you---Lyrics submitted by Leon Knight.
