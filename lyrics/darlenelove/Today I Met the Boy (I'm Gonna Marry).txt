Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry
He's all I've wanted all my life and even more
He smiled at me and then the music started playing
Here comes the bride when he walked through the door

Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry
The boy whose life and dream and love I wanna share
For on my hand a band of gold appeared before me
The band of gold I always dreamed I'd wear

When we kissed I felt a sweet sensation
This time it wasn't just my imagination

Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry
He's just what I've been waiting for, oh yes
With every kiss, oh this is it, my heart keeps saying
Today I met the boy I'm going to marry

When we kissed I felt a sweet sensation
This time it wasn't just my imagination

Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry
He's just what I've been waiting for, oh yeah
With every kiss, oh this is it, my heart keeps saying
Today I met the boy I'm going to marry

Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah
Today I met the boy
Today I met, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Today I met
yeah yeah yeah
Today I met---
