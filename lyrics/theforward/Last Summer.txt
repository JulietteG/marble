There's sure to be two people more cooler than you or me
But Im too inclined to think so
There comes a time when every man needs to step up and fight
At least it says that on my tattoo

Its a last summer so get out while you can piranha
Youre swimming alone
The air is thicker; lets drink up all our parents liquor
Youre driving me home

Dont even trip on the denizens of hip 
Because we know the things that you dont know
We are the guys that stand behind the guys that stand behind you at shows
It seems to me there's responsibility to make, make appropriate exits
I dont want to be lonely like the people I have sex with, accept this.

It's a last summer so get out while you can piranha
Youre swimming alone
The air is thicker; lets drink up all our parents liquor
Youre driving me home

We shall stall death before the fall
One last call and I cant hold on any longer

The last summer so get out while you can piranha
Youre swimming alone
The air is thicker; lets drink up all our parents liquor
Youre driving me home

It's a last summer
The last summer, home
The last summer
The last summer, home---Lyrics submitted by Brandi.
