They gotta brush you aside, make up the time,
stick to the scene make the masses so clean.
We know.
They gotta tell you who's right  tell me I'm wrong.
Two puppets, one hand and a heart felt song.
We know, we know, we know. we know.

Cause we've been down this road before
If the word is broken will it bring you down?
Yeah we've been down this road before.
When the world is choking will it bring you down?
Yeah we've been down this road before.
Will it bring you?

It's eyes front' in a nation of disinformation.
Right from the start keep us all in the dark.
We know, we know, we know. we know.
We jumped ship on the saviour of modern behaviour
Swallowed the blame make us always the same
We know, we know, we know. we know.

Cause we've been down this road before
If the word is broken will it bring you down?
Yeah we've been down this road before.
When the world is choking will it bring you down?
Yeah we've been down this road before.
Will it bring you?

Tell me I'm right tell me I'm wrong.
Stick to the scene make the masses so clean.

Cause we've been down this road before
If the word is broken will it bring you down?
Yeah we've been down this road before.
When the world is choking will it bring you down?
Yeah we've been down this road before.
Will it bring you?---Lyrics submitted by ghssh.
