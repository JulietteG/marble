Oh, ohhh

[Verse 1:]
Love, don't mean a thing
If you ain't comfortable
If you can't stop the way you feel when
Things, don't go your way
And takes a turn, for the worst
And I, shouldn't've done you wrong babe

[Chorus:]
There's some things I know that I'm gone regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left
Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget
It's not your fault, baby you were the best
I was just draining your love

[Verse 2:]
You use to try to save us
I was the one who played us
I was the one who made us, fall apart
And I was just too afraid of
Didn't know what love was made of
'Cause of my past relation
I was by myself, I didn't care about you, ooh, ooh, ohh
I don't want you to leave me?,
Hey, So I'm a tell the truth, ooh, ooh, oh oh ohh
I took you for granted
[? ]

[Chorus:]
There's some things I know that I'm gone regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left
Cause I was draining your love


The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget
It's not your fault, baby you were the best
I was just draining your love

[Bridge:]
Hate to beat myself up
But I gotta fess up
Really made a mess
Of your heart, of your heart

Baby, please forgive me
Start a new beginning
I'll pick up the broken pieces to your heart
And I know that I...

[Chorus:]
There's some things I know that I'm gone regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left (please don't go)
Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget (ain't easy baby)
It's not your fault, baby you were the best
I was just draining your love (your love)

There's some things I know that I'm gone regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left
Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget
It's not your fault, baby you were the best
I was just draining your love...---Lyrics submitted by heather.
