(LeToya Talking)
I don't know
it's not you, it's the ones that hurt me
and i just can't afford to be hurt again so....

Hold on, I'm not really tryna go through this again
I'm not jumpin up&down; about lovin
(excuseme if) I dont wanna dive back into that pool of love
I'm done swimmin(i'm good)
see i don't feel like gettin to know you(no)
what you like to eat(no)
and what you like to do(no)
see that's too much information to deal with
play the love game with anotha(cuz i quit)

don't wanna start over again
cuz I've had enough
I don't wanna hurt again
sorry i give up
already know what im missing
pain an heartach im tired of it cuz my eyes are stayin dry now
don't wanna let another in
cuz im cool on that
cuz it might happen again
got no time for that
and it keeps repeating
see that's insanity
but im cured from this disease can you forgive me

Chorus:

you gotta forgive me
I know it might sound crazy 
but right now my heart's a little lazy
tired of hookin up, tired of caring
i don't feel like lovin you( feel like lovin you)
you gotta forgive me 
i know it might sound crazy 
but who knew love could be so draining
tired of hookin up, tired of caring 
i don't feel like lovin you( feel like lovin you no more)

Baby there's sumthing that you gotta understand
it's not your fault but i changed my plans
And i've said that before but now
(it's different) I really mean it
Oh..see the problem is that i
loved soo hard and i've got 
too burn and im not goin down that road again
cuz i've found a different route

don't wanna start over again
cuz I've had enough
I don't wanna hurt again
sorry i give up
already know what im missing
pain an heartach im tired of it cuz my eyes are stayin dry now
don't wanna let another in
cuz im cool on that
cuz it might happen again
cuz i've got no time for that
and it keeps repeating
see that's insanity
but im cured from this disease can you forgive me

Chorus:

you gotta forgive me
I know it might sound crazy 
but right now my heart's a little lazy
tired of hookin up, tired of caring
i don't feel like lovin you( feel like lovin you)
you gotta forgive me 
i know it might sound crazy 
but who knew love could be so draining
tired of hookin up, tired of caring 
i don't feel like lovin you( feel like lovin you no more)

Bridge: 

I hope you understand
I mean i wanna love again
but i just can't do this no more
I'm sorry

Chorus:

you gotta forgive me
I know it might sound crazy 
but right now my heart's a little lazy
tired of hookin up, tired of caring
i don't feel like lovin you( feel like lovin you)
you gotta forgive me 
i know it might sound crazy 
but who knew love could be so draining
tired of hookin up, tired of caring 
i don't feel like lovin you( feel like lovin you no more)---Lyrics submitted by Darien.
