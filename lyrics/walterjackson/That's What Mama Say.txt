It won't be long before I venture through this world all alone.
All that shine ain't gold,
People can be mighty cold.

Mama said there ain't gonna be any roses popping up to lead the way.
Watch out for that storm to come forth,
'cause the sun don't shine everyday.
That's what my mama said.
You better take heed to her oath.

Now when you get a woman.
Make sure that she's mighty nice.
Be good to the one,
and when the day is done,
love her with all your might.

Mama said there ain't gonna be any roses popping up to lead the way.
Watch out for that storm to come forth,
Cause the sun don't shine everyday.
That's what my mama said.
You better take heed to her oath.

My mama said, now,
You better be careful!
Oh son be careful!
That's what my mama said.
Take heed baby,
don't let her hurt you now.
Just listen to me child.
You better take heed.
Oh, be careful! ---
