When I think of those east end lights, muggy nights
My curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer
And I won't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
You thought you had your hooks in me, didn't cha dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, fly away, bye bye

I never realized the passing hours
evening showers
slip noose hanging, in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your society scene
Just a played-out pawn, played-out by a domestic queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it!
 listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank god my music's still alive
oooo weee

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't cha dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, fly away, bye bye

I would have walked head on into the deep end the river
Clinging to my stocks and bonds
Paying your h.p. bills forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home

Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
yea, Someone saved my life tonight

So save your strength
 and run
To the field, that you'd  played 

ahhhh someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You thought had your hooks in me, didn't cha dear
You had,  had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, fly away, bye bye

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

ohh, someone saved me

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

From an O.D.
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight---Lyrics submitted by Tremayne Primm.
