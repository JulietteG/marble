Brick by brick, the night eclipsed 
Pricked by cuticle thorns 
Dried the sleep on nursery slits Into this life Im born 
Heavens just a scab away 
Id like to see you after just one taste

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more, let them see it has begun 
The others Ive become

If you should see the dice, 
charmed with Its snaked choked eyes 
Youll wear the widows weeds 
Because theyre just your size

Behind the snail secretion, 
leaves a dry heave that absorbs 
A limbless procreation, let the infant crawled deformed 
A bag replaced the breath of these suffocating sheets 
And now when the craving calls Ill scratch my itchy teeth

Come on and sing it now 

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more 
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more

She fell for the whispers, 
sister flooded deaf tears 
That night tore a river, in her baron womb mirror 
And his multiple sons with their mandible tongues 
Set crucified fires to petrified homes
let it burn

And the owls they were watching 
And the owls didnt care 
Then the owls came a knocking, placenta in their stares 
They will feed on all the carnage, leftover from the flood 
And in the corner of their eyes, fled sister L Via

Now the pieces went floating, reflecting all at dusk 
Conceived from the stabbing, was Vismund Cygnus

Twenty five wives in the lake tonight...---Lyrics submitted by nadja.
