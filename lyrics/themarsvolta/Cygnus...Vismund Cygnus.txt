The ocean floor is hidden
From your viewing lens
A depth perception
Languished in the night
All my life,Ive been
Sowing the wounds
But the seeds sprout
A lachrymal cloud

Nino preparate
Que vas sufrir
Nino preparate
Salte veneno
Nino preparate
Salte de aqui
Nino preparate
Labios temblando
Nino preparate
Salte veneno
Nino preparate
Salte de aqui
Nino preparate
Brincan los cuerpos
Vas a sufrir

My nails peel back
When the taxidermist ruined
Goose stepped the freckling impatience
All the brittle tombs
Five hundred little qs
Im splitting hairs to
Match the faces

All night Ill hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre
Sonando
De rabia naci

Now this train dont lie
An abortion that survived
A lineage of
Bastard mastacation
All the severed proof
Talons scratch my suite
These are the feathers
That replace them

All night Ill hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre
Sonando
De rabia nac

Who do you trust
Will they feed us the womb
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb
I found the remnants
Of a crescent fang
It cleaned my wing
Down to the bone
Umbilical syllables
Left to decode
There was no cradle
I can taste it
Come on now

All night Ill hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre
Sonando
De rabia naci

Who do you trust
Will they feed us the womb
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb
Bring me this plague
She took a drink
Those nicotine stains
On his every word
My scavenger quilt
Will only hide the truth
Bring me
Bring me this plague
I count the days to find
What was left behind
Only these names I clutch
Will lead me to my home
Somehow this river marks
A wrinkle hand in mine
And everyday that parts
The water into two
Mothers and feathers start
To drown the living proof
I cant remember these lakes of blood
Wrapped in a blanket
There sweats a cut
Who do you trust
Will they feed us the womb
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb---Lyrics submitted by Demi.
