I think Ive become like one of the others
I think Ive become like one of the others 
I think Ive become like one of the others

There was a frail syrup dripping off His lap danced lapel, punctuated by her Decrepit prowl she washed down the hatching Gizzard soft as a mane of needles His orifice icicles hemorrhaged By combing her torso to a pile Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse She was a mink handjob in sarcophagus heels

Bring me to my knees 
Read the sharpened lines 
All my arms, bled me blind 
Faucet leaks in shadows 
Spilling from morgue lancet 
Caressed your fontanelle
I've sworn to kill every last one 
Every last one 
Panic in the shakes of the wounded 
Panic in the worms 
Onto the floor And out of your mouth Out of your eyelids

No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches
No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches

All your dreams, splintered off 
Leech by leech on this catafalque 
Anyone will tell you, yes anyone 
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm 
Your mother flirted with disease 
When she skinned that costume by its navel strings 
Panic in the shakes of the wounded 
Panic in the worms, onto the floor 
And out of your mouth out of your eyelids

No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
Shock lest shackles free you
Volt face cons abandon you again I wont feel not this time---Lyrics submitted by nadja.
