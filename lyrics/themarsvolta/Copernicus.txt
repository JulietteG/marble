Close the doors
If you want to see her breathing again
Blur the days
Sleeping is just not an option

How come every time I walk you crawl
When you cut out all the letters that make up this note
I won't I won'tgive up
'Til I find what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I held you with crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind

You're not there
I poke needles in the neck of a doll
She pokes back
Asking why can't I just let her out

How come every time I walk you crawl
When you cut out all the letters that make up this note
I won't give up
'Til I find you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you with crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind

[x2]
Don't let the days escape
What I did brings more of them
And we'll be waiting just for them
Over my dead body
Over the search they lead
And they wont find them anymore

Now that I collect
From cells that we once shared
With multi-headed union
Of multiple selves

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I held you with crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
Holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you with crippled bandages
Don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind---Lyrics submitted by Shiloh.
