Brick by brick, 
the night eclipsed Pricked by the cuticle thorns, dried the sleep 
On nursery slits into this life Im born 
Havens just a scab away Id like to see you after just one taste 
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more, let them see it has begun 
The others Ive become

No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, no theres no time 
You aint got nothing, your life was just a lie.---Lyrics submitted by nadja.
