How much do you make
In that death factory
Severance owed in the chamber of revolvers
Empty jails fall from my scalp
Shake the globe and let me out
If still I can remember the day
That they took you from me

Seems like I've been runnin'
From your trenchant memory
Harp sickle will warn me when it's over
'Cause if heaven breathes
Then someone trade places with me
'Cause I dont wanna tear feathers instead of rags
Instead of rags

When do I get to see the body preserved inside this grin
Sewn in the lips were her last words
Ill be damned I can still hear her laughing
Your angels have tangled their brass again
The comfort of doubt still it keeps you thin
And still I can remember the day
That they took you from me

Seems like I've been runnin'
From your trenchant memory
Harp sickle will warn me when it's over
'Cause if heaven breathes
Then someone trade places with me
'Cause I dont want to tear feathers instead of rags
Instead of rags

Does your temperature ache
Is your glass about to break
Are you purple with current
Will you now become the servant
Gordian knots in the power lines
Saucer fills to empty with pesticide
Like the pharaohs of old
Bury me in gold
I'll make your son refuse to fight
In the stalk home setting that we provide
If your heart does cease to speak
My fingernail choir will make your chalkboard sing---Lyrics submitted by Shiloh.
