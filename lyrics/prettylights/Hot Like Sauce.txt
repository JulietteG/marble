It's so hard to tell all the scrambled stuff.

Then there's the badass part with the chic. Some things i have no clue about... They're in parenthesis.

(so magical), unmatchable, spectacular, unbreakable
You shakin me, not probable
Ya'll get ridiculed for even tryin to con me
(so magical), unmatchable, spectacular, unbreakable

It's got some "gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove" from black dog (zeppelin)

Don't drop it in me league at all, don't speed you'll fall
Fake b*tch fake t*ts fake (cleave n all...Leave it all)
Whats wrong wit ya
Don't start no mess today
Gung ho just put your toast away
Have a drink on me
I got tricks to play
Twist tops, straight shots, (hand rockin?) effects
Your still no good
Still around the way
Tighter than your grandma's vagina

What are they?

Haha they *** words... This song just screams "i'm a bad mother...Shut your mouth!" and he sooo is---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
