should we even wonder why our hearts are torn
why our image is based on this broken city
should we ask ourselves why our lungs breathe in sickness
innocence is seen as weakness
laughted at us naive
and it's these things that hold you down
when they're supposed to keep you safe and sound
and it's these things you claim to believe.
don't let them be the ones you forever tried to please
it's this scene that leaves you cold
but why choose anything else and lose your place in line
may I ask one thing, how do you think this will work out
you are no more well-liked than those who have been betrayed---Lyrics submitted by gangsta.
