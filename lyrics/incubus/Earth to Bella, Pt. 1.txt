Earth to Bella,
You think you've got it all figured in,
Earth to Bella,
Everything you know is wrong. Well, almost
Earth to Bella,
I've seen when you are not listening
I bear the burden
Of being the voice that lets you know
We all grow old,
And before you swim you gotta be ok to sink.
Earth to Bella,
The world can be an unfriendly place.
SO hold your head up
And do your best to save some face.
It's not so hard...
Just undo yourself and see a
Second sun ascend.
I'm ok to sink
ok to sink
Im ok to sink
ok to sink.---Lyrics submitted by matthew.
