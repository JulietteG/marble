I'm a ne'er do well 
Runnin' off black gold 
It's high time I pulled over 
And walked around a while 

I've seen that porcelain shell 
Your exoskeleton 
And I feel like we'd walk well together 

Because in the end, we are friends and lovers. 

If asked of me I would 
Gobble them to bits 
The things that wall us off from 
Where we belong 

What's wrong with you is good 
For what's wrong with me 
And I think maybe we should stick together. 

Because in the end, we are friends and lovers 
We are friends and lovers. 

Abandon all the bones 
We've got to pick 
They'll only weigh us down and 
We're better than that 
If they all throw stones 
Start a collection 
Of everything we're not 
And wont (be)cause 

You should never have to defend 
Being friends and lovers. 
Being friends and lovers. 
Being friends and lovers.---Lyrics submitted by Emma Nem.
