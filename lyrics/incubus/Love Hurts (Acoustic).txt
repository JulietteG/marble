Verse1:
Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat 
but love is now a feat
as common as a cold day in LA

Pre-chorus:
Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder 
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing

Chorus:
Love hurts 
but sometimes it's a good hurt 
and it feels like I'm alive
Love sings 
when it trancends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
Cause without love I won't survive

Verse 2:
Oooohhhh...
I'm fettered and abused
I stand naked and accused
Should I surface
this one man submarine
I only want the truth 
So tonight we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy 

Pre-chorus:
Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder 
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing

Chorus:
Love hurts 
but sometimes it's a good hurt 
and it feels like I'm alive
Love sings 
when it trancends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
Cause without love I won't survive
(Instrumental Break)

Chorus:
Love hurts 
but sometimes it's a good hurt 
and it feels like I'm alive
Love sings 
when it trancends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
Cause without love I won't survive

Love hurts
Ohhhh...Love hurts
With out love I won't survive
Love hurts 
La da da dadeda da ohh 
Love hurts 
Without love I won't survive
