We all have a weakness
But some of ours are easy to identify
Look me in the eye and ask for forgiveness;
We'll make a pact to never speak that word again
Yes, you are my friend 

We all have something that digs at us,
At least we dig each other,
So when weakness turns my ego up
I know you'll count on me from yesterday.


If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me.
Sing this song!
Remind me that we'll always have eachother,
When everything else is gone.


We all have a sickness
That cleverly attaches and multiplies
No matter how hard we try.

We all have someone that digs at us
At least we dig each other
So when sickness turns my ego up
I know you'll act as a clever medicine.


If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering 
The better part of me.
Sing this song!
Remind me that we'll always have each other 
When everything else is gone
Oh eachother....
When everything else is gone.

If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering 
The better part of me.
Sing this song!
Remind me that we'll always have each other 
When everything else is gone
Oh eachother....
When everythingthing else is gone
Oh eachother ...
When everything else is gone.---Lyrics submitted by Leah.
