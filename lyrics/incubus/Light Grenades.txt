We're given a garden
and gave back a parking lot.

We've got about fifteen minutes to go

before this audience
starts throwing tomatoes, yeah.

It's not the end, there is more show.
We've got about fifteen minutes to go.

Survived the plague, floated the flood.
Just peeked our heads above the mud.
No one's immune, deafening bells.
My god, will we survive ourselves?

I'm not an alarmist,
but someone should break the glass

and pull that red T-lever down

to get there attention.
Start lobbing the light grenades

that burst and blind them with the truth.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Survived the plague, floated the flood.
Just peeked our heads above the mud.
No one's immune, deafening bells.
My god, will we survive ourselves?

Survived the plague, floated the flood.
Just peeked our heads above the mud.
Wipe off your face, we've come this far.
Come on, remember who you are.

Survived the plague, floated the flood.
Just peeked our heads above the mud.
No one's immune, deafening bells.
My god.

Survived the plague, floated the flood.
Just peeked our heads above the mud.
Wipe off your face, we've come this far.
Come on, remember who you are.
Come on, remember who you are.
Come on, remember who you are.

Remember, remember.
Come on, remember who you are.
Remember, remember.
Come on, remember who you are.---Lyrics submitted by Skit.
