You move in slow motion, everything goes by so fast
Just slow down a little, save the best part for last
You speak in riddles
Your intentions turn me on
I'm yours forever, will you love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone

You're an unfenced fire
Over walls we trample
Its you I admire
My living example

Your eyes are an udiscovered ocean far away
Any minute now keeping both poets and priests at bay
Dont get ahead of me, could we just this once see eye to eye?
Could you want perhaps me, ask me how it feels to vie
To vie

You're an unfenced fire
Over walls we trample
It's you I admire
My living example

It's a photograph discovered a decade after
It's a cannon blast disguised as a firecracker
Its enough to bring a brick wall to it's knees
And sing 'please!'

You move in slow motion, everything goes by so fast
Just slow down a little, save the best part for last
For last

You're an unfenced fire
Over walls we trampled
It's you I admire
My living example

It's you I admire
My living example---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
