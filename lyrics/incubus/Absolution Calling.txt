It's like an intuition
Or a feeling in the air
An intangible impression
That's always everywhere

You bit into the apple
Laid down your sword and shield
Untie!
A little bit dies
A little each time
The medicine smiles
Then spun 'round like a gyre
In the unified field
Inside your elegant guide
An arrow in flight
A million miles

I remember feeling the opposite of falling
Into that spot where we unite every knot
Spinning past the ceiling
Absolution calling...
"Are you there, or not?"

It's an open invitation
come see the sights of sages
We've been a pride of lions
So afraid to leave our cages

Don't fret over the pieces
That smolder in the sun
Untie!
A little bit dies
A little each time
The medicine smiles
'Cause nothing can be broken
When everything is one
Inside your elegant guide
An arrow in flight
A million miles---
