Girl I wanna kiss you
But not just on your lips, no
Tips of your fingers and every intersection
Start again then at your pinky toe
I know you know

Can you tell I miss you?
From my cadence and tempo
Lips are a trigger, and maybe this connection
Is a point we should be aiming for

Could we make up?
Could we make out?
Could we make up?
Could we make out?

I get high every time I get the taste of you on my tongue
And I know youre one to hold on to
Oh, a deep sigh everytime I get a hint of you in my mind
Cause I know you wont be held onto

Babe, Ive got a weakness for the backs of your knees, your
Honey spilt over, and now I am an army of ants
And were all thinkin the same thought,
Lets get to work.
Let me introduce you to my slippery fingers
Glistening and dangerous I'll use them all in ways
That would make you giggle at my funeral

Whoaah, I get high every time I get the taste of you on my tongue
And I know youre one to hold on to
Oh, a deep sigh every time I get a hint of you in my mind
Cause I know you wont be held onto

Could we make up?
Could we make out?
Could we make up?
Could we make out?

Can you tell I miss you?
From my cadence and tempo
Lips are a trigger, and maybe this connection
Is a point we should be aiming for---
