You almost had me there
It was the batting lashes that gave you away
You're bold beyond repair
And there's an absence, today

Of defiance
Our most awakened inclination
And your elegant abberation

Something's happening
All the rebels and devils have come to naught
But hear your sirening
And who would unring your bell

Defiance
Our most awakened inclination
Of Defiance
Your elegant abberation---Lyrics submitted by Emma Nem.
