I'm at the end of my ribbon again 
For those who want to apathy 
You had the perfect opportunity 
But pled the fifth and walked away, yeah, ohhh

Say something 
Make us proud 
Cast the first stone 
Say any, anything at all
Make a move 
Make a move

For every one thing we're ignorant of 
A thousand more things beat the maze, yeah 
You saw the apple hanging on the tree 
But missed the orchard in your gaze, ohhh

Say something 
Make us proud 
Cast the first stone 
Say any, anything at all
Make a move (Hands on the eyes are the engines of demise) 
Make a move

I'm cautious of who I will call a friend 
Who you acquaint is who you are 
The darkest hours are when we choose a side 
So make your pick and take the fall

Say something Say anything at all
Make a move (Hands on the eyes are the engines of demise) 
Make a move (Hands on the eyes are the engines of demise)
Make a move (Hands on the eyes are the engines of demise) 
Make a move---Lyrics submitted by Jin.
