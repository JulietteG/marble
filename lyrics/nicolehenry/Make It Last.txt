Hold me close
While we kiss
Let me linger in heaven like this
Love is often over too fast

Make it last

Let me stay in your spell
Love is sweet so let's savour it well
All too soon this dream will be past

Make it last

If love stays on
My fears will fade
and each new dawn
I'll start with my heart unafraid

Let the flame linger low
Let the fire burn longer and slow
Till this moment is lost to the past

Make it last---
