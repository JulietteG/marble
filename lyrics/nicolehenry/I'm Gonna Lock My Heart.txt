I'm gonna lock my heart
And throw away the key
Cos I'm tired of all those
tricks you played on me
I'm gonna turn my back on love
Gonna mock the moon above
Seal all my windows up with tin
So that the love bug can't get in
Gonna park my romance right along the curb
Hang a sign upon my heart
"Please don't disturb"
And if I never fall in love again
That's soon enough for me
I'm gonna lock my heart
And throw away the key

And if I never fall in love again
That's soon enough for me
I'm gonna lock my heart
And throw away the key---
