I'm looking for a sign
To show me that i'm right on
Cued to break the ball
When my back's against the wall
So I take it as it comes
I'll show off anyone
Who thinks i'll take it slow
Just watch me as I go

Yeeeeaaah

Oooh Oooh

na na nanananana

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 
Ya better believe,
I'm not going away

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 
Ya better believe,
I'm not fading away

Whoah

Hey you, 
Ya better believe

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 

Time, if time is such a scare
Then stills is who I am

But, I'd like to make it clear
Each moment that I'm here
Now learn to play the game
To win without the share

Now, so welcome to the show
Just watch me as I go

Yeeeaahh

Oooh Oooh

na na nanananana...

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 
Ya better believe,
I'm not going away

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 
Ya better believe,
I'm not fading away

Whoah

Hey you, 
Ya better believe

Hey you, 
Ya better believe

I'm shining as bright as light
I move to myself tonight
I've been really without a 
(incomprehensible)

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 
Ya better believe,
I'm not fading away

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 

Hey you, 
Ya better believe, 

Ya better believe.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
