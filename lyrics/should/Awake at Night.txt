his hands are small
they settle down
to rest upon his lap
his minds at ease
he breathes night air
theres nothing much to see

and I like watching him
fighting to stay awake at night

his eyes they close
for just a wink
his head drifts slowly south
sleep descends
in the still night air
but he wont give it peace

and I like watching him
fighting to stay awake at night

he holds his own
for quite some time
but cant avoid the end
the crickets sing
his lullaby
the wind picks up his dreams

its all that I need tonight
its all that and everything to me---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
