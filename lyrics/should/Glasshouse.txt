although it appeared like vision
stretching time; slowing down
like a fire without sound

and I think I heard silence
for the first time it hit me
that I had nothing more
that I was going home

and I sat there for hours
at the edge of a river
and I saw nothing more
is this all?  nothing more?

only on the top of the glasshouse
and the face throwing stones
hasnt ever atoned

and I sat there for hours
at the edge of a river
and I saw nothing more
and I saw nothing more

and I think I heard silence
for the first time it hit me
that I had nothing more
that I was going home

and I sat there for hours
at the edge of a river
and I saw nothing more
is this all?  nothing more?---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
