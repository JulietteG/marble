he woke just then to what? he wasnt sure
and found her feverish
and standing in the sun
it struck him all at once that he was lost
he hadnt a plan for this
or anything at all

oh, why must we move on?
cant we be left alone?
to wander in our own slumberland
as we hit all the stars
that further drift afar
we have it all; we wont dream no more 

as the day wore on he traveled more
and knocked on all the doors
that hadnt tumbled down
he stayed awake with her and told his love
that she would run free in days
but days were all they had

oh, why must we move on?
cant we be left alone?
to wander in our own slumberland
as we hit all the stars
that further drift afar
we have it all; we wont dream no more 

as his life moved on he wandered more
from that departed door
so stately on that hill
but he was always drawn to wander stars
thats where theyre dreaming
dreaming

thats where theyre dreaming
thats where theyre dreaming
dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
