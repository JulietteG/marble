I left a message for myself
it was on the stairs last night
and I passed it going out
and you passed it coming back

dont you know just to fade away?
dont you know just to fade away?

I liked the concept; I liked your hair
it propped me up; Im filled with air
but it had no permanence
like my own disfigurement

dont you know just to fade away?
dont you know just to fade away?

just to fade away
just not today---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
