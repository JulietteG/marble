Step by step heart to heart left rite left we all fall down like toy soldiers.

It wasnt my intention to mislead you it never should have been this way what can I say
Its true I did extend the invitation I never knew how long youd stay
When you hear temptation call its your heart that takes, takes the fall
Wont you come out and play with me

Step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Its getting hard to wake up in the morning, my head is spinning constantly, how could it be
How could I be so blind to this addiction if I dont stop the next one is going to be me
Only emptiness remains, it replaces all, all the pain
Wont you come out and play with me

Step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Only emptiness remains it replaces all, all the pain
Wont you come out and play with me

Step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
