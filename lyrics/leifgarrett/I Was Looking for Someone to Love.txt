I told myself when you smiled at me
This time it's gonna be forever
I didn't know you would hurt me so
But from the very start
You are the one who would break my heart

Coz I was looking for someone to love
And oh the heartaches I found
I was looking for someone to love
But you were just looking around

You led me on pretending you could care
Promising the love we'd share together
I've closed the door, can't take it anymore
Love will never be the same
Love will never be the same
You turned it around and you made it a game---Lyrics submitted by lee hanyang.
