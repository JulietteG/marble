Let's Go! 

The lights are on but there is no one home
Yeah I'm the type of guy that shouldn't be left alone
They say just one more night of observation
There's nothing like a permanent vacation

I break down like you want me to
But I will not give control to you
Sniff like a pound of glue
Forget all the things you put me through
Dial up the residue
Now I'm nuts, just like a blue cashew

I go Psycho (psycho)
Psycho (psycho)

And all I want is to go home just for a bit (hey hey hey)
But these padded rooms are the shit! 

Whoa! 
I'm happy in my mental health
Whoa! 
These conversations with myself
Whoa! 
They say that only time will tell
Whatever, I'm happy in my mental health
I'm happy in my mental health

1, 2, 123, Go! 

Hey meet a friend of mine, now where'd he go? 
He's probably sitting there but you would never know
They say just one more shock (yeeow!)
Try not to resist
They say lie down
And bite on this

[? ] shocks away
But the voices in my head are here to stay
[? ]
I get more drugs than DEA
One day they'll do a play
They take your shoelaces away

Psycho (psycho)
Psycho (psycho)

And all I want is to go home just for a bit (hey hey hey)
But these padded rooms are the shit! 

Whoa! 
I'm happy in my mental health
Whoa! 
These conversations with myself
Whoa! 
They say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health

Straight jacket
Bad habit
Cuz I live for the habit
This static
Illmatic
Double dose is just like magic
Straight jacket
Let's have it
You pump up all my panic
Welcome this is my life
A padded room up in the attic

And all I want is to go home just for a bit (hey hey hey)
But these padded rooms are the shit! 

Whoa! 
I'm happy in my mental health
Whoa! 
These conversations with myself
Whoa! 
They say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health

Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Psycho psycho
I'm happy in my mental health---Lyrics submitted by Jase.
