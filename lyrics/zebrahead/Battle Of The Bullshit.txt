You say.. 
I'm a punchline, broken down time.
I got nothing but at least I know it's all mine.
Fight like Kung-Fu as we bleed through.. 
scars on our bodies are reminders not to trust you.

It's an uphill war battle of the bullshit..
And if less is more than more or less we're never gonna quit.

(2x)
Hate us..
Brandish your loaded guns.
Burn us..
Blistering than a thousand suns.
Blame us..
Shame is fucking ton.. we've come undone, we've come undone.

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side cause..
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.

Check this shit out....
Imma refuse.. fucking recluse, hanging with my friends at the bottom of a tight noose.
Like an outcast, coming dead last, always up to something so you know you better think fast.

When it's battle cry, rebel yell our lungs out. 
If it's do or die, than do you know we're dying to break out?..

(2x)
Hate us..
Brandish your loaded guns.
Burn us..
Blistering than a thousand suns.
Blame us..
Shame is fucking ton.. we've come undone, we've come undone.

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side cause..
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.

Don't stop, that's a hell of a lie.. for real, it's even one I'd buy..
Can't deal, you got a crooked spine..that's fine cause I draw the line.
We see through your fake devotions going through the motions, bullshit notions..
Check out the hooks and the rhymes I render, we won't back down and we won't surrender.. won't surrender, we won't surrender!

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side cause..
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
