I like pleasure spiked with pain and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
Songbird sweet and sour Jane and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane 
pleasure spiked with pain, 
that motherfuckers always spiked with pain.

Looking in my own eyes (hey lord), 
I can't find the love I want, 
Someone better slap me, 
Before I start to rust, 
Before I start to decompose, 
Looking in my rear view mirror, 
Looking in my rear view mirror, 
I can make it disappear, 
I can make it disappear (have no fear),

I like pleasure spiked with pain and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
Songbird sweet and sour Jane and, 
music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
pleasure spiked with pain, 
that motherfuckers always spiked with pain,

Sitting in my kitchen (hey girl), 
I'm turning into dust again, 
My melancholy baby, 
The star of mazzy must, 
Push her voice inside of me,

I'm overcoming gravity, 
I'm overcoming gravity, 
(It's easy when you're sad to be,) 
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me

I like pleasure spiked with pain and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
Songbird sweet and sour Jane, 
and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
pleasure spiked with pain...,

Just one note could make me float, 
Could make me float away, 
One note from, 
The song she wrote, 
Could fuck me where I lay, 
Just one note, 
Could make me choke, 
One note that's, 
Not a lie, 
Just one note, 
Could cut my throat, 
One note could make 
me die.

I like pleasure spiked with pain and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
Songbird sweet and sour Jane, 
and music is my aeroplane, 
It's my aeroplane, 
That's spiked with pain.

(my aeroplane, my aeroplane, my aeroplane, my aeroplane)

...it's my aeroplane..(x8)..---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
