Woo!
Stiff club, its my nature,
Custom love is the nomenclature.
Turn down mass confusion,
Hit the road because we just keep cruisin'.
Double my fun, double my vision,
Long hard look at my last decision.
Hustle here, hustle there,
Hustle me bitch and you best beware.

It's emotional and I told you so,
But you had to know so I told you.
Soft walk to horizon,
One big crash that no one dies in.
This for the folks in Fayetteville,
It'll come true if you say it will.

[Chorus:]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around

It's emotional and I told you so,
But you had to know so I told you.
Please don't look right through me,
Hurts my heart when you do that to me.
Street lights out my window,
City May breeze gonna stroke my skin though.
Dropped a lot of words on an old brick wall,
Rob a lot of banks got a pedigree scrawl.
Put my peg into your square,
Run around like we just don't care.

[Chorus:]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah ah
Woo!

[Bridge x4:]
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna get you

[Chorus:]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah ah

[Outro:]
God I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Gonna leave it all around---
