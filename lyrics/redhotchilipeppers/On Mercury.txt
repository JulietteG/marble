I've got myself in a
Masochistic hold

Why don't you let go

Shake it off just to
redirect my flow

come on lets go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date

I've got to find my way into the
light, heavy, middle weight

We dont stop, rock around
the clock

Motor mouthing off infront
of every other road block

Come again and tell me
what you're going thru

Like a girl who only knew
her child was due

Memories of everything of
lemon trees on mercury

come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas

you always took me with a
smile when I was down

Memories of everything
that blew thru

Looking up into a reverse vertigo
what an undertow

Give it up another stubborn scorpio
come on, lets go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date

I've got to find my way into the
light, heavy, middle weight

We don't stop, rock around
the clock

Motor mouthing off infront
of every other road block

Come again and tell me
what you're going thru

Like a girl who only knew
her child was due

To moon she gave
another good review

Turn around and look at
me it's really really you

Memories of everything of
lemon trees on mercury

Come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas

You always took me with a
smile when I was down

Memories of everything
that blew thru

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date

I've got to find my way into the
light, heavy, middle weight

We don't stop, rock around
the clock

Motor mouthing off infront
of every other road block

Memories of everything of
lemon trees on mercury

Come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas

You always took me with a
smile when I was down

Memories of everthing
that blew thru

Memeries of everthing of
lemon trees on mercury

Come to me with remedies
from five or six of seven seas

You always took me with a
smile when I was down

Mermories of everything
that blew thru---Lyrics submitted by evelyn.
