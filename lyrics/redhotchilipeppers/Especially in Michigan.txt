Life is my friend
Rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
....well I could be your friend

White clouds I'm in
A mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
....well I'm in Michigan

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your love

A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan

Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in
....into Michigan


Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your love

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your love

Life is my friend
Underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
....when I'm in Michigan


Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your love

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your love, oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Abi.
