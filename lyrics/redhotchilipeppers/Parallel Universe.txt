Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first

Under water where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in the sea 
Just like me

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a 
California king
I swear it's everywhere 
It's everything

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits 
In your eye microcosm

You could die but you never dead spider web
Take a look at the stars in
Your head fields of space kid

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a 
California king
I swear it's everywhere 
It's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a 
California king
I swear it's everywhere 
It's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl

Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salted cheeks 
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a 
California king
I swear it's everywhere 
It's everything

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a 
California king
I swear it's everywhere 
It's everything---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
