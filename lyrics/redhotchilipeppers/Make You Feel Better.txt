She's the one
She's the only one 
She got ripped back light gunna make me come

 I say.... when i smile
I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide
Like a country mile

I say now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause thats what we do

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me
and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire jump up to meet

I say now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause thats what we do

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones that will make you feel better and
Someone to spare when love is the only end and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

(oh yeah)
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck

I, walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style

I say, she the one she the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done.. and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram... and

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones that will make you feel better and
Someone to spare when love is the only end and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
(ohhhhhhh yeaaahhhh yeah, yeah)

(oh yeah)
So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
For the red on rust... I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gunna hear my prayers

I say now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause thats what we do

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones that will make you feel better and
Someone to spare when love is the only end and
We are the ones that will make you feel better and (x5)
