Magpgies on fire
Making love like little
Worms out on the porch can
Leave the medicine
Oh well I'm game,
For anything at all

Scarecrows a liar
Spends the year alone
No one checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon
And now it's time to fall

All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

All in all it's just
A call of something wise beyond your room
There's a changing of a major chord---
