To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Python power straight from Monty
Celluliod loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
Shes too free Im the patient

Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream dont let me go
And purple stain-I know

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Lets get it on with alligator haters
Did what you did-did what you said
Whats the point yo whats the spread

Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream dont let me go
And purple stain-I know
And if I call you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
Its way out there but I dont care
Cause this is where- I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Its way out there
But I dont care
Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Feather light but you cant move this
Farley is and angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Lets sleep weeping willow

Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream dont let me go
And purple stain-I know
And if I call you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
Its way out there but I dont care
Cause this is where- I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Its way out there
But I dont care
Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
