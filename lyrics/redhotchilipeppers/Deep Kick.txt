I started when we were little kids free
spirits but already tormented by our own hands
given to us by our parents
we got together and wrote on desks
a slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
a slipped through whatever cracks
we can find minds altered
we didn't falter in portraving hysterical
and tragic characters
in a smog filled universe
we loved the dirty city
and the journeys away
from it we had not yet been
or seen our friends selves
chase tails round and round in
downward spiral leaving trail
of irretrievable vital life juice
behind still the brothers blood
comrades partner family
cuzz was impenetrable
and we lived inside it laughing
with no clothes and everything
experimental till death was upon us
in our face mortality
and lots of things seemed futile
then but love and music can save us
and did while the giant grey monster grew
more poisoned and spewing ugly shit around
nothing is the same so we keep moving.
Went off and off and got some hair cuts
Lookin wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a Bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
Mothersfuckers woke us up

Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathetic love and bellylaughs

Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kind and do the no no

Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathics love and belly laughs

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the Starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good

I remember 10 years ago
In Hollywood we did some good
and we did some real bad stuff
but the Butthole Surfers
always said it's better to regret
Something you did than something you didn't do
We were young and we were looking for the deep kick...
Seen `em come seen `em go---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
