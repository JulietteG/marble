All the creatures, on the beaches 
Makin' waves in the motion picture 
Won't you keep this, in between us 
Search and seizure, wake up venus 

The dollar bill will 
Return the ill pill 
Mom and Dad take your 'dont be sad' pill 
Turn the screw and twist my language 
Don't forsake me im contagious! 

Theres a reason for the twenty-first century... 
Not too sure but I know that its meant to be 
And that it's meant to be 

It's my favorite combination 
Comin' down with the favored nations 
Deep rotation, mutilation 
Learn to give and take dictation 
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh 
Like the Cain and Able 
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh 
Time to run this table 

There's a reason for the 21st Century 
Not too sure but I know that's it's meant to be 
And that it's meant to be 

Read me your scripture and 
Read me your scripture 
Read me your scripture and 
I will twist it 
Show me your wrist and I 
Show me your wrist and 
Show me your wrist and I'll 
Kiss it kiss it 
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh 
Like the Cain and Able 
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh 
It's time to run this table 

Simple Soldier, hand it over 
Stop and read what you just told her 
Strangulation , altercation 
Of all the sex and good vibrations 

There's a reason for the 21st Century 
Not to sure but I know that's it's meant to be 
And that it's meant to be yeah 

There's a reason for the 21st Century 
Not to sure but I know that's it's meant to be 
And that it's meant to be---Lyrics submitted by will.
