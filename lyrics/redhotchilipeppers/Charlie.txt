All the boys stitch in time
Get yours got mine                                  
In a minute ill be there
Sit tight get square
You could do it with hippie rowans
Like that Trombone
Anybody got a divvy tone
Thats right unknown   

When I pick up on that smell 
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman set me sum
Better pick up on your run

So much more than.     And Charlies waking me
 Into my core.               And Charlies shaking me
 Tell my story.              And Charlies making me
And Charlies making me smile.

Everybody do the twist
Get the message off these fists
Move around like a scientist
Laid down get kissed
Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy will advise
Ever ready in discuses
Sunset sunrise

When I pick up on that smell 
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman set me sum
Better get up on your run

So much more than.     And Charlies waking me
 Into my core.               And Charlies shaking me
 Tell my story.              And Charlies making me
And Charlies making me smile.

My heart your skin this love i'm in
We dont arrive with out a surprise your right im wrong be free belong
Intimate side is cumin to life 

When I pick up on that smell 
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman set me sum
Better pick up on your run
All I euer wanted to is pick it up and run with you 
Slip in to a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

So much more than.     And Charlies waking me
 Into my core.               And Charlies shaking me
 Tell my story.              And Charlies making me
And Charlies making me smile.

My heart your skin this love Im in
We dont arrive with out a surprise your right Im wrong be free belong
Intimate side is cumin to life 
My heart your skin this love Im in
We dont arrive with out a surprise your right Im wrong be free belong
Intimate side is cumin to life---Lyrics submitted by meg.
