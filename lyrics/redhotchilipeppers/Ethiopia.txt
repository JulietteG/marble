"We're rolling everybody. It starts with bass."

E I O I E I A
When you give your love away,
you get a feeling for...
E I O I E I A
Live to love another day,
even when you feel unsure.
More and more I wanna raise!
Raise my bar and raise your stay.
E I O I E I A
When I lie they're wide awake,
for my son I make

[Chorus:]
Tell my boy I love him so,
Tell him so he know.
Lost in Ethiopia,
walk out in that road.

E I O I E I A
Something good gon' come your way,
just look out your door.
E I O I E I A
Tell him what you wanna say,
no matter whatcha mad at girl.

[Chorus:]
Tell my boy I love him so,
Tell him so he know.
Lost in Ethiopia,
walk out in that road.

E I O I E I A
Steal my heart to give away,
make me wanna say.
E I O I E I A
You and I are so no same,
more and more and more each day.

[Chorus:]
Tell my boy I love him so,
Tell him so he know.
Lost in Ethiopia,
walk out in that road.---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
