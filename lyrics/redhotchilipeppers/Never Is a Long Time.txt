If I stole it all, or hesitate
The world would always never seems to wait
A comedy that could be so divine
Never is a long time
A shadow born to steal the light of day
You woke me up and said come on lets play
But now I know this never had between (?)

You are, you are the star within
The far, the far, the far away
The law that caused it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do
I thought I done it all, I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked as clear as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
But Never is a long time
Now I share this feeling in my yang
Stolen good time, always give away
A never that will always wonder what the star will say
From far, from far, from far away
The law that caused it all to stay by you, by you
By you, by you
A baby claping on your dress, will always have a place I guess, by you, by you
Im in love, and we could bless the pleasure of my childs best
Lonely books and tenderness, to rescue me from emptiness

You are, you are the star within
The far, the far, the far away
The law that caused it all to stay
You are, you are, the star within
The far, the far, the far away, it all, it all, it all to stay---
