Cabron

I see you in the park
You're always wearing
Dodger blue
mad dogging me and
anyone from my other crew

I am small but I am strong
I'll get it on with you
if you want me to
what else can I do

everyone would take a cue
from anything you do
if you want them to
what else can they do

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
this time of night's
for singing songs
about the local news

Cabron [x 4]

I'll come around and make peace
get down make a barbeque
let's keep the moon awake and do electric boogiloo

I am small but I am strong
you see I'm just like you
if you only knew
that I'm just like you

All the world around
take a cue from
anything you do
if you only knew
that they're just like you

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
this time of night's
for singing songs
about the local news

Cabron [x 8]

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
this time of night's
for singing songs
about the local news

Cabron [x 8]---Lyrics submitted by Kerry.
