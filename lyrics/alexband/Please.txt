There's no pleasure without pain
There's no love without hate
Everything you give comes right back to you
But overseeing space and time
Turning water into wine
There's a power looking down upon us
Now, but how, do I find out?
A way, to say, what I have to say

Chorus:
So please, please
Tell me what I need
I'm asking you
Please, please
Tell me what I need to believe.

We made fire from the flame
You put out our wicked games
All we wanted was to be close to you
But you're always in control
Pulling strings over our souls
Though we have free will
We're never alone
Now, well how, do I find out?
A way, to say, what I have to say

Chorus

If love is a temple
Then hope is a church
That binds everybody
Like the spine of a book
Filled with pages that cannot be turned
If we're here for a reason
Then the reason is ours to know
But you say that it's better
To not know why together
We keep living on and weather the storm

Chorus
