Is there anybody who can help me out?
I'm picking up the pieces
But they keep raining down
Is there anybody who can end this war?
We've been fighting for so long
I forgot what we're fighting for
So father can you pardon our sins?
Tell me how we lost the answer to this question

What is love?
The fire's burning in our hands 
What is love? 
Will we ever understand?
You can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
What is love?
'Cause I think we're starting to forget

Have you ever wondered what went wrong?
Though we rose from the mud
We're drowning in the flood
It goes on and on
Heaven is waiting 
Like an open door
I want to go there with you 
but is there room for more?
So mother can you save us again?
Or is it you that needs the saving from your own children?

What is love?
The fire's burning in our hands 
What is love? 
Will we ever understand?
You can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
What is love?
'Cause I think we're starting to forget

All that we're given from the beginning to the end
Tell me now
What is love?
What is love? 
Can you tell me now?

What is love?
The fire's burning in our hands 
What is love? 
Will we ever understand?
You can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
You can't get what you give 
If you don't give what you get
You can't get what you give
If you don't give what you get
What is love?
'Cause I think we're starting to forget
 All that we're given from beginning to end
So tell me now what is love
'Cause you know I think we're starting to forget---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
