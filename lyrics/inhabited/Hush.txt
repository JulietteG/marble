Hush goodnight, I'll kiss you goodbye
To every thought that's destroying my life
Hush goodbye, I'll walk in the light
Go away, don't come back, I'm saying goodbye

Where my girls at that are sick and tired
Of buyin' into all the same old lies
'Cause sooner or later it'll catch up to you
I know you wanna change, but you don't know what to do

You say

Where my girls at
Tell me where my girls at
Where my girls at 
Tell me where my girls at

I'm not gonna listen, I'm saying goodbye
I'm not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking my life
Not gonna listen, I'm saying goodbye
Not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking, you're taking my life

The mind works like stop, play, rewind
The junk we let in will effect us in time
And sooner or later no, we're not the same
The voices in our head, yeah, they're driving us insane

Where my girls at
Tell me where my girls at
Where my girls at 
Tell me where my girls at

I'm not gonna listen, I'm saying goodbye
I'm not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking my life
Not gonna listen, I'm saying goodbye
Not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking, you're taking my life

Where my girls at, let me hear ya if you don't care
Where my girls at, let me hear ya if you're out there
Where my girls at, let me hear ya if you don't care
Where my girls at, let me hear ya if you're out there
Where my girls at that are sick and tired

No we're not gonna listen, we're saying goodbye
We're not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking our lives
We're not gonna listen, we're saying goodbye
We're not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking, you're taking our

Not gonna listen, we're saying goodbye
We're not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking our lives
We're not gonna listen, we're saying goodbye
We're not gonna listen, 'cause you're taking, you're taking our lives

(Where where where my girls at, let me hear ya if you don't care
Where my girls at, let me hear ya if you're out there
Where my girls at, let me hear ya if you're out there there there)---Lyrics submitted by Katy Burks.
