I say I'll rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Don't cloud my vision
I'm telling you not today
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
'Cause I'm seeing straight
Made my decision
Made it through the shades of grey
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Made it my own way
Oh Oh Oh Oh
I materialize the feeling
To carry on, to carry on
I know some will say I'm dreaming
But I carry on, I carry on

They say no way, oh, I say I'll rule the world
Ain't afraid of the walls, I'm a break 'em down
They stay the same, oh, I'm feelin' high as a bird
Ain't afraid of the ground, I'm a stay up
I say yeah yeah yeah, they say no no no
They say slow slow slow, I say go go go
They say no way, oh, I say I'll rule the world
I say I rule the world

I chased illusion
Then I watched it fade to black
Throwing me off track
Found revolution
Found it in a simple fact
I ain't coming back

I materialize the feeling
To carry on, to carry on
I know some will say I'm dreaming
But I carry on, I carry on

They say no way, oh, I say I'll rule the world
Ain't afraid of the walls, I'm a break 'em down
They stay the same, oh, I'm feelin' high as a bird
Ain't afraid of the ground, I'm a stay up
I say yeah yeah yeah, they say no no no
They say slow slow slow, I say go go go
They say no way, oh, I say I'll rule the world
I say I'll rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
I say I rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oooh
Oh Oooh

They say no way, oh, I say I'll rule the world
Ain't afraid of the walls, I'm a break 'em down
They stay the same, oh, I'm feelin' high as a bird
Ain't afraid of the ground, I'm a stay up

I say yeah yeah yeah, they say no no no
They say slow slow slow, I say go go go
They say no way, oh, I say I'll rule the world
I say I rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
I say I rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
I say I rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
I say I rule the world
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oooh
Oh Oh Oh Oh---
