Hits you once or twice, catches me again
Every time I see your face inside this little sin
Hits you once or twice, catches me again
Every time I see your face inside this little sin

Oooh...  see your face inside this little sin
Oooh...  
Its a long, long way from home
Its a long, long way from

I saw you once, I saw you twice, I saw you three times a day
But I cant take it, cant take you being away
I saw you once, I saw you twice, I saw you three times a day
But I cant take it, cant take you being away from me

Oooh... cant take you being away
Oooh...
Its a long, long way from home
Its a long, long way from home
Its a long, long way from home
Its a long, long way from home

Oooh... I saw you three times today
Cant stand you being away
I saw you three times today
Cant stand you being away
Cant stand you being away

Its a long
Its a long
Its a long, long way from
Its a long, long way from
you---Lyrics submitted by Zoey Fironi.
