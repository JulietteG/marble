Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
That gun is loaded. 

I know that I messed up a few times or what you want to call it. 
I know if I fell down you'd change the way that I saw it. 
I'd put it on the line for this time only. 

Is that what you really want? 

I can't see that I got red hands I'm colour blind sing Day-oh. 
Don't put the blame on my child the damn thing gone wild all Day-oh. 
Never wanted to be foolin' you, Can't believe I was ruining you. 

Is that what you really want? 

Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
That gun is loaded. 
That gun is loaded but it's not in my hand. 
That gun is loaded but it's not in my hand. 
The fire burns I'm not the one with the match man! 
That gun is loaded but it's not in my hand. 

Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
That gun is loaded. 

I've seen it all before you back out and everything's changing. 
I needed something more you stepped down so what are you chasing. 
I'd put it on rewind for this time only. 

Is that what you really want? 

I realize that I got red hands don't want to change this Day-oh. 
Don't ask me why I choose to lie I stay blind all Day-oh. 
It's clear to me that you are fuming too. 
Your accusations are burning through. 

Is that what you really want? 

Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
That gun is loaded. 
That gun is loaded but it's not in my hand. 
That gun is loaded but it's not in my hand. 
The fire burns I'm not the one with the match man! 
That gun is loaded but it's not in my hand. 

Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
That gun is loaded. 

Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
That gun is loaded.---Lyrics submitted by Joe Minaglia.
