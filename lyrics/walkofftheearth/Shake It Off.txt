I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "it's gonna be alright"

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
That's what they don't see

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm-mm
That's what they don't know

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "it's gonna be alright"

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off
Oh, oh, oh, I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, oh, oh, I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, oh, oh, I shake it off, shake it off

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off
Oh, oh, oh, I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, oh, oh, I shake it off, shake it off
Oh, oh, oh, I shake it off, shake it off---
