little boxes on the hillside
little boxes made of ticky tacky
little boxes on the hillside
little boxes all the same

theres a pink one and a green one
and a blue one and a yellow one
and theyre all made out of ticky tacky
and they all look just the same

and the people in the houses
all went to the university
where they were put in boxes
and they came out all the same

and theres doctors and lawyers
and business executives
and theyre all made out of ticky tacky
and they all look just the same

and they all play on the golf course
and drink their martinis dry
and they all have pretty children
and the children go to school

and the children go to summer camp
and then to the university
where they are put in boxes
and they come out all the same

and the boys go into business
and marry and raise a family
in boxes made of ticky tacky
and they all look just the same

theres a pink one and a green one
and a blue one and a yellow one
and theyre all made out of ticky tacky
and they all look just the same---Lyrics submitted by federici family.
