Change your life when she looks your way.

Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
Change yo life when she looks your way.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
Just like the tide she can drag you away.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
She change your life when she looks yo way.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
'Cause when she hits you, ya feeling okay.

Tell you once but never again!

Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
Change yo life when she looks your way.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
Just like the tide she can drag you away-ay-ay.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
She change your life when she looks yo way.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
'Cause when she hits you, ya feeling okay.

Hurry Up!

Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
Change yo life when she looks your way.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
Just like the tide she can drag you away.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
She change your life when she looks yo way.
Everybody wants her, everybody needs her
'Cause when she hits you, ya feeling okay.
'Cause when she hits you, ya feeling okay.
When she hits you, you feeling okay.---Lyrics submitted by Carson.
