I cant hear a single word
Just know youre talking cause your lips keep moving
Every thing I thought Id learned
Goes out the window
All I want is one thing

You can promise castle, treasures, babies
I don't care
Cause right now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn down the lights down low and kiss me under the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
[whistles]
You
[whistles]
You, you make my heart go
[whistles]
You
[whistles]
You, you make my heart go

Ticking tocking like a bomb
Throws me back when I had you closer
Skin to skin we get it on
Without the love I feel you going bolder

You can promise castle, treasures, babies
I don't care
Cause right now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn down the lights down low and kiss me under the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
[whistles]
You
[whistles]
You, you make my heart go
[whistles]
You
[whistles]
You, you make my heart go

Take it all off
Want every inch of you
Traveling back in time
Tangled the tight
Just like we used to
Now do the thing I like

Turn down the lights down low and kiss me under the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
[whistles]
You
[whistles]
You, you make my heart go
[whistles]
You
[whistles]
You, you make my heart go ---
