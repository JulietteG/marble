Nobody believes me when I tell them that you're out of your mind
Nobody believes me when I tell them that there's so much you hide
You treat me like a queen when we go out,
wanna show everyone what our love's about
All wrapped up in me whenever there is a crowd
But when no ones around

(Chorus)
There's no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell whats going on this time
Theres a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let them know it's you
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

Did I ever do anything that was this cruel to you
Did I ever make you wonder who was standing in the room
You made yourself look perfect in everyway
So when this goes down, I'm the one that will be blamed
Your plan is working so you can just walk away
Baby your secret's safe

Theres no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell whats going on this time
Theres a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let 'em know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

Such a long way back, from this place we are at
When I think of all the time I've wasted, I could cry
Theres no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell whats going on this time

Theres a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let 'em know it's you
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

Theres no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell what's going on this time
There's a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let 'em know it's you
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too---Lyrics submitted by Aayushi.
