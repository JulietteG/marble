Mmm yeah you burn me again
Well I don't wanna know where you been
Mmm I, I was a new best friend
Do you know I'll treat you like them?

And I know oh, oh, I

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
On my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
To remind me

Ooh
A tattoo to remind me

Apologies for the way I've been
And I couldn't wash you off my skin, no I
I could live without you

Mmm, tears and my eyes can dry
But I won't
I'm burning like the wire in my bones
You could be in the way you blame me

And I know oh, oh, I

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
On my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
To remind me

Ooh
A tattoo to remind me

See these scars leaving blood on my big o white dress
Beating hearts, screaming loud and louder

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
On my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
To remind me

Ooh
A tattoo to remind me

Under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess that you have to leave a tattoo
To remind me---
