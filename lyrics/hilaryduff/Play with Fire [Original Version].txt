I can't believe it's really you
Been so long, you look good
I hear your doing really well
Don't ask me, let me tell you
How I've been since when you left
Since let me forget
Finally every tear has dried, I've whiped you from my life

Do you remember all the times you said you call me
Cause I remember all the reasons people warned me
And now I'm hearing that you still adore me
Well if you think I'd ever get with you again 
Then you can just

Chorus
Love me, Love me
Feed the flame
If you want me back again
Burn through the sky
Higher and Higher
Baby can you play with fire

You never know just what you got till I'ts gone, you freak out
That I'm not falling for that game, Boys like you Never change
You made me feel I wasn't enough, wasn't enough for your love
But it was insecurity that made you run
It wasn't me
So don't you sit there trying to give me more excuses
I don't have time for this, I'm off to play in Houston
And I'm too busy with the million things I'm doing
You can't make up for what you've done
But you still try to be the one

(Chorus)

Oh by the way, by the way I found someone who gives me space,
Keeps me safe
makes me sane
Found someone to take your place
Now I'm safe, In his arms
And I've decided that only he can play with fire
