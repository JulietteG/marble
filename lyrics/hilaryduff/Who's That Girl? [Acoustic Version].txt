There were places we would go at midnight
	there were secrets that nobody else would know

	There's a reason but I don't know why
	I don't know why	
	I don't know why
	I thought they all belonged to me

        (chorus)

	who's that girl? 
	where's she from?
	No she can't be the one
	That you want
	That has stolen my world
	It's not real, it's not right
	It's my day, it's my night 
	By the way
	Who's that girl living my life?

	Oh no, living my life


	Seems like everything's the same around me
	Then i look again and everything has changed
	I'm not dreaming so i don't no why
	I don't know why
	I don't know why
	She's everywhere i wanna be

        (chorus)


	I'm the one who made you laugh
	who made you feel
	who made you sad
	I'm not sorry
	for what we did
	for who we were
	I'm not sorry
	I'm not her...
