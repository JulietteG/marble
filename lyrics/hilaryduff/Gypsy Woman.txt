Man: The battle of France is over 
Hilary: Congratulations, you've joined the ranks of all the rest 

Was it her face that invaded your mind? 
Her kind isn't that hard to find 
She lets you think that you found her first 
That's how she works, her sick and twisted gypsy curse 
(Bridge) 
She can swallow knives 
She can swallow lives 
Gold and black stare, 
Brought the night of your demise 

(CHORUS) 
Try to run away with the gypsy woman 
Here today then gone for good 
Can't get away with the gypsy woman 
Thought no one would know your secrets down below [but ya] 
Can't go 
Can't go with her 
Can't go 
Can't go with her 
Can't go 
Can't go with her 
Can't go 
The gypsy woman 

This is her favorite game to play 
She's got you stumblin', stumble, st-st-stumblin' 
Talks with a grin cause she's got no shame 
Enjoys the fame, bringing down the family name 

(BRIDGE) 
She can swallow knives 
She can swallow lives 
Gold and black stare, 
Brought the night of your demise 

(CHORUS) 
Try to run away with the gypsy woman 
Here today then gone for good 
Can't get away with the gypsy woman 
Thought no one would know your secrets down below [but ya] 
Can't go 
Can't go with her 
Can't go 
Can't go with her 
Can't go 
Can't go with her 
Can't go 
The gypsy woman 

She can rob you blind with just one look from those eyes 
Out of all the thieves that trained her 
None of them could tame her 

(CHORUS) 
Tried to run away with the gypsy woman 
Here today then gone for good 
Can't get away with the gypsy woman 
Thought no one would know, your secrets down below 
Can't go, can't go with her 
Can't go, can't go with her 
Can't go, can't go with her 
Can't go, (with) the gypsy woman 

Can't go, can't go with her 
Can't go, can't go with her 
Can't go, can't go with her 
Can't go, the gypsy woman 

Tell me was it worth it? Can You Say It's Worth it? Tell Me Was It Worth? Can You Tell Me It Was Worth it?
