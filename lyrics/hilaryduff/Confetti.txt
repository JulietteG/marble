This conversation hasn't happened
But you need to hear me now
Call it a warning sign or a caption
But there's walls that won't back down

I'm wide awake
And I swore I wouldn't dream
When I hear you say
That you won't let go of me

I'm slipping under
Soon as I'd thought never again
Oh no, no, no, no

If I fall
You better catch me
You're turning me
Into confetti
I can't sleep
My head is heavy
You're turning me
Into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for daylight
You freak out
You side-affect me
You're turning me
Into confetti

You gotta away of here
And maybe there's a chance you can't resist
So you set your sails to my winds, waiting
Till the water starts to shake

I'm wide awake
And I swore I wouldn't dream
When I hear you say
That you won't let go of me

I'm slipping under
Soon as I'd thought never again
Oh no, no, no, no

If I fall
You better catch me
You're turning me
Into confetti
I can't sleep
My head is heavy
You're turning me
Into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for daylight
You freak out
You side-affect me
You're turning me
Into confetti

You happened and I tripped headfirst
And your heaven is a place on Earth
You happened and I tripped headfirst
And your heaven is a place on Earth

If I fall
You better catch me
You're turning me
Into confetti
I can't sleep
My head is heavy
You're turning me
Into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for daylight
You freak out
You side-affect me
You're turning me
Into confetti

You happened and I tripped headfirst
And your heaven is a place on Earth
You happened and I tripped headfirst
And your heaven is a place on Earth---
