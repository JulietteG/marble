Real life, broken glass
Left them by the sea
Holding onto things
We don't really need
Our edges used to
Fit together perfectly
Why does something good
Always start to bleed?

Hurting, hearts go wild
Bruised girl, broken down
Praised you, many times
One big lie
Passion, washed away
Fake it, fake today
Please give up
And just say goodbye

Stay in love
Give me a reason
Holding on just for the weekend
Crave the world
We're barely breathing, oh
Stay in love
Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every single day pretend it's true
And you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Holding on just for the weekend

All is said and done
All the fights are fun
Trap each other
And waiting to get caught
Two birds sitting
And the air is all we got
Baby I love you
But we need to break up

Hurting, hearts go wild
Bruised girl, broken down
Praised you, many times
One big lie
Passion, washed away
Fake it, fake today
Please give up
And just say goodbye

Stay in love
Give me a reason
Holding on just for the weekend
Crave the world
We're barely breathing, oh
Stay in love
Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every single day pretend it's true
And you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Holding on just for the weekend

Oh, we'd be different from the rest
I guess just like everybody, everybody else
Oh, we'd be different from the rest
I guess just like everybody, everybody else
Like everybody else, no

Stay in love
Give me a reason
Holding on just for the weekend
Crave the world
We're barely breathing, oh
Stay in love
Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every single day pretend it's true
And you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Holding on just for the weekend

Holding on just for the weekend
Holding on just for the weekend---
