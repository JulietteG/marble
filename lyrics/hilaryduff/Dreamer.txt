im at the grocery store and there you are just watching me pick up my clothes from
thecleaners and look who i see i try to lose you in my car comeon buddy dont you think
you've over stayed your stay dont you have much better things to do with your life
then hang around and stare at me and complicate mine you eyes must burn so bad
cause you haven't blinked you and me will never be if  thats what what you think oh your 
such a dreamer but i'm not a believer in all the things that you dream stop watching
me stop watching me i go to bed and i wake up isn't that interesting i brush my
teeth and feed my dogs isn't that thrilling , don't you think that that's thrilling don't 
you think it must be fun to follow me prtending we're a thing this is so messed up
cant you see that you're just scaring me oh your such a dreamer but im not a believer in all the things that you dream stop watching me stop watching me stop watching me---Lyrics submitted by chantal.
