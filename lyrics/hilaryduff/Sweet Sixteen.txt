Today I'm gonna ride away and feel the sun throughout my hair 
Finally free to be who I want to be who that is I don't really care 
'Cuz I've got friends who love me, blue skies are above me 
My blonde hair is everywhere 

Sweet sixteen 
Gonna spread my wings 
Sweet sixteen 
It's my chance to shine 
Sweet sixteen 
Discovering 
Sweet sixteen 
So much more to life 
Sweet sixteen 

Drivin' down to the club where we go to dance 
Radio's blastin' and the top is down 
There ain't nothing in my way except the traffic of L.A. 
And I've got friends who love me bright stars shine above me 
My blonde hair is everywhere 

Sweet sixteen 
Gonna spread my wings 
Sweet sixteen 
It's my chance to shine 
Sweet sixteen 
Discovering 
Sweet sixteen 
So much more to life 
Sweet sixteen 

My Mama loves me and a sister who shows me 
And Daddy's always there, yeah yeah yeah 

Sweet sixteen 
Gonna spread my wings 
Sweet sixteen 
It's my chance to shine 
Sweet sixteen 
Discovering 
Sweet sixteen 
So much more to life 
Sweet sixteen 

I want to know what it feels like 
I need to see it from the inside 
I can taste a bit of what I will find
So much more to life 
Sweet sixteen 

I want to know what it feels like 
I need to see it from the inside
I can taste a bit of what I will find 
So much more to life 
Sweet sixteen---Lyrics submitted by Aayushi.
