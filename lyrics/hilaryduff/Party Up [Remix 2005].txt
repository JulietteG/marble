You are driving me out of my mind
Cause you take me everywhere
But out at night
What more do you need
For me to get with you?

I didnt see this coming
Why dont you start me up?
Theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
This could be the start of something
Why dont you party-up
Time for you to come on down

I dream about it in my sleep
You seem to like me better when i creep
This time i wont loose

I didnt see this coming
Why dont you start me up?
Theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
This could be the start of something
Why dont you party-up
Time for you to come on down

You roll me,
You use me,
You love me then
You wrap me up
And reel me and use me again
You love me
You hate me
You say its the end
I know your gonna do it again and again
Hey!!!

I didnt see this coming
Why dont you start me up
Theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
This could be the start of something
Why dont you party-up
Time for you to come on down

Come on a light me up

I didnt see this coming
Why dont you start me up
Theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
This could be the start of something
Why dont you party up
Time for you to come on down

Come on and party up---Lyrics submitted by Miranda.
