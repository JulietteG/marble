Lately, you've been actin' so shady
All you say is I'm crazy
When you know you knew
Save me from these walls as they cave in
All of our magic is fadin'
Cause when you know you knew

We're falling apart, we're falling apart
Like a house of cards
And I know in my heart, I know in my heart
That this has gone too far

I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lies
I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lies
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Can't you see that? Can't you see that?
I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-la-la-lies

Tell me why you think you can play me
Twist your lies and stare blankly
Don't you know I knew?
And, baby, all my time that you've wasted
I'll find a way to reclaim it
I think I see the sun

We're falling apart, we're falling apart
Like a house of cards
And I know in my heart, I know in my heart
That this has gone too far

I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lies
I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lies
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Can't you see that? Can't you see that?
I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-la-la-lies

Why do we hold on to broken things?
When this has gone too far

I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lies
I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lies
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Can't you see that? Can't you see that?
I'm done with your lies
La-la-la-la-lie, la-la-la-la-la-la-lies

(La-la-la-la-la-la-lies)---
