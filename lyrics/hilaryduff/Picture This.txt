Half-dressed, sunrise
Late night, your eyes
Heartbeat, your bed
Sound out what we said

Drink after drink, watch you lean into me
I stare at the floor, bring our eyes up to me
It's all I don't know, your words make me weak
I'm new from the start, you've taken me

It's not how I pictured this
It's better than it
But we regret the things we said
Picture it getting better than this
Let it live inside our head
Let our hearts cross the line, it's time
I pictured this, it's better than it
Let's leave it where we'll both be missed

Cold cheeks, warm touch
The taste of your tongue
Low lights, your hands
Night time, our time

Kiss after kiss as we lay in the sheets
If heaven is real, then how does it dream?
It's all I don't know, your words make me weak
I'm new from the start, you've taken me

It's not how I pictured this
It's better than it
But we regret the things we said
Picture it getting better than this
Let it live inside our head
Let our hearts cross the line, it's time
I pictured this, it's better than it
Let's leave it where we'll both be missed

(Woo!)
Blurry eyed and tongue tied
Tripping over landmines
Gettin' lost in your mind
Tripping over landlines
Hands creep down my waist
Little slower, now
Hands creep down my waist
Let me show you how

It's not how I pictured this
It's better than it
But we regret the things we said
Picture it getting better than this
Let it live inside our head
Let our hearts cross the line, it's time
I pictured this, it's better than it
Let's leave it where we'll both be missed---
