Gotta find your inner strength
If you can't then just throw life away
Gotta learn to rely on you
Beauty, strenght, and wisdom, too

You're beautiful inside and out
Lead a great life without a doubt
Don't need a man to make things fair
'Cuz more than likely he won't be there

Listen girl, gotta know it's true
In the end all you've got is you---Lyrics submitted by Helena.
