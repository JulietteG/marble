Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play alone
Round and round we go but we never know
When we should get off

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now come to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And know I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but I still got one thing left
I've got a brave heart
I've got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I guess the safer play would've been to stay
Just make your world
But the other side is calling me tonight
Even though it hurts

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now come to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And know I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but I still got one thing left
I've got a brave heart
I've got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I don't know, know, where we're going
I can't breathe, breathe, all fading starts
I don't know, know, where I'm heading
Just know, know, you're stealing my heart
I wouldn't change a single page of my history
I'm gonna keep all the letters you wrote to me

Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play alone
Round and round we go but we never know
When we should get off

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but I still got one thing left
I've got a brave heart
I've got a brave heart
I got a brave heart---
