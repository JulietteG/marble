My heart is so proud.
My mind is so unfocused.
I see the things you do through me as great thing  i have done.

And how You gently break me,
then lovingly you take me and hold me as my father and mold me as my maker.

"How many times will you pick me up,
when I keep on letting you down?
And each time I will fall short of your glory, 
how far will forgiveness abound?"

And You answer
"My child I love you.
And as long as you're seeking My face,
You'll walk in the pow'r of My daily sufficient grace."

And feel a bit discouraged,
Knowing that someone,
somewhere could do a better job.

For  who am I to serve You?
I know I don't deserve You.
And that's the part that burns in my heart and keeps me hanging on.

"How many times will you pick me up,
When I keep on letting you down?
And each time I will fall short of Your glory,
How far will forgiveness abound?"

And You answer
"My child I love you.
And as long as you're seeking My face,
You'll walk in the pow'r of My daily sufficient grace."

You are so patient with me, Lord.

I'm learning what Your grace realy means.
The price that I could never pay
was paid at calvary.

So, instead of trying to repay You,
I'm learning to simply obey You
By giving up my life to You.

"How many times will you pick me up,
When I keep on letting You down? 
And each time I will far short of Your glory,
How far will forgiveness abound?"

And you answer
"My child, I love you.
And as long as you're seeking my face,
You'll walk in the pow'r of My daily sufficient grace."---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
