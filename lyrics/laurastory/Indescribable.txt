From the highest of heights
to the dephs of the sea
creations revealing it's majesty
from the colors of fall
to the fregrence of spring
every creature unique in the song that it sings

All exclaming
indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky in the sky and you know them by name
You are amazing God
All powerful
untainable
awstruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God

Who told every lightning bolt where it should go
or seen hevenly storehouses laden with snow
who imagined the sun and give source to it's light
Yet conseals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom

(chorus)
(chorus)

(chorus)

incomparable
unchangeable You see the dephs of heart and you know me the same
You are amazing God (x3)---Lyrics submitted by laura.
