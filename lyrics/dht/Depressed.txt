I wander through the world, no meaning in my life
My mind... is driving me insane
The hurt I've kept all years
So much want it to end
Don't want to live with this pain

I cannot follow through, as the down exceeds the joy
Provide... my mind with a cure
As I need to get my high
The juice to help me fly
Is the cause of my sorrow and my pain

Oh God, please let me go
Let me leave the misery
I'm so tired in my head
Can't keep on living like this
Cuz I have no life you see
I shall end my own misery
