Break out the cymbals and tambourines,
Call up the trumpets and horns;
Raise up a banner and come with me,
It's time to worship the Lord
Praise Him together in unity,
We've got a reason to sing;
Lift up a heavenly harmony,
It's time to worship the King


CHORUS:
With one voice every tribe will praise Him,
With one voice every tongue will tell
That the Lord is good; His love endures
And His mercy lasts forever
With one voice come and worship,
Lift your voice  we will worship
With one voice come and worship with one voice---Lyrics submitted by Marie.
