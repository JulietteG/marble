I may never know
The heartache that you feel
Sometimes cold winds blow
Life's pain becomes real
The silent tears you cry
Can never go unheard
No no no
For God is standing by
Before you say a word

Who's there, God's there
Always right by your side
Who's there, God's there
Always standing close by

Your life may seem hard
When everything goes wrong
See fear can grip your soul
And your doubts can be so strong
So strong so strong
Remember Jesus knows
The heartache that you feel
And He wants to hold hold you
Hold you until you heal

Chorus

He's right there with you
Standing next to you
He's right there by your side
So don't be afraid
Because He won't go away
God's right there
Standing by---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
