I've come to say how much I love you
I've come to say how much I adore you
Lord I'm not here to complain
About my many problems
By Your Spirit and Your Grace
I'm confident you'll solve them

CHORUS:
I'm here, to say
I love you
'm here to say
I adore you
I'm here to say
I love you,
I love to love you Lord

I....'ve come to say
how much I need you
the longing of my heart
is to please you,
let your all consuming fire
cleanse me in your presence
Lord my goal and my desire
is to serve and give you reverence

CHORUS:
I'm here, to say
I love you
'm here to say
I adore you
I'm here to say
I love you,
I love to love you Lord(2x)

I love to love you Lord
I love to love you Lord
I love to love you Lord
I love you---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
