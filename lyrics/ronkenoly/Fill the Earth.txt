(Chorus)
Fill the earth with music
Fill the earth with joy
Fill the earth with singing
For the honour and the glory of the Lord (x2)

My brothers, get ready
Stand and lift your voice
Sing for the honour and the glory of the Lord
My sisters, get ready
To sing and clap your hands
For the honour of the Lord, let celebrate his day
Every boy and every girl
All the nations of the world
It's time to take your families and sing

Lion Of Judah, Seat Of Abraham
Captain of the host, the King of Kings, the Great I am
Lily Of The Valley, the Bright and Morning Star
Sweet of the sharing love of God forevermore
Surely as he lives
All the earth shall be filled 
Filled with the glory of the Lord

Fill the earth with music
Fill the earth with joy
Fill the earth with singing
For the honour and the glory of the Lord (x2)

Psalms 150 verse 6
Says "Let everything that has breath praise the Lord."
So let's fill the earth with music
Let's fill the earth with joy
Let's fill the earth with singing
Let's fill the earth

(Chorus)

Fill the earth(x8)

Fill the earth with music!---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
