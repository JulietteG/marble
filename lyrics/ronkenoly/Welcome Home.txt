The Road was straight and narrow,  
Leading to my father's house, 
The gate were open wide awaiting my return 
Near them stood my father with his arms stretched out to me  
With tears on his face I heard him say 

Welcome Home, I've missed you so much 
My heart has been broken since the day you went away, 
Welcome home I'll prepare a celebration, 
Come take your place beside me  
You've been gone so long  
Welcome home 

His hand was on my shoulder; 
As we walked up to the house 
And mom peeped out the front door; 
And then came running out 
She threw her arms around me and  
squeezed me like only mama can 
And then kissed me on my cheek with my face held in her hands

She said welcome home 
How I've longed for this moment  
I've prayed for you each night, 
Since the day you went away 
Welcome home 
I'll prepare a place for you 
My prayers have been answered 
Thank you Jesus, oh thank you Jesus 
Welcome Home 

Oh how good it felt to be in my father's house 
After all the pain and heartache I had put him through 
And to know that I'm forgiven  
And my past has been forgotten  
And to hear my family say we still love you 
O welcome home,  
Oh how sweet the sound those simple words we love you 
Still Echo in my heart 
Welcome Home 
No more will I take this place for granted 
It's so good to be loved and wanted  
After you've done wrong and still be  
Welcomed home, welcome home.---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
