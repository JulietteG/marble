CHORUS:
It is good, it is good, it is good, to give thanks to the Lord on high
To sing of Your faithfulness and loving kindness both day and night
To play on our instruments sweet songs of praise for the things You do
It is good, it is good, it is good, to give thanks to You

VERSE 1:
For though the wicked spring up like the grass and are everywhere
Soon they will perish
But all those planted in Your house will grow without end
Sing it again!

VERSE 2:
For though we struggle and trials and troubles still come our way
You won't forsake us
Your Word has told us Your promises will never end
Sing it again!

BRIDGE:
Why give Him praise (Because He is worthy)
Why should we sing (He loves you and me)
Why give Him thanks (Because He forgave us)
Why celebrate (Because we are free)
And when should we thank Him (Both morning and evening)
In what circumstance (The good and the bad)
Is it always easy (Oh it's not so easy)
But is it good
Yes it's good, it is good, it is good!

ENDING:
It is good, it is good, it is good, to give thanks to You
It is good, it is good, it is good, to give thanks to You---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
