It is such fun to see
Such fun to see
Satan lose

It is such fun to see
Such fun to see
Satan lose

Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon
The winna mon
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time

I am on the winning side!

I am on the winning side
The winning side
The winning side
I am on the winning side
The winning side all the time

In Matthew chapter two
Satan lose
When Jesus was born in a manger
And in the wilderness
Satan lose again
At the Mount of Transfiguration
Yeah!

At the crucifixion
Satan lose again
When Jesus rose triumphantly
From the grave

And at the ascension
Satan lose
Once more
When I was born again
Yeah!

Winna mon(x7)
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time


He the Winna
The Winna
The Winna
The Winna
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time

He's the Winna
The Winna
The Winna
Winna mon
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time

It is such fun to see
Such fun to see
Satan lose

It is such fun to see
Such fun to see
Satan lose---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
