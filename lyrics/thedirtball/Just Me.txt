It's just me
The only one that get my dirt done
And make my legs run underneath the hot sun
 Just me
I'm motivating, dedicating
Stay hopping trouble
Bubble popping who be all the time dropping
Just me
A piggy bank breaker
A narc fund faker
An autumn leaf ranker
All along: it's just me
A green thumb grower
That can own a snow blower 
For the winter storm 
Warning on the watch 
Just me 
A man with the fam and a plan 
Driving across the land 
With the cash in my hand 
Just me 
Quite on the prowl 
For act like an owl 
I can see you barking loud 
Keep it down  
Trust me 
 It never pays in the ways of a hard bridge burner 
With an attitude 
All I do is 
Be me 
And keep it on the real 
Coming with my own feel 
Fight for your right 
Man it ain't just me 
Im speaking for so many who be working for the penny on the dollar 
Hear me holler 
No baller 
Just me 
Im only bust generous weather be a plus 
When Im coming through your town 
What a sound 
Just me 
Another track spider Im a wet woods splitter with a chainsaw  
Reppin' the end up 
Just me 
A mountain peak rebel 
Living at another level 
With the large lung capacity  
Just me 
A poly sic major 
Packing heat 
On my street 
In the middle of the desert
 That is where you will find me 
Setting boobie traps at my compound 
Getting rubbed down by my fine girl 
Her and just me 
Cruzan' with my dog 
In the front seat banngin' beats 
On the river banks 
It be just me 
The only one who understand everything that be running through my head when Im dead 
It be just me 
A Raptillion who can run a marathon under the influence 
Yo
 Thats me 
A Subnoize solider 
I already told you
 Im going to hold it down 
And it aint just me 
We commin' super strong 
With underground army 
But for now I gotta put it down
 For me 
Im like a bull tribe 
With a mouth full of teeth 
Im going to strike if you trippin' on me 
Just me 
Stressed to the max 
With the packs and the clicks that I hang with 
And all I can be is 
Just me 
A fun loving criminal my gangster is subliminal 
Never let it slip or get away from me 
Flip 180 
Then maybe you can see 
Underneath it all 
Lights, camera, shining 
On me---Lyrics submitted by damage.control.
