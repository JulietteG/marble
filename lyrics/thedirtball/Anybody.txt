INTRO
I feel the party party
in my body body
My heart pounding pounding 
from the pills in my system
(x2)

[Chorus]
Anybody wanna get down?
Anybody wanna take a ride down town?
Anybody wanna party with the party man
on the party plan, eat a platter full of pills
and Die!
(x2)

Who want that me? 
Me don't want
but I know a lotta people that are on the hunt
They be caught up on the feeling 
caught up on the run
Caught up in a land of pharmaceutical fun

Yeah,
one pill three pill five pill nine!
Feeling on top and I'm doing just fine
But i ate a lot of pills on the  Fourth of July
My buddy "Gabe" was involved and between you and I

He'd been off on a hot one, 20 pills deep
Lotta heavy drinking before he went to sleep
He seemed okay he was always a mess
But he never woke up now he's laid to rest

But he partied with the best of them
Partied with the whole clan and the rest of them,
Laying sticks in the ground
Party people watch out
Get down to the sound that's what it's about
Come on, uh

Chorus (anybody wanna get down.)

Take a little trip with me
Take a ride down town while I bang the beat
Talk about another friend called Vicodin
who had a friend named "Steve" 
he was a thief

yeah, yeah

Skilled in the arts of stealing the heat
Worked on a tarmac in a medical fleet
Ran the dirty biz of yanking the pills,
taking them home
and selling them off 
and stuffing his gills

Pilled out almost every single weekend
Towards the end all the energy leaking
We loved to party with Steve,
but then he died

So I wrote this song instead of a cry, 

Follow!

(Chorus)

(Intro)

To the people the people the party people that rock
Get fucked up but remember the talk
that we had about a minute ago,
Knock knock,
who's there on the countdown? you on the clock.
Only eat 2 pills not 75

Let's party like a mother fucker keep it alive
Rest in peace to the ones who tried

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Travis Nowicki.
