Speak plain he said
But didn't see
He acted that way
And held me like a cup
Fill me up then pour me out
Therein lies the doubt.
We had the same feelings
At opposite times.

When a good man and a good woman
Can't find the good in each other
Then a good man and a good woman
Will bring out the worst in the other
The bad in each other

But what and how
To find us now
When we've become two
Fluorescently blue
Down the neon river
The sadness canoes
Either without or with her

When a good man and a good woman
Can't find the good in each other
Then a good man and a good woman
Will bring out the worst in the other
When a good man and that good woman
Can't find the good in each other
Then a good man and a good woman
Will bring out the worst in the other
The bad in each other. ---
