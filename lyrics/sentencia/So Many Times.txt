So many times ive lost and found my way
Running through this dark and painful highway
Im going straight to my decline
And i dont see a happy ending for me

So many times i falls again 
Vicious circle, i cant escape
It happens again, it never ends
its hurting me, its killing me

So many times i poisoned my body and turned it to stone
A body without feelings, no remorse
No apologies, no memory, no friends, no relatives.
Walking by it self, soulless

So many times this pain ruin me
Now its part of me, i cant touch it
i can give up and start all over again
So many times... so many times....---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
