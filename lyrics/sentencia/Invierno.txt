Let me know that you will always be here
because only with you I can fight.
Let me dream that everything will be better
Because only with you I can dream.

A different horizon opened our way.
A challenge to our gray and fateless lives.
An injection of will awaked our love.
A small heart more powerful than both.

Day by day bleeds the pain of not having.
in restless days we struggle to posess,
what make us rest and a reason.
the fragile balance of our love.

That cold winter who wanted to divide us
and those damned souls, wanted to slay.
Minds drawn, cold, without dignity,
sharpened their claws, in envy of our truth.

Today, as that day, I stand honoring
in the name of a dream that keeps me alive.
some time ago my wounds have healed,
winter is not so cold, and youre still...with Me.---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
