I have tried everything, but the real life hits us.  
The things we lived, you think we deserve it.   

Why? Because they did not lived the things we lived.
We have to teach them, show them what we are made of.  

Open up your mind!!!!!

Now show me, what are you made of.
Walk with me to the gates, there is nothing left to lose

I will wait for you there, i hope you can reach me
is there someone watching out for us?

Broken fists
I broke my fists,   
Against the wall
against the walls of life.

Soul falls apart
My soul falls apart
Trying to escape
to escape from this crap.---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
