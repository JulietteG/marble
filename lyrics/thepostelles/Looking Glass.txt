Oh don't you know
You never needed me
You always had a friend
Someone to fill your needs

Oh yes I know
That when you fall behind
You're gonna take a sip
You're gonna cross that line

Oh question your heart
Let it show
That you're never gonna let it go
So let's make a toast to self control

So now you're holding me close
And girl I'm holding you tight
And the room just keeps spinning round
Every night

Oh yes I know
That when you fall behind
You're gonna take a sip
You're gonna cross that line

Oh question your heart
Let it show
That you're never gonna let it go
So let's make a toast to self control

Oh don't you know that I know
You're never gonna let it go
Oh don't you know that I know
You're never gonna let it show no no
Oh don't you know that I know
You're never gonna let it go
Now oh question your hear let it show
That you're never gonna let it go
So let's make a toast to self control

You wish you found a friend
Someone to hold you up
When you fall down again
You wish you found a friend
Someone to hold you up
When you fall down again---Lyrics submitted by scott summers.
