Hurt to lose your love
Hurt so much more to lose my pride
Yes, it hurt to lose your love
Hurt so much more to lose my pride
It's sad, you know, you broke my heart
But why'd you go and twist my mind

I thought it, I knew it, I felt it
I saw it in your eyes
You were lovin' our best friend
But you denied it and replied
That I was crazy
That paranoia filled my eyes
It's bad enough you were unfaithful
But why'd you go and twist my mind

I accused you over and over
I cried out again and again
You said you'd beat some sense in me
Then you kept lovin' our best friend
Yes you called me crazy
And I believed you at the time
It's bad enough you were unfaithful
But why'd you go and twist my mind

You know our friend couldn't stand to see me
See me beaten blue and black
She said you called me insane
Just to throw me off your track
She said yes you are not crazy
She said you two were lovers all the time
Yes, you blamed me for our problems
You double-crossed me with my own mind

It hurt to lose your love
It hurt so much more to lose my pride
Yes, it hurt to lose your love
It hurt so much more to lose my pride
Yes it's bad enough you broke my heart
But why'd you go and twist my mind

I say it's bad enough you were unfaithful
But why'd you go and twist my mind---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
