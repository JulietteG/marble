I gave everything to you
All I ever had
And if it was made for you
No sacrifice was bad
Just from knowin' you
I felt so very glad
Seemed like such a good idea at the time

I gave all my time to you
All I had on hand
All my life revolved around you
And all I had ever planned
Somebody get me away from you
No obstacle could stand
Seemed like such a good idea at the time

I never thought you'd let me down
For even a minute
I never trusted anyone
Like I trusted you
I really thought I could believe in you
I was locked in it
Then you made all those others seem
Like they were true

All too soon to you
I became a joke
I was of no use to you
I was all used up and broke
Then like floating up a flue
You disappeared like smoke
Seemed like such a good idea at the time

I never thought you'd let me down
For even a minute
I never trusted anyone
Like I trusted you
I really thought I could believe in you
I was locked in it
Then you made all those others seem
Like they were true

All too soon to you
I became a joke
I was of no use to you
I was all used up and broke
Then like floating up a flue
You disappeared like smoke
Seemed like such a good idea at the time, at the time
Seemed like such a good idea at the time---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
