If I could make a wish
I'd make it twice
I'd gladly sacrifice
And let him ride
The rag one time for me

When times are bad
They could be much worse
If my baby had the curse
So let him ride the rag one time for me

Oh he don't know pain
He don't know stress
That visitor makes quite a mess
Let him ride the rag one time for me

I love my baby
But he don't understand the rag
I love him, I love him yes I do
I love my baby
But he don't understand the rag
I love him, I love him yes I do

I'd make him holler
Make him shout
Learn what monthly pain is all about
If he'd ride the rag one time for me
I would give him cramps
Make him shake
His head and back and belly ache
If he'd ride the rag one time for me

But to this story
They can be some joy
If you're not ready for a girl or boy
I'll keep that ride
And enjoy it thankfully
Yes I'll keep that ride
And hope for your sympathy

I love my baby
But he can't understand the rag
I love him, I love him yes I do
I love my baby
But he can't understand the rag
I love him, I love him yes I do

Give me a Midol, give me a Motrin
Give me a Darvon, give me an Advil
Give me a Tylenol, give me a Pamprin
Give me a Valium, give me a Zydon---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
