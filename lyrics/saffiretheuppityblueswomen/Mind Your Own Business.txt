If my man and I are fussin' brother that's our right
Me and that sweet fella's got a license to fight
Mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
Mind your own business
(Mind your own business)

If you mind your business
You won't be mindin' mine

If I wanna honky tonk around till two or three
That's my headache don't you worry 'bout me
You oughta mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
You oughta mind your own business
(Mind your own business)

If you mind your business
You'll stay busy all the time

Well the man across the street tries to make my choice
I speak loud and clear using my own voice
He oughta mind his own business
(Mind your own business)
He oughta mind his own business
(Mind your own business)

He oughta mind his business
He'll stay busy all the time

Mindin' other people's business seems to be high tone
I got all I can handle mindin' my own
I mind my own business
(Mind your own business)
I mind my own business
(Mind your own business)

I mind my business
I stay busy all the time

Mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
Mind your business
(Mind your own business)
Oh mind your business
Mind your own business

Mind your business
Or you won't be mindin' mine---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
