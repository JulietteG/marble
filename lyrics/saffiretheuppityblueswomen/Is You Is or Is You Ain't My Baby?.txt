I know a man who's always late
Every time we have a date
But I love him, yes I love him
I'm gonna walk right up to his gate
See if we can't get it straight
Cause I want it
So I'm gonna ask him

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Way you're actin' lately makes me doubt
You still my baby, baby?
Seems my flame in your heart has gone out

Well a man is just a creature
Who has always been strange
Just when I'm used to one
Well he decides to make a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby, you've found somebody new
Is my baby still my baby true?

Well a man is just a creature
Who has always been strange
Just when I'm used to one
Well he decides to make a little change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby, you've found somebody new
Is my baby still my baby true?---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
