I've been sitting here in this waiting room
Since twenty after nine
I must have read this magazine
At least a hundred times
So you'd probably think I'd be relieved
When they finally call my name
But I know what's in store for me
When I'm back in the saddle again
I got the OBG why me blues

My feet are in the stirrups
But somebody else was in my shoes
He tells me to relax, but I say
Come on doc, would you
I got the OBG why me blues

Oh nurse who is that man
I can only see his eyes
It's tough to let a stranger
Take a gander at these thighs
He's tellin' me some stupid joke
And expecting me to laugh
But I lost my sense of humor
When I got up in this torture rack
I got the OBG why me blues

My feet are in the stirrups
But somebody else was in my shoes
He tells me to relax, but I say
Come on doc, would you
I got the OBG why me blues

Lie down, lie down
Move back, move back
You must keep these things in the freezer
Ah!, what the heck was that?
I got the OBG why me blues

My feet are in the stirrups
But somebody else was in my shoes
He tells me to relax, but I say
Come on doc, would you
I got the OBG why me blues
I got the OBG why me, why me
Blues---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
