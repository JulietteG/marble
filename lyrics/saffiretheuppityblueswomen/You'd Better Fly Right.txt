You better fly right
You better fly right
You better fly right
You better straighten up and fly right

Well I hear that you been buzzin every field in town
You got your throttle shoved forward, your flaps lowered down
This romance we got is going nowhere
Cause you always keeping me up in the air
You better fly right
You better straighten up and fly right

I'm gonna tell you pretty papa what I'm talkin about
We just started makin contact then it's over and out
The straight and narrow's where you gotta stay
To keep your landing privileges on my runway
You better fly right
You better straighten up and fly right

You know flying inverted can be strange
You just waggle your tail till you're cleared to land
When you stagger home at twelve o'clock high
You know you'll be headed for the sharp nosed dive

If you can't fly in formation hon I'm going to clip your wings
You bank on your joystick and you lose your bearings
I got no fear of flying hon and I can solo too
I can find a finer cockpit deal off from you
You better fly right
You better straighten up and fly right

You better fly right
You better fly right
You better fly right
You better straighten up and fly right---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
