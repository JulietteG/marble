Ain't life grand
Ain't love fine
You got what you wanted
Baby and I got mine
Gazing out my window
Till the sun comes shining through
Hey baby, I ain't nobody's fool

Got a pocket full of matches
From every bar in town
Long jar full of ashes
Ashes on the ground
Got Jimmy Reese singin
Honest I do
Hey baby I ain't nobody's fool

There's shoes on the counter
Dishes on the bed
Bottles in the bathtub
I got rocks in my head
I keep rearrangin'
And messing up my place
I'm just looking for something
Or someone to take your place

I ain't got no curfew
I ain't got no golden rule
Got no one to tell me
What is or ain't cool
I ain't got no nothin'
Since I got over you
Hey baby, I ain't nobody's fool

I got shoes on the counter
I got dishes on the bed
I got bottles in my bathtub
I got rocks, rocks in my head
I keep rearrangin'
And then I mess up my place
I'm just looking for something
Or someone to take your place

I ain't got no curfew
I ain't got no golden rule
Got no one to tell me
What is or ain't cool
I ain't got no nothin'
Since I got over you
Hey baby, I ain't nobody's fool
Oh baby, I ain't nobody's fool
Oh baby, I ain't nobody's fool---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
