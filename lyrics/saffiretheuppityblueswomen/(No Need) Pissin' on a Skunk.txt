I saw again for the first time, 
just the other day
I wanted to hurt you like you hurt me, 
throw some dirt in your face
But Im a bigger person, 
so no I have not sunk,
Aint no need for me to be pissin on a skunk
My heart started pumping, 
my hands got sweaty too,
Thinking about the cussing I was gonna lay on you
But Im a peaceful person dont want no troubled funk
And no need for me to be pissin on a skunk

Well Im sorry, so, so sorry, 
ya did me all those dirty, dirty deeds
But what goes around ya know it comes around
A higher power will bring you to your knees
Ill lower my pressure keep my lips tight, 
no need to argue cause I know I am right. 
Im a whole and healthy woman, 
Im not crazy, Im not drunk
Just no need for me to be pissin on a skunk

Ill lower my pressure keep my lips tight, 
no need to argue cause I know I am right. 
Im a whole and healthy woman, 
Im not crazy, Im not drunk
Just no need for me to be pissin on a skunk
Aint no need, no need to be pissin, 
pissin on a skunk.---Lyrics submitted by sharon chute.
