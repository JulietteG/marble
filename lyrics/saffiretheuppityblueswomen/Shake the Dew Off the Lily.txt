You know before I start this song, I just gotta tell you a little 
bit of a story. You know the older you get, the weaker some 
of your body parts get. And one morning around four a.m.
one of my body parts was gettin' weaker and weaker and weaker. 
So I had to go into the next room and take care of a little business.
While I was sittin there I realized I didn't have any TP, so the hook 
came to this song. And as I sat there a little bit longer, some other
words jumped into my head. And all of a sudden this became 
our Georgia O'Keefe song. Cause I know we have some Georgia
O'Keefe fans. And it goes like this:

I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily

Well I look at all the orchids
I sniff at all the vines
Pull the petals from the daisies
To see if you are mine
Early in the mornin
I shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily

Well dahlias and gardenias
Goodbye thorny rose
I'm playin in my garden
I'm watching flowers grow
Early in the mornin
To shake the dew off the lily
I shake it, I shake it, yeah
Early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily

Yeah I suckle honeysuckle
I laugh at daffodils
I pluck them sweet petunias
It gives me such a thrill
Early in the mornin
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily

Yeah I suckle honeysuckle
I laugh at daffodils
I pluck them sweet petunias
It gives me such a thrill
Early in the mornin
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily
I get up early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily

Well I shake it, I shake it
I shake it, yeah I shake it
I shake it, I shake it, ah ah ah ah ow
Early in the morning
To shake the dew off the lily---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
