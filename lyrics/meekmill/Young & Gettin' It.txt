Young and Im getting it, young and Im getting it
Young and Im getting it, young and Im getting it
Im just young and Im living shit
I just want the money, yall can keep them bitches
Cause Im young and Im getting it, Im young and Im getting it

[Hook - Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs (facts),
Shorty wanna roll and Im like aw man she fine (facts),
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me (huh), Im just living my life
Im just young and Im getting it (work), young and Im getting it (work),
Young and Im getting it (work), young and Im getting it (work),
Im just young and Im living shit (work),
I just want the money (work), yall can keep them bitches (work),
Cause Im young and Im getting it (work), Im young and Im getting it

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes in my spare time
She dont fuck on the first night, then she dont meet my deadline
Niggas smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah man
Im sipping on the whole eighth of that purp shit, bed time
I copped 4's like yours, yall niggas aint important
Shorty want that molly, and Im gonna give ger she order
Tats all in my body, strapped up like I'm war
Eat the pussy I probably, if it smell like water
Her neck talk it say fuck me, my wrist talk it say suck me
These niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Kris Humphries
And make them buy me a whip nigga
Nothing less than a 6 nigga,
Yall running yall mouth like hoes, all yall some bitch niggas

Okay, your baby mama, I balled that (check), side chick I balled that (check)
Main chick I balled that (check), and your dream girl just called back
Im still repping that north side with that big P on my ball cap
These broke niggas dont like me, cause they say I think Im all that
Now coon copped that rari, I dont need to feel sorry
Niggas claiming my flows, I should put these niggas on maury
And I aint claiming these hoes, got these haters looking all salty
When I pulled up in that Rolls, swag and surfing on them like gnarly
Im with 3 hoes like Santa Clause, and Im the boss Diana Ross
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasnt even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it th, ths nigga won't be playing at all
Knowing that girl his main thing, that shit I dont like nigga, bang, bang
