Yea, see real niggas come first cuz we made to respect and we do what we want in these streets 
And dope boys come second cuz money make the motherfucking world go round 
And fly niggas come third cuz he might aint got no money but he still could fool the baddest bitch in the building 
Killin these streets nigga 
Treat the motherfucking ghost like its grandma Keefs 
Walk up the lead, shorty V and we order a feast 

I come straight from the ghetto, Im ballin hard as I wanna 
And Im thankful as ever, that we aint out on a coma 
There been death in system, you the ref with the whistle 
Cuz these suckers is fowl, they disrespect us  we hit em 
Niggas claiming they real, they wishing their gang official 
They got me out in the field, a nigga back on his crystal 
Go on with the hammers, my niggas all in the slammer 
Niggas want to catch me slippin but I dont walk over in there 
Im outchea strappin them felcrow and no, I dont say Im dough 
But I spin that raw shit, its like a cell code 
Put one in your hand nigga, like walk with a shell ghost 
I wanted a chamber yea we on point like your elbow 
Bulletproof range when I pull and shoot things 
Hit em close range, let em feel the blue flame 
Every month I buy a new car, a new chain 
I wont never fuck no bummy hoes that count they loose change 

Real nigga come first (first) and dope boy come second (second) 
Fly nigga come third and I keep birds all in my words (in my words) 
I keep birds all in my words (and them people tapping my line man that shit bad for my lungs) 
Real bitches come first (first), fat bitches come second (second) 
Freak bitches come third and I keep birds all in my words 
I got purchase all in my system and half a juice in syrup 
And these suckas talkin this money shit, yall niggas got some nerve 

I try to kick my bitches up on lay away (lay away) 
And if you fuck me good you getting paid today (paid today) 
Thats 40 on my wrist, you caught me 80k 
And I aint got no ice in it, rollin out the light tinted 
So these niggas see me (see me), sway em like graffiti (fiti) 
I get what I wanna (wanna), like I own a genie (genie) 
Niggas hatin on me (on me) 
Know they wanna pin me at the table with my niggas, he is locked in with the greenie 
And that pussy smell like Fiji 
Boy, Ill just go swimming 
Everything but foreign from the porches to the women 
Im early in the morning, with the coca, tryina flip it 
Nigas say they want the money but they dont want go and get it 
Thats why real nigga come first (first), dope boy come second (second) 
Fly nigga come third and I was out there on that curb 
With mailbox so close with me, Im picture word that Im worth 
Talkin late nights you dont play right, that kitchen wearin that work 
Go! 

Real nigga come first (first) and dope boy come second (second) 
Fly nigga come third and I keep birds all in my words (in my words) 
I keep birds all in my words (and them people tapping my line man that shit bad for my lungs) 
Real bitches come first (first), fat bitches come second (second) 
Freak bitches come third and I keep birds all in my words 
I got purchase all in my system and half a juice in syrup 
And these suckas talkin this money shit, yall niggas got some nerve---Lyrics submitted by LisaScho.
