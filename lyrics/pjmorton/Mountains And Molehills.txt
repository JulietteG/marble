There's this girl from a small town
that doesn't really fit in
Wants to leave and sperad her wings
but she feels like she's boxed in
She said "I'll never make it in the big city...
cause things are always moving fast"

"besides where will I live, where will I work, 
there's so much to search
and I'm fresh out of cash"
Stop the excuses don't beleive the lies
make up you mind and try instead of 
Making mountains out of molehills
when their not even real
Need to go and follow your dreams
its not as hard as it seems

You've gotta tryyyy
You've gotta tryyyy
You wont know unless you try
You've gotta tryyyy
You've gotta tryyyy
You wont know unless you try

Now lets fast foward to the present
She lives in a high rise way downtown
Making more money than she's ever made in her life
Now she just looks back and laughs 
to think she ever thought twice
She made up her mind
She did what she could
She listened to her heart and nobody else
and she stopped 
Making mountains out of molehills
when their not even real
Need to go and follow your dreams
its not as hard as it seems

If there is ever a time you're doubting
I'll be right here to encourage you
If you feel like you're falling
Just take my hand, I'll pick you up
and show you its not as bad as what it seems
Making mountains out of molehills
when their not even real
Need to go and follow your dreams
its not as hard as it seems

You've gotta tryyyy
You've gotta tryyyy
You wont know unless you try
You've gotta tryyyy
You've gotta tryyyy
You wont know unless you try---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
