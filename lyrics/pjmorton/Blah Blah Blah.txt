*Opening*
You know that real love
Sometimes you can't explain it,
It just comes out like jibborish

I'm looking at your picture (looking at your picture),
Wishing I could be with you (be with you),
But I'll see you soon (ooo),
Nevertheless (nevertheless),
I still get so anxious (so anxious),
It never gets old to me,
My love just grows con-constantly,
(I can't explain it, it's like),
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
I can't find the words for this love,
It comes out like blah blah blah blah blah,
This love is so marvelous,
It comes out like jibborish
Blah blah blah

It doesn't matter what you wear (doesn't matter what you wear),
T-shirt and jeans I don't care (I don't care),
Just as long as you're here,
Just the thought of you,
Sometimes makes me feel so weak (feel so weak),
Makes me go back in time (back in time),
Back to when I couldn't walk - walk or speak,
It makes me go,

Blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah
(Can't find) Can't find the words for this love it
Comes out like blah blah blah blah blah
This love is so marvelous,
It comes out like jibborish
Blah blah blah

It makes me go blah blah blah blah blah,
Blah blah blah blah,
Can't find the words for this love it comes out like,
blah blah blah blah blah
This love is so marvelous
Just comes out like jibborish
Blah blah blah
