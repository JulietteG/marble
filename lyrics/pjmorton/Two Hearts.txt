I've got two hearts in my hands
what should I do?
I've have to put one heart down 
so I can have one hand free
So I can love totally

I've got two hearts in my hands
too much to choose
but in this game there is no tie
but one has to lose
no one leaves unbruised

See I have got
two hearts one too many
I have got 
two hearts, two is plenty

But some things gotta get done
gotta get back to one 
but I just dont know where to start
with these two hearts
these two hearts

I've got two hearts
unfortunately, it happened this way
and there's a fork in the road
I'm trying to choose which way to go
but I just dont know
I've got two hearts 
doctor please remedy this
the hearts have grown much too large
soon they wont be able to fit
I cant handle it

see I have got 
two hearts one too many
see I have got 
two hearts, two is plenty
But some things gotta get done
gotta get back to one 
but I just dont know where to start
with these two hearts
these two hearts

But some things gotta get done
gotta get back to one 
but I just dont know where to start
with these two hearts---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
