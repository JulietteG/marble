I'm drivin
I'm flyin
I'm heading some place new
You're distant
I'm faded
My heart is black and blue

Remember last summer
Chasin after you
The warm nights
The moonlight
I never had a clue

I tried to make this easy
I tried to understand
You keep it undercover
You keep it if you can

When I SEE YOU AROUND
Don't say anything
Cuz I don't want to know
When I SEE YOU AROUND
Don't say anything
No offense to you

The winter it made you
A frozen memory
I heard all your secrets
And how it's gonna be

You looked me in the eyes
And tell me how it feels
I should have known I was dreaming
Believing you were real

When I SEE YOU AROUND
Don't say anything
I don't want to know
When I SEE YOU AROUND
Don't say anything
No offense to you

You can't hide behind those eyes
I've seen through all the lies
I wont give it one more try
And you know I never will
Ya know I never will

When I SEE YOU AROUND
Don't say anything
I don't want to know
When I SEE YOU AROUND
Don't say anything
No offense to you
You can't hide behind those eyes
I've seen through all your lies

When I SEE YOU AROUND---Lyrics submitted by farrah.
