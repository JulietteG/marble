All I (all I) hear is your voice, 
A whisper away (a whisper away)
Always calls to me
All I (all I) keep with me are memories of you 
(are memories of you)

Wonder what it's like out there
Hoping all your good dreams come true
When you float out above 
Does the world finally come into view?

Today I dedicate to you
Today I dedicate to you
I wont let you go
I need you to stay
There's a place in my heart 
That just won't be the same
Today I dedicate to you

All I (all I) hear are your words, 
They carry me, carry me
Everywhere I go (I go)
And all I (all I) dream of is me next to you

Did you find yourself out there?
Did you really find out the truth? 
(find out the truth)
Well I guess heaven knew 
That we all see the angel in you
When you float out above 
Does the world finally come into view?

Today I dedicate to you
Today I dedicate to you
I wont let you go (I wont let you go)
I need you to stay (I need you to stay)
There's a place in my heart 
That just won't be the same
There's a place in my heart 
That just won't be the same
Without you, you, you

Can I say I miss you down here?
And I'm not, not alone
Can I say I miss you down here?
And I'm not, not alone

Today I dedicate to you
(Today I dedicate to you)

Today I dedicate to you 
Today I dedicate to you (ooh)
Today I dedicate to you
Today I dedicate to you (ooh)
I wont let you go (I wont let you go)
I need you to stay (I need you to stay)
There's a place in my heart 
That just won't be the same
I wont let you go (I wont let you go)
I need you to stay (I need you to stay)
There's a place in my heart 
That just won't be the same
There's a place in my heart 
That just won't be the same
Without you, you, you---Lyrics submitted by rachel.
