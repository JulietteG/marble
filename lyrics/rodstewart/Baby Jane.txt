Baby jane don't leave me hanging on the line
I knew you when you had no one to talk to
Now you're moving in high society
Don't forget I know secrets about you
I used to think you were on my side
But now Im no longer sure
I wish I knew what I know now before

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever

Baby jane don't it make you feel sad
Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
Ive said goodbye so many times
The situation aint all that new
Optimisms my best defense
Ill get through without you

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
I wont be that dumb again
I know it's gotta last forever
When I fall in love again
I know it's gonna last forever

Baby jane Ive said all I want to say
Go your own way don't think twice about me
Cause Ive got ideas and plans of my own
So long darlin I'll miss you believe me
The lesson learned was so hard to swallow
But I know that I'll survive
Im gonna take a good look at myself and cry

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
When I fall in love next time
I know it's gonna last forever
I wont be that dumb again
I know it'll last forever---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
