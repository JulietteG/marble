I've got a chair that sits in, Michael's Bar
That place has seen the best of me
You've got wings and I've got, feet of clay
It's down to you to come to me

And I'm waiting

I find a feather, I tie it to a stone
To drag these things around a while
I throw them out into the blue
And I sit back inside myself

And I'm waiting

As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can

And I'm waiting

As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can
As fast as I can---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
