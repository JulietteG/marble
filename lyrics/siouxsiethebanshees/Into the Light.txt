Into the line Into the light
I see it fine I see it fight
into the line Into the light
our hearts entwine a new horizon
Remember when Bleached into white
your time again kept out of sight
Standing in the light
always sitting on the line
never on a side
always wanting to be right Pushing out the light

Standing in the light
I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light
and blinded my the sight

Dead ahead in the night
burning in the light
and knowing that it's right
driving in the night-Dead ahead in the light......

Into the light...... ---Lyrics submitted by mikey.
