*Dialtone, knocking*
Female voice: Housekeeping... 
*Knocking* 
Female: Hello, housekeeping? 
*Tries, door, knocking*
Female: Hello?

Well you found me, but I don't know
Why you wanna save me...
Well, God is great and God is good
But God didn't help me when he could
And life dances so lonely by.

This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up
This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up

I, I can't feel anything
My arms are numb and I'm hoping
You noticed the line I left off
All that you'll find inside
Are bells and butterflies
But I'll be smiling when I die

This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up
This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up

This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up

*Knocking*
Female: Sir, I know you're in there; are you okay?
Male voice: Excuse me, ma'am, what's the problem here?
Female: No one answering.
Male: Who's in here. Hello? 
*Knocking* 
Male: Hello? Stepping in the room now... 
*Keys jingle, LOUD blunt thump, dialtone gets louder*
Male: Oh Jesus Christ!
Female: Oh! Ooh!

This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up
This is just a courtesy call
This is just a matter of policy
This is just an act of kindness
To let you know that your time is up

This is just a courtesy call
(Why'd you want to save me?)
This is just a matter of policy
(Why'd you want to save me now?)
This is just an act of kindness
(What'd you want to do it for?)
To let you know that your time is up
This is just a courtesy call
(Why would you wanna save my life?)
This is just a matter of policy
(I know you did or you could)
This is just an act of kindness
(It's been comin' for a long time, long time...)
To let you know that your time is up---Lyrics submitted by jake.
