Laughing like we're crazy 
Nothing mattered 
Nothing fazed me 
We were younger then 
So much younger then 
Everything seems rotten through 
The eyes of the forgotten 
And we were dumber then 
So much dumber then 

Well have I judged a book by how its bound 
Am I lost or am I found 
And are you with me 
Are you with me now 
Come back from the dead 
You've been inside your head for too long 
Are you with me now 
Find the places that scare you 
Come on I dare you 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 

The years they took their toll 
And all the things I can't control 
Come back to haunt me now 
Almost taunt me now 
Whats left to be afraid of 
We found out what we are made of 
And we've come this far 
We both have the scars 

Have I ever judged a book by how its bound 
Am I lost or am I found 
And are you with me 

Are you with me now 
Come back from the dead 
You've been inside your head for too long 
Are you with me now 
Find the places that scare you 
Come on I dare you 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 

Well have I judged a book by how its bound 
Am I lost or am I found 
And are you with me 
Come back from the dead 
You've been inside your head for too long 
Find the places that scare you 
Are you with me now 
Come back from the dead 
You've been inside your head for too long 
Are you with me now 
Find the places that scare you 
Come on I dare you 
OH 
Come on I dare you 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 
Are you with me 
Are you with me---Lyrics submitted by Theres.
