Feels like your life is over
Feels like no hope is gone,
You kiss it all away,
Maybe,Maybe,
This is a second comming,
This Is a call to arms,

You'll find uo now, and 
we'll be wasted,wasted

Hey, Hey, Hell is what you 
make, make, Rise against
Your faith, faith, Nothing's
gonna keep me down
Even if it's killing you because 
you know the truth,

Listen up, listen up,
there's a devil in the
Church, got a devil in 
the chamber and
This Is Gonna Hurt

Let it out, Let it out,
you can scream 
and you can shout
Keep your secrets 
in the shadows and
You'll Be Sorry,
Everybody's getting numb,
(Everybody's getting numb),
Everybody's on the run,
(Everybody's on the run),

Listen up, listen up,
there's a devil in the
Church, got a bullet in
the chamber and 
This Is Gonna Hurt

You got your
hell together,you know it 
could be worse
A self inflicted murder,
Maybe, Maybe,
You say it's all a crisis,
You say it's all a blurr,
There comes a time 
You gotta face it, face it,

Hey, Hey, Hell Is what you 
make, make, Rise against 
your faith, faith, Nothing's 
gonna keep me down,
Even if it's killing you
because you know
the truth,

Listen up, listen up,
there's a devil in the
Church, got a bullet in
the chamber and
This Is Gonna Hurt

Let it out, let it out,
you can scream 
and you can shout,
Keep your secrets in 
the shadows and
You'll Be Sorry,
Everybody's getting numb,
(Everybody's getting numb),
Everybody's on the ,
(Everybody's on the run),



Listen Up, listen up,
there's a devil in the
Church, got a bullet in 
the chamber and
THIS.IS.GONNA.HURT!

(This Is Gonna...)

Listen up, listen up,
there's a devil in the
Church, got a bullet in
the chamber and
This Is Gonna Hurt

Let it out, let it out,
you can scream 
and you can shout,
Keep your secrets 
in the shadows and
You'll be Sorry,
Everybody's getting numb,
(Everybody's getting numb),
Everybody's on the run,
(Everybody's on the run),

Everybody's Getting some,
(Everybody's Getting some),
Everybody's on the run,
(Everybody's on the run),
 and
THIS IS GONNA HURT!!---Lyrics submitted by Shadow.
