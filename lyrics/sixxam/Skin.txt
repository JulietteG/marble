Paint yourself a picture
Of what you wish you looked like
Maybe then they just might
Feel an ounce of your pain

Come into focus
Step out of the shadows
It's a losing battle
There's no need to be ashamed

Cause they don't even know you
All they see is scars
They don't see the angel
Living in your heart

Let them find the real you
Buried deep within
Let them know with all you got
That you are not your skin

Oh (X2)

When they start to judge you
Show them your true colors
And do unto others
As you'd have done to you

Just rise above this
Kill them with your kindness
Ignorance is blindness
They're the ones that stand to lose

Cause they don't even know you
All they see is scars
They don't see the angel
Living in your heart

Let them find the real you
Bury deep within
Let them know with all you got
That you are not your skin

OHHHHHHHHHH

Well they don't even know you
All they see is scars
They don't see the angels
Living in your heart

Let them find the real you
Bury deep within
Let them know with all you got
That you are not 
That you are not your skin

Oh (X2)---Lyrics submitted by Theres.
