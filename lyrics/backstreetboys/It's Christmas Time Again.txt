Frost grows outside the window
First kiss under the mistletoe
oh oh oh oh

Bells chime inside a steeple
Open the doors heat the people sing
oh oh oh oh

And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa is back in town, town, town
Thats when Its Christmas Time Again

La Ta la ta ta ta ta, Its Christmas Time Again
La Ta la ta ta ta ta, Its Christmas Time Again

And Ive been checkin my list twice
Got plans to give you your gift tonight
oh oh oh oh

Wake up under a lit three
One wish came true, youre here with me
oh oh oh oh

And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa is back in town, town, town
Thats when Its Christmas Time Again

La Ta la ta ta ta ta, Its Christmas time again
La Ta la ta ta ta ta, Its Christmas time again

And when the snow is falling down, down, down
You know that Santa is back in town, town, town
Thats when Its Christmas time again

La Ta la ta ta ta ta, Its Christmas time again
La Ta la ta ta ta ta, Its Christmas time again---
