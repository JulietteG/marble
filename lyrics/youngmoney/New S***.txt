[Gudda] 
Ughn 
Flow gifted like the honor roll 
At crunch time I deliver like dominoes 
A different freak for every day I got all kinda hoes 
I slide em dick n get the fuck I neva mind them hoes 
But neva mind them hoes 
I got all kinda flows 
I switch em up so quick as fuck I gotta timeless flow 
Young animal 
Punishin the protools 
Eatin this beat up like soul food you niggas old news 

[Wayne] 
NOw aint you tired of sayin the same shit everyday 
I mean the same shit ashley n mary kate 
Sometimes I wish dat I was blind like mr ray 
How come you talkin out yo ass but aint got shit to say 
I spend my money like my time I aint got it to waste 
Man I'm so fast feel like I'm racin in a different race 
Too much champagne now watch me spit it in dem bitches face 
Tomorow mornin I cud tell you how dem bitches taste 

[Jae] 
This rap shit is our house you niggas just visitin 
Young money wolverines bitch no ... 
I get in them hoes n reel em in like fishermen 
N throw dey ass in the truck n we rose like michelins 
All hail the kings, crowns glistenin 
I stunt hard as I want cuz I aint gettin a chance to live again 
Focus is what you better get boy we on dat better shit 
All bosses no executives you just repetitive 

[Wayne] 
NOw aint you tired of sayin the same shit everyday 
I mean the same shit ashley n mary kate 
Sometimes I wish dat I was blind like mr ray 
How come you talkin out yo ass but aint got shit to say 
I spend my money like my time I aint got it to waste 
Man I'm so fast feel like I'm racin in a different race 
Too much champagne now watch me spit it in dem bitches face 
Tomorow mornin I cud tell you how dem bitches taste 

[Mack Maine]

[Wayne] 
NOw aint you tired of sayin the same shit everyday

Man I'm so fast feel like I'm racin in a different race 
Too much champagne now watch me spit it in dem bitches face

Cash money too much money to calculate
