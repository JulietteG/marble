[Lil Wayne] 
Too many women, and not enough time 
Im a cool cat, but im on life nine. 
Pimping aint dead cause I be the life line 
And I dont buy the bar cuz it dont sell white wine 
Gon let that light shine 
ballin for a life time 
Smoking on a nice pine, Weezy baby flight flyin 
You can call him your husband 
Call me at night time 
And even though women change 
I will always like dimes 
And yeah im quite fine, but shawty much finer 
And I just get behind her 
And smack it like E Honda 
And please dont hate on me 
when you see me with Kiana 
cause she wilder than Nirvana 
and colder than your honor 
holla at your boy manana 
Maybach come wit a recliner 
run up on it and sh-t will get uglier than an iguana 
this is only a reminder its Young Money dont forget it 
and im Weezy F baby you might find it on a titty 
would you . . . 

[Chorus - Short Dawg] 
Pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

Pa-pa-pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gu-Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

[Verse - Short Dawg] 
Chilling with my possy
Bout to calls some ladies over 
Tell em this is YME so when you come you cant leave sober 
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her 
Put her on a tab now she rolling like a baby stroller 
Im the freshest n-ggas seen 
Whippin in my jeans 
Shoot ya lights out im like bredick with the beam 
Life a game of chess, and im headed for your queen 

Now my stomach and my thighs 
Wat a head is in between (ew) 
And she wetter than a stream, I drink medicine to lean 
Keep a cup in my hand like im begging for some cheese 

I fall off in the party 
Yeah im kinda tardy but if I hated she'll be riding on em like a Harley 
Look you call it getting married, I call it acting selfish 
my belt got Gs on it like a Packers helmet 
And imma hit it if you bring your girl around 
but the weed is like my collar cause I might just turn it down 
if you . . . 

[Chorus - Short Dawg] 
Pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

Pa-pa-pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gu-Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

[Gudda Gudda] 
Okay tool on deck (deck) 
Im new born fresh (fresh) 
I knock your friends down (down) 
And you going next (ha) 

Young money fly 
N-gga all the bitches after me 
Murder in the bed and you gonna be my next casualty 
Automatic stick, but I give it to her manually 
Im giving dick all year round and you can get it annually 


Styrofoam feel 
With a strawberry fanta tree
Leaning ima need a kick stand to stay on my feet 
Get out ma bidness like I kicked ya out my office 
I aint worried about the price, im more concerned with offer 

Fresh to death like I got dressed in the coffin 
With a party in my pocket 
Blue and red dolphins 
Im high as a motherf-cker 
Let me do my thing bitch im doing me 
And your girl doing the same sh-t 

Im in the car getting head 
As I lane switch, Do-Double G I do my thang bitch 

[Chorus - Short Dawg] 
Pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

Pa-pa-pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gu-Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

[Drake] 
Uhh, Ok I told you catch up 
Did you make a mill yet? 
I cant predict how many of em I can still get 
October own thats such a f-ckin real set 
No tatts but the ink of my money still wet. 

Life is such a beach, its sandy all around me 
I came here with young money man, thats family all around me 
Im in my living room and I got Grammys all around me 
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me. 

Welcome to the life 
The life thats meant for me 
My bentley has a tint so you got to squint to see 
I hollad at your girl thats when she went with me 
But please dont blame yourself cause it just wasnt meant to be 

They say im one of the illest 
Thats just off from first impression 
And my cards always accepting 
I dont deal well with rejection 

I look in the dictionary 
And dont see the word recession 
I dont smoke in public 
But tonight ill make an exception so just . . . 

[Chorus - Short Dawg] 
Pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man 

Pa-pa-pass me the dutch with cha left hand 
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man 
Im in my polo Tee, Gu-Gucci sweat pants 
She on a Jubilee call me the X-man---Lyrics submitted by alliee.
