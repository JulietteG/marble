[Lil Chuckee]
Nothing make a man feel better than his lady
Cause girl I got you


[Chorus]
I know Im always gone and Im hardly never home Dont worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down Ima buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Dont worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) haa
Its just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)


[Lil Twist]
As I was walking by
I seen you standing there with a smile
Lookin shy caught my eye
Thought you wanna hang a while
i15 on the beat and I aint cruisin highways
So baby lets get away
Save the troubles for another day haa
Jammin Escapade in the lot
Wit Escalade on the back
Ya homies wack I promise that
It aint trickin if you got it
Might as well spend a stack
I hit the mall and ball down
Call me young Steven Jackson
And Im the one
And I won with no games played
Never have to work in our life day we got it made
Every days a vacae M.I.ami like Dade
And we aint ever clean up
Cause baby I got maids haa
Young money we so paid
And if you ever get hurt baby i'm ya band-aid ha
While im lookin at you
Never worry bout nothing cause girl I got you


[Lil Chuckee]
I know Im always gone and Im hardly never home Dont worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down Ima buy you everything
You aint gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Dont worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) haa
Its just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cuz girl I got you)


[Lil Chuckee]
Shawty Im here any time that you need me
Fa sheezy Im here to make ya lifeeasy
They say to every good dude theres a good lady
And I have mine already
Aint no need to keep lookin
And when Im on the road you go to my house
And walk my bulldog and help my mums out
And play with my sister you know I love that
Thats why whatever you want I'ma cop that
Im your Rashaad, you my Nu-Nu
Im ya Will Smith, baby you my Jada Pooh
And when Im in the studio you come chill wit me
Play around with my hair
You keep me motivated
If we had a team
Id be Reggie Bush youd be Kim Kardashian
Your body so amazing
And when Im not witcha
Im on my iPod Bumpin 'Forever My Lady' I LOVE YA


[Lil Chuckee 2x]
I know Im always gone and Im hardly never home Dont worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down Ima buy you everything
You aint gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Dont worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) haa
Its just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)---Lyrics submitted by mohoganey.
