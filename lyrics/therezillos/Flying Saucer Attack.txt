There's a threat approaching from the stars
All the horrors from Venus and Mars
Everybody'd better be on guard
When the flying saucers land

Watch the skies above the horizon
For the spies who have no flies on
When they appear through the statusphere
Better lock yourself inside

Flying saucer attack
I'm never coming back
Oh, oh, oh
Until it's over

Laser beams and gamma projectors
There'll be nothing on Earth to protect us
When they arrive out of the sky
They'll be frying us alive

Call out the army and United Nations
Alert the police and airforce stations 
Tell everybody to run and hide
Because the end is near at hand

Flying saucer attack
I'm never coming back
Oh, oh, oh
Until it's over

There's a threat approaching from the stars
All the horrors from Venus and Mars
Everybody'd better be on guard
When the flying saucers land

Watch the skies above the horizon
For the spies who have no flies on
When they appear through the statusphere
Better lock yourself inside

Flying saucer attack
I'm never coming back
Oh, oh, oh
Until it's over

Oh, oh, oh
Until it's over
Oh, oh, oh
Until it's over---Lyrics submitted by Tony Bown.
