I hope you're the end of my story
I hope you're as far as it goes
I hope you're the last word I ever utter
It's never your time to go

Sometimes this road that we travel
Feels like it's leading us on
And spinning our wheels just stirs up the gravel
Before you know it, it's gone.

I hope you're the end of my story
I hope you're as far as it goes
I hope you're the last word I ever utter
It's never your time to go

I'll keep on turning the pages
Oh what a story to tell
You'll still be my sweetheart when everything ages,
You'll be the last book on the shelf

I hope you're the end of my story
I hope you're as far as it goes
I hope you're the last word I ever utter
It's never your time to go

I hope you're the last word I ever utter
It's never your time to go---
