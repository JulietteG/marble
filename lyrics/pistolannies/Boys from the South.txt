Maybe he's in Texas, maybe this town
Maybe Oklahoma plowin' up some ground
Southern Carolina, somewhere on the coast,
Maybe Alabama drivin' thru Montgomery right now.
There's somethin' 'bout a boy from the South.

Maybe he's in Florida, somewhere in the pines,
Maybe on the delta throwin' out a line,
Maybe he's in Georgia, starin' at the stars,
Maybe Tennessee pickin' on a guitar right now.
There's somethin' 'bout a boy from the south

Yea, the first time I felt it I was only 16,
And he kissed me underneath the chinaberry tree.
Said "Goodnight darlin'," with a sweet southern drawl.
Man, I think I might just have to love them all 
My boys from the South.

Maybe in Kentucky, workin' in the mine.
Maybe down in Little Rock, just to pass the time.
Maybe he's somewhere in New Orleans,
Livin' it up in the Big Easy right now.
There's somethin' 'bout a boy from the South.

Yea, the first time I felt it I was only 16,
And he kissed me underneath the chinaberry tree.
Said "Goodnight darlin'," with a sweet southern drawl.
Man, I think I might just have to love them all 
My boys from the South.

Maybe he's in Texas, maybe this town.
My boys from the South. ---Lyrics submitted by katie qualls.
