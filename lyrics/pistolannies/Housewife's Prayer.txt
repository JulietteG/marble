I been thinking about, 
Setting my house on fire,
Can't see a way out,
Of the mess i'm in,
And the bills keep getting higher,
All i need is a match,
And a gallon of gas,
God i'm getting tired,
Gonna set this house on fire,

I've been thinking about,
Going off the deep end,
My man can't get no over time,
And the baby ain't been sleeping,
All i need is a washing machine,
These ends of mine ain't beating,
I'm bout to go off the deep end,

Ooo hooo, ooo hooo, ooo hooo

Well i've been thinking about,
All these pills i'm taking,
I wash them down with nice cold beer 
And the love i ain't been making 
Oh i feel like i'm burning up
And worrying about things i ain't been saying 
And all these pills i'm taking 

Ooo hooo, ooo hooo, ooo hooo

I been thinking about
Setting my house on fire---Lyrics submitted by Lacey Mancil.
