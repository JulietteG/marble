I dont have to lay beside you
Feeling so alone
But my babys crying for his daddy
And asking when hes coming home

I dont have to feel neglected
Im not damaged goods anymore
But my baby has been devastated
Ever since he walked out that door

Im trading one heart break for another
One kind a pain for a different kind of pain
And I wonder
If this is gonna hurt even more
Im finally alive but its killing who Im living for

I dont have to hear his complaining
And I dont have to curse his name
But my darlin is missing his daddy
Hell always have me to blame

Im trading one heart break for another
One kind a pain for a different kind of pain
And I wonder
If this is gonna hurt even more
Im finally alive but its killing who Im living for

Im trading one heart break for another
One kind a pain for a different kind of pain
And I wonder
If this is gonna hurt even more
Oooh Im finally alive but its killing who Im living for---Lyrics submitted by Alyson Chambers.
