Fine china stacked by the kitchen sink
Aunt Tammy's in there claiming all the diamond rings
Uncle Bobby's loadin up the tv set
Only thing they're grieving over is what they ain't gonna get
She's only been in the ground a day or two
Oh I'm glad momma ain't around to watch this family feud

Great grandaddy's shotgun started it all
She wasn't even cold fore they ripped it off the wall
Wanda's fighting Angie over antique quilts
Nobody even waited for the reading of the will
If daddy was here he'd beat us black and blue
I'm glad momma ain't around to watch this family feud

I'm watching it all go down in shame
Wish the whole house would go up in flames
Who gives a damn bout a cedar chest
When we just laid her soul to rest

She's only been in the ground a day or two
I'm glad momma ain't around to watch this family feud
She's probably rolling over in her grave
Cause the good Lord giveth and the family taketh away---Lyrics submitted by stormmi shaw.
