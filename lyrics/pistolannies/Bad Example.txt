Somebody had to set a bad example
Teach all the prim and propers what not to do
Nobody around here wants to ramble
What the hell, that's what I was born to do

Those swanky big brick houses don't amuse me
I live in a trailer but I drive a cadillac
I ain't never tried to impress nobody
With my honk if you're horny sticker on the back

Somebody had to set a bad example
Teach all the prim and propers what not to do
Nobody around here wants to ramble
What the hell, that's what I was born to do

All the girls that I grew up with went to college
Their rich daddies bought them a degree
But I'm a third generation bartender
Yeah, and I like livin' from a tip jar week to week

Somebody had to set a bad example
Teach all the prim and propers what not to do
Nobody around here wants to ramble
What the hell, that's what I was born to do

Somebody had to set a bad example
Teach all the prim and propers what not to do
Nobody around here wants to ramble
What the hell, that's what I was born to do
I said, what the hell, that's what I was born to do---Lyrics submitted by Kassidy Carey.
