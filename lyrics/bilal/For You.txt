As a matter of fact, we the doppest niggas 
you ever wanted to fuck with...

And we got our peeps up in here too...
And they'll roll up in ya if they need to...
Like I'd do...
It would be better if I do.

Verse 1:
Now, can I be true?
And you be the ear that I talk to?
And you be the one that I walk to?
You be the woman that I'm doing
Even when I have the time to?

You understand in me...
In a world so obsessed with beauty and ugliness...
(Ugliness!)
God chose you! (Baaaaaaby!)
And baby...

For you...

Chorus:
For you, I...
I'd Rob And Steal...
For you, I...For you...
For you, I 
Blast the nine...

For you!

For you, I...
Ride or Die
For you, I...For you
For you, I...
Please Believe it...

For you!

Verse 2:
The only separating me from you,
Is a mobile phone away...
And a trip you could make in a day...
Baby, trust in me, I'll handle it!

Now, this may sound like some pimp shit to you, 
But I ain't pimpin'...
Please forgive me if I appear to.
I'm just a nigga that says what he means...

So, baby it's yours...
If you want to...
Yours...if you need to...
Yours, even if I have...
Just as long as you're here and you're comfortable

I got some pillows in the back 
If you need to lay it on my shoulder
While i drive you back to my house 
Though everybody knows

For you...

Chorus:
For you, I...
I'd Rob And Steal...
For you, I...For you...
For you, I 
Blast the nine...

For you!

For you, I...
I'd ride or die
For you, I...For you
For you, I...
Please Believe it...
Please believe it!

Bridge:
Come to the light...(Please Believe!)
'Cause you could be a star!!!

Heeeeeeeeeeeeyyy!

Come to the light...
'Cause you could be a star!

(Please Believe it...Please Believe It!!!!)

Chorus:
For you, I...
I'd Rob And Steal...
For you, I...For you...
For you, I 
Blast the nine...

For you!

For you, I...
Ride or die
For you, I...For you
For you, I...
Please Believe it!

I'd Ride or die...For you, I...
Id Rob And Steal....For you, I...
For you...
For you, I...

I'll do it, baby...
Baby, please believe it 
when I tell you...

For you, I...Ride or Die
For you, I...For you
For you, I...

I got it!
Please Believe it, Ladies and Gentlemen!!!!
(Please believe it, Ladies and Gentlemen...)
