Love is a ghost in a room 
when she has turned away into the empty night. 
Love will make you wait to be found. It carries you home. 

On her island there is no horizon line, 
only endless sea going up, becoming sky. 

Who is the shadow in the corner of her eye? 
It speaks in a language of smoke and pale heavy air. 

It says, Lover, you are tired and falling, crawling. 
It says, Lover, you are alone in misery. 
For you are a blur, disconnected in memory. 
And everything you carry weighs on you like misery. 

Shed love to fly but the sky dont care. 
Shed love to fly but the sky wont hold her. 

From a great height, she falls past gravity, 
through the blue of the sea, 
to the island shes made. 
She waits. 

The little girl wonder, like spring and all is splendor, 
has caught a ride to yesterday. 
Theyve been shepherded on home. 
Lover, where have you gone? 
Have you gone?---Lyrics submitted by utere.
