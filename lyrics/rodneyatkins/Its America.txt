Driven down the street today
I say a sign for lemonade
they were the cutest kids I'd ever seen in this front yard
as they handed me my glass
smiled thinkin to my self man what a picture perfect postcard this would make of America
[Chorus]

It's a high school prom
it's a springstein song
it's a ride in a chevrolet
it's a man on the moon
and fireflies in a June
and kids sellin lemonade
it's cities and farms
it's open arms
one nation under god
its America

Later on when I got home,I flipped the tv on,Isaw a little town that some big twister tore apart
People came from miles around just to help their neighbors out
And I was thinkin to myself I'm so glad that I live in America

[repeat Chorus}

Now,we don't always get it all right
but there's no place I'd rather live my life
cause it's a kid with a chance
it's a rock n' roll band
It's a farmer cuttin hay
It's a big flag flyin in the summer wind over a fallen hero's grave

It's a high school prom
it's a springstein song
It's a welcome home parade
it's a man on the moon
and fireflies in June
and kids sellin lemonade
it's cities and farms
it's open arms
One nation under God
It's America
It's America---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
