The Declaration of Independence
Think I could tell you that first sentence but then I'm lost
I can't begin to count the theories
I've had pounded in my head that I forgot

I don't remember all that Spanish
Or The Gettysburg Address
But there is one speech from high school
I'll never forget

Come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me about yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else

She's her daddy's girl
Her momma's world
She deserves respect
That's what she'll get, ain't it son?

Now, y'all run along and have some fun
I'll see you when you get back
Bet Ill be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

Well, now that I'm a father
I'm scared to death one day my daughter
Is gonna find that teenage boy I used to be
That seems to have just one thing on his mind

Shes growin' up so fast
It won't be long before
Yeah, Ill have to put the fear of God
Into some kid at the door

Yeah, come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me about yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else

She's her daddy's girl
Her momma's world
She deserves respect
That's what she'll get, now ain't it son?

Now y'all go out and have some fun
And I'll see you when you get back
Probably be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

Now it's all for show
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt
Its just a daddy thing
And hey, believe me, man, it works

Come on in boy sit on down
And tell me about yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else

She's her daddy's girl
Her momma's world
She deserves respect
That's what she'll get, ain't it son?

Now ya'll run along and have a little fun
And I'll see you when you get back
Probably be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

Son, now y'all buckle up
And have her back by 10:00, uh
Let's say about 9:30
Drive safe---
