Now the curtain is going up
The entertainer is taking a bow
Does his dance step and sings his song
Even get all the audience to sing along
Yes he knows just what he must do
Knows how to bring down the house when he's through
Snappy patter and jokes 
He knows what pleases the folks
The entertainer the star of the show.

It was in Vaudeville 
And he was on the bill
With all the singers, dancers, acrobats and clowns 
There was a dog act there
Even a dancing bear 
And a comedian who never lets you down 
But when he came on
To sing his favourite song
He really wowed them in the cities and the towns
They came from near and far
To see the Vaudeville star 
The entertainer.---Lyrics submitted by Ken Hendrick.
