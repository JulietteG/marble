Last night I, I saw you standing
And I started, started pretending
I knew you, you knew me too
And just like a Roni you were too shy
But you weren't the only one so was I

And I dreamed of you ever since
Now I build up my confidence
Next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name

I started to write you letters
But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey, baby but just like a baby I could not talk
And I tried to come closer but could not walk

And I think of it every night
How I just could not get it right
Oh, if we ever come close again
I know what I'll say then

Can we talk for a minute?
(Can we talk baby can we talk for a minute?)
Girl I want to know your name
(I want to know your name)
Can we talk for a minute?
(Can we talk for a minute baby?)
Girl I want to know your name

Oh, girl one more chance
With you again I will not let it go
Oh, please give me just a one more chance
For love, love, love, love

Can we talk for a minute?
(Yeah yeah baby)
Girl I want to know your name
(I wanna know)
Can we talk for a minute?
(Can we talk for a minute baby?)
Girl I want to know your name
(Oh baby, baby, baby, baby)

Can we talk for a minute?
(Come on talk to me baby)
(Come on and talk to me baby)
Girl I want to know your name
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know your name)

Can we talk for a minute?
(Can we talk for a minute, come on and talk to me baby?)
Girl I want to know your name
(Come on baby, come on baby)

Can we talk for a minute?
(I said can we talk for a minute, come on and talk to me baby)
(See I wanna know, you better tell me your name baby)
Can we talk for a minute?
(I said come on and talk for a minute)
(I said come on and talk for a minute)
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
(I wanna know your name)
Can we talk for a minute?
(Talk to me for a minute)
(Come on and talk for a minute)
(Come on, come on, come on and talk)---
