Tie me down,
Ill go wild, Ill go wild
You cant hold down,
A homeless child, a homeless child

No man was born to be locked up,
No man is born to not be free
Were here to live, were here to love
Were here to touch, feel and see

When the lows get to heavy
I must teach myself to climb

Tie me down,
Ill go wild, Ill go wild
You cant hold down,
A homeless child, a homeless child

Behind the cloth, behind the paint
Behind the flesh and bones
Behind the laughter and the pain
Behind the eyes lies my soul

When the tears get to heavy
I must teach myself to cry

Tie me down,
Ill go wild, Ill go wild
You cant hold down,
A homeless child, a homeless child

Theres got to be a way
Im a hunter for a better day

Tie me down,
Ill go wild, Ill go wild
You cant hold down,
A homeless child, a homeless child

Tie me down,
Ill go wild, Ill go wild
You cant hold down,
A homeless child, a homeless child

Tie me down,
Ill go wild, Ill go wild
You cant hold down,
A homeless child, a homeless child---
