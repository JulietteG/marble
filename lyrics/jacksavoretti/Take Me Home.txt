Theres a full moon on the rise
And a sadness growing heavy in my soul
You can see it in my eyes
I dont know where to go
No i dont know where to go

Theres a kindness in your smile
Please forgive me i cant help but stop and stare
We can walk for miles and miles
I know youll get me there
Yes I know youll get me there

Take me home with you tonight
Im not gonna make it down this lonely street
Take me home with you tonight
Im not gonna make it on my own
My own two feet

Now the early morning sun
Is burning holes right through the mask i wore all night
Can I take your hand and run
Ill follow you for life
Ill follow you for life

Take me home with you tonight
Im not gonna make it down this lonely street
Take me home with you tonight
Im not gonna make it on my own

You're not the one that i can live with
You're the one that i can't live without

Take me home with you tonight
Im not gonna make it down this lonely street
Take me home with you tonight
Im not gonna make it on my own,
My own two feet---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
