Im sick and tired of getting older
I keep getting lost trying to find my way
Looking for love in every corner
Night after night
But every street light looks the same

So Im taking a chance, walking away, breaking the rules
Nobody here can tell me what to do

Im out on my own, making my way
Trying to be someone, that I can be proud of one day
Im out on my own, doing it my way

I gotta be tough, gotta be stronger
And take the time to understand
This city cant get any colder
Stab you in the back while shaking your hand

So Im taking a chance, walking away, breaking the rules
Nobody here can tell me what to do

Im out on my own, making my way
Trying to be someone, that I can be proud of one day
Im out on my own, doing it my way
Doing it my own way

Taking a chance, walking away, breaking the rules
Nobody here can tell me what to do

Im out on my own, making my way
Trying to be someone, that I can be proud of one day
Im out on my own, doing it my way
Doing it my way
Doing it my own way---Lyrics submitted by Roos.
