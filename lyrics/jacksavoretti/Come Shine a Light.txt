Dressing up in black and blue like I have been may times before
Every moment I spare with out you leaves me wanting more
If I close my eyes I can picture you here in my arms
Man I would kill just to keep you safe out of harm

Come shine a light on me
Your love is more than Ill need
This one is not for sale
As far as I can see
Come shine a light on me

Cigarettes and Alcohol singing songs just to pass the time
Everything I ever want never ends up being mine
So I just get real high catch your eye on a shooting star
Still remember the first ime I saw you alone at the bar - alright

Come shine a light on me
Your love is more than Ill need
This one is not for sale
As far as I can see
Come shine a light on me

I can make my fist I can fight till I get what I need
But Id rather be loving you - you loving me - alright

Come shine a light on me
Your love is more than Ill need
This one is not for sale
As far as I can see

Come shine a light on me
Come shine a light on me
Come shine a light on me
Come shine a light on me ---
