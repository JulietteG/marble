tchya, ladies handclap, thats the way they used to do
Now we're gonna do it again come on, tchya goes like this

Chorus: (x2)

When them ladies, move their bodies
What we gon do, we gon Hand clap
Hands applauding, girls moving to the rhythm
People, what we gon do? We gon hand clap

Verse 1:

Hot like pili,pili (Hot like chili, chili)
Girl i really mean it
Drinking but never silly
Down to the last shilling
Move your belly like waves
Mass shake like earth quakes
Show me how you move your body
Yeah come on give it to daddy
Lord have mercy girls, got me clapping girls
In my house, before we launch, in't no stopping these
girls

These claps in't lazy no, and they drive you crazy
yeah
So once again, clap you upper hands
Ladies, It's an all night dance, now move all night
long yeah
Till morning comes, come on
Work what your mamas give you
Don't be shy, not at all, please do
Now let me break it down in swahili

Wasichana, mutingishe, penbeni, katikati, polepole,
haraka wooh

English Translatation: (Shake it girls, from the side, to middle, speed it
up wooh)

Chorus: (x2)

When them ladies, move their bodies
What we gon do, we gon Hand clap
Hands applauding, girls moving to the rhythm
People, what we gon do? We gon hand clap

Verse 2:

Get ya clappin, cos i am wat`s happenin
after u heard bout me, i bet u turn ya back again
im crazy lazy, aint ya average lady

get ya back off the wall
u just standin there ahh like a crack a bomb
was ya prob? u been sad like same ol` song
sing along, oh u need 2 take a pill then u ready 2go
check ya pocket, is it fat- is it poundin
it gotta be both- when we out we be lougin`
follow the step - STL- we ahead of the league
A strucker bomb, all my booty shakers get it on

Chorus: (x2)

When them ladies, move their bodies
What we gon do, we gon Hand clap
Hands applauding, girls moving to the rhythm
People, what we gon do? We gon hand clap

Verse 3:

My feet left right
she 360 from the waist down
hands up clap sound like surround sound
minus will be belly dancing
eye contact like, like two romancing
intense dancing
music got ya hands clapping
body's moving souls grooving
if aint off the wall on the dance floor then ya loosen
if ya shy get to the bar get to boozing
dancing like ya in the mirror
or ya at home joking with ya friends
tonight aint fun unless ya sweating till ya slim
and ya hands up clapping like you need a encore for more

Chorus 4: (x2)

When them ladies, move their bodies
What we gon do, we gon Hand clap
Hands applauding, girls moving to the rhythm
People, what we gon do? We gon hand clap

Wasichana, mutingishe, penbeni, katikati, polepole,
haraka wooh
