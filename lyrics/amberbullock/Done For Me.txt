Woke up this morning
Breathing
Realized it was You, ooh
So I got up,
Called a friend
Had to tell them the truth

(CHORUS)
Bout how you loved me (how You loved me)
Unconditionally (unconditionally)
Even though I am not worthy You still take care of me
Bragging aboutcha (aboutcha)
Bout how perfect You are
Youre so amazing
Gotta say Lord Im crazy bout You

I just cant hold it gotta tell you what Hes (done for me)
He loosed the shackles gave me peace and He (set me free)
I just cant hide it Im excited that Hes  (amazing)
I wanna thank You Lord for everything Youve (done for me)

So when Im feeling
like giving up (like giving up)
and throwing in the towel, ooh
Ill stop for a minute
And think about
The ways Youve brought me out
(CHORUS)

(You give new mercies to me every morning
You make the sunshine, You keep the world turning)
Yeah, You are the reason I live (reason I live)
Ill tell it every chance that I get

I just cant hold it gotta tell you what Hes (done for me)
He loosed my shackles gave me peace and He (set me free)
I just cant hide it Im excited that Hes  (amazing)
I wanna thank You Lord for everything Youve (done for me)
