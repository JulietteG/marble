[Verse 1]
Couldve been dead sleeping in my grave
But you said no it wouldnt happen that way
Gave me a second chance and I thank you for that
The devil tried to get me but you had my back
Lord you gave your life up just for me
You caused the lame to walk and the blind to see
Couldve gave up any day
But you didnt so all I have to say is

[Chorus]
La la la, La la la la
Lord youve been so good
La la la, La la la la
Lord youve been so good
(Repeat)

[Verse 2]
Woke me up and you didnt have to
Always been there when Im going thru
I just wanna say whats on my heart
Youve been by my side right from the start
Lord I go thru so much pain
But you kept my mind and you kept me sane
Lord I love you in a special way
I know you love me too all I got to say is

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge]
Lord youve been so good
Youve had my back when no one would
You picked me up when I was down
I know youll always be around
(Repeat)

[Chorus out]---Lyrics submitted by Anja J.
