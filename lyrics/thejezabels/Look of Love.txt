You got me lit up with a look of love
I could take you in a pick up truck
Like Im choking
But Im talking rough literature
And are you rolling about with the big son
And mowing them down
Hey little honey,
Im rolling in line with you

In the dead of night
I cant give in to your love
In the dead of the night
Your loves so staggering
That Ill shut it out of my mind
You get spinning again
Oh, get spinning again
Ill get spinning again

In the dead of night Ill look
Oh the reckoning of all
Gonna lick it like that sugar
Should I recognize it calls me?

Got me lit up with a look of love
I could take you in a pick up truck
I am always
When Im always hurting with you

In the dead of night
I cant give in to your love
Well get spinning again
Oh, get spinning again
Well get spinning again
Oh, get spinning again
Well get spinning again---
