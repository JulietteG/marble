Well I was the one who showed you the sky,
But you brought it down, down to my thighs.
Sadly believed every word
I didnt mean about loving darkness

And there it is now, he enters the room.
It guts like fish to see how hes grown.
So we go out onto the town to mess around.
Ooh, get my groove on, mess around.

Well you were the one who thought it was funny
That half of the world had never seen money.
Shimmy-shuffle round, break it all down.
It does never come to an end, as long as you can help yourself.

There it is now, she enters the room.
It guts like a fish to see how shes grown.
Saw me go blind, step out of line,
You know I cant help myself.
When you get your groove on I go blind.
When you get your groove on I go blind.
When you get your groove on I go blind.

So, let me go out into the evil world that you know,
Where my baby cries, but I cut the ties.
Oh, let me go out into the sinful world that you know,
That you really love.

Just let me be easy to love.
Just let me be easy to love.

When you get your groove on, yeah I go blind.
When you get your groove on, yeah I lose my mind.
When you get your groove on the whole world goes blind.
So get your groove on girl, well go wild. ---
