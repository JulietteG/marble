What's wrong, dear brother?
Have you lost your faith?
Don't you remember a better place?
Needles and things done you in
Like the setting sun
Oh, dear brother, trouble weighs a ton

What's wrong, dear sister?
Did your world fall down?
Men misuse you and push you around
Same story dear, year after year
Pathetic men run
Oh, dear sister, trouble weighs a ton

Trouble in the air
Trouble all I see
Does anybody care?
Trouble killing me
Oh, it's killing me

What's wrong, dear mother?
Has your child disobeyed?
Left you hurt in so many ways
What once was sweet is sorrow and grief
That cannot be undone
Oh, dear mother, trouble weighs a ton
Oh, dear mother, trouble weighs a ton ---Lyrics submitted by jason.
