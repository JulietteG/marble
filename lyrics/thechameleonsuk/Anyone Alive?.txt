Bush is back 
It's a matter of fact 
Bush is back 
It's a matter of fact 
Spark up a light 
Angel it's alright. 
Spark up a light. 
Angel it's alright.

Oh and you're the light on me 
Oh and you're the light on me

And anyone with eyes can see 
I am not afraid with you 
Anyone with ears to hear 
I am not afraid with you 
Anyone alive 
Can feel the storm clouds gathering

What have you got? 
Does it seem like a lot? 
What have you got? 
Well to some it's a lot 
Where do you go? 
Well I think I know 
Above and beyond the energy flow 
Mouth to mouth with the feminine glow

Oh you're the light on me 
Yeah pour your light on me.

Anyone with eyes can see 
I am not afraid with you. 
Anyone with ears to hear 
I am not afraid with you 
Anyone alive 
Can feel the storm clouds gathering in

'Cause anyone with eyes can see 
I am not afraid with you 
Anyone with ears to hear 
I am not afraid with you 
Anyone alive can see 
I am not afraid of the storm clouds gathering in.
