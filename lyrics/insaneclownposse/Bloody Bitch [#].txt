i live life like im playin a game of x-box
i dont give a fuck if i die or get caught
there i am god damn everything was smooth
i woke up with a bloody bitch dead in the bathroom
the wicked shit phrase and i heard through the day
some how now relates my new murderous ways
scared of fuckin death of whats happenin here

Blood in the tub as i scrub a dub
on my knees geese i hope she aint have a disease
i need the keys to the shead 
ima cut the head off
my dads got knife that will cut lead off
how shal i do this what sounds fun
i just sat on her head pee and twittle my thumbs
finally said fuck it stomped her face
sunk in like a pumpkin i left no trace.

Another bitch dead on the bathroom (floor)   x3
Find me into the night ill be thuggin
Another bitch dead on the bathroom (floor)  x3
Find me into the night ill be scrubin

You must think im some kind of fuckin idiot dont you
what you think ima do warn ya when im on ya
thats what they teach u on forensic files
teaching all your secrets and styles
got that aluminum foil zone for your crime lab
 you find nothing but a carcus salb---Lyrics submitted by nikki.
