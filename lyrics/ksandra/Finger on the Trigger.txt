You put your finger on the trigger
You got the finger on the pulse
You put your finger on the trigger
You got your finger on the pulse

Lately 
They hang on every word you say (you say) 
Watchin
Watchin every move you make (you make) 

When I look into your world
See it all turn into gold             
Headline
Now this is your time and place                          

Youve got your finger on the trigger
Everything you do is just right             oh oh oh
You put your finger on the trigger 
Everything is coming to life                oh oh oh
Its alright
And youre looking good                 
So right
Got the Midas touch
You put your finger on the trigger 
And then you set the world alight          Whoah oh oh oh

News flash
Climbing to the top of the scene 
So fast					
Number one in every feed

Anything is possible
When your cup is running full  
Stage fright
A-list and celebrity

Youve got your finger on the trigger 
Everything you do is just right             oh oh oh
You put your finger on the trigger  
Everything is coming to life                oh oh oh
Its alright
And youre looking good                 
So right
Got the Midas touch
You put your finger on the trigger 
And then you set the world alight          

You put your finger on the trigger
You've got the finger on the pulse
You put your finger on the trigger
You've got your finger on the pulse

You put your finger on the trigger
You got the finger on the pulse

Now this is your time and place

Youve got your finger on the trigger 
Everything you do is just right            
You put your finger on the trigger  
Everything is coming to life               

Youve got your finger on the trigger 
Everything you do is just right       
You put your finger on the trigger 
Everything is coming to life                
Its alright 
And youre looking good                 
So right  
Got the Midas touch
You put your finger on the trigger
And then you set the world alight        
You put your finger on the trigger 
And then you set the world alight
Whoah oh oh oh
