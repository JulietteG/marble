Ooh, time with you

On the road, blue sky noon
Sunsets comin', a lovely tune
Time to spare, love to give
Peace of mind, a time to live

Wouldn't it be nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
A joy that's true, some time with you

Stars are up, stakes are too
Shooting star, a [war?] is blue
You wink first, I don't care
Which way we go, long as you're there

Wouldn't it be nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
A joy that's true, some time with you

Time suspends, we're outta sight
We forgive, no time to fight
Need my time to explore you
Kiss and make up, a whole new shoe

Wouldn't it be nice?
Wouldn't it be mm mm oh so nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
A joy that's true, oh whoa

Wouldn't it be nice?
Wouldn't it be oh oh oh so nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?

Some time with you, ooh
Some time time time with you---Lyrics submitted by Ronn.
