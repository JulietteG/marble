Those who trust, in the lord
are strong mountain.

that can not,,,no.
not be moved.
   2X

Those who trust, in the lord.
Are as mount Zion.

they will not,,oh no.
not be moved. 
    2X 

Though the World moves like mad
you are lord of faithful.
you alone are faithful
jesus you, you will not 
not be changed.

Christ the king 
He sets my feet on a ferm foundation.
I will not,no.
not be moved.

though the world moves like mad
you are lord of faithful.
you alone are faithful
jesus you, you will not be changed---Lyrics submitted by andrew.
