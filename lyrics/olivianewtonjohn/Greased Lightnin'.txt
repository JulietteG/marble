Why this car could be systematic
hydromatic
ultramatic
Why it could've been Greased Lightning (Greased Lightning)

We'll get some overhead lifters and four barrel quads
Oh yeah
(Keep talking whoa, keep talking)
Fuel injection cutoffs and chrome plated rods oh yeah
(I'll get it Ready, i'll kill it to get Ready!)
With the four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door
You know that ain't no S**t we'll be getting lots of tit
In Grease Lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
(Greased lightning go, Greased lightning)
Go Grease Lightning you're coasting through the Heat Lap Trial
(Greased lightning go, Greased lightning)
You are supreme! the chicks'll cream for Grease lightning!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

We'll get some purple hued tailpipes and some thirty inch fins
Oh yeah
We'll pound 'em in the dashboard and duel muffler twins
Oh yeah
With new pistons, plugs and shocks I can get off my rocks
You know that I ain't bragging she's a real pussy wagon
Grease lightning

Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)
Go grease lighting you're coasting through the heat lap trial
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for grease lightning

Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)
Go grease lighting you're coasting through the heat lap trial
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for grease lightning
Lightning, lightning, lightning
Lightning, lightning, lightning
Lightning!

Come on Guys lets get to work!  Yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Aleksei.
