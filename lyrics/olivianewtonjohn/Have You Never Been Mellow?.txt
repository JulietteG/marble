There was a time when i was in a hurry as you are
   i was like you 
There was a day when i just had to tell my point of view
   i was like you
Now i don't mean to make you frown
No i just want you to slow down

Have you never been mellow
Have you never tried
To find the comfort from inside you
Have you never been happy just to hear your song
Have you never let someone else be strong

Moving around as you do
With your head up in the clouds
I was like you 
Never had time to lay back 
Kick your shoes off close your eyes
I was like you

Have you never been mellow
Have you never tried
To find the comfort from inside you
Have you never been happy just to hear your song
Have you never let someone else be strong


now your not hard to understand
you need someone to take your hand---Lyrics submitted by lynn.
