I will lift up my Eyes

Theres a gate around the garden
Theres a lock upon the gate
Theres a key that longs to open
Theres a river flowing somewhere
To a sea that knows her name
Theres a ship that sails upon it

You are knowing
You are everywhere
In the shadows 
And in the light
From the valleys
To the mountains
I will lift up my eyes
I will lift up my eyes

By the day the sun wont burn me
And the moon will guide thy way
For the spirit never slumbers
It will keep me from all evil
With its arms around thy soul
From this moment and forever

You are knowing
You are everywhere
In the shadows 
And in the light
From the valleys
To the mountains
I will lift up my eyes
I will lift up my eyes
My eyes .
My eyes 
My eyes.
My eyes 

I will lift up my eyes---Lyrics submitted by P.
