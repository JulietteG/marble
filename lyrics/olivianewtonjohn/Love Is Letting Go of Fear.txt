The pain is something that you cant ignore
Youre always wondering
what the hurt is for
Your heart feels something 
that it cant explain
You yearn for love 
but youre afraid to change
Remember... the wounded bird still sings
Rememberthat faith has tiny wings

Love is letting go of fear
Love is letting go of doubt
Love is letting go of chains 
That tie your spirit down and
Love is letting go of pain
Love is learning how to dance
Inside the light again

Youre always haunted by the love you lost
Youre scared that 
youll forever pay the cost
You believe this is the bitter end
Better lonely than be hurt again
Remember theres always one more chance
Remember that loves the only dance

Love is letting go of fear
Love is letting go of doubt
Love is letting go of chains 
That tie your spirit down and
Love is letting go of pain
Love is learning how to dance
Inside the light again

Love is letting go of pain
Love is learning how to dance
Inside the light again

Mmm love with all your heart
Mmm love with all your soul
Mmm love with all your might
mmmmmm let go ---Lyrics submitted by P.
