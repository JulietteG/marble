When you cant find your direction
And your heart wont guide you home
Let Go 
Let God
When your dreams are broken in the dust
And youve lost the will to trust 
Let Go
Let God

Let the signs remind you
We are passengers
Let the signs remind you
To surrender
To surrender
Let Go and Let God

When faiths a dying fire
And theres no spark to feed the flame
Let Go and Let God
When your courage fails you 
And the well of hope runs dry
Let Go and Let God

Let the signs remind you
We are passengers
Let the signs remind you
To surrender
To surrender
Let Go and Let God

Let the signs remind you
We are passengers
Let the signs remind you
To surrender
To surrender
Let Go and Let God
Let Go and Let God
Let Go
And let God.---Lyrics submitted by P.
