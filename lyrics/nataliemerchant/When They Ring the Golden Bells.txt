theres a land beyond the river
that they call the sweet forever
and we'll only reach that shore by fait's decree
one by one we'll gain the portals
there to dwell with the immortals

when they ring their golden bells for you and me
dont you hear the bells now ringing
dont you hear the angles singing
tis a glory halleluja to believe
in that far off sweet forever
just beyond the shining river
when they ring their golden bells for you and me

we shall kno no sin or sorrow
in that heaven of tomorrow
when our hearts shall sail beyind the silvery sea
we shall only know the blessing 
of our father's sweet caressing

when they ring their golden bells for you and me
dont you hear the bells now ringing
dont you hear the angles singing
tis a glory halleluja to believe
in that far off sweet forever
just beyond the shining river
when they ring their golden bells for you and me

when our days shall know their number
when in death we sweetly slumber
when the king commands the spirits to be free
nevermore with anguish laden
we shall reach that lovely eden
when they ring their golden bells for you and me
when they ring their golden bells for you and me---Lyrics submitted by emily.
