We were never the marrying type, oh no  
We won't buy dishes or stained glass lights, oh no  
For a table we'll never sit at and the house we won't ever get 

I won't wake up and pick out your tie, oh no  
You won't come home and kiss me at night, oh no 
We won't lie in this king bed for two 
Say good-bye to us saying I do's  

No more white picket fences 
No more lace veils or vows  
No more you're the only one cause that's all done with now  
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you  
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you 

Take these roses and this Jameson, oh no 
Find a subway that i can sit in, oh no 
Buy a one-way out of this city 
Everything that i need got it with me 

No more white picket fences  
No more lace veils or vows 
No more you're the only one cause that's all done with now 
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you 
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you 

All these notes and all these words are all that's left in me 
Bend these pages, count my woes  
One last song to set me free 

No more white picket fences  
No more lace veils or vows  
No more you're the only one cause that's all done with now 
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you 
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you 

This is the last love song I'll ever write for you 
This is the last love song I'll ever write for you, oh oh oh---
