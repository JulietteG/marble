Ooh, ooh,

I got ten fingers to the sky,
My back to the wall, my white flag high,
Her lips, just like a gun,
She's got silver bullets on her tongue,
He's deep under her spell,
I'm screamin' out, but it just won't help,

I think I'm cursed,
I had him first,

Oh, Adeline, have mercy
You don't wanna break my heart,
Take what's mine, don't hurt me,
Steal my money, steal my car,
Don't take my man, don't take my man,
I said, don't take my man 'cause you know you can,
Put the gun down, ooh,
Put the gun down, ooh,

She stole my man, took him from me,
She's got crimson eyes, a screamin' body,
Face is young, she must taste sweet,
She drops those panties to her knees,
Walkin' on my happy home,
She won't give up until I'm gone,

I think I'm cursed,
I had him first,

Oh, Adeline, have mercy,
You don't wanna break my heart,
Take what's mine, don't hurt me,
Steal my money, steal my car,
Don't take my man, don't take my man,
I said, don't take my man 'cause you know you can,
Put the gun down, ooh,
Put the gun down, ooh,

Put the gun down, put the gun down,
Got your finger on the trigger now,
Put it down, put it down,
Put it down, put it down,
Put the gun down, put the gun down,
Or I'mma set fire to the whole damn house,
Put it down, put it down,
Put it down, put it down,
Whoa, oh, Adeline,

Oh, out a line, have mercy,
You don't wanna break my heart,
Take what's mine, don't hurt me,
Steal my money, steal my car,
Don't take my man, don't take my man,
I said, don't take my man 'cause you know you can,
Put the gun down, ooh,
Put the gun down, ooh,
Put the gun down, ooh,
Put the gun down, ooh,
Put the gun down.---Lyrics submitted by Zz.
