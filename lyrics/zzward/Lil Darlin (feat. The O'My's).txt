Oh, please, please, please,
Quit dragging my heart through them coals,
Oh, please, please, please,
Stop trying to fix it 'cause, baby, it's broke,
When it's late at night and you call me,
'Cause I've got another man fixing my blues,
You should never, never worry 'bout nothing, baby,
'Cause I'll never love someone new the way I love you,

And every word I say to you feels like I'm screaming out a bunch of whispers,
And every word you say to me is like a bee sting or leaving blisters,
There ain't no honey left in this hive,
There ain't no sugar nowhere inside,
I hate to love ya, I love to hate ya,
I just can't shake you,

Oh, please, please, please,
Quit dragging my heart through them coals,
Oh, please, please, please,
Stop trying to fix it 'cause, baby, it's broke,
When it's late at night and you call me,
'Cause I've got another man fixing my blues,
You should never, never worry 'bout nothing, baby,
'Cause I'll never love someone new the way I love you,

You're the static, just enough dramatic,
Shock, you drive me crazy,
Ain't no man could take your place,
You know it, baby,
But I just can't stand you, so it's got to end,

There ain't no honey left in this hive,
There ain't no sugar nowhere inside,
I hate to love ya, I love to hate ya,
I just can't shake you,

Baby, when you want me, when you crave me, when you need it,
If you ain't got the time to save me when I'm falling, then just beat it,
'Cause, boy, I can't be your medicine, your ritalin when you're fiending,
If you won't be my knight in shining when I'm crying, when I'm screaming,

Oh, please, please, please,
Quit dragging my heart through them coals,
Oh, please, please, please,
Stop trying to fix it 'cause, baby, it's broke,
When it's late at night and you call me,
'Cause I've got another man fixing my blues,
You should never, never worry 'bout nothing, baby,
'Cause I'll never love someone new the way I love you---
