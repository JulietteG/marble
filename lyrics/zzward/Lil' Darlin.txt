Oh Please Please Please
Quit draggin my heart through them coals
Oh Please Please Please 
Stop Tryin to fix it cause baby its broke
When its late at night and you call me
Cause i gotta nother man fixin my blues
You should never never worry bout nothin baby
Cause ill never love someone new 
The way i loved you

And every word i say to you
Is like im screamin out a bunch of whispers
And every word you say to me 
Is like a bee sting or leavin blisters

There aint no honey left in this heart
There aint no sugar no where in sight
I hate to love you
I love to hate you 
I just cant shake ya

Oh Please Please Please
Quit draggin my heart through them coals
Oh Please Please Please 
Stop Tryin to fix it cause baby its broke
When its late at night and you call me
Cause i gotta nother man fixin my blues
You should never never worry bout nothin baby
Cause ill never love someone new 
The way i loved you

Your the static just enough dramatic
Shock you drive me crazy 
Aint no man
Can take your place 
You know it baby
But i just cant stand you 
So its got to end

There aint no honey left in this heart
There aint no sugar no where in sight
I hate to love you
I love to hate you 
I just cant shake ya

Baby when you want me 
When you crave it
When you need it 
If you aint got the time save me 
When im fallin
Then just beat it
Cause boy i cant be your medicine
Your ridilin when or feinin
If you wont be my knght and shinin
When im cryin when im screamin

Oh Please Please Please
Quit draggin my heart through them coals
Oh Please Please Please 
Stop Tryin to fix it cause baby its broke
When its late at night and you call me
Cause i gotta nother man fixin my blues
You should never never worry bout nothin baby
Cause ill never love someone new 
The way i loved you---Lyrics submitted by Shanice W.
