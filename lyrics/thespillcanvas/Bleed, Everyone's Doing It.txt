Hello, is this thing on? Are you listening to me?
I need roughly a million people to help assemble a brilliant rebel army.
Take all division from religion, and just throw it out.
Whatever you believe, you're welcome here.
Now let me tell you what it's all about.

Bleed, everybody bleeds.
The same as you and me.
Pour and mix our lives together and flow into the streets.

Are you still with me? Am I making myself clear?
Don't get distracted by the puppet show of politicians,
They put one on every single year.
Take all excuses your fear produces and line 'em up in a row.
We're gonna execute them,
Then salute them and let our courage grow.

Bleed, everybody bleeds.
The same as you and me.
Pour and mix our lives together and flow into the streets.

At the end of the day we all share the same consequence.
Nobody is immune to death or the taste of our own ignorance.
All across the globe it's deafening. (Everybody knows.)
All existence clear your throat and sing. (Everybody knows.)

Bleed, everybody bleeds.
The same as you and me.
Pour and mix our lives together...

Bleed, everybody bleeds.
The same as you and me.
Pour and mix our lives together and flow into the streets.

Bleed, everybody bleed.
Everybody bleed.
Everybody bleed.
Everybody bleed.---Lyrics submitted by joey.
