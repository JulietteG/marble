I wanna be locked in a cage 
I wanna be strapped in a chair (hey, hey) 
I wanna be where you are 
If my insanity comes (hey, hey, hey)
Wrapped up inside your 

I wanna break my legs 
In case of thought to escape (hey, hey)
Keep the hammer out of my reach 
If my pounding impulse comes (hey, hey, hey)
Wrapped up inside Your arms.... 
Locked up inside You 

Hold me down 'cause I want to know You 
You bring calm to my rage 
You are life and I'm thirsting for You 
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage

Im locked (x3)

I love to be caught by you 
I wanna be trapped in Your arms (hey, hey)
Your cage is rest to my bones 
Your cage is peace to my soul (hey, hey, hey)

Wrapped up inside Your arms 
Wrapped up inside You 

Hold me down 'cause I want to know You 
You bring calm to my rage 
You are life and I'm thristing for You 
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage 

Wrapped up inside Your arms 
Wrapped up inside Your arms 
I'm inside Your arms 
I'm inside Your arms 

Hold me down 'cause I want to know You 
You bring calm to my rage 
You are life and I'm thirsting for You 
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage

Hold me down 'cause I want to know You 
You bring calm to my rage 
You are life and I'm thirsting for You 
Hold me, hold me, locked in a cage
I'm locked (x9)---Lyrics submitted by olivia.
