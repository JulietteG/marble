Im still trying to figure out how to tell you I was wrong
I cant fill the emptiness inside since youve been gone
So is it you or is it me?
I know I said things that I didnt mean
But you shouldve known me by now
You shouldve known me

[chorus]
If you believed
When I said
Id be better off without you
Then you never really knew me at all
If you believed
When I said
That I wouldnt be thinking about you
You thought you knew the truth but youre wrong
Youre all that I need
Just tell me that you still believe

I cant undo the things that led us to this place
But I know theres something more to us than our mistakes
So is it you or is it me
I know Im so blind when we dont agree
But you shouldve known me by now
You should've known me

[chorus]
If you believed
When I said
Id be better off without you
Then you never really knew me at all
If you believed
When I said
That I wouldnt be thinking about you
You thought you knew the truth but youre wrong
Youre all that I need
Just tell me that you still believe

Is it you, or is it me?
I know i said things that i didn't mean
You should've known me by know
You should've known me

[chorus]
If you believed
When I said
Id be better off without you
Then you never really knew me at all
If you believed
When I said
That I wouldnt be thinking about you
You thought you knew the truth but youre wrong

Cause you're all that i want
Don't you even know me at all
Youre all that I need
Just tell me that you still believe---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
