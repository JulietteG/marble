Angry words and honking cars
Satellites and fallen stars
Distant dark blue radios that whisper down my boulevard
Ghosts and chains rattle in the attic
Broken headphone filled with static
Lonely room youve got nowhere to run

3 2 1 for all and all for 1
Times will be bad times will be good
Things I wish I had are done and somehow wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
youve got a voice and a song to sing (and a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da 
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through  the American noise
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise

Slamming door and cell phone rings
Hurricane forces silent screams
Dont know what to believe
Bend the rule just to break it
Your so tired cause to gotta fake it
But you just wanna be someone

3 2 1 for all and all for 1
Times will be bad 
Times will be good
Things I wish I had are done 
And some I wish I would
Cutting through the  American noise
Youve got a voice and a song to sing (and a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da 
Lift up your voice
Let love come through  the American noise
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love come through  the American noise

No matter who you are youve got a voice
Why dont you use it
Sing your own song
Take all the noise
Make it into music

La da da da
La da da da
La da da da ah

La da da da
La da da da
La da da da ah

La da da da
Lift up your voice 
Let love cut through the American noise

La da da da
You have a choice
Let love cut through  the American noise

You've got a voice

Let love cut through
The American noise---Lyrics submitted by shyla davidson.
