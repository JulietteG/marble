Speak, and my heart starts aching
Reach, and the numbness dims
Beat, still my minds uncertain
Breath, it begins again
YOU ARE THE ONE REAL THING YAAH
YOUR ARE THE ONE TRUE THING THAT I KNOW
YOU ARE THE ONE REAL THING
no matter what the future brings
your the one real thing
Stay, locked within your presence
Truth, renew within my mind again
Rest, cause i know your faithful and i
Trust, cause i know your name
YOU ARE THE ONE REAL THING YAAH
YOUR ARE THE ONE TRUE THING THAT I KNOW
YOU ARE THE ONE REAL THING
no matter what the future brings
your the one real thing
i get down on my knees and i feel your love wash over me (repeated3x)
Speak, and my heart starts aching
Reach, and the numbness dims
Beat, still my minds uncertain
Breath, it begins again, begins again
YOU ARE THE ONE REAL THING YAAH (REPEAT)
YOU ARE THE ONE TRUE THING THAT I KNOW (REPEAT)
YOU ARE THE ONE REAL THING
no matter what the future brings
your the one real thing
i get down on my knees and i feel your love was over me (repeated)---Lyrics submitted by Stephanee.
