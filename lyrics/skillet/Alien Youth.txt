It's been confirmed that the aliens have landed....

World wide Jesus domination
Love conquers all.
Rise like the chosen generation
There no stopping it all.

Come on, freaks, lets go. (Repeat x2)
Get all the freaks, lets go.

Chorus
We're taken over the world with an alien youth
We're coming for your soul
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
Change the world with an alien youth
We're taken over, over, over
Alien youth!

Come on, freaks, lets go(Repeat x2)

Do you believe that the aliens have landed?
We're everywhere you go.
Infiltrate: at the break of revolution
You can't stop the revival
And we're not gonna leave this world alone
And we're not gonna leave it, yeah

(Chorus)

Come on freak lets go
Get all the freaks and lets go(Repeat x2)

And we're not gonna leave this world alone
And we're not gonna leave it, yeah(Repeat x2)
