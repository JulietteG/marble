Power, is another word that I use to describe You
Your mighty winds come in and blow me away
Frightening, coming at me like lightning
Good to feel again
I shake whenever You speak my name

And I'm surrounded
You overpower me
Your a sunny rage, You're a hurricane
You are everything I cannot see and can't explain
Your an enigma, wrapped in a mystery
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy

Divine, is a reality You that define
You define time
I see, You within everything within thought and within reign
Captured, is just the word to capture all my feeling
And still You're a wide frame
You see me free, I wanna be Your slave

And I'm surrounded
You overpower me
Your a sunny rage, You're a hurricane
You are everything I cannot see and can't explain
Your an enigma, wrapped in a mystery
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy

I can't escape your energy(Repeat x8)

Power, is another word that I use to describe You
Your mighty winds come in and blow me away

And I'm surrounded
You overpower me
Your a sunny rage, You're a hurricane
You are everything I cannot see and can't explain
Your an enigma, wrapped in a mystery
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy

I can't escape it. I can't escape. 
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy.---Lyrics submitted by elle.
