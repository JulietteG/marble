As I walk through
The corners of Cooley High
I gotta be thankful
That I'm still alive
I have lots of thoughts
Like who the Hell am I
What is the truth
And what is a lie
But I think about my life
And everything is okay
I gotta pave a way
To a brighter day
`Cause its really plain and simple
When it came to me
There's a lot of people
Just like me
(Like me)
There's a whole lot
Just like me
(Like me...)

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon (woo)
When you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

1964
Uhh
Here we go
Hey yo'
The child was born
It was a beautiful day
1964
The 31st of May
The girl gave birth
To a baby boy
He is not a burden
He is a bundle of joy
She was just a young girl
(She was just a young girl)
In her youth
(In her youth)
And her parents tried real hard
(And her parents tried real hard)
To hide the truth
(To hide the truth)
Is there a chance
(Is there a chance)
For the baby to live
(For the baby to live)
That is a chance
(That is a chance)
That you gotta give
(That you gotta give...)

(Woo) And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon
And when you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
(Represent, hah)
You know we'll have a good time then
(Represent...)

(One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight...)

It was nine whole months
Inside of the womb
Another long month
In the hospital room
Facing doom in a tomb
`Cause the kid is alone
But somebody came along
And they took the kid home
He came into the world
Like we all do
But he never ever knew
How he came through
Do the best you can do
If this happen to you
And understand all the words
That I'm rappin' to you
??(Outside)
Understand all the words
That I'm rappin' to you
??(Outside)

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon (whoo)
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon (whoo)
When you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Yo'
The mother and the father
Is all that he knows
They give him lots of love
And you know that it shows
He's livin' really well
He has all that he needs
He came into the world
And he's gonna succeed
It is a blessing
To live in the light
If nothing is wrong
Then sumthin' is right
They say that life is a mystery
(Ahhhh...)
And I just wanna know my history
(Ahhhh...)
Understand that life is good to me
(Ahhhh...)
That's the way it is so
(Let it be)

My life is complete
Everything is all right
Life is good to me
I'm in paradise
Understand when I'm rappin'
No pain and sorrow
I just want you to know
Yo-yo
I just want you to know
Yo-yo
(I'm all right ma...)

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon
And when you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon
And when you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon
And when you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon
And when you comin' home
And I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

And the cat's in the cradle
And the silver spoon
Little boy blue
And the man in the moon
And when you comin' home
And I don't know when
You know we'll have a good time then---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
