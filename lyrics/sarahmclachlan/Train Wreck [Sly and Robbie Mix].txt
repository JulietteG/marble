Would your love
In all its finery
Tear at the darkness
All around me
Until I can breathe again
Until I believe again

`Cause I'm a train wreck
Waiting to happen
Waiting for someone to come
Pick me up off the tracks
A wildfire born of frustration
Born of the one love
That gets me so high
I've no fear at all

Would your eyes
Like midnight fireflies
Light up the trenches
Where my heart lies
Until I can see again
To find my way back again

`Cause I'm a train wreck
Waiting to happen
Waiting for someone to come
Pick me up off the tracks
A wildfire born of frustration
Born of the one love
That gets me so high
I've no fear at all

To fall so deep into you
(Oooohhhh...)
Lose myself completely
(Oooohhhh)
 In your sweet embrace
(Oooohhhh...)
All my pain's erased
(Oooohhhh...)
From your mouth
It's all that I wish
The mercy of your lips
Just one kiss
Until I can breathe again
Until I can sing again

`Cause I'm a train wreck
Waiting to happen
Waiting for someone to come
Pick me up off the tracks
A wildfire born of frustration
Born of the one love
That gets me so high
I've no fear at all

To fall so deep into you
Lose myself completely
In your sweet embrace
All my pain is erased

Ahhhh...

Lose myself completely
In your sweet embrace
All my pain's erased...

Ahhhh...
Ahhhh...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
