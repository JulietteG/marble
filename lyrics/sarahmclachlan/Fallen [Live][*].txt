Heaven bent to take my hand 
And lead me through the fire 
Be the long awaited answer 
To a long and painful fight 

Truth be told I've tried my best 
But somewhere along the way 
I got caught up in all there was to offer 
And the cost was so much more than I could bear 

Though I've tried, I've fallen... 
I have sunk so low 
I have messed up 
Better I should know 
So don't come round here 
And tell me I told you so... 

We all begin with good intent 
Love was raw and young 
We believed that we could change ourselves 
The past could be undone 
But we carry on our backs the burden 
Time always reveals 
The lonely light of morning 
The wound that would not heal 
It's the bitter taste of losing everything 
That I have held so dear. 

I've fallen... 
I have sunk so low 
I have messed up 
Better I should know 
So don't come round here 
And tell me I told you so... 

Heaven bent to take my hand 
Nowhere left to turn 
I'm lost to those I thought were friends 
To everyone I know 
Oh they turned their heads embarassed 
Pretend that they don't see 
But it's one missed step 
You'll slip before you know it 
And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed 

Though I've tried, I've fallen... 
I have sunk so low 
I have messed up 
Better I should know 
So don't come round here 
And tell me I told you so... 

Oh I have messed up
Better I should know
So don't come roung here
And tell me I told you so...---Lyrics submitted by shirley.
