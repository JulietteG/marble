Since I was a girl
Dreamed of a different life
Far away in the lights
But now Im here
Staring into the face of the unknown

And who was I to think I could fool them
When I dont even know who I am?
Whats it gonna take to make me worthy
Whats its gonna take to make me strong
I dont have much to give
Ive only just begun to live

So how do I become somebody new?
How do I begin to make it happen
How will I believe and see this through?
When I feel so unready
And I feel so alone?

Back on solid ground
My head is spinning round
My heart is in two different worlds
But here I stand
Wondering where I fit into this madness

I thought when I was home Id see clearly
But theres so much I dont understand
Whats its gonna take to lift the darkness
Whats its gonna take to light my way?
I have so much to give
Ive only just begun to live

So how do I begin my life anew?
How do I begin to make this happen
How do I believe and see this through?
Cause I feel like Im ready
But I still feel unsure?---
