Written by Sarah McLachlan

Oooooh...
In the desert of my dreams I saw you there
And I'm walking towards the water
Steaming, body cold and bare
But your words cut loose the fire
And you left my soul to bleed
And the pain that's in your truth
Deceiving me has got me scared

Oh why...(oh why)
Oh why...(oh why)
Oooohhhh...

Through your eyes the stains of battle
Like a brooding storm
You're up and down these pristine velvet walls
Like focus never formed
My walls are getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray
I see you now
A vague deception of a dying day

Oh why...
Oh why...
Oooohhhh...
Ahhhhh...

I fall into the water
And once more I turn to you
And the crowds were standing
Staring, faceless
Cutting off my view to you
They start to limply flail their bodies
In a twisted mime
And I'm lost inside this tangled web
In which I've laid entwined
You're gone and I'm lost inside this tangled web
On which I'm lain entwined

Oh why...
Oh why...
Oooh...ahhhh...

(??)I've been told
And baby you left my soul to bleed
High-dee-hoe
And baby you left my soul to bleed

Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why, why, why

Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why, why why
Oh tell me why, why why

Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why
Oh tell me why, why why
Oh tell me why, why why...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
