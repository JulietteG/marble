??(Known...
Known...)??

Heaven bend
To take my hand
And lead me through the fire
Be the long-awaited answer
To a long and painful fight
Truth be told
I've tried my best
But somewhere along the way
I got caught up in all there was to offer
And the cost was so much more
Than I could bear

And though I've tried
I'm fallen
I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
But don't come around here
And tell me I told you so

We all begin
With good intent
When love was raw and young
We believed that we could
Change ourselves
The past can be undone
But we carry on our back
The burden
Time always reveals
In the lonely light of morning
In the wound that would not heal
Is the bitter taste of losing everything
That I've held so dear

I'm fallen
I am sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
So don't come around here
And tell me I told you so
Don't tell me I told you so

Heaven bend
To take my hand
I've nowhere left to turn
I'm lost to those
I thought were friends
To everyone I know
Oh they turn their heads
Embarrassed
Pretend that they don't see
That it's one missed step
One slip before you know it
And there doesn't seem
A way to be redeemed

Though I've tried
I've fallen
I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
So don't come around here
And tell me I told you so

Though I've tried
I'm fallen
I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
So don't come around here
And tell me I told you so
Don't tell me I told you so

I have sunk so low...
Better I should've known...

I have sunk so low...
Better I shouldd've known...

Don't tell me I...
Don't tell me I...
Don't tell me I...
Don't tell me I...
Don't tell me I told you so...

I have sunk so low...
Better I should've known...

I have sunk so low...
Better I should have known...

Don't tell me I told you so...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
