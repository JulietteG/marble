When we were young 
there were always creatures lurking under the bed 
A thousand year old dragon lived deep in the lake 
and he said dont be afraid 
So you dove in 

He seemed so sweet and lovely he made you laugh 
and made you forget about the rain 
Showed you new tricks on guitar 
hidden talents that erases the pain 

And dont you know that theres a wolf stalking in sheeps 
clothing tells me hes the real thing 
Think what your life would be missing 
if you didnt have him to sing 
To sing about 

Three headed monsters they want your money wanna be in the picture be your friend 
They fill your pool with alligators are they all just jokers or are they cruel 

They light up when they see you like theres no where else that theyd rather be than by your side 
Then they promise you the stars but theyre really just along for the ride 

And dont you know that theres a wolf stalking in sheeps 
clothing tells me hes the real thing 
Think what your life would be missing 
if you didnt have him to sing 
To sing about 

Is it the sparkle in their eyes or the knowledge 
of the ways of the world 
The way they kiss the way they hold you has made you 
blind to the fangs and the fire 

Theres a wolf stalking in sheeps 
clothing tells me hes the real thing 
Think what your life would be missing 
if you didnt have him to sing 
To sing about---
