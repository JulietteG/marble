I will be the answer
At the end of the line
I will be there for you
While you take the time
In the burning of uncertainty
I will be your solid ground
I will hold the balance
If you can't look down

And if it takes my whole life
I won't break
I won't bend
It'll all be worth it
(It'll all be worth it)
Worth it in the end
`Cause I can only tell you 
What I know
That I need you in my life
And when the stars
Have all gone out
You'll still be burning so bright

Cast me gently
Into morning
For the night has been unkind
Take me to
A place so holy
That I can wash this from...
The memory
Of choosing not to fight
Choosing not to fight

If it takes a whole life
I won't break
I won't bend
It'll all be worth it
Worth it in the end
`Cause I can only tell you
What I know
That I need you in my life
And when the stars
Have all burned out
You'll still be burning so bright

Cast me gently
Into morning
For the night has been unkind---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
