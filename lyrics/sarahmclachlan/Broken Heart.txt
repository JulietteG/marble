Are we just drops of rain falling for a little while
Playing hard we lose and gain
trying to hold on to what matters

Till the end

I keep walking forward like I know where Im heading
How I wish you were here to see me trying to live up to my name

Till the end

I should be thinking with my head not with my broken heart
Look to the future for all it can give and not to us being apart

We trip and fall and stand again
and go on with our heads held high
We laugh and love as best we can
trying to hold on to the wonder

How long? How long?

I should be thinking with my head
and not with my broken heart
Look to the future for all its got and not to us being apart

Sometimes I feel I cant go on
I let it get me down so hard to heal oh and I fall
Fall to my knees it hurts to survive the love thats gone

But I should be thinking with my head
and not with my broken heart
Look to the future for all its got and not to us being apart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
