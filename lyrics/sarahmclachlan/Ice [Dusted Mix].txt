The ice is thin
Come on
Dive in
Underneath my lucid skin
The cold is lost
Forgotten

Hours pass
Days pass
Time stands still
Light gets dark
And darkness fills
My secret heart
Forbidden

I think you worried
For me then
The subtle way
That I'd give in
But I know
You liked the show

Tied down to this bed of shame
You tried to move around the pain
But oh
Your soul is anchored

The only comfort
Is the moving of the river
You enter into me
A lie upon your lips
Offer what you can
I'll take all that I can get
Only a fool's here

Well I don't like your tragic sighs
As if your God has passed you by
Well hey fool
That's your deception
Your angels speak with jilted tongues
The serpent's tail has come undone
You had no strength to squander

The only comfort
Is the moving of the river
You enter into me
A lie upon your lips
Offer what you can
I'll take all that I can get
Only a fool's here
To stay
Only a fool's here
To stay
Only a fool's here...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
