Loving lying enemy
I have seen your face before
Never thought again I'd see
Didn't want to anymore

I remember your loving eyes
And the moonlit kiss
The evening lullabies I will truly miss
Through the years we had it all
Midnight whispers, the midday calls
This house of cards, it had to fall

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place you can't touch
Don't believe when you tell me your love is real
Because you don't know much about heaven boy
If you have to hurt to feel

Every time I see you
I can't help but look away
All along I had believed everything you'd say
When I look now I know I've seen your face before
Don't want your deceiving smile
Standing at my door
And I don't care what people say
I'm ready now to face this day

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place you can't touch
Don't believe when you tell me your love is real
Because you don't know much about heaven boy
If you have to hurt to feel

Because you don't know much about heaven boy
If you have to hurt

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place you can't touch
Don't believe when you tell me your love is real
Because you don't know much about heaven boy
If you have to hurt to feel---Lyrics submitted by Suzanne.
