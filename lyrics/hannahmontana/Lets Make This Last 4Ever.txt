I need a kick drum
A guitar now
And a bass line
And imma show you how

How to rock
How to dance
How to get down
And all i need is a
Piano in my track now

Throw your hands (X3)
Throw your hands up
(whoa ohoh, whoa ohoh)

Cause you can't (X3)
Cause you can't stop
(Whoa ohoh, Whoa ohoh)

Can you hear me
Do you feel it
If you with me
One-Two-Three

Cause we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So let's make this last forever

Turn the amps on
Turn the lights down
Bu-bu-but push yourself off

Imma show you how
How to rock
How to dance
How to get down
Everybody on the floor now

Throw your hands (X3)
Throw your hands up
(whoa ohoh, whoa ohoh)

Cause you can't (X3)
Cause you can't stop
(Whoa ohoh, Whoa ohoh)

Can you hear me
Do you feel it
If you with me
One-Two-Three

Cause we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So let's make this last forever

Let's make this last forever (X3)

Of all the stars
In the skies at night
You got to ask one thing
Don't shine quite as bright

Throw your hands (X3)
Throw your hands up
(whoa ohoh, whoa ohoh)

Cause you can't (X3)
Cause you can't stop
(Whoa ohoh, Whoa ohoh)

Can you hear me
Do you feel it
If you with me
One-Two-Three

Cause we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So let's make this last forever

Throw your hands (X3)
Throw your hands up
(whoa ohoh, whoa ohoh)

Cause you can't (X3)
Cause you can't stop
(Whoa ohoh, Whoa ohoh)

Can you hear me
Do you feel it
If you with me
One-Two-Three

Cause we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So let's make this last forever

Let's make this last forever (x5)

Cause we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So let's make this last forever---Lyrics submitted by Tyra.
