So I might slip again.
Let it in now & then.
That don't mean anything,
I'm still good.

I look around me
how did I get here?
Not part of my plan.

I ended up in a situation
Wasn't in my hands.
I think about it 
when i wanna give up.

How to keep on going
How to keep my chin up.
Somehow I know it 
I'm not gonna give up.
Never gonna give up!

Chorus

So I might slip again,
Let it in now and then,
That don't mean anything
I'm Still Good.
Trying to be my best,
When I fall its a mess,
pick myself up again,
I'm Still Good.

I'm still good
   (X2)

When days are like that,
And I can shake 'em 
Its weighing on my mind
So I'm just saying 
I'm only human.

Life gets you down sometimes,
I think about it 
When I wanna give up.
How to keep on going 
How to keep my chin up.

Somehow I know it 
I'm not gonna give up,
Never gonna give up.

Repeat Chorus
     (X2)

Life puts up a fight,
With me but I can,
Take on anything,
I'm gonna make it real,
This dream I believe in,

I think about it.
When I wanna give up.
How to keep on going,
How to keep my chin up.
Somehow I know it 
I'm not gonna give up.
Never gonna give up.

Oh Oh Ohaa 

Repeat Chorus
   (X2) 

I'm Still good 
Pick myself up again
I'm Still good,
I'm Still.
I'm still Good---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
