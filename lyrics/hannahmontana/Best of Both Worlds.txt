Oh yea, come on
You get the limo out front, Oooh whoa oh
Hottest styles every shoe every color
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star

Chorus: You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out take it slow
then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds

the best of both woorlds(yea)

You go to movie premieres (Is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on a radioo
Livin' two lives is a little weird (Yea)
the school's cool cuz' nobody knows
Yeah you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitaaar

u get the best of both worlds
chill it out take slow
then u rock out the show
u get the best of both worlds
mix it all together and u know that its the best of both
u know that its the best of both worlds

Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best part is that
You get to be whoever you wanna be
Best! Best!
Yeah the best of both
Best! Best! 
You got the best of both
Best! Best!
Come on the best of both

Who woulda thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstaaaar ?

You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out take it slow
then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best
You get the best of both worlds
without the shades and my hair you can go anywhere
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
Oh Yeah!
It's so much better cuz' you know you got the
Best of Both Worlds---Lyrics submitted by johnathan.
