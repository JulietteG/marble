[Verse 1] 
The weekends almost done 
The moon is low in the sky 
 i feel like going out 
Before the night passes by 
I won't just sit around 
When life becomes a drag 
I dance 

I like the bass (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) 
I like the boom (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) 
I need guitar (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) 
I like that drum when it goes boom boom boom 

[Chorus] 
Let's dance 
What the weekend 
What the night is all about 
Let's dance 
Grab your girlfriends 
Grab your boyfriends 
Sweat it out 
Let's dance 
(Move your whole body) 
(Let's start the party) 
(Speak/rap) 
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy 
I need someone to dance with me baby 
(Dance) 

[Verse 2] 
The musics on (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) 
My favorite song (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) 
The beat is strong (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) 
We'll dance 
Come on 

[Chorus] 
Let's dance 
What the weekend 
What the night is all about 
Let's dance 
Grab your girlfriends 
Grab your boyfriends 
Sweat it out 
Let's dance 
(Move your whole body) 

(Let's start the party) 
(Speak/rap) 
To much rock for one girl can make her go crazy 
I need someone to dance with me baby 
(Dance) 

Keep movin! 

Crank it up! 
Yeah 

[Bridge] 
When the night says hello 
Yeah get ready to go 
Turn it up 
Turn it loose 
Yeah you got no excuse 
Just take a chance 
Get out on the floor and dance 

[Chorus] 
Let's dance 
What the weekend 
What the night is all about 
Let's dance 
Grab your girlfriends 
Grab your boyfriends 
Sweat it out 
Let's dance 
(Let's dance) 
And let's start the party 

[Chorus] 
Let's dance 
What the weekend 
What the night is all about 
Let's dance 
Grab your girlfriends 
Grab your boyfriends 
Sweat it out 
Let's dance 
(Move your whole body) 
(Let's start the party) 
(Speak/rap) 
As soon as my album goes number one 
Mr. Lim I'd like a Rolex with 40 diamonds---Lyrics submitted by Victoria.
