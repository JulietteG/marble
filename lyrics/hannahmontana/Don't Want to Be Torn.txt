Maybe its the things I say,
Maybe I should think before i speak.
But I thought that I knew enough,
To know myself and do what's right for me.
And these walls I'm building now
You use to bring 'em down
The tears i'm crying out,
You use to wipe away!

I thought you said it was easy,
Listening to your heart.
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why I'm I breaking apart.
Don't wanna be torn (x4)

Don't make me have to choose between what I want
And what you think I need.
Cuz i'll always be your little girl
But even little girls have got to dream.
Now it all feels like a fight
You were always on my side,
The lonely I feel now,
You use to make it go away!

I thought you said it was easy,
Listening to your heart.
I thought you said I'd be okay.
So why I'm I breaking apart,
Don't wanna be torn

Why is all this so confusing, 
Complicated and consuming
Why is all this made me angry
I wanna go back to being happy!

The tears I'm crying out,
You use to wipe away.
I thought you said it was easy
listening to your heart.
I thought you said I'd be okay.
So why I'm I breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn,
Dont wanna be torn,
Don't wanna be torn,
Don't wanna be torn,
