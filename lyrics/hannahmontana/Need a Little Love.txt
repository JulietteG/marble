When the darkness leaves you lonely
Or the world tries to push you away
When your sky is looking troubled
You can count on me cause I'm gonna stay

Put your worries in my pocket
I got a key so we can lock it
I swear that I wont let them escape

Love its always worth it
Love everyone deserves it
It's the friend that you holds you're hand
When nobody understands
Love it wants to heal you love
And see the real you
But you have to open up when you need a little love

If there something you're in need of
You only have to let me know
I've got a shoulder you can lean on
And I'm always right up the road

Put your fears in my pocket
I've got a key so we can lock it
You know I wont let them escape

Love its always worth it
Love everyone deserves it
It's the friend that you holds you're hand
When nobody understands
Love it wants to heal you love
And see the real you
But you have to open up when you need a little love

Every night when your heart is praying for peace
From the noise in your head
There's a light that is yours to keep
That's brighter than all the rest

Love its always worth it
Love everyone deserves it
It's the friend that you holds you're hand
When nobody understands
Love it wants to heal you love
And see the real you
But you have to open up when you need a little love
Need a little love
Ohh Yeah
Need a little love ---Lyrics submitted by Caitlyn Aamodt.
