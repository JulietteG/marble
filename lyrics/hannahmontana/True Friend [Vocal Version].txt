I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit is such a crazy time
It's sooner than I thought but you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And
Start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And
Start all over
I'm gonna start all over

Fantastic and romantic
All a big surprise
You've got the warning hasitation pushed aside
It's sooner than I want
But you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start
I'm gonna start all over

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And
Start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And
Start all over
I'm gonna start all over

It's so easy
You disrupt me
Can't complain

It's so easy
You disrupt me
Can't complain

It's so easy
You disrupt me
Can't complain

It's so easy... 

I'm gonna start all over
Start all over

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And
Start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And
Start all over

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And
Start all over
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And
Start all over
I'm gonna start all over---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
