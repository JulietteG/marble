Sha la la la la 
Sha la la la la

You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I love the way you felt so strong
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holding me

{Chorus}

I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shead a tear
every once in awhile
And even though its different now
your still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you

You used to call me your dreamer
and now I'm livin out my dream

Oh how I wish you could see
Everything thats happening for me
I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time is flying by too fast

{Chorus}
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shead a tear
every once in awhile
And even though its different now
your still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you

I know your in a better place (yea)
But I wish that I can see your face (oh)
I know your where you need to be
Even though its not here with me

{Chorus}x2
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shead a tear
every once in awhile
And even though its different now
your still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you

I miss you---Lyrics submitted by dana.
