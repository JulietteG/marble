(L.O.V.E. oh, L.O.V.E... L.O.V.E oh... L.O.V.E)

I see your face, I look in your eyes, 
What you feel is no surprise, 
Everyone needs something to believe in, 
Tell me your dreams and I'll tell you mine, 
In our hearts we'll look inside, 
And see all of the colors of the rainbow, 
I know! 

[Chorus]
We all wanna believe in love, 
We all wanna believe in something, 
Bigger than just us, 
We all want to be a part, 
Of the greater picture, 
That's hangin' in our hearts, 
Yeah it's bigger than us! 

I wanna see beyond my own little world, 
Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy, 
See the world with clarity, 
Oh-oo-oh, 
We have such a long way to go, 
But I know, 
We're getting closer everyday, 
Everyday! 

[Chorus]
We all wanna believe in love, 
We all wanna believe in something, 
Bigger than just us, 
We all want to be a part, 
Of the greater picture, 
That's hangin' in our hearts, 
Yeah bigger than us! 

It fills the universe, 
It lights the skies above, 
It rescues our hearts with love, 

(L.o.v.e, love)with love! (l.o.v.e, love)
That's what's bigger than us! (bigger than us, c'mon)

It's love, it's love, that's bigger than us

It's love, it's love, that's bigger than us
(Whoo! )
It's love, it's love! (it's love, it's love! it's love, it's love! )


We all wanna believe in love, 

We all wanna believe in something, 

Bigger than just us!---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
