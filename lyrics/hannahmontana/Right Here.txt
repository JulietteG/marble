Why would you rather be anywhere else with me?
I tell you man It's all right here
(Whereever we are, where ever we are)
Check out the scenery we've won the lottery
I tell you man it's all right here

And I can't believe you'd even think
Of being any place, Any place
Any place around here
The grass may be green It really is I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there
Whereever you go

(Wherever we are, Wherever we are
Wherever we are, Wherever we are
It's all right here)

[Speak:] Excuse me officer...

If you're smart you know you wanna
Be in the midst of all hot energy
It's all to welcome You,
Time so good,
It's moving way to fast
If we could
I know we'd make it last
It's all here for you
It's all here for you
It's all here for you

It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are.
Wherever we are, wherever we are.)
It's all right here 
(It's all right here
its all right here 
(Wherever we are, Wherever we are)
C'mon
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
C'mon let's go!
(Wherever we are)
It's all right here

Any open road
(Any open road)
Will take us anywhere
As long as I'm with you I won't get where
And we can choose
The desert or the sea
Cuz the good times are in front of you and me! (Me)

Why would you rather be,
Anywhere else with me?
I tell you man,
It's all right here
(Wherever we are, Wherever we are)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
I tell you man,
It's all right here
And I can't believe
You're even saying
Of being any place,
Any place around here
The grass may be green
It really is, I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there
(If you were there)
Wish you were here
You'd wish you were here

And if I could
To make you wanna stay
Just one more day
Maybe everything would be O.K.
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE!
(Wherever we are, wherever we are
Wherever we are, Wherever we are
It's all right here)
It's all right here 
(Wherever we are, wherever we are
wherever we are, wherever we are
It's all right here.)---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
