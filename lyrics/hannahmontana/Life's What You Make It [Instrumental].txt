Don't let no small frustration 
ever bring you down 
No,no,no,no 
just take a situation 
and turn it all around 

with a new attitued ,  evry thing can change 
make it how you want it to be 
stay mad, why do that ? , give your self a break
laugh about it , and u ll' see....  
(chorus)
life's what you make it 
so let's make it rock
life's what you make it ..
 so come on, come on ,come on , evrybody now ..

why be sad broken hearted ?
there's so much to do
life is hard or it's a party
the choice is up to you

with a new attitued evrything can change 
make it how you want it to be 
stay mad , why do that ? give ur self a break 
i know u wanna party with me
 (chorus)
life's what you make it 
so let's make it rock
life's what you make it so come on, come ,come on ,everybody now
let's celebrate it ,join in every one 
u decide  cuz life's what you make it 

things are looking up , any time you want 
all you gotta do is realize that 
it's under ur control
so let the good times rock and roll !!!!!!!!!

c'mon everybody
d..d..d.. do it now
All right let's get the party started
Yeah ,yeah ,yeah , now that's a party 
Yeah , yeah ,put ur hands together

life's what u make it so let's make it rock
life's what you make it so come on , come on, come on , everybody now 
let's celebrate it , join in everyone 
you decide , cuz life's what u make it , AWW YEAH 
life is what you make it .---Lyrics submitted by london.
