Don't call me leave me alone
I'm not gonna answer my phone
Cause i don't 
No i won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
Cause i don't And i won't need you (oh, oh)
Send out a 911
We're gonna have some fun
Hey boy you know you better run

CHORUS
Cuz it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out
Without you
You better hold tight
Cuz girls' nights without you
Let's go GNO
Let's go GNO
Let's go GNO
Let's go
It's a girls' night

I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows what that girl will lead to
You'll hear from everyone
You'll get the 411
Hey boy you knew this day would come

CHORUS
Cuz it's a girls' night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out
Without you
Let's go GNO
Let's go GNO
Let's go GNO
Let's go

Hey boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy
Try to find another girl like me boy
Feel me when I tell ya I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
Hey boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy
Try to find another girl like me boy
Feel me when I tell ya I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line

Cuz it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out
Without you
You better hold tight
Cuz girls' nights without you
Let's go GNO
Let's go GNO
Let's go GNO
Let's go
It's a girls' night---Lyrics submitted by Yobi.
