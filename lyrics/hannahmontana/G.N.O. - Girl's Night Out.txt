[Verse 1]
Don't call me
Leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
Cuz I don't
No I won't see you

I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
Cuz I don't
And I won't need you

Send out a 911
We're gonna have some fun
Hey boy, you know
You better run

[CHORUS]
Cuz it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out without you
You better hold tight
'Cause girl's night is without you
Let's go
G.N.O.
Let's go
G.N.O.
Let's go
G.N.O., let's go
It's a girl's night

[Verse 2]
I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows
What let go will lead to

You'll hear from everyone
You'll get the 411
Hey boy
You knew this day would come

[CHORUS]
Cuz it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out without you
You better hold tight
'Cause girl's night is without you
Let's go
G.N.O.
Let's go
G.N.O.
Let's go
G.N.O., let's go
It's a girl's night

Hey boy
Don't you wish you could have been a good boy
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell ya
I am fine
And it's time for me to draw the line
I said, Hey boy
Don't you wish you could have been a good boy
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell ya
I am fine
And it's time for me to draw the line

[CHORUS]
Cuz it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out without you
You better hold tight
'Cause girl's night is without you
Let's go
G.N.O.
Let's go
G.N.O.
Let's go
G.N.O., let's go
It's a girl's night---Lyrics submitted by sabrina.
