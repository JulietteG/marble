Come on guys tell me what we're doing
We're hangin' around when we could be all over the place
The sun is shinin' just the way we like it
Let's get out of this hallway
Show the world our face

It's Friday but there's nowhere to go
Anywhere is cool but we're not going home
And we can do anything we wanna do
It's all up to me and you

[chorus:]
Turn this park into a club
the stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
Skateboards here's our ride so pull on up everyone is waiting for us

So anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We got the party with us
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We got the party with us

Radio, let me be your DJ
I'll turn you up keep us moving 'til we're on a roll
Everyone is dancing to their own beat
And letting go, everybody here's got soul

It's Friday and there's nowhere to be
We're kickin' it together it's so good to be free
We got each other and that's all we need
The rest is up to you and me

[chorus]

[bridge:]
Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer
That nothing can stand in our way today let's find a place to play

[chorus:]
Turn this park into a club
the stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
These skateboard's here's our ride so pull on up
So pull on up everyone is waiting for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us

Turn this park into a club
the stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
We got the party with us
Skateboards, heels
So pull on up everyone is waiting for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
Oh oh oh
We got the party, we got the party, we got the party, we got the party with us
Oh oh oh oh oh
We got the party with us---Lyrics submitted by alyssa.
