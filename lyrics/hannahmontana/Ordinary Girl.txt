Dont get me wrong, I love who I am, 
I dont want to be ungrateful, it probably sounds strange,
I really love the role I play, the songs I sing,
But with all the fame, the thing that seem so simple,
Are suddenly so far out of reach, wish that they could see that underneath, 

Im just an ordinary girl,

Sometimes Im lazy,
I get bored,
I get scared,
I feel ignored,
I feel happy,
I get silly,
I choke on my own words, 
I make wishes,
I have dreams,
And I still want to believe,
Anything can happen in this world, 
For an ordinary girl,

Like you, like me, for an ordinary girl,
Like you, like me.

How are you, hello goodbye?
What they hear, what they there,
And again, its time to go,
Miss popular always on the role,
Put my best foot forward, got to get on with the show,
Strike a pose, for the front cover of a magazine,
Everywhere I arrive, I get high-fives,
They paint me larger than life,

Im just an ordinary girl,

Sometimes Im lazy,
I get bored,
I get scared,
I feel ignored,
I feel happy,
I get silly,
I choke on my own words, 
I make wishes,
I have dreams,
And I still want to believe,
Anything can happen in this world, 
For an ordinary girl,

So give it everything,
Or nothing at all,
You get back on your feet,
When you stumble and fall,
A little luck can go a long way?
So dont you worry about what people say?
Who knows where the wind may blow,
For an ordinary girl, 


Im just an ordinary girl 

Sometimes Im lazy,
I get bored,
I get scared,
I feel ignored,
I feel happy,
I get silly,
I choke on my own words, 
I make wishes,
I have dreams,
And I still want to believe,
Anything can happen in this world, 
For an ordinary girl,

Like you, like me, for an ordinary girl,
Like you, like me, for an ordinary girl,

mmmmmm..

For an ordinary girl,
Like me, like you.---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
