I lost myself at your show last night,
looking at your sparkling eyes
In the middle of a fresher crowd

You keep living like a movie star
But tell me who you really are
When the lights go down
                        [Bridge]
Baby that's a great guitar on the radio
I've been far on the sterio
You've got me [you've got me coming back for more]
                     [Chorus]
Pop princess hold my hand 
Pop princess
I'm a fan
Pop princess I need you now
Freak me out, turn me upside down
Pop princess make me smile 
Pop princess drive me wild 
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your light off now

You were hiding in a darker stall
Waiting on your curtan call
Getting your peice of mind

But I was looking past the glossy stare
I know who was really there
And I'd like to spend some time

Baby that's a great guitar on the radio
I've been far on the sterio
You've got me [you've got me coming back for more]
                     [Chorus]
Pop princess hold my hand 
Pop princess
I'm a fan
Pop princess I need you now
Freak me out, turn me upside down
Pop princess make me smile 
Pop princess drive me wild 
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your light off now

Baby girl
I think you're radical 
But you're a star
And unfinatical
Can we start something new 
Just between me and you

 [Chorus]
Pop princess hold my hand 
Pop princess
I'm a fan
Pop princess I need you now
Freak me out, turn me upside down
Pop princess make me smile 
Pop princess drive me wild 
Pop princess I need you now
So baby turn your light off now---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
