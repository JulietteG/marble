Hey get up 
Get Loud
Start pumpin up the party now x2

It's the same old, same grind
But we don't feel we're wasting time
Not so bored that we can't find, 
A better way! 
My friends, my kind
No one's gettin' left behind
If they did it'd be a crime
And that's why we say
Let the music start a revolution
No time to play it safe

Hey get up
Get loud 
Start pumpin up the party now x2

They can't, 
We can
Parents might not understand
Havin' fun without a plan
Well that's what we do
We're all here (Let's go! )
Gotta make this party grow
Together we can make it blow
Right through the roof
The music's gonna start a revolution
Too late to play it safe 

Hey get up
Get loud 
Start pumpin up the party now x2

We don't have to paint by my numbers 
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise
Feel the thunder
It's time to lose control 

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x2]
Pumpin' up the party now
Party now, party now 

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x4]
