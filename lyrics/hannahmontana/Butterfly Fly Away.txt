You tucked me in Turned out the light
                       kept me safe and sound at night
                  little girls depend on things like that
                   brushed my teeth and combed my hair
                          had to drive me everywhere
                                 when i looked back 
                              You had to do it all alone 
                             make a living make a home
                     must have been as hard as it could be 
                         And when i couldn't sleep at night
                    Scared things wouldn't turn out right
                   You would hold my hand and sing to me

                                Caterpillar in the tree
                          How you wonder who you'll be
                      Cant go far but you can always dream
                     Wish you may and wish you might
                          Don't you worry, hold on tight
                     I promise you that there will come a day
                                   Butterfly fly away 

                        Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
                     Got your wings now you cant stay
             Take those dreams and make them all come true
                       Butterfly fly away ( butterfly fly away)
                       You've been waiting for this day
                         All along you know just what to do
                         Butterfly, Butterfly, Butterfly
                                  Butterfly fly away
                                  Butterfly fly away
                                  Butterfly fly away---Lyrics submitted by Annalyn Johnson.
