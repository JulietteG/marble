Everybody makes mistakes... 
Everybody has those days... 
{1, 2, 3, 4}

Everybody makes mistakes... 
Everybody has those days... 
Everybody knows what what I'm talkin' 'bout
Everybody get's that way... (that's right)
Everybody makes mistakes... (uh huh) 
Everybody has those days... 
Everybody knows what what I'm talkin' 'bout... 
Everybody get's that way... (yeah)

Sometimes I'm in a jam
I've gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it anyway
No way to know for sure
I'll figure out a cure
I'm catching up the holes
But then it overflows
If I'm not doing to well
Why be so hard on my self? 

[Chorus]
Nobody's Perfect! 
I gotta work it! 
Again and again till I get it right
Nobody's Perfect! 
You live and you learn it! 
And if I mess it up sometimes.
Nobody's perfect... 

Sometimes I work a scheme
But then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned
Gets stuck in quicksand
No problem, can be solved
Once I get involved
I try to be delicate
Then crash right into it
But my intentions are good {yeah yeah yeah}
Sometimes just misunderstood.

Nobody's Perfect! 
I gotta work it! 
Again and again till I get it right
Nobody's Perfect! 
You live and you'll learn it! 
And if I mess it up sometimes... 

Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it! 
I know in time I'll find a way.
Nobody's perfect! 

Sometimes I fix things up
And they fall apart again.
{Nobody's perfect}
I know I mix things up
But I always get it right in the end.
{you know I do}

[Talking]
Next time you feel like it's just one of those days
When you just can't seem to win
If things don't turn out the way you planned, 
Figure something else out 
Don't stay down! Try again! {yeah}

[Singing]
Everybody makes mistakes... 
Everybody has those days... (that's right) 
Everybody knows what what I'm talkin' about... 
Everybody get's that way... 
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days.
Everybody knows what what I'm talkin' about... 
Everybody gets that way

[Chorus]
Nobody's Perfect! 
I gotta work it! 
Again and again til I get it right
Nobody's Perfect! 
You'll live and you'll learn it! 
And if I mess it up sometimes... 
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
I know that I'll find a way(whoa)
Nobody's perfect
You'll live and you'll learn it
Cause everybody makes mistakes

Nobody's Perfect
Nobody's perfect, no no
