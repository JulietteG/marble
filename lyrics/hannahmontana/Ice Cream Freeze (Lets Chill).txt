Alright, here we go
Follow me now

Hit it
Everybody do your dance
Aint nothing better than an all night jam (Oh! ha)
Are you ready for a little something new tonight (Oh yeah!)

I got a brand new stepping thing you are gonna like
Come on boys
Gotta do like I do
Just follow my lead
Everybody lets chill
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Can you do the milkshake

Shake it shake it down low
Can you snow cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We could party all night
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Can you do the milkshake
Shake it shake it down low
Can you snow cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We could party all night
Shake it shake it shake it shake it Shake it down low
Then do the ice cream freeze
All kind of stepping make you feel good (make you feel real good)
Triple step, butterfly, sugar foot (sugar sugar foot)
But, Im coming with a new thing.
What you need? (Thats right!)

Now everybody want to do the ice cream freeze (Whoohoo)
Come on boys
Gotta do like I do
Just follow my lead
Everybody lets chill
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide left to right

Put your hands in the air
We could party all night
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We could party all night (party all night)
Did I hear anyone say party? (party)
Were just getting started (woo!)
Wanna take it from the top
Will you know I will
Now everybody lets chill
Light, camera, freeze

Everybody lets go!
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide left to right
Put your hands in the air
We could party all night
Do the ice cream freeze (hooo)
Strike your pose
Then you do the milkshake
Shake it shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide left to right

Put your hands in the air
We could party all night
(Do the ice cream freeze) Do the ice cream freeze
(Do the ice cream freeze) Then you do the milkshake
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it
(Do the snow cone slide) Do the snow cone slide
Put your hands in the air
Go Crazy
Everybody lets chill---Lyrics submitted by arkiany.
