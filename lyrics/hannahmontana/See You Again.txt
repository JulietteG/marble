i got my sights set on you and i'm ready to aim
i have a heart that will never be tamed
i knew you were somethin' special when you spoke my name
now i can't wait to see you again

i've got a way of knowin' when somehin' is right
i feel like i must have known you in another life
'cause i felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
now i can't wait to see you again

the last time i freaked out i just kept looking down
i st-st-stuttered when you asked me what i'm thinkin' 'bout
felt like i couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
my best friend lesley said 'oh she's just being miley'
the next time we hang out i will redeem myself
my heart it can't rest 'till then
ooh, whoa, whoa i, i can't wait to see you again

i got this crazy feelin' deep inside
when you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
i'm not a mind reader but i'm readin' the signs
that you can't wait to see me again

the last time i freaked out i just kept looking down
i st-st-stuttered when you asked me what i'm thinkin' 'bout
felt like i couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
my best friend lesley said 'oh she's just being miley'
the next time we hang out i will redeem myself
my heart it can't rest 'till then
ooh, whoa, whoa i, i can't wait to see you again

i got my sights set on you and i'm ready to aim

the last time i freaked out, i just kept looking down
i st-st-stuttered when you asked me what i'm thinkin' 'bout
felt like i couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
my best friend lesley said 'oh she's just being miley'

the next time we hang out i will redeem myself
my heart it can't rest 'till then
ooh, whoa, whoa i, i can't wait to see you again
ooh, whoa, whoa i, i can't wait to see you again---Lyrics submitted by ella.
