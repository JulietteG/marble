Maybe it's the things i say
Maybe i should think before i speak
But i thought that i knew enough 
To know myself and do what's right for me

And these walls i'm building now 
You use to bring 'em down
And these tears i'm crying now
You used to wipe away

[Chorus]
I thought you said it was easy
Listening to your heart 
I thought you said i'd be okay
So why am i breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn Don't wanna be torn

Don't make me have to choose between what i want and what you think i need
Cause i'll always be your little girl
But even little girls have got to dream 

Now it all feels like a fight 
You were always on my side
The lonely i feel now
You use to make it go away

[Chorus]
I thought you said it was easy
Listening to your heart 
I thought you said i'd be okay
So why am i breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn 

Why is all this so confusing
Complicated and consuming
Why is all this made me angry
I wanna go back to being happy

[Instrumental]

These tears i'm crying out
You used to wipe away

[Chorus]
I thought you said it was easy
Listening to your heart 
I thought you said i'd be okay
So why am i breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn Don't wanna be torn---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
