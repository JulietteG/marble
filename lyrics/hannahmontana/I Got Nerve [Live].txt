We haven't met, and that's okay
'Cause you will be asking for me one day

Don't want to wait in line
The moment is mine believe me

Don't close your eyes
Cause it's a chance worth takin
And I think that I can show you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve! 

Electrified, I'm on a wire
Gettin' together and we're on fire
What I said, you heard
Now I've got you spinning

Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
I know what you like, 
I know what you think, 
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's Everything I see, 
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

You... You need to discover
You make me feel free
And I, I need to uncover, 
The that's reaching out for me 
Hey hey hey! 

I know where I stand
