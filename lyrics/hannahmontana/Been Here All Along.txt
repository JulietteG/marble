Mmmmmmmmmmm yeah
Sunrise and I lifted my head
then i smiled at your picture
sitting next to my bed
sunset and your feeling ok
cuz you smile at the letter that i sent you to today

And I, can't wait till i see you again
and we both say remember when
The band played on the 4th of July
And you held me on your shoulders
way up high

[Chorus]
Your still there for me
wherever there might be
and if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you will listen
to my song 

Your with me
you've been here all along
You've been here all along


Back then you walked me to school
Told me to be careful and to follow the rules
Fast forward you taught me to drive,
you gave me the keys and we went for a ride

And I can't waut till i see you again
And we both say remember when
I'm holding on to moments like that
And I know that your coming back

[Chorus]
Your still there for me
Wherever there might be
and if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight
knowing it's alright
I believe that you will listen to my song

Your with me
You've been here all along


yeahh....

All along the way I keep you in my heart
and in my breath
You'll always be the one who cares the most

Counting on the day 
I see you running up
then say I miss you
I miss you

Your still there for me
Wherever there might be

And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you will listen to my song

Your still there for me
wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep at night
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you will listen to my song

Your with me
Cuz your with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along---Lyrics submitted by Breanne.
