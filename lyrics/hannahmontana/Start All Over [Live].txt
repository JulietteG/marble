I have to wonder if this waves to big to ride 
commit or not commit in such a crazy time
its sooner than i thought but you called me out
i lost control and there's no doubt

im gonna start all over 
out of the fire into the fire again
you make me want to forget 
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind or worse
another chance to get burned 
and start all over
im gonna start all over

fantastic and romantic
all a big suprise 
you've got the warning 
hesataion pushed aside
yet sooner than i want but you
caught my heart
i guess i'm ready now to start

i'm gonna start all over
out of the fire and into the fire again 
you make me want to forget
an start all over
here i come straight out of my mind and worse
another chance to get bured
and start all
i'm gonna start all over

its so easy you distruped me can't complain
its so easy you distruped me can't complain
its easy you distuped me can't complain
its so easy

i'm gonna start all over
out of the fire and into the fire again
you make me want to forget
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind and worse
another chance to get burned

and start all over
out of the fire and into the fire again 
you make me want to forget 
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind and worse
another chance to get burned 
and start all over
i'm gonna start all over!!---Lyrics submitted by elizabeth.
