Oh-Ooh
I feel like I'm a million miles away,
From myself.
More and more these days, I've been down.
So many open roads,but they never lead me home
And I just don't know where my brain went

Who I really am, How it's gonna be
Is there something that I can't see
I wanna understand!

Maybe I will never be
Who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Maybe who I am today
Ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be
Every part of me.

So I'll try
Try to slow things down
And find myself
Get my feet back on the ground
It'll take time,
But I know I'll be alright 
Cuz nothing much has changed
On the inside

It's hard to figure out
How It's  gonna be
Cuz I don't really know now
I wanna understand!

Maybe I will never be
Who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Maybe who I am today
Ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be
Every part of me 

I don't wanna wait 
Too long
To find out where I'm meant to belong
I've always wanted to be where I am today
But I never thought i'd feel this way

Maybe i will never be 
Who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Maybe who I am today
Ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be 
Every part of me
Every part of me---Lyrics submitted by lauren.
