Whoa!

[Verse 1:]
You wake up. It's raining and it's Monday.
Looks like one of those rough days. Time's up!
You're late again so get out the door (get out the door).
Sometimes you feel like runnin'.
Find a whole new life and jump in.
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor.
When the lights go down, it's the ending of the show!
And you're feeling like you got nowhere to go.
Don't you know?

[Chorus:]
You can change your hair,
And you can change your clothes.
You can change your mind,
That's just the way it goes.
You can say goodbye and you can say hello.
But you'll always find your way back home.
You can change your style,
You can change your jeans.
You can learn to fly,
And you can chase your dreams.
You can laugh and cry,
But everybody knows.
You'll always find your way back home.

Huh!

[Verse 2:]
Your best friends
Your little hometown.
Waiting up wherever you go now (mmm)
You know that you can't always turn around (turn around)
Cause this world is big and it's crazy (it's crazy)
This girl is thinking a maybe.
This life is what some people dream about (dream about)
Cause when I'm feeling down and I'm all alone (one-one)
I always got a place where I can go.
'Cause I know.

[Chorus]

Yeah they know exactly who you are (are)
Where the real you is a superstar (star)
You know it's never too far away.

You can change your hair,
You can change your clothes.
You can change your mind
That's just the way it goes.
You can say goodbye and you can say hello.
But you'll always find your way back

You can change your hair,
You can change your clothes.
You can change your mind
That's just the way it goes.
You can say goodbye and you can say hello.
But you'll always find your way back home.

You can change your style,
You can change your jeans.
You can learn to fly,
You can chase your dreams,
You can laugh and cry.
But everybody knows.
You'll always find your way back home.

You'll always find your way back home.
You'll always find your way back home.
You'll always find your way back home.
You'll always find your way back home.

You'll always
You'll always find your way.
You'll always find your way (back home) back home. ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha Neil.
