Looks like we found ourselves 
Up against a wall 
In need of a little help 
But no one wants to call 
After all weve been through 
Do we let our friendship end 

You need me and i need you 
No, we will not break 
Never break 
But even if we bend, 

Yea it's 
YOU AND ME TOGETHER [together, together, together] 
Yea IM ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side] 
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT 
CMON LET EM TRY [let em try] 
CAUSE ITS YOU AND ME TOGETHER NOW 

Anyone can have a day 
When their heart is on their sleeve 
No one wants to see it our way 
Cant agree to disagree 
Youd think itd be easier 
But it feels like you just cant win 
But somehow well make it work 
Cause we deserve it- you know were worth it 
You cant give up on friends 

Cuz it's 
YOU AND ME TOGETHER [together, together, together] 
Yea IM ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side, oh] 
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT 
CMON LET EM TRY [c'mon let em try] 
CAUSE ITS YOU [it's you] AND ME TOGETHER NOW 

TOGETHER NOW 
oh, now, now, now 


it's 
YOU AND ME TOGETHER [together, together] 
Yea IM ALWAYS [i'm always] ON YOUR SIDE [on your side] 
oh, woah 
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT 
CMON LET EM TRY 
c'mon let em try 

it's 
YOU [it's you] AND ME [and me] TOGETHER [together, together] 
Yea IM ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side, i'm on your side] 
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT 
CMON LET EM TRY 
[c'mon let em try] 
cuz it's you and me together now 
together now, now 
together now, now---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
