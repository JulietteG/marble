Smooth talkin
So rockin
He's got everthing that a girl's wantin
Guitar cutie
He plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself from doing somthin stupid
I think i'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name

He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe somethin been telling me, 
telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one,he could be the one
oh oh oh oh,he could be the one,he could be the one, be the 
oh oh oh oh

He's lightning 
Sparks are flyin 
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and
I'm going crazy about him lately 
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing
Think I'm really diggin on his vibe
He really blows me away

He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me I want to get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe something's been telling me, 
telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one,he could be the one,be the
oh oh oh oh,he could be the one
He could be the one oh oh oh oh

And he's got a way 
Of making me feel 
Like everything I do is
Perfectly fine
The stars are alined when I'm with him
And I'm so into him...

He's got something special(somethin)
He's got somehting special(somethin)
And when he's looking at me I want to get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe something's been telling me, 
telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one,he could be the one 
oh oh oh oh,he could be the one,he could be the one, be the3
oh oh oh oh,he could be the one oh oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
