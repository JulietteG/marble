Well I'm looking out at an overcast sky in the morning
I can hear the warning as it calls to you
As the birds migrate and the wind is raised
I see the eagle soaring
Although I'm just a pawn in nature's game like you
Wah hoo wah hoo, wah hoo ...

[Chorus]

On the wings of an eagle I find myself lifted through the skies
Lifted up above the world to see
On the wings of an eagle I find myself lifted through the skies
Lifted up above the world to see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

As the days roll on and the nights get long
The changing of the seasons
The falling autumn leaves they bring me down
They bring me down, they bring me down

[Instrumental]

Do you lose your way in the middle of the day
Do you see your brother crawling?
And all the while he's calling out for help from you
Wah hoo wah hoo, wah hoo ...

On the wings of an eagle I find myself lifted through the skies
Lifted up above the world to see
On the wings of an eagle I find myself lifted through the skies
Lifted up above the world to see

Can you see me? Can you see me?
Can you see me? Can you see me?

Can you see me? Can you see me?
Can you see me? Can you see me?---Lyrics submitted by MARK.
