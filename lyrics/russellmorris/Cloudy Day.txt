Another Cloudy Day
I like The rythmn of the falling rain
I was so lonely long before you came
You and I together on a cloudy day

You know when the sky is so low
That you can reach out and touch it with your hands
It's then when you tell me again
That you will always be there when you can

Everyone knows that it's something
That they just don't understand
Love has this feeling that makes you wanna
Go and give more than you can
Giving so much more than you have

Another Cloudy Day
I like the rythmn of the falling rain
I was so lonely long before you came
You and I together on a cloudy day
You and I together on a cloudy day
You and I together on a cloudy day---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
