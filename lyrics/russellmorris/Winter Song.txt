As another day begins 
I think of you my dear friend
I wish you were her again
Though Dreams have to end
And somewhere in my life
I gave you shelter from your storm
I tried to keep you warm
So you would stay on........
Do, do, do, do, do, do......

The weather now is colder 
Than it was when you were near
The leaves have disappeared
And snow cools the air
And I know that I will think of you
Wherever you may be
Do you think of me
Oh do you think of me
Do, do, do, do, do, do......
Do, do, do, do, do, do......---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
