[Hook:] 
If I Dont Nuthin Imma Ball 
Im Countin All Day Like A Clock On The Wall 
Now Go And Get Your Money Little Duffle Bag Boy

Look Honey I Aint Never Ran From A Nigga And I

[Verse 1:]
Tha Beat So Hot Tha Flow Is So Ice Cold 
Walkin To The Gucci Store Honey I'm Home 
I Am On My Shit I Need A Pamper On 
Toilet Paper On The Side For Example Hommie 
I... Get... Money 
I Know You Niggas Aint Heard No Shit Like This And 
While You Wishing On That Fallin Star I'm In A Foreign Car 
Smoking Out With The Doors Ajar 
Suede Sun Roof Hangin Out The Big Top 
We Leave The Dealership Head To The Rim Shop 
You Niggaz Bearly Dressin I Got Thousands Piling 
Thats That Salad Dressin Im On My Thousand Island 
Wildin... Stylin... I Be I Get So Much Money Its My I.D 
Dont Try Me And If I Dont Do Nuthin Ima Fuckin Ball 
And I Aint Bout To Start Runnin Nawl Nigga Nawl 

[Hook:] 
If I Dont Nuthin Imma Ball 
Im Countin All Day Like A Clock On The Wall 
Now Go And Get Your Money Little Duffle Bag Boy 
Said Go And Get Your Money Little Duffle Bag Boy Get Money 
And I Aint Ever Ran From A Nigga And I 
Damn Sho Aint Bout To Pick Today To Start Runnin 
Look Honey I Say I Aint Never Ran From A Nigga And I 
Damn Sho Aint Bout To Pick Today To Start Runnin Get Money 

[Verse 2:]
Aint Nuthin To A Boss We Ballin When You See Us 
We Hear Them Hataz Callin They Too Far Off To See Us 
Unless They Got They Glasses On Get Your Bifocal Game 
Class Is Now In Session Now Try To Stay Focus Mane 
Your Boy Aint Good Enough Style Aint Hood Enough 
Would've Could've Should've Wont Do With Us True Enough 
Need A Hoe Break A Hoe Never Nuthin New To Us 
Turnin Hoes To House Wives Never Been Cool With Us 
Soon Enough All These Dealers Are Gonna Catch Up 
Till Then Fuck It I'm Winnin So Ima Stack Up 
Flows Like A River Tha Current Is So Rapid 
Hit With The Wrachet Thats How Shit Happens 
Next Time You're Yappin Make Sure It Be About That Big Money Talk 
Let That Lil Money Walk Call Me What You Want But Dont Call Me For Front 
Southside I Got Wut U Want Come Holla At Me
