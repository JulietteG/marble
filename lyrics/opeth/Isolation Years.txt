there's a sense of longing in me
as Ive reed rosemary's letter
the writing is honest
can't forget her
the years she's lost

when I saw rasure
tossed about her room
and as I read her dying mood
I know she did

there's a sinners details in here
and the pain must have made you decide
and left us think
next to his name
she knows he's gone
in isolation
a song that would remain
a hole in me
is poring out to rest
another shore---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
