In the corner, beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason I'd never notice
 a memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know, you'll never return to this place

Gone through days, without talking
There is a comfort in silence
So used to losing all ambition
And struggling to maintain what's left

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know, you'll never return to this place

And once undone, there is only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up what really happened
And force the darkness unto me

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know, you'll never return to this place---Lyrics submitted by bob.
