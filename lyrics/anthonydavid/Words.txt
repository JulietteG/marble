i believe that, heaven must be like this
ray of sunshine, kiss upon your skin
just say you love me, make my day go good
pot of gold at the, end of the rainbow

(chorus)

can't tell you nothin you ain't already heard
no matter what i say its nothin but words
just let me prove to you what i know is real
let me express to you the way that i feel

i believe that love is, synonymous with heaven;
such a sensual bliss, the way you touch me
makes this life so good, a reward at the;
end of the long road

(chorus)

can't tell you nothin you ain't already heard
no matter what i say its nothin but words
just let me prove to you what i know is real
let me express to you the way that i feel

2x
ahhhhhhhh
hhhhhhhhh
hhhhhhhhh

2x
ahhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhh

fairytales can be, real if you'll just believe
got my mind made, i don't plan to leave;
cause you were meant for me, simple that may be;
why be complex, loving you is so easy

(chorus out 3x)

can't tell you nothin you ain't already heard
no matter what i say its nothin but words
just let me prove to you what i know is real
let me express to you the way that i feel---Lyrics submitted by tommy.
