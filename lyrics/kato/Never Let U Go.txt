Oh oh oh oh
Never let em
Never, never let em go

Baby, I dont have all the right words to say
So if I come off crazy
Thats just a chance I gotta take
But baby now Ive got you here
Gonna make it last forever, yeah
I dont care whos watching, let em stare
Tell me what you like, Ill take you there

Can you feel it?
Gonna let you know
That I feel it
Its time to let it show
It drives me crazy whenever youre around
Let me hold you down

And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Its you and me against the world
And I will never let you go

Come and smoke with me and let your hair hang down
Have a shot and see if you can drink that down
Come and sleep with me and creep around this town
Be in ecstasy cause Ill be showin you how
This is all I do, I make the things drop down
And once you pick it up, Ill make you say wow wow
Do it secretly, so we love profound
Like (?) yep yep that doggy style

Can you feel it?
Gonna let you know
That I feel it
Its time to let it show
It drives me crazy whenever youre around
Let me hold you down

And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Its you and me against the world
And I will never let you go

So stick around, you can count on me baby, Im down on my knees
And I will be there girl I swear Im giving you all that you need
So tell me, are you down, down?
Are you down, down?
Cause its already a quarter to three
And all we got is right now (only right now)
And I wont stop till youre all over me

And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Its you and me against the world
And I will never let you go

And I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Its you and me against the world
And I will never let you go---
