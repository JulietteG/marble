[Chorus]
Africa has the shape of a broken heart
And the heart of a broken land,

You fell from heaven
Straight to hell,
Now your children are missing

[Verse 1]
I try to understand
Who I am
Years after years
God, it feels the same

Parted favors
Everybody's gone
Ain't no war that I know
Anybody won

[Chorus]
Africa has the shape of a broken heart
And the heart of a broken land,

You fell from heaven
Straight to hell,
Now your children are missing

[Verse 2]
Kiss their forehead
And hold their hands
Close their eyes
And put their name on their graves

Dust is dust
And so goes our faith
So goes our faith

[Chorus]
Africa has the shape of a broken heart
And the heart of a broken land,

Fell from heaven
Straight to hell,
Now your children are missing

[Verse 3]
And the wind blows,
And the children roam
Sitting on a side of a road
Watching all the boats, ooh

[Chorus]
Africa has the shape of a broken heart
And the Heart of a broken land,

You fell from heaven
Straight to hell,
And now your children are missing

[Outro]
Now I understand
Who I am, who I am, who I am

Tell me how,
Tell me how,
Tell me how,
I can accept the thing
Things that I cant change
Except the things that I can change ---Lyrics submitted by emily ch.
