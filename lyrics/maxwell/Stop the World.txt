VERSE1
someone stop the world yea
seem like the moment is coming i am going get you girl,
shadows are falling across your part the vision looks absurd yea
no one around to interrupt the feeling you start baby  oh

CHORUS
image if this was, if this was you, here this was i 
so perfectly designed, to be here all night
let the world rage outside,cause when i'm here with you 
the world stop for me ,the world stop for me 

VERSE2
and then the extraordinary ordinary things, 
things i can't explain with subtext: the word stops for me 
and girl you know just what i mean, i need you girl 
sing me a song, sing it soft, sing it long, girl stop my world  oh

CHORUS
image if it was, if this was you, here this was i
so perfectly designed, to be here all night
let the world rage outside, cause when i'm here with you
the world stop for me, the world stop for me 

BRIDGE
someone stop the world stop it stop it stop  oh
someone someone stop the world stop the world
we about the stop the world tonight, 
we about to love we aint got no worry no battle 
cause i am going to be with my girl tonight 
we about to stop the world stop the world stop the world 
we about to stop the world tonight 
we about to love we aint got no worry no battle yea 
you are my own yea
we about to stop the world tonight
make your self at home 
i'm going be with my girl tonight
and lay here all night long 
we about to stop the world tonight   oh yea---Lyrics submitted by ronelle.
