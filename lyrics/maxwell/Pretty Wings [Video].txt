Time will bring the real end of our trial 
One day there'll be no remnants no trace 
No residual feelings within ya 
One day you won't remember me. 

Your face will be the reason I smile 
But I will not see what I cannot have forever 
I'll always love ya 
I hope you feel the same. 

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad 
You toyed with my affliction 
Had to fill out my prescription 
Found the remedy 
I had to set you free. 

Away from me 
To see clearly 
The way that love can be when you are not with me 
I had to leave 
I had to live 
I had to lead 
I had to leave....... 

If I can't have you 
Let love set you free 
To fly your pretty wings around. 

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your 
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around. 

I came wrong you were right 
Transformed your love into a lie 
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies 

I turned day into night 
Sleep till I die a thousand times 
I should have showed you better nights, better times, better days 
And I miss you more and more 

If I can't have you 
Let love set you free 
To fly your pretty wings around 

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your 
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around 

So Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your 
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around 

Say Pretty wings, pretty wings, 
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around 

Darlin,Darlin, Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your 
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around 

Pretty , Pretty , Pretty 
Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your 
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around 

Someone better is gonna love you 
Someone, Someone is gonna love you baby 

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your 
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Omariie.
