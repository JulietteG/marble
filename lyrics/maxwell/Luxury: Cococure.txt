Took a high from a low
Took my icy freeze and thawed the cold
An inspired undisclosed
It's a privacy that y'all should know
Never wonder cause I know
Ain't no other got this flow
Lady lover, lady soul
You're my discovered pot of gold

[1] - I found a cure for this
Cococure for this
It's got me plushed on some luxurious
Cococure

It's a happy in a sad
It's a more that's less
It's a glad, drive me crazy (ooh baby)
You're my mommy, you're my dad
Lady lover never go
You're the part of my heart that is soul

[Repeat 1]---Lyrics submitted by rae.
