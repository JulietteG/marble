Haven't you heard.
I'm stuck on a verse.
I'm stuck on a boy who fills me with joy.
I knew I was wrong to
Jump straight on into this picture so pretty,
But he is so pretty to me.

And he doesn't know just how far I would go,
Just to kiss him, 
He doesn't know how i Pinde.

So I'm like a whirlpool.
and I watch him sparkle.
And we'll make, love make magic.

Haven't you heard before i had first.
and he loves me so, we're two in a row.
Just  look at his eyes, there as blue as the skys,
a picture so pretty, 
but he is so pretty to me.

So i'm like a whirlpool.
and I watch him sparkle,
And we'll make, love make magic.

And i couldn't tell you.
Just tell love it takes you.
Because word dont make, what i make,
with him.

Haven't you heard, 
i'm stuck on a verse.
I'm stuck on a boy, who fills me with joy.
I knew i was wrong, to jump staight on into, 
this picture so pretty, 
but he is so pretty to me.---Lyrics submitted by mollie.
