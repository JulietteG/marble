Whooaaaa...
Whooaaaa...

Another sleepless niightt,
I'm still starin' at the ceilin'
I can hear him fightin'
With her for no good reason.
Will this ever end,
Will this house be a home again.
If I had my way,
I'd corner him and say :

Put yourself in her positon
All she needs if recognition,
Loves not enough when you say it,
Don't you know,
You've got to mean it.
Screwin' up,
The best thing ever,
Its somethin' you'll regret forever,

Another day goes by and,
Nothin' changed shes still the same.
I can hear her cryin'
Thinkin' she's the one to blame,
Will this ever end
Will this house be a home again. ?
If I had my way
I'd corner him and say :

Put yourself in her position
All she needs is recognition,
Loves not enough when you say it,
Don't you know,
You've got to mean it,
Screwin' up the best thing ever,
Somethin' you'll regret forever,
Take her and make sure she feels it,
Let her know,
And never let her go....

(Instermental)

Screwin' up the best thing ever,
Its somethin' you'll regret forever,

Another sleepless night and,
Nothin changed, 
She's still the same
Another stupid fight
And someone's gotta say :

Put yourself in her position,
All she needs is recognition,
Loves not enough when you say it,
Don't you know
You've gotta mean it
Screwin' up the best thing ever
Somethin' you'd regret forever,
Take her and make sure she feels it,
Let her know,
And never let her go.
And never let her go,
No No No
Put yourself in her position
All she needs is recognition
Take her and make sure she feels it,
Let her know 
And never let her go---Lyrics submitted by Shai.
