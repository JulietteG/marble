Pumpin on my sleeve
Heart that barely beats stallin'
uh oh
floating facing down 
sea of broken vows
drownin'
uh oh

Bridge:
Blow after blow and I'm starting to see why
better alone than be bruised by your dark side
Down to the bone your the knife that'll cut right through

Chorus:
Sex and love dont feel the way I do X2
 from you

Verse 2:
Slowly for affect
morning make-out sex is hallow
uh oh
burnin' to the ground
House that used to stand so solid

uhoh

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
