Saw you walk into the room
Thought I'd try to talk to you
Babe am I ever glad you wanted me too
It's been two years to the day
Half the time I've been away
I know I'm not there enough
but that's gonna change
Cause I'm coming back to show you that I'm keeping the promise I made

(Chorus)
When I'm with you
I'll make every second count
Cause I miss you
Whenever you're not around
When I kiss you
I still get butterflies years from now
I'll make every second count when I'm with you

Yeah, we've had our ups and downs
But we've always worked them out
Babe am I ever glad we've got this far now
Still I'm lying here tonight
wishing I was by your side
Cause when I'm not there enough
Nothing feels right
So I'm coming back to show you that
I'll love you the rest of my life

(Chorus)

Whatever it takes I'm not gonna break the promise that I made
When I'm with you
I'll make every second count
cause I miss you

When I'm with you
I'll make every second count
cause I miss you
Whenever you're not around
When I kiss you
I still get butterflies years from now
I'll make every second count
(make every second count)
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Katilyn.
