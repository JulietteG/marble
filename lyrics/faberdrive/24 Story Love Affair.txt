When I met you
You told me
To forget you
Your way out of my league
But it happened
Couldn't I see
A disaster was ready to be unleashed

Tryin' to climb the ladder but I'm handcuffed to the bottom,
Need to use the keys but you're the only one who's got 'em

I know the end is comin',
I should have started runnin',
24 story love affair

With me down here and you up there
I know it's all but over
I wish that last kiss would've lasted longer
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there
With me down here and you up there

You were towering
Above me
Started climbing
And never thought it through
But you warned me
Should've listened
Now I'm sorry
I ever met you too

Tryin' to climb the ladder but I'm handcuffed to the bottom,
Need to use the keys but you're the only one who's got 'em

I know the end is comin',
I should have started runnin',
24 story love affair

With me down here and you up there
I know it's all but over
I wish that last kiss would've lasted longer
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there

I know the end is coming
So scared of heights it numbing
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there
With me down here and you up there

I know the end is comin'
So scared of heights its numbing
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there

I know it's all but over
I wish that last kiss would've lasted longer
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there
24 story love affair
With me down here and you up there
