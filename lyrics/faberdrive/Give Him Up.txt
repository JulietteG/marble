She's crying, on the phone
Every day, it's the same
But she'll never know
He's lying,
He's not alone,
At the bar,
Grinding hard, 
With another ho.

So wasted,
He stumbles in,
Throws the keys on the couch,
Acting innocent,
She won't ask where he's been,
Just wants a kiss from his lips,
Cause she misses him.

All this time,
It kills me.

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat,
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink.
She doesn't see that she should be with me.

She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him...
G-g-g-give him up.

He wakes up,
To go to work,
Takes his keys, his CD's,
And a Gucci shirt.
He's practiced, and well rehearsed,
Every line, by design,
In the mirror first.
She's dressed up,
It's Friday night,
Sitting home, all alone,
Hoping he's alright,
He calls her,
He's working late,
She never thought
That he's got another dirty date.

All this time,
All this time,
It kills me.

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat,
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink.
She doesn't see that she should be with me.

She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him...
G-g-g-give him up.

They say, come what may,
But I can't seem to get you off my mind,
They say, come what may,
But I can't let you fall for every line,
They say, come what may,
But I can't watch while you forgive him,

Every time,
Every time,

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat,
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink.
She doesn't see that she should be with me.

She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat,
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink.
She doesn't see that she should be with me.

She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him...
G-g-g-give him up.---Lyrics submitted by Ellie.
