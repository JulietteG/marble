Come on and move your body
Move your body, body
Come on now, everybody
Everybody, move your body

[x2]
No, nobody stop
Everybody move
Get up and dance, g-get up and dance
Move your body, b-b-body

It's going down tonight, the ladies looking right
Dressed up with fancy shoes, tight jeans and sweet perfume
The line's around the block but we just walk right up
We're here to make a scene cause we're living the dream
Tonight, we're gonna do it right so

[x2]
No, nobody stop
Everybody move
Get up and dance, g-get up and dance
Move your body, b-b-body

Come on and move your body
Move your body, body

We're lining up for shots for every friend we've got
Let's down a couple more before we hit the floor 
And when they stop the beat, we'll take it to the street
Ah, here's my limousine, who's coming home with me tonight?
Tonight we're gonna do it right so

[x2]
No, nobody stop
Everybody move
Get up and dance, g-get up and dance
Move your body, b-b-body

Hey, yeah, caught in the moment
You can't control it
Hey, yeah, this is your chance now
Get up and dance now!
Dance now (Everybody)
Dance now (Move your body now)

It's going down tonight, a thousand flashing lights
We're here to make a scene cause we're living the dream
Yeah!

[x2]
No, nobody stop
Everybody move
Get up and dance, g-get up and dance
Move your body, b-b-body

(Move your body)
Caught in the moment (Move your body, b-b-body)
You can't control it (No stopping tonight)
This is your chance now (Tonight, we're gonna do it right)
Dance now, dance now
Get, get up and dance now, dance now

Come on and move your body
Move your body, body
Come on now, everybody
Everybody, move your body---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
