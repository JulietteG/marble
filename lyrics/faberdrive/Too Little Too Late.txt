I planned it out perfect, practiced and rehearsed it
I could see it every time I closed my eyes
Destine to make it, so close I could taste it
Only waiting for the planets to allign

Walking in to take it all
But then I slip and fall

I'm at the right place, but at the wrong time
I had my one shot but forgot the line
I'm always stuck in second place
But I know one day I'm gonna win this race
I'm on the right track, but took a wrong turn
I made a sure bet, and I still got burnt
But I'm about to catch a break
So don't say it's too little too late

Don't say it, don't say it
Don't say it's too little too late

Watching and waiting, but losing my patience
So I step outside to try and clear my mind
I stare at the sunset, and suddenly get it
All I have to do is make it mine

Walking in to take it all
But then I slip and fall

I'm at the right place, but at the wrong time
I had my one shot but forgot the line
I'm always stuck in second place
But I know one day I'm gonna win this race
I'm on the right track, but took a wrong turn
I made a sure bet, and I still got burnt
But I'm about to catch a break
So don't say it's too little too late

And I know I got a long, long way to go
Yeah I know I gotta make it on my own
I gotta stand up for myself
And when I'm falling, gonna get up off the ground
Every minute, every hour of every day
I can make it, yeah I'm gonna find a way
Yeah I'm gonna find a way

I'm at the right place, but at the wrong time
I had my one shot but forgot the line
I'm always stuck in second place
But I'm gonna win this race
I'm on the right track, but took a wrong turn
I made a sure bet, and I still got burnt
But I'm about to catch a break
So don't say it's too little too late
Too little too late

I planned it out perfect, practiced and rehearsed it
I can see it every time I close my eyes---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
