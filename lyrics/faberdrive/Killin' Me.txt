She takes me to the edge 
This waiting, so frustrating 
She puts me to the test 
To break me, She takes me... 

Round and round 
When will I win? 

(Alright, here we go again) 

Oh no. Here we go 
She's killn' me 
(Alright, here we go again) 
I can't say no 
I can't believe she's killin' me 
Teasin' me again 
Why does she play with me, 
(Why does she play with me?) 
Like it's just pretend? 
She pulls away from me 
(She pulls away from me) 
Oh no. Killin' me again 

Her kiss is just like wine 
Intoxicating, just maybe 

She'll give me more this time 
Cause I'm cravin' what she's savin' 

Round and round
