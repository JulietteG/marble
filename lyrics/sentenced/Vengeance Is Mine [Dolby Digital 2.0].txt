I am stunned, you caught me by surprise
Assault and run - you outdid yourselves!
Beaten numb, I didn't see you sneaking 'round the corner
How could I... There is no sight in my third eye

We're not done, I will hunt you down
One by one... I'll blow you all to hell!
For you faceless, nameless cowards cannot hide
The day of reckoning will arrive

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down!
Stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest!
I'll rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine
From the wreckage
I'm right on your track, you bastards
A dozen of eyes for an eye - vengeance is mine!

I have dreams of hammering your skulls
Fantasies of bashing in your brains
Obsessively... I am watching, I am stalking, I am following
And then the massacre begins

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down!
Stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest!
I'll rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine
From the wreckage!
I'm right on your track, you bastards
A dozen of eyes for an eye - vengeance is mine!

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down!
Stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest!
I'll rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine
From the wreckage!
I'm right on your track, you bastards
A dozen of eyes for an eye - vengeance is mine!
A dozen of eyes for an eye - vengeance is mine!
Vengeance is mine!---Lyrics submitted by adam.
