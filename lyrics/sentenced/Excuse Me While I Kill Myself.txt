How do you do?
Have yourself, a pleasent afternoon.
Well, fuck you too,
Good night's the one I choose, for you!


I'll kill myself,
I'll blow my brains onto the wall.
See you in Hell,
I will not take this anymore.
Now this is where it ends, this is where I will draw the line,
So excuse me while, I end my life.

I will pull this through,
Not having a reason's no excuse.
What the Hell do you,
Suppose that I have left to lose?

I'll kill myself,
I'll blow my brains onto the wall.
See you in Hell,
I will not take this anymore.
Now this is where it ends, this is where I will draw the line,
So excuse me while, I end my life.

[Guitar Solo]

*Spoken* I'll kill myself...
See you in Hell
I'll kill myself
See you in Hell
I'll kill myself
See you in Hell
I'll kill myself
See you in Hell
I'll kill myself
See you in Hell
I'll kill myself

I'll kill myself,
I'll blow my brains onto the wall!
See you in Hell,
I will not take this anymore!
This is where it ends,
I put a bullet in my head,
And yes, drop dead.
This is where it ends,
This is where I will draw the line.
Excuse me while....

I kill myself.---Lyrics submitted by Francis.
