I heard you talking in your sleep
Calling out another man's name
My suspicion's killing me
Are you playing the cheating game?

Once a week got with your friends
Well, it's turning into three
Can't help but wonder where you've been
It's all become a mystery

I wanna know where I stand
Am I in, am I out of your plan?
I wanna know what to do
Am I losing you?

I found a note you meant to hide
The message says, let's meet at night
Phone keeps ringing, tell me, why?
It's wrong number every time

I wanna know where I stand
Am I in, am I out of your plan?
I wanna know what to do
Am I losing you?

Come home in the middle of the night
Girl, you know that it just ain't right
What's going on?

You got me so confused
Baby, you got me singing the blue
All night long, girl

I wanna know where I stand
Am I in, am I out of your plan?
I wanna know what to do
Am I losing you?

I wanna know, I can't stand it, baby
Tell me am I losing you?
Am I losing you? Am I losing you?
I wanna know, am I losing you?
