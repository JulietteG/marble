Oww
Hes got a style, got no soul
Hes got everything that a man could want from rock n roll
Hes got love, all he needs
And he can grip you by the throat 
And you know hes going to make you bleed

Taking off down the road, alright now
Every which way we will go

Hes got a knife in your back
And you never know the turn but you know youre off the track
Steely eyes, cold and blue
Though you cannot hide the way 
But you know hes going to get to you 

Taking off down the road, alright now
Every which way we will go
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Come on now lad
Hold onto the night

In this crazy heat
Theres a stranger on the road
Hes got a style, got no soul
Hes got everything that a man could want from rock n roll
Hes got a knife in your back
And you never know the turn but you know youre off the track

Watch out!

Taking off down the road, alright now
Every which way we will go
Hold onto the night
Come on now lad
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night

Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night

Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night

Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night
Hold onto the night---Lyrics submitted by Chris Halbower.
