Bad Bad Bad Bad Girls

Theyre comin down the street, The kinda girls youve just got to meet
My mother told me all about you
Look wild, look mean, look bad and a little obscene
Im sure they could show you a thing or two

When the night starts comin around, And girls start putting it down
Bad Bad Girls
Give me some more, give some more than I was looking for
Ill go crazy and do anything you can do
Bad Bad Bad Bad Girls
Gimme a shot, gimme a shot of anything you got
Theyre waiting to put the finger on you.
Theyre bad, I said bad

Theyre hot, theyre bad
Got the moves for making you mad
Theyre ready to do the number on you
Temperature's off the clock, These girls aint gonna stop
Theyre waiting to put the fire on you

When the night starts comin around, And girls start putting it down
Bad Bad Girls
Give me some more, give some more than I was looking for
Ill go crazy and do anything you can do
Bad Bad Bad Bad Girls
Gimme a shot, gimme a shot of anything you got
Theyre waiting to put the fire on you.
Theyre bad, gonna eat you alive better run, better hide, So look out
(Guitar solo)
When the night starts comin around, And girls start putting it down
Bad Bad Girls
Give me some more, give some more than I was looking for
Ill go crazy and do anything you can do
