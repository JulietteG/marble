There's a path running under the city
Where the stones and the hills divide
There's a path that we can walk
Through the loss and the pity
She out of the light
She thought it'd be safer
She said "I wanna go home"
Eyes turn grey like a face in the paper
She said "I wanna go home"

There's a girl sleeping under the river
Where the snow and the rain collide
There's a girl that we watch
And we'll soon be with her
She's out of the light
She doesn't remember
She said "I wanna go home"
Face turns white like a sky in December
She said "I wanna go home"
"I wanna go home"

There's a black house burning in the moonlight
We're standing at the door
When there's no one in sight
This will all be over tonight

There's something in the dark
And I wanna go home
There's someone else here
We're not alone
This will all be over tonight

There's a place where we can all be together
Where the moon and the stars reside
There's a place we can go
Where we'll sleep forever
We're out of the light
We'll never remember
Do you wanna go home?

There's a black house burning in the moonlight
We're standing at the door
When there's no one in sight
This will all be over tonight

There's something in the dark
And I wanna go home
There's someone else here
We're not alone
This will all be over tonight---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Lowe.
