Tell me why we never cared to do this when we still had time. 
We'll never have to give up if we never try. 
I know I'll only want it when it's gone, into the fire. 
Show me now. 
I wish that I could fake it but I don't know how. 
I know we'll never make it but I can't stop now. 
We're only just beginning and it's over. 

Too late. No time, it's over, and now, can't wait. 
Now it's too late. No time, it's over, and now, can't wait. 
And now, we all fall down. 

Into the fire. 
And my wishes have all come true. 
We all fall down. 
I don't want it if I can't be with you. 

Leave me here. 
I'll never see tomorrow till my eyes are clear. 
We never could run faster than the passing years. 
I know that I won't miss you till you're gone, into the fire. 
Cross my heart, we'll never have to let this end if we don't start. 
We'll never see the light till we step into the dark. 

Too late. No time, it's over, and now, can't wait. 
Now it's too late. No time, it's over, and now, can't wait. 
And now, we all fall down. 

Into the fire. 
And my wishes have all come true. 
We all fall down. 
I don't want it if I can't be with you. 

There's a lesson that we learn in the pages that we burn. 
It's written in the ashes of the fire below. 
All the world is spinning round as we crash into the ground. 
We'll never be together now. 

It's too late.---Lyrics submitted by Amber Austin.
