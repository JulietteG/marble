I saw you in a photograph
The answer is in your eyes
It dragging me back to everything else
We left behind
You're hiding inside
A perfect life
A picture of us
I'm hearing you whisper
Alibis

There is a shadow here
But there's no life behind me
The stains of blood on the floor
Serve to remind me
The time is drawing near
Turns like a knife inside me
I never wanted it all 
Come stand beside me

The walls are moving closer now
The ceiling wont wash away
The message is clear
There's nobody here
Just walk away
I'm waiting for you
I'm all alone
And through the wall
I'm hearing you whisper
Alibis

There is a shadow here
But there's no life behind me
The stains of blood on the floor
Serve to remind me
The time is drawing near
Turns like a knife inside me
I never wanted it all
Come stand beside me

I never wanted it all
Come stand beside me
I never wanted it all
Come stand beside me
Come stand beside me---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Lowe.
