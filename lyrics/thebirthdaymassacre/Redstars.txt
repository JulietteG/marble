Best of cruel intentions 
Finding what they fail to mention
No truth, all pretension
Raise your hand to get attention

You give it, we take it
You build it, we break it
You sign and we erase it
You feel it, we fake it
~Its my red star~
I steal it
~Its my red star~
I can't let go
~Its my red star~
Conceal it
~Its my red star~
All I know

Wasted education
Celebrating imitation
Misplaced admiration
Speaking for a generation

You give it, we take it
You build it, we break it
You sign and we erase it
You feel it, we fake it
~Its my red star~
I steal it
~Its my red star~
I can't let go
~Its my red star~
Conceal it
~Its my red star~
All I know---Lyrics submitted by Samie.
