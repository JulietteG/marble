The story's missing a wishing well,
No mirror to show and tell,
No kiss that can break the spell,
I'm falling asleep.

Every prince is a fantasy.
The witch is inside me.
Her poison will wash away memory.

We kill the lights and put on a show.
It's all a lie
But you'd never know.
The star will shine
And then it will fall
And you will forget it all.

And after midnight we're all the same.
No glass shoe to bring us fame.
Nobody to take the blame.
We're falling apart.

Every story's a waiting game.
A flower for every name.
Their colors are paling in the falling rain.

We kill the lights and put on a show.
It's all a lie,
But you'd never know .
The star will shine,
And then it will fall,
And you will forget it all.

Now you know
It's so much better to pretend
There's something waiting for you here.
Every letter that you wrote 
Has found its way to me my dear 
You can make believe that what you say 
Is what I want to hear 
I'll keep dancing through this beautiful, delusional career 

Faking every tear.
Looking like a compromise suicide.
Keeping all my dreams alive.---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
