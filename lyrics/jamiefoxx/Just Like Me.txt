(T.I. : Intro)
Say Foxx? (Yeah.. eah.. eah...)
I had-I had a chick man- (Yeah.. eah.. eah...)
She wouldn't did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah.. eah.. eah...)
I did the same thing to her but-
She ain't have no right to do me like that though dawg, for real (Yeah.. eah.. eah...)

(Jamie Foxx : Verse One)
You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too bli-i-ind to see it baby
That you was out here doing the same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car?
And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house
She's been in the car
I've even let her push the Porsche around a couple times
Ohh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

(Jamie Foxx : Chorus)
You're just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me
She don't know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can't be mad dapslyrics
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me...

(Jamie Foxx : Verse Two)
Now it ain't so easy for me to be imagining what you been doing baby
So I don't even have to ask (No)
Cause you ain't the only one that keeping secrets baby
So really, no sense in me playing back
And I, can't say nothing
Cause I did you wrong
And I was on some bull****
When I let that ***** up in our home
She's out from us just like me
And she played the game like one of my homies
Ohh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can see you baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

(Jamie Foxx : Chorus)
You're just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud

Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me
She don't know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can't be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e (Getting money, having fun, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (In the club, throwing ones, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (24's on the rims)
Just like me... (Go on shawty do your thang)

(T.I. : Bridge)
Hey!
Shawty who you fooling you?
Know I'm way too cool for you
To run that game when we play me
Trying to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwing her
Just like I hear he doing you
Why you worry about me doing me
I see you doing you
I can make her better though
You gon let him ruin you
Just for the record
No, I wouldn't have her unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you
That booty do be moving boo
Late night, straight pipe
That ain't nothing new to you
Wait a minute
Can't tell me
-****-
Wanna tell me
Something tell me this
If I woulda never woulda hit that chick
Would you even ever know that dude exist?
Still.
Naw.
Got me quick, still
You ask about I've kissed it
Now you all on his ****
Shawty looking -Tipsy?- -History?-

(Jamie Foxx : Chorus)
Just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs
And you just like me (You know I was wrong shawty)
She don't know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can't be mad
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
(You dealing with a man with an ego, you know?)
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me-e-ee-e-e
She just like me...---Lyrics submitted by lucy.
