(feat. Justin Timberlake & T.I.)

(Yo, Uh) Ooooooooooh
(Talk to me) You know you looking at a winner
(Hahahaha Uh, Yeah)
(Lemme get it right here first)

(Verse 1: Justin Timberlake)
Im wakin
Up in the morning
Hustlin to the stage, if I been performin
Bustin in through the hay and bustin the door in
Wakin up the misses of my seven story
Speakin of the misses
Im watchin, Im pourin
Just like a drink that Im enjoyin
And dont mean bottles you up and rejoice
Just look at me soarin
Feelin like Jordan

(Bridge: Justin Timberlake)
(Aaah Ah) Hold up I aint finished yet
On top but you just dont get it yet
I dont get cut
I make em cut the check
Cant hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(Aaah Ah) You aint heard Im the shit
On top but you just dont get it yet
I never got cut but I make em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

(Chorus)
I feel like I cant miss
I know they want me to fall
But aint nothing bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner
I cant miss, Cant lose, Cant miss
You know you looking at winner
Cause Im a winner
Yeah Im a winner

(Verse 2: Jamie Foxx)
Im stepping out in the evening
Keep women in screams
You gotta be cheatin
But Im so pleased

I make this look easy
And yall thinking Im seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TVs
To Screens and DVDs
To CDs,
To MP3s Overseas
I got no time
The talking is boring
Just look at me soaring
Feeling like Jordan

(Bridge: Jamie Foxx)
(Aaah Ah) Hold up I aint finished yet
On top but you just dont get it yet
I never got cut
I make em cut the check
Cant hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(Aaah Ah) You aint heard Im the shit
On top but you just dont get it yet
I never got cut but I make em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

(Chorus)
I feel like I cant miss
I know they want me to fall
But aint nothing bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner
I cant miss, Cant lose, Cant miss
You know you looking at winner
Cause Im a winner
Yeah Im a winner

(Chorus)
I feel like I cant miss
I know they want me to fall
But aint nothing bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner
I cant miss, Cant lose, Cant miss
You know you looking at winner
Cause Im a winner
Yeah Im a winner---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
