Pop the champagne and let it rain all over the world!
Me and my girl we about to do the twirl on the dance floor.

Who told you to walk up to me in them louboutins so high?
That is the shit I seen in my life!
That to make your boyfriend cry, make him cry baby
Lord knows when you were sittin' in front of your mirror at home
You knew that he was about to get jealous,
Why the hell you put that black dress on?! it's so cold!

It ain't my, it ain't my fault
Just blame it on the dress that you bought
I blame it on the way that you walked in the club,
And stole my heart!
It ain't my, it ain't my fault
It ain't my, it ain't my fault

Been sneaking, meet me in the bathroom stall
And slalom to decide
Don't take him upon the way on, ooh oh

Lord knows when you were sittin' in front of your mirror at home
You knew that he was about to get jealous,
Why the hell you put that black dress on?! it's so cold!

It ain't my, it ain't my fault
Just blame it on the dress that you bought,
I blame it on the way that you walked in the club,
And stole my heart!
It ain't my, it ain't my fault
It ain't my, it ain't my fault

It ain't my fault, you know you're wrong
It ain't my fault,
You knew that dress was a bad ass as soon as you put it on you
It ain't my fault, you know you're wrong
It ain't my fault if homie don't know
He's leaving here alone

It ain't my, it ain't my fault
Just blame it on the dress that you bought,
I blame it on the way that you walked in the club,
And stole my heart!
It ain't my, it ain't my fault---
