Ooo, oo, Ooo, oo,Ooo oo, ooo

Verse 1:
They say I had it bad, 
Addicted to what we had,
Heart rate's low fading fast, 
Vital's low might not last,
Strapped down while sirens ring, 
Holding on trying to breathe,
Not like this I cant leave, 
Look what you've done to me, 

Chorus:
I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
They said I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you,
Cause I want you close, 
Need you the most, 
Without you im just through,
So I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you

Verse 2:
Rushing me switching lanes,
IV's all through my vains, 
Blood test say no cocaine,
They don't know your the blame,
Cause your deep inside of me,
So this is goodbye to me,
But for you I'll die happily,
One more hit I'll be free,

Chorus:
I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
They said I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you,
Cause I want you close, 
Need you the most, 
Without you im just through,
So I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you

Bridge:
Cause I knew that you would kill me,
Cause I'm sweatin' tweakin' feanin', 
Never been so high,
But damn I love this feelin', 
Cause I'm achin' breakin' shakin',
Will I make it through the night,
And now my body's cold, 
Im losin' it cause i was abusin' it, oo no
Cant nobody help, I did to myself,
And that's why I'll do it again and again

Chorus:
I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
They said I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you,
Cause I want you close, 
Need you the most, 
Without you im just through,
So I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you---Lyrics submitted by Tanisha.
