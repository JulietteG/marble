Blame it on the booze, got u feeling loose
Blame it on the tron, got business on
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

(verse 1)
Eh, she say she usually don't
But I know she front
Shawty know what she want 
But she don't want to seem like she easy
I hear u say what u won't do
But u know we probably go do
What u feel inside 
Don't let it out now

(Bridge)
Girl what u drinking
Go let it sink in
Here for the weekend, 
thinking we can
see what we can be 
if we press fast-forward
just one more round if u down i'm for it
fill another cup up
feeling on your butt what 
u ain't even care 
now i was unaware 
i find who u were before my bus was leaving
(bus was leaving)

(Chorus)
Blame it on the booze, got u feeling loose
Blame it on the tron, got your business on
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the vac, Blame it on the henny
Blame it on the bluetap got u feeling dizzy
Blame it on the alcohol 
Blame it on the alcohol

(verse 2)
Oh see put a drink on me
Now i knowing she tipsy
She put her body in me
Now she keep staring me right in my eye
No telling what i'm go do
Baby i'll rather show u
What u been missing in your life
When i get inside

(bridge)

(chorus)

(verse 3)
T-Pain
Girl i know u feel good 
Just like u look
A couple more shots u open like a book
Shawty i ain't tripping
cause i'm gonna read ya 
Shawty i ain't tripping 
i just wanna please ya
I'm go take a shot of the nuvo
Shawty ain't do no
It's going down, we can kick it like judo (judo)
U know what i mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it was all a dream
So i made her say ah-ah-ah
Now she got her hand on my leg
And got my seats wet in my ride (ride)
All over my ride (all over my ride)
She looked me dead in the eye (eye)
Then my pants got bigger 
She already knew the digger
Had me looking at her boyfriend
Like ha-ha-ha

(chorus)

To the ballers popping bottles
With the henny in they cups
Spending money ain't a thing
If it ain't throw it up in the sky (sky)
Hold your drinks up high (high)
To my independent mama's 
Who can buy their own bottles
If u looking like a model
When them broke fella's holla
Tell them bye (bye)
Put your drinks up high (high)

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by John.
