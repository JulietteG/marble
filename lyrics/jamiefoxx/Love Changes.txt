(feat. Mary J Blige)

You stayed awake half the night
Love just
Put you through changes
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
It must be love that's on your mind
You doin' things, you wouldn't before.
And you outta know

Love will make you oh so happy
Inside-i-i-ide
Can't control it but it takes you over
Love will make you oh so sad
Make you cry-y-y-y

Changes
Love changes, Love changes
That's what love puts you through
Love changes, Love changes
Changes
That's what love makes one do
Love changes

Wonderin' if it's real this time
Just not another half-goodbye
You walk around starry eyed
Can't believe that love would hurt again
Hurt again
I can't believe that this love will

Love will make you oh so happy
Inside
Can't control it but it just takes you over
Love will make you oh so sad
Make you cry

Changes
Love changes, Love changes
That's what love puts you through
Love changes, Love changes
Changes
That's what love makes one do
Love changes

You know what Mary?
Yeah Jamie
All I wanna do is just get back to the basics
I wanna get back to to lovin'
Get back to huggin'
Get back to carin'
Get back to sharin'
Get back to understandin'
Everything we do
Get back to even teachin'
Teach me please
Get back to lovin' your woman
Get back to lovin' your man
Get back to cookin' for your man
Whenever you hungry baby

Changes
Love changes, Love changes
That's what love wants to prove
Love changes, Love changes
Changes
Love will make you oh so happy inside
Love will make you oh so sad make you cry
Love will make you oh so happy inside---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
