By the time you get this letter
I might be doin better
It's kinda hard trying to survive
In all this crazy weather

Everybody wants my number
Everybody's callin my name
But in the midst of all of this
I can still hear you say

Son, walk upright
And straighten yo tie
You don't want one of those good jobs to pass you by
Don't act no fool, I'm watching you
And now that you're gone
It still feels like you do, I Wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

[Verse 2]
Now all of these people ask me
"Is it lonely at the top?..."
Or do I find comfort
In all the things I got

Well these cars keep me movin
These planes keep me high
A million dollar home
But I'm barely gettin by
Cause...

I miss our talks,
One thing u used to say (used to say)
When things got hard (Hard on me)
Get down on your knees and pray

And then those walks (then those walks)
Its just the simple thangs
We still do all of this
But only in my dreams, I wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son (you would be so proud of yo son)
I wish u were here (thats all I kno to say, thats all I kno to pray)
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

But sometimes I wonder why
Why cant u still be here wit me?,
Wish God would've waited a couple more years for u to see
I'm tryna stay strong
Barely holdin on
I kno I'll see u again,
But for right now, rest in peace

And when I get to heaven
First thing they'll say to me
Tell me have u seen Estelle Marie Talley
Find out where u are,
Run into your arms
Wrap yo wings around me
And whisper in my ear, well done

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here---Lyrics submitted by Angel.
