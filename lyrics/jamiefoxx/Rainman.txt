rainman, rainman......rainman, rainman
ca call me ca call me rainman, rainman

Theres no need for me to lay out my clothes,
When shes not around theres nowhere to go,
make no attempts getting up out of this bed,
im wanna open my eyes but i just close the curtain instead,
her thunder storms shuts my lights off oooohhhhh,
i got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow cuz right now i cant just catch a break

Chorus: Everyday it rains when she aint laying right here i can feel the coolness in the air i know my chances aint far/ everyday it rains would it be jus my window seal sound reaches my ear go then it reappears/ everyday it rains my heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy the flood moves around me/ everyday it rains no sign of the light as the time goes by 40 days and 40 nights

Just when i thought i gotten rid of u,
I turn my face to your pillow thats soaked in your perfume,
the waters raging no life vest and i cant swim through through no,
my heart, my mind, and my soul its lost somewhere in this deep (not sure, her thunder storms shut my lights off oooohhhh,i got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow cuz right now i cant get a break

Chorus: Everyday it rains when she aint laying right here i can feel the coolness in the air i know my chances aint far/ everyday it rains would it be jus my window seal sound reaches my ear go then it reappears/ everyday it rains my heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy the flood moves around me/ everyday it rains no sign of the light as the time goes by 40 days and 40 nights

baby cut my lights (cut my lights)back on (back on baby)take me im ours (take me im yours)release me release me ohhhhh uhh ohhhh rainman,rainman, rainman
