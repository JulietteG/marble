Curiosity
The young and the free
There for all to see
Entranced
Burned by the flame
Have your senses taken leave
Into the fire of true belief
Its the orgy of the free

It was at first as
If they were shadows
Shimmering visions
By the light of the dancing flame
Bodies in motion
The sound of the ocean
Came into vision
On the night of the dancing flame

What of your own free will
Bodies are writhing still
There in the moonlight
With my head up held high
Wish I could keep on walking by
But I
Find myself drawn to you
I let you do what you want to do
You had your wicked way
There on the site of the dancing flame

It was at first as
If they were shadows
Shimmering visions
By the light of the dancing flame
Bodies in motion
The sound of the ocean
Came into vision
On the night of the dancing flame

To dance around the fire
On the night of the dancing flame
To make the flame grow higher
In the light of the dancing flame

To dance around the fire
On the night of the dancing flame
To make the flame grow higher
In the light of the dancing flame

On that starry night
Lost my sense of time
I dont know how I
Got my fingers burned

Maybe I got too close
To the light of the
To the light of the
To the light of the dancing flame

The light of the
The light of the
The light of the dancing flame---Lyrics submitted by NNN.
