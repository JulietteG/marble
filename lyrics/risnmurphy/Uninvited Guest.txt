I am walking the streets
I am wandering aimlessly
I can see that it's all for sale
and uncertains me

All alone
And it looks like everyone else
Is busy
All avoiding
Eye contact with me

I could be well dressed
Even all the money I've left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best
I'm an uninvited guest
Waste another day of nothing

I could get out of my head
Even all the money I've left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best
I'm an uninvited guest
Lost another day of nothing

I've been walking the streets
It's another purposeless day
I am far from the reasons it took to pass this way

I am haunted by thoughts
I am taunted by things to do
And people to see
Catch my eye, passerby
Before I
Pass through

I could be well dressed
Even all the money I've left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best
I'm an uninvited guest
Waste another day of nothing
I could get out of my head
Even all the money I've left
I could buy another day of nothing
I could never quite forget
I'm an uninvited g(uest)

I'll keep wandering
Aimlessly
Until that flickering
Moment of intensity
I'll form with you, stranger
Recognise me
Well glance my way
See something in me, I
Keep on
Wandering
Aimlessly
Until that flickering
Moment of intensity
I'll find in your stranger
Recognise me
Glance my way
See something in me, I
Keep on wandering
Aimlessly
Until that flickering
Moment of intensity
I'll form with your stranger

Recognise me
See something in me
But see something
Here in the world
Time it recurs
While your world

I could be well dressed
Even all the money I've left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best
I'm an uninvited guest
Waste another day of nothing

I could get out of my head
Even all the money I've left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best
I'm an uninvited guest
Lost another day of nothing

Not sure if I'm gonna survive
Survive
Don't know if this is living a lie
Words fly
Not sure if I'm feelin' alright
On pride
I'm tired


Not sure if I'm ready to laugh... or cry.---
