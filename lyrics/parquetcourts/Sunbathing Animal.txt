One creature I return to
One habit I neglect
I cannot slow the pace at which I yearn
Frank and unabashed I become a frozen servant
Smiling, asking nothing in return
Fang-toothed woman foaming at the mouth as she addressed me
Not with moving lips but with the rabid wild arresting
Not yet intended to identify emotion
Scrawling bold and oblique in my head
Ive hung out at your service jobs
Ive watched you wait and be ignored
Blend into the background as they sipped at what you poured
I cling to your perimeter as you float in their margins
Oblivious to being stuck their satellite becomes my sun
And Ive flown into that trap before when things have gotten dark
In the depths of strangers' glances lies the most ferocious spark

Most freedom is deceiving, if such a thing exists
When I was young I knew but didnt care
Faces change in shape but represent the same old beast
I want to flee but I can only stare
Its the sound a captured heart makes as it sizzles into vapor
The tidal hum of fondness like a spike wave oscillator
The rapid UV grin that beckons me into approaching
Grasping as it recedes into space
Who greets me first when I arise?
Who creeps into my half-shut eyes?
Its in the blaze of your embrace where I feel more real and alive
The bosom of a thousand watts into my skin
Into my guts
Running circles in my plot
Howling like a tethered mutt that broke free for the first time
So proud till he got caught
In his brief emancipation he can feel what I cannot

There is a patch of light that hits the floor Ill often occupy
Stretch my arms and legs and close my eyes
I now can hear my pulse alone
This manic pace, I cannot slow
I do not miss the child you stole
Frying and abiding, Im in your control
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sunbathing animal
Like a sun---
