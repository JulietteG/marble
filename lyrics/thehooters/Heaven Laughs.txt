See the stars that shine and give us light
One less star is in the sky tonight
Words alone won't keep our tears away
But I know that star will shine again someday

And heaven laughs when we say good-bye
It ain't so far to the other side
Someday soon we will meet again
Say it over and over and over 'til then

Dream tonight about a last embrace
Close my eyes and I will see your face
Dreams alone won't keep our tears away
But in my heart I know we'll meet again someday

And heaven laughs when we say good-bye
It ain't so far to the other side
Someday soon we will meet again
Say it over and over and over 'til then

And so we laugh when we say good-bye
It ain't so far to the other side
And heaven knows we will meet again
Say it over and over and over again

From ever-last to everlasting
From sea to shining sea
How much did we take from each other
Here's one from the heart and one more for free

And heaven laughs when we say good-bye
It ain't so far to the other side
Someday soon we will meet again
Say it over and over and over 'til then

And so we laugh when we say good-bye
It ain't so far to the other side
And heaven knows we will meet again
Say it over and over and over again

Say it over and over and over again...---Lyrics submitted by Joshua Whelan.
