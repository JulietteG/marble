Mutual Fools (Hart)

We, took full advantage of the grey
And we, decieved ourselves in every way
My body was right there but my mind was somewhere else
Your heart was so swollen it no longer resembled itself

And we're fools...
(Mutual fools)
Mutual fools...
(Mutual fools)

You played the treasure hunt with me, the mute
But I refused to give you the clue to the loot
And I kept that gold hidden until I forgot where it was
But you waste your time on unrequited love

So you must be a fool...
(Mutual fools)
We're mutual fools
(Mutual fools)

I told you it's a dangerous game we play
But you would not have it any other way
And you should have just kept walking when I began to kiss like I cough
Cause now you've been finished off

By the wrath of a fool
(Mutual fools)
We're mutual fools
(Mutual fools)---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
