When your teeth clench down
And your tongue traces the roof of your mouth
Your eyes begin to drown
While your words find some back door way out
The phone's at your cheek
The tears creep in the mouthpiece - it goes dead
You're half-relieved, you haven't even dialed her number yet

But you must get through to her extension
Though there are hotlines for preventions
But fools behind your intervention
Don't know you can't rehab obsession

Your best qualities are anomalies against your good intention
Horizontally wishing
Lightning would strike down your imagination
Why do you want to take her hand
To show her the ruins of what you're proud of?
Convince her in vain
It only came from a place of pure love?

Laws of attraction and of tension
Confine the prizes of contention
How do you give all your attention
Without it turning to obsession?

Obsession - you can't lose all your marbles then take them all home!
Obsession - not when you define "home" as a pair of arms
Obsession - How do these voices scream loudest when you're alone
(I don't know)
But that's when you know that it's obsession...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
