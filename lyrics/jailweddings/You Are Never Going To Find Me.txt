Well, I thought I was being strong
But I knew that all along
I was deeply mourning
Trying to make some sense
Out of certain events
So now I'm leaving you without warning
You never saw my foot tappin'
Just waiting for something to happen
You would not look away from the TV
So naturally I felt trapped
So I decided to pull back
To reclaim my own sad history

And now I'm somewhere else with somebody
But I ain't telling you or nobody
It'll ruffle everybody's feathers
But I'm no longer a chicked
I just had to act quick
And guess what?
I feel a whole lot better

You are never, ever going to find me

I had a dark premonition
In fact I've had a million of 'em
Regarding my future
In every midnight meltdown
I can still hear that sound
So I scream to drown out your whisper
I'm out of sight, trying to find
A way to run you out of my mind
But you've taken permanent residence
So I've pulled off the perfect crime
Just to take back what is mine
Where the blood would not be enough evidence

Yeah, now I'm somewhere else with somebody
But I ain't telling you or nobody
We'd be lost on any confession
I'll just keep ignoring your voice
All night long, as if I had a choice
With every dark premonition...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
