How Am I Still Alive? (Hart)

The knives of sunlight dissect my eyes
Such a cruel way to convince me to rise
On this day that should have never come
I've seen it all, yet I'm somehow surprised

You can find the meaning of life in anybody's measly breath
But now I'm more mystified about the meaning of death
And how... Am I... Alive?---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
