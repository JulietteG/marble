Staring At The Stars (Hart)

With how fast she switches gears
She must have had this planned all along
OH BRAVO! What a smooth transition
Overacting in some endless audition

But I knew true authenticity
Countless nights in her night terror wakes
Begging me to hold her close
This death-grip, one of the many forms our loving takes

And I alone know how you were meant to be known
Unafraid to have your skin chewed right off the bone
Yes, those were the nights
On the cliffs, looking up, afraid of heights

We were staring at the stars
(Staring at the stars)
While the ground crumbled beneath our feet

Is this how you prefer to be?
A bit counterfeit, flaunting your vacancy
We dug deep for the holy
Perhaps that's why
You always came back to me

But now you're wiping away your footprints
And it's only because you're dragging your feet
And these shallow impressions?
You won't need them to find me

The names on this city's will were ours
(The city will be ours)
Until they read us the fine print beneath

And some men think they've had you pinned under some silly orange tree
But I've had you in a nurse suit
Deep in New Orleans
Where I made you scream true
Back when I made you scream clean---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
