When We're Together (We Let Ourselves Go) (Hart)

We've known each other for so long
We've seen each other in so many other lovers' arms
Now we reach for each other but away from what makes us whole
When we're together we let ourselves go!

We make each other feel so immortal
So the closer we get
The quicker we get into trouble
Now you've got a black eye and I can't get off of the floor
When we're together we let ourselves go!

We see in each other things that no one should know
Proving the world wrong
Through sex, wine and song
That there's no tomorrow
While ever resolution went right out the window
When we're together we let ourselves go

Remember how witty we were
When we actually tried?
Now we're just merely content to hide
Remember how pretty we were?
Exposing all our insides
Now I'm afraid the best part of us has died...

REMEMBER!

You were alone when I fell for your rogue spirit
I thought I would die if I could not possess all of it
Smothering each other's fire that once made us glow
When we're together
We let ourselves go
We're closing out the rest of the world!
As we just stay shivering in our dark corner!---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
