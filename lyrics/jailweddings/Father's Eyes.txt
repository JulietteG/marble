In the throes of passion
She asked me to retrieve something hidden deep in her woman-need
A certain ration
Of avalanche revealing the sting of layers meant to bury
She took both of my hands
And placed them firmly around her neck
I didn't want to fight it
I was already inside her so gently

That's when I realized
"This was once somebody's daughter..."
When she cried, begging me to squeeze harder
All the fear somehow glowing in the night
Was it the timing or was the lighting just right?

When suddenly she saw her Father's eyes
She somehow superimposed them on mine
Now I can't look at her the same no matter how hard I try
Why did she give me her Father's eyes?
And why didn't she seem at all to mind?
I thought to myself as I retired to my side

We had another visit
She wanted me
To kiss it all better
Should I have let her
Take me to where the shadows of our shadow selves retreat?

I didn't understand
Till I knew her face was the one I loved
And my two hands
Fit her neck like a glove
Even though the act always made her cry
She'd hold me so tight as we would blur every line

But I hope I never see her Father's eyes
I would make that man wish he was blind
Refreshing his memory by brandishing a shiny knife
Why did she give me her Father's eyes?
And why didn't she seem at all to mind
When I threw back on my clothes and I ran outside?
While I hope I never see her Father's eyes
Now I cannot escape her Father's eyes---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
