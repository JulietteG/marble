Tough Love (Hart)

Well I knew we were so young when we made the deal to seal our fate
We'd live each day like it was our last and leave tomorrow to wait
Well, I kept my side of the pact but you panicked and locked our door
And I've never had my lover be my mother before

So don't you give me your tough love
Don't give me your tough love
Don't try to turn something so sweet into a chore
Don't you give me your tough love
Don't give me your tough love
Because this Purple Heart would never dream of declaring war

Just look what you have done, I've turned into your teenage son
Rebelling against my premature disciplinarian
But you're such a textbook case of guilt turning into rage
While I'm gently trying to turn your page

So don't you give me your tough love
Don't give me your tough love
I'm trying so hard to see past your crossing arms
Don't you give me your tough love
Don't give me your tough love
Just like the day I put my fist through my alarm

And now I'm going to live my life
Exactly like
When you first fell in love with me
I was an animal back then
Now when you pet my skin
You try to skin my hide off of me!

So don't you give me your tough love...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
