Well, I don't want to make all of you frown
I never really wanted to sing a sad song
But I believe there is a truth to be found
In certain things that just go on and on...

And I know it sounds silly but
I think I've gone deaf
From the screaming pain of the world
After years of cupping my ears to hear every boy and girl

And may today... be merciful!

They tell me I should stop worrying
But I believe this paranoia keeps me alive
(And this paranoia waits, and this paranoia stays)
Ok, I agree this paranoia eats me alive

So I scream with the pain of the world, hoping to harmonize
Along with every single boy and girl till we all close our eyes

And may today... be mercy FULL! FULL! FULL! EMPTY! FULL!

This is our last ditch gospel
May today be merciful

And it's with this Godless prayer that we hope to summon
The world as the cruel comedian
We must all heckle on! And on! And on! And on!!!---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
