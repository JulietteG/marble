When you walk down the street and see someone you kind of know
Do you let your eyes meet, or retreat into their shadow?
Well come on! Stand tall! Smile big!
With your small talk ammo!

Cause they could be famous someday
In some way that they don't deserve
They could be famous someday
Singing songs that never wanted to be heard
They could help you on your way
Going in reverse

Some of us live this life like we've got some terminal disease
Others depend on those who instead should have become police
Well, something's got to fertilize
This industry of zombies

Who will be famous someday?
(but only after they fuck off their craft to the wind!)
Who will be famous out there?
All on rafts, washed up on deserted islands!
In the middle of that sea
Of mediocrity

Bursting at the seams
Creaming their jeans
Somehow making it seem
Like they're so busy
Living the dream
Of a magazine education
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hand on the shaft
Lips ever so gently caressing the head
How else could you be an overnight sensation?

You're gonna be famous, all right
If you're somehow rich to begin with
You're gonna be famous someday
if you find the right ones to sleep with
Blowing bubbles in your wettest dream
You're gonna be famous up there
Where there's no stars, just tacky sequins
Shining famous with a glare
Dagger eyes from all of your friends
Rowing gently down the stream
Of mediocrity...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
