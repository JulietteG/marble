I Thought You Were Someone I Knew (Hart)

Excuse me, but you have the same exact hair
Lookin' through me, with that same deer-in-headlights stare
But to make this mistake once
Should not warrant that kind of response
I was only reminiscing on the love I believed we shared

I just thought you were someone I knew
I just thought you were someone I knew
Won't you please pardon these open arms just hangin' here
I just thought you were someone I knew

You know they say everyone's got a lost identical twin?
Well this is not the first time I have seen hers again and again
But the biggest difference
Is the cold irreverence
Frozen over every crevice of hers I liked to jump in

I just thought you were someone I knew
I just thought you were someone I knew
Talkin' to me like you're somebody's rude secretary
When I thought you were someone I knew...

...and I knew it was you all along!
All these streets have sure changed
But our weathered statue faces remain

But you, you won't give me the time of day
Your head lived in my collarbone and my hands lived around your waist!

I just thought you were someone I knew
I just thought you were someone I knew
We took a trip to Hell and lived to tell its secrets
I just thought you were someone I knew---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
