People ask me for advice
But I can't repair their shattered lives
When the most important question out there
I still can't answer myself
People talk and they are nice
But I know what hides behind our eyes
That deep fried, mummified angel of innocence
That we battered ourselves

Why is it so hard to be good?
My inner child's been put up for adoption
Why is it so hard to be good?
When abstinence was never an option
Why is it so hard to be good?
When the only alternative is just feeling rotten
Why is it so hard to be good?

When I was young, I thought a lot
To avoid becoming a robot
But the more that I thought
The more I got scared
Of that phantom presence
Waiting for me on top of the stairs
When I got the guts to start walking up
It started walking down so I couldn't reach the top
In the middle, we stopped
Caressed each other's hair
Till we fell down the stairs

Why is it so hard to be good?
The right direction has been laid out for us
Why is it so hard to be good?
When we try everything cause we're just too curious
Why is it so hard to be good?
Then kick rocks till we're covered in dust

But even the dust
Has a seductive quality
The way you want to brush
It all right off me
Aren't you afraid you won't trust
What you will find underneath?
Well sometimes it's a rush
Realizing it's hard to breathe

Why is it so hard to be good?
I know there's something so attractive in the dark
Why is it so hard to be good?
To cast away all this guilt in my heart
Why is it so hard to be good?
I cannot play these puppet strings like a harp
Why is it so hard to be...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
