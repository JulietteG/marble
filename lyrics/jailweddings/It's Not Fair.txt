Let's have a laugh as we see me run down the street
Holding up a photo of the way she looks at me
It's not fair...
Never before has a vision of beauty
Awoken a beast of pure insanity
It's not fair...

Is this Christmas or my execution?
Either way, it feels like electrocution
So I'm wearing black face
To cover up any trace
Of all my dead giveaway symptoms

I play it so cool that my heart turns to ice
But who will freeze the drool when I look in her eyes?
It's not fair...
She's not manipulative
She's just a little wounded birdy
To whom I've given every liberty
It's not fair...

If I cannot have her absolution
Take me away to the mental institution
I'll compartmentalize
While they lobotomize
Both sizes redefining subtraction

And tonight! No one gets me!
I've never felt so alone in our own crowd
Cause tonight, no one gets me
Cause in my heart there's just no one else allowed
Except her
(Accept her)
NO!
It's not fair

(You want to have one last teenage tantrum?)
(So go and have your last teenage tantrum)
(Now that you've had your last teenage tantrum, how do you feel?)---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
