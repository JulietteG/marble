One Of These Days (Hart)

So you think you're tough
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
The way your sorry soul acts like nothing can penetrate
But you like it rough
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Like a carnival with your victims burnt at the stake

One of these days
You'll find someone
You love more than your own life
And they're gonna go away

(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

When they think you're nuts
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
That's the only time you ever seem to be satisfied
You don't got the guts
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
To tell them all the biggest part of you has died

One of these days
You'll find someone
You love more than your own life
And they're gonna go away

(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

But wait a second here!
Isn't that how you got that way in the first place?
When you found someone you loved more than your own life
And they just went away?

(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
