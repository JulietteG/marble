Somebody Lonely (Hart)

I came alone
I left alone
Drank my eyes closed so I couldn't find my way home
So I threw my arms out and just started spinning down the street
Screaming out of tune this little poem
Dedicated to my phantom harem
Where ever you may be

I'm gonna find somebody lonely tonight
I'm gonna look at the dead right into the eyes
They'll look at me scared
Before I will dare
To spill these guts about how it's been such a long time

Like a man on a meat hook, I've been strung up and stripped
And with what's left of this flesh it's not like me to give a stranger the first pick
But I've saved the last little bit of me for you
Someone I don't even know but who's paralyzed by loneliness too

You're on your 8th gin and tonic, and you're almost passed out in that thing
And your wild blue eyes have started to cross like a Picasso painting
But I've seen beauty before, obscured by a storm that passes with some patience and guts
And I've had encounters just like this one before that ultimately ends with a kick in the nuts

But please don't be scared
It's like looking in a mirror
One you can always replace instead of going through the trouble to repair

(After the glass is smashed, I will disappear fast)

I'm going to find somebody lonely
Gonna make them admit that they are lonely
I'm going to find somebody lonely
Gonna make them admit that they are lonely---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
