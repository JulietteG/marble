Break free from this feeling in me
If you just give a little all you gotta do is trust me
Break free from this feeling in me
If you just give a little all you gotta do is trust me

Attached at the hip I need some room to breathe
These emotions are getting the best of me
I can finally see it was you all along
And looking back now I realize where I went wrong

Everyone knows, everyone knows
You replace the pain with vanity
Maybe one day, maybe one day, you will see
You're the reason we're done
Everyone knows, everyone knows
You replace the pain with vanity
Maybe one day, maybe you'll say
I'm the reason we're done

It's because of you I'll never be alright
Because of you I'm losing sleep at night
I've tried, I've tried, I'm losing my mind
Because of you I still find it hard to move on

Oh my god you're killing me
Now drop the act you pity queen
I'll keep you here just shut your mouth
Just let me have my way with you

Everyone knows, everyone knows
You replace the pain with vanity
Maybe one day, maybe one day, you will see
You're the reason we're done
Everyone knows, everyone knows
You replace the pain with vanity
Maybe one day, maybe you'll say
I'm the reason we're done

Even if I had a heart I wouldn't waste it on you

Lets see this as it really is
A part of me you'll always have
But we don't really care at all
I hate this thing inside of me
That keeps you far away from me
But deep down this is who we are
Lets see this as it really is
A part of me you'll always have
But we don't really care at all
I hate this thing inside of me
That keeps you far away from me
But deep down this is who we are

Everyone knows, everyone knows
You replace the pain with vanity
Maybe one day, maybe one day, you will see
You're the reason we're done
Everyone knows, everyone knows
You replace the pain with vanity
Maybe one day, maybe you'll say
I'm the reason we're done---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
