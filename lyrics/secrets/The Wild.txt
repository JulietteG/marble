You're the worst part of me
because when I gave you my soul, I didn't get one back
and it was never enough but it was all I had.

If you could take me back to the way things were and maybe,
I could take back all the words I told her.
I could take back my soul, take back what's mine,
and baby I won't take you back for the first time.

And finally, I'm free to fly without you here by my side.
Now that these restraints have lifted, it feels like the weight has shifted.
Finally, I'm free to soar without you here to block the door
and I can finally fly.

My mind is littered with photos of you and I'm burning them one by one.
You're just another bitter face and in your heartless fucking book.
I gave you everything and that's exactly what you took.

Get her out of my head.

And finally, I'm free to fly without you here by my side.
Now that these restraints have lifted, it feels like the weight has shifted.
Finally, I'm free to soar without you here to block the door
and I can finally fly.

I'm bruised and broken, damaged goods, and severely misunderstood.
It took this long to realize that this too shall pass and I'll learn to live again.
This too shall pass and I'll learn to live again.
I'll learn to live again.

Finally I'm free to fly without you here by my side.
Now that these restraints have lifted, it feels like the weight has shifted.

And finally I'm free to fly without you here by my side.
Now that these restraints have lifted, it feels like the weight has shifted.
And finally I'm free to soar without you here to block the door
and I can finally fly.

And I can finally fly.
This too shall pass and I'll learn to love again. ---
