I've broken my bones
Sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
And on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon,
I hope you'll catch me soon

Attention to love, to life, to all that's right
I'm wondering why you're letting me fall so far
From what I've chased my entire life

Through the darkest of nights, with no hope for a light
I bled for you
When you were broken, alone and you needed me most
I bled for you

So, please give me one good reason
I should keep believing in a goddamn thing
When this thing inside of me, I've never seen
It's telling me to give up, move on and forget my life
But in the end you'll see
This is the difference between you and me

I've broken my bones
Sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
And on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon
But you're not caring

I've broken my bones
Sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
And on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon
I hope you'll catch me soon

Shut our self from more
Shut our self from more

I'll carry on, through the bitter days
I'll carry on, through this hell you pave
I try to stand tall (x2)
But it's so hard to live.
When there's nothing at all

It's never enough
Should I give up now? (it's never enough)
You shouldn't give up now
You drowned me alone (I'll carry on, carry on) (x2)

I've broken my bones
Sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
And on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon
But you're not caring

I've broken my bones
Sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
And on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon
I hope you'll catch me soon

We struggle at bones, but keep wanting more.
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor. (x3)

I've broken my bones, threw my faith out
the door.
You can't reach the top without feeling the
floor.

FUCK!

You can't reach the top (x2)
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor ---
