Slipping from conscious through below the night
Silhouettes of karma spit fire in your eyes
Strike out in the dark, it all comes to light
Seeds you've sown that haunt you from the oath you tried to hide

Come on your cover's blown
It's never gonna let you go
Caught by the undertow
You said I'd never fight alone

Let's refresh the vision, the vow we held as truth
When bloody fists have fallen is when the fight is through
Face the one decision, to die or carry on
It's hard to think that nightfall is darkest before dawn

Come on your cover's blown
It's never gonna let you go
Caught by the undertow
You said I'd never fight alone

Drops of rain won't chisel stone with single acts of violence
Keep raining, erode
Shards of pain won't sear the soul when words are bound to silence
Keep raining, erode

Feel the candle burning, scorching from both sides
Impervious to dying, this torch will be held high
Give it up, leave your soul to rot, or see it through the end
Break the oath, it's breaking you
You can't reach the top without expecting to fall

Drops of rain won't chisel stone with single acts of violence
Keep raining, erode
Shards of pain won't sear the soul when words are bound to silence
Keep raining, erode

We've seen it all, we've heard it all a hundred times
I've seen it all, but never saw the change in mind

Drops of rain won't chisel stone with single acts of violence
Keep raining, erode
Shards of pain won't sear the soul when words are bound to silence
Keep raining, erode---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
