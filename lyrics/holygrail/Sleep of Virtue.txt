If you had worth to hold it fell somewhere along your life
Slipped out untold
Another overthrow, good riddance- tear 'em out of strife
No friends or foes

And in the darkest places you'll soon be shutting out the light
But now we're calling for you, your time has come

You will burn for your crimes
You'll learn to see through our eyes
You will hurt you will cry
You'll learn to see through our eyes 
Never cheat away, never steal away the light

When you cross the divide you'll learn to see through our eyes

You'll never need to know what's before you out of sight 
Yet you uphold

And in the darkest places you'll soon be shutting out the light
But now we're calling for you, your time has come

You will burn for your crimes
You'll learn to see through our eyes
When you cross the divide you'll learn to see through our eyes
You'll learn to see through our eyes 
Never cheat away... never steal away the light

As soon the brightness fades, you slip away and close your eyes
Although you're filled with hate, accept the blame, no place to hide
You passed the final stage... you're losing hope, your mouth is dry

It's time you face your fate... the dreams you made will never reach the other side

You will burn 
You'll learn to see through our eyes
When you cross
You'll learn to see through our eyes 
Never cheat away... never steal away the light
Never steal away the light---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
