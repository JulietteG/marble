What's the point of living if you can't accept the pain?
Wrap yourself in misery to try and bury all the shame
Challenged all philosophies to live against the grain
Severed all humanity; and evil world you cannot change

Crawling, screaming, blood across the ceiling
Trouble sleeping, conscience slowly creeping

Only the good die this way
Only the pure die in pain
Only your blood will delay your judgement day

So you think you've found a purpose, but you can't accept the truth
Bask yourself in sinful pleasures try to idolize your youth

Crawling, screaming, blood across the ceiling
Trouble sleeping, conscience slowly creeping

Only the good die this way
Only the pure die in pain
Only your blood will delay your judgement day

Poisoning your senses just to feel like you're alive
Staring down at that empty barrel to keep from suicide

You gotta stand up tall embrace the misery
(We stand tall, embrace the misery)
You gotta break the walls & face philosophy
(Break these walls, challenge philosophy, sever humanity)

Only the good die this way
Only the pure die in pain
Only your blood will delay your judgement day---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
