Breathing in an endless sin, a secret once ignored
Spirits whisper in my sleep, a calm before the storm

Close your eyes, turn back time

Wash away the rains of sorrow, keep your fear at bay
Find a way to change tomorrow, make it true today

Waiting for an open door a dream can travel through
Knowing now more than before, nightmares can come trye

Close your eyes, turn back time

Wash away the rains of sorrow, keep your fear at bay
Find a way to change tomorrow, make it true today

No regrets for words unspoken, no remorse or promise broken
After all the chances taken, nothing left - our dream's forsaken now

Close your eyes, turn back time

Wash away the rains of sorrow, keep your fear at bay
Find a way to change tomorrow, make it true today---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
