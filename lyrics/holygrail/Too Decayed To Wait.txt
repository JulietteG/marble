Perfect man I'm watching, your head is in my sights
My finger's on the trigger with a million reasons why
Hiding in your palace, life locked in your safe
Dollars won't defend you when I blow all your brains away

You're too decayed to wait for
Today you'll be betrayed by what you pay for
You're shiny, classy, and you're clean
You're every sniper's dream

When you die, no man will cry
Your bank account's a carcass to a vulture's eye
To you we're mongrels howling in the halls
But carrion, feel no conscience when they wipe you from the walls

When you watch the sunset realize you've lived your final day

You're too decayed to wait for
Today you'll be betrayed by what you pay for
You're shiny, classy, and you're clean
You're every sniper's dream

Blind and blighted, black benighted, slither round the floor
Famine, plague, and war
Drones desert you, stripping silver flesh and ever wanting more

Be comforted with thoughts that your legacy is gone
When the barrel cools you'll have death to leave your son
Sacrifice your fortune to stop your wounds with gold
It's a fool that pays a pension if he's never getting old

You'll pay, you're too decayed to wait for
Today you'll be betrayed by what you pay for
You're shiny, classy, and you're clean
You're every sniper's dream---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
