He's waiting
You're stalling
I'm dying, caressing
Oh, it's the waiting

You're calling him
She's talking 
About me, and you'll be
Oh, defend me

So friendly night

I'm hoping
This feeling
Stays with me
Intimacy
Oh, it's the waiting
Interesting night

God help me
Don't let this end
My lover be with 
No one, no one 
No one, no no one

No
No
No one, no no one.

And I don't want to leave you---Lyrics submitted by k.
