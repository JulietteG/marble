Yeah!
Last Friday night I wasn't me
I was a still life trapped in eternity
I was the focal point of a focus out of ink

And Ive been wandering and I live through the garden of your heart ache
Always making a mess, always stumbling out the door
But I dont wanna be an asshole anymore

Woah baby, baby Ill be good to you
I dont wanna be an asshole anymore
Woah baby, baby, Ill be good to you
Baby, baby, Ill be good to you

Another night, I devour the sun
Plunge myself into the depths of oblivion
Yeah somewhere along the way I found wine
Feels damn good just to bleed sometimes
All I ever wanted was to make things right
Usual vital, missing spite
I push my emotions off a bridge, Ive been taking them hostage with a shotgun
Now were somewhere treading water, somewhere lost inside the the man that I'm not
But I dont wanna be an asshole anymore

Woah baby, baby Ill be good to you
I dont wanna be an asshole anymore
Woah baby, baby, Ill be good to you
Ill be good to you
Ill be good, Ill be good, Ill be good

I wont lie no more about where Ive been
And I wont pry no more over the people that youre hanging with
Youre the only lover that I ever miss
And Ive been hopelessly in love with
Look at this tangle of thorns
I dont wanna be an asshole anymore
Yeah, I dont wanna be an asshole anymore
Oh no, no, no---
