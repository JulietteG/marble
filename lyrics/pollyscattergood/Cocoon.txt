From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in
From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in

They sing of lost electric love
They sing about hope
They sing of giving up
And then they sing about joy
They sing of pain
They sing about cold metallic blame

From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in
From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in

They sing of waiting endlessly
They sing about lost eternity
Then they sing about waking up alone
They sing about being on your own

From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in
From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in

I'm gonna let you in
I'm gonna let you in
Just as the drum begins
I hear it whispering
I'm gonna let you in
I'm gonna let you in
Just as the drum begins
I hear it whispering

As I stumble, look away
Don't want you to see me this way
I am no good, I am no good at all
Nobody catch me when I fall
They see the spiral on the edge
They see the winter like a ledge
Upon a ledge, we all just stumble down
Not built to last, not built to stick around

From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in
From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in
From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in
From my cocoon of angel wings
From my cocoon, I'm gonna let you in---
