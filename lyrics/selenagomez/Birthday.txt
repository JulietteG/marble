Tell 'em that it's my birthday [x3]
When I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know so it's OK
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
When I party like that

(Jazz it up) [x2]

Happy as can be
Fallin' into you fallin' into me (so yummy!)
How do you do? Come and meet the queen, cake and cream
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams, blow your dreams away with me
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams, blow your dreams away with me
So yummy!

Tell 'em that it's my birthday [x3]
When I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's OK
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
When I party like that

(Jazz it up) [x2]

Feelin' fine and free
Crashin' into you, crashin' into me (so yummy!)
It's all I wanna do, come and dance with me, pretty please
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams, blow your dreams away with me
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams, blow your dreams away with me

Tell 'em that it's my birthday [x3]
When I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's OK
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
When I party like that

Tell 'em that it's my birthday [x3]
When I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's OK
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
When I party like that

Blow your dreams, blow your dreams, blow your dreams away with me [x4]

(Party on, baby)

Tell 'em that it's my birthday [x3]
When I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's OK
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
When I party like that

Tell 'em that it's my birthday [x3]
When I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's OK
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
When I party like that---Lyrics submitted by Ana Teixeira.
