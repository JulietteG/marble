You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
Cause you never gonna take me there
And I know what I know
And I know youre no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know its not meant to be

Heres my dilemma, one half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma, from the moment I met ya
I just cant get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted, to my dilemma
My dilemma, its you, its you

Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors, but you wont come clean
I guess Im hoping its because of me
And I know what I know
And I know youre no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know its not meant to be

Heres my dilemma, one half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma, from the moment I met ya
I just cant get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted, to my dilemma
My dilemma, its you, its you

I could live without you, your smile, your eyes
The way you make me feel inside
I could live without you, but I dont wanna
I dont wanna, oh, oh
You make me so upset sometimes

Heres my dilemma, one half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma, from the moment I met ya
I just cant get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted, to my dilemma
My dilemma, its you, its you, its you, its you
Its you, its you, its you, its you
Its you, its you, its
My, my, my dilemma---Lyrics submitted by Ida'Nathalie.
