You walk and talk
Like you're some new sensation
You move in circles
You don't need an invitation
You spend your money
You can't get no satisfaction
You play it right
So you can get the right reaction

It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone
Nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby
Aren't they the ones
Supposed to be there for

You, and you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You, and you're falling down
No, it's not all about
You, and you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down
Falling down

Falling down
You're falling down
You're falling down

What's out of place
When you look into the mirror
The truth is blurry
But the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed
Your smile is so elastic
You gave me roses
But they're all just made of plastic

It won't be long, my darling 
Pick up the phone
Nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby
Aren't they the ones
Supposed to be there for

You, and you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You, and you're falling down
No, it's not all about
You, and you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down
Falling

Smile for the camera
Everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera
If they're all about to trash you
Smile for the camera
(Camera, camera)
Smile for the camera
Who's gonna catch you

You
(You)

You, and you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You, and you're falling down
No, it's not all about
You, when you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down
Falling

Smile for the camera
Everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera
If they're all about to trash you---Lyrics submitted by Y.
