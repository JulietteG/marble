In the dark we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from the world outside we know
In your lips I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from our world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
Run away from the world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And it's my favorite part

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you ---
