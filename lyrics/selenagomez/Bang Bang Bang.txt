Yeah X3
Woahh X2
Ohh

My new boy used to be a model
He looks way better than you X2
My new boy gets it, how to get me
His love is deeper you know
He's a real keeper you know

Bang Bang Bang
I'm breakin in
Stealing all my love back
Givin it to him

Bang Bang Bang
This time I win
I thought your love was all that
'Til I let him in

Woahh

You're gonna be the one X4
That's hoping

woahh

You're gonna be the one X2
When I'm out havin fun
You're gonna be the one
That's broken

woahh

My new boy knows the way I want it
He's got more swagger than you
He's got more swagger than you do

My new boy really likes to flaunt this
He's not hiding me you know
He's showing me off you know

Bang Bang Bang
I'm breakin in
Stealing all my love back
Givin it to him

Bang Bang Bang
This time I win
I thought your love was all that
'Til I let him in

You're gonna be the one X4
That's hoping

woahh

You're gonna be the one X2
When I'm out havin fun
You're gonna be the one
That's broken

woahh

I hope you slip and fall
All over my heart and just lay there alone
Yeah, you got what you wanted

On your hands and knees grasping for air 
Grasping for me
Baby don't hold your breath
I've moved onto the next

Woahh, onto the next one
On to the next one X2

Bang Bang Bang
I'm breakin in
Stealing all my love back
Givin it to him

Bang Bang Bang
This time I win
I thought your love was all that
'Til I let him in

You're gonna be the one X4
That's hoping

woahh

You're gonna be the one X2
When I'm out havin fun
You're gonna be the one
That's broken

woahh

Bang Bang Bang
I'm breakin in
Stealing all my love back
Givin it to him

Bang Bang Bang
This time I win
I thought your love was all that
