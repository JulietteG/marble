(Round & Round) 
Round & Round 
Round & Round 
Round & Round 

You see me standing there 
And act like you don't know me 
But last night you were calling me 
Saying you want me 

Oh why you always make me feel 
Like I'm the one that's crazy 
You feel my heart racing 
My, my heart racing 

Boy, I need you here with me 
We can't go on this way 
I'm falling hard for you 
All I can say 
We're going round & round 
We're never gonna stop going round & round 
We'll never get where we're going 
Round & round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
Cause I'm getting dizzy going 
Round & round & round 

You come to pull me close 
And whisper in my ear 
You always told me lies 
I've cried out all my tears 
I push my feelings to the side 
But then you bring them back 
Bring them back 
Now you got me singing 

Love me or love me not 
I'm staring at the clock 
I pick them flower petals off 
And then I watch them drop [x2] 

We're never gonna stop going 
Round & round 
We'll never get where we're going 
Round & round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
Cause I'm getting dizzy going 
Round & round & round 

Uoh uoh uoh 
Uoh uoh uoh 
Uoh uoh uoh ---
