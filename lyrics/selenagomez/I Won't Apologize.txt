You had me to get her and here I thought it was me.  I was changing, arranging,  my life to fix your lies its, all said, and all done, I gave it all for the long run, can she say, the same thing, I guess this  is good-bye and good-luck    I cant be what you want me to be

[chorus]
Im sorry for changing  Im sorry it had to be this way believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize for who I am (no, no)
remember the time when you said you were out with your best friend but it wasnt the best friend that you know i thought you meant and i used to accept it, I didnt know I could be free but I am and I wont go back 'cause you so dont deserve me    I dont even want to be her

[chorus]                              
Im sorry for changing Im sorry it had to be this way  believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize for who I am I thank you for this hopeless war because through the pain I am a lot stronger than before and now Im on I dont need you anymore Im sorry  

listen close I wont say this again Im sorry for changing Im sorry it had to be this way believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize for who I am Im sorry for changing Im sorry it isnt like it was believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize, why should I apologize, no i wont apologize for who I am---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
