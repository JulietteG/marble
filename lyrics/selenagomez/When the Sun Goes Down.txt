Been a long day
Waiting for the night to come
I check my iPhone
Let me see what's going on, going on, going on
Help me DJ (DJ DJ)
Play my favorite song
Make the speakers shake, speakers shake
Now everybody want to sing along, sing along

When the night is here
The only thing on my mind
Is having a good time
When the moon appears
You can always hear us say

The party doesn't start till the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody out when the sun goes down, ah ah ah
The music isn't on till it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down (x3)

Oh oh oh Yeah

Rushing my hands up
I'm feeling good now
On the dance floor
We can turn it inside out, inside out

When the night is here
The only thing on my mind
Is having a good time
With my friends 
That's real
You can always hear us say

The party doesn't start till the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody out whent the sun goes down, ah ah ah
The music isn't on till it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down (x3)

Oh oh oh Yeah

Down down down
The sun is going
Down down down
When the moon appears
You can always hear us say

When the stars come out
You can always hear us say

Oh oh oh Yeah

The party doesn't start till the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody out whent the sun goes down, ah ah ah
The music isn't on till it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down (x6)

Oh oh oh Yeah---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
