HEY! 
HEY! 
HEY! 
When you walk, You don't leave tracks 
When you talk they don't talk back, Believing every word you say 
But they don't know, they don't..don't know 
Secrets that you just cant keep, Promises that you made me 
You twisted it to suit yourself 
But now i know..i know, i know 

ooooooooooooooooooo 
Everything that i told you 
ooooooooooooooooooo 
and you just smile and then you 

Kiss and tell everything i say stuck inside your little brain 
everybody wants to know yeah 
lips that lie caught in your track sold me out and you just laugh said were friends till the end yeah but you 

Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 
(you don't mean it, you don't mean it) 
Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 

Wish that i could take it back, you want it all but you cant have that, people falling at your feet 
They don't know, They don't..don't know 

Their going to figure out real soon the dirty deeds will catch up to you its crumbling underneath your feet 
but you don't know you don't..don't know 

ooooooooooooooooooo 
Everything that i told you 
ooooooooooooooooooo 
and you just smile and then you 

Kiss and tell everything i say stuck inside your little brain 
everybody wants to know yeah 
lips that lie caught in your track sold me out and then you just laugh said were friends until the end yeah but you 

Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 
(you don't mean it, you don't mean it) 
Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 

ooooooooooooooooooo 
Everything that i told you 

ooooooooooooooooooo 
Everything that i told you 

ooooooooooooooooooo 
you just smile and then you 

Kiss and tell everything i say stuck inside your little brain 
everybody wants to know yeah 
lips that lie caught in your track sold me out and then you just laugh said were friends until the end yeah but you 

Kiss and tell everything i say stuck inside your little brain 
everybody wants to know yeah 
lips that lie caught in your track sold me out and then you just laugh said were friends until the end yeah but you 


Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 
(you don't mean it, you don't mean it) 
Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 
Don't mean it 
(you don't mean it, you don't mean it) 
Don't mean it 
Don't mean it---Lyrics submitted by ruth.
