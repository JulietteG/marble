I wouldn't wanna be anybody else. Hey.
You made me insecure
Told me I wasnt good enough
But who are you to judge
When youre a diamond in the rough
Im sure you got some things
Youd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldnt want to be anybody else

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na 

Im no beauty queen
Im just beautiful me

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

Youve got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus]
Who says
Who says youre not perfect
Who says youre not worth it
Who says youre the only one thats hurting
Trust me
Thats the price of beauty
Who says youre not pretty
Who says youre not beautiful
Who says

[Selena Gomez - Verse 2]
Its such a funny thing
How nothings funny when its you
You tell em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
Its like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Wont let you touch the sky



Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

Im no beauty queen
Im just beautiful me

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

Youve got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus]
Who says
Who says youre not perfect
Who says youre not worth it
Who says youre the only one thats hurting
Trust me
Thats the price of beauty
Who says youre not pretty
Who says youre not beautiful

[Bridge]
Who says
Who says youre not star potential
Who says youre not presidential
Who says you cant be in movies
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you dont pass the test
Who says you cant be the best
Who said, who said
Wont you tell me who said that
Yeah, oh
Who says

[Chorus]
Who says
Who says youre not perfect
Who says youre not worth it
Who says youre the only one thats hurting
Trust me
Thats the price of beauty
Who says youre not pretty
Who says youre not beautiful
Who says?---Lyrics submitted by marisela.
