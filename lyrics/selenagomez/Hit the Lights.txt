It's the boy you never told "I like you"
It's the girl you let get away
It's the one you saw that day on the train
but you freaked out and walked away

It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
things you swear you'll do before you die
It's the city of love that waits for you
but your too damn scared to fly

chorus: 
Hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight
come alive
let the moment take you
lose control tonight (x2)

It's the time that you totally screwed up
still you're trying to get it out your brain
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up
It's the past you're dying to change

It's all the money that you're saving
while the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true
cause your too damn scared to try

chorus (x2)

It's a mad mad world
gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world
when you go all the way

hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight

So let's go go go go
all the way
yeah let's go go go go
night and day
from the floor to the rafters
people raise your glasses
we could dance forever

chorus (x1)

It's a mad mad world
gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world
when you go all the way

hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight....---Lyrics submitted by Kaela.
