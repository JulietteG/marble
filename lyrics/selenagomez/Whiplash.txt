Baby no lights, 
Hits the spotlight, 
I'm in my fly, 
To take you away.
I'm feelin so free, 
You're makin me crazy, 
That's what you do, 
That's what you do, 
Lets go now.

Lickety split, 
You fell in a bash, 
She falls in a pit saying "hello darling", 
Twisted insanity, 
Falling humanity, 
All that I want is some tranquility, 
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on boy.

Chorus:
Come on and take me to the other side, 
I'm gonna wait, I wanna look into your eyes, 
I'm so in love, I think I'm gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.
It's up to you and I don't wanna give you clues, 
I'm goin fast, I think we got enough to lose, 
Don't look back or else were gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.

Like a first kiss, 
With the sweet list, 
Of some love song, 
Oh yeah.
With this melody, 
Fallin over me, 
It makes me weak, 
So damn weak, 
So lets go now.

Lickety split, 
You fell and a bash, 
She falls in a pit saying "hello darling", 
Twisted insanity, 
Fallen humanity, 
All I want is some tranquility, 
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on boy.

Chorus:
Come on and take me to the other side, 
I'm gonna wait, I wanna look into your eyes, 
I'm so in love, I think I'm gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.
It's up to you and I don't wanna give you clues, 
I'm goin fast, I think we got enough to lose, 
Don't look back or else were gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.

Bridge:
Lalalalalalala 
Lalalalalalala 
Lala lalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lala lalala
So lets go now

Chorus:
Come on and take me to the other side, 
I'm gonna wait, I wanna look into your eyes, 
I'm so in love, I think I'm gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.
It's up to you and I don't wanna give you clues, 
I'm goin fast, I think we got enough to lose, 
Don't look back or else were gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
