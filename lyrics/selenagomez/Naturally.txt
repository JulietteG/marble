How you choose to express yourself 
It's all your own and I can tell 
It comes naturally, it comes naturally 

You follow what you feel inside 
It's intuitive, you don't have to try 
It comes naturally, mmmm it comes naturally 

And it takes my breath away 

You are the thunder and I am the lightening 
And I love the way you know who you are 
And to me it's exciting 
When you know its meant to be 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
When you're with me, baby 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
Bay bay baby 

You have a way of moving me 
A force of nature, your energy 
It comes naturally (You know it does) 
It comes naturally 
Mmmm yeah 

And it takes my breath away (Everytime) 
What you do, so naturally 

You are the thunder and I am the lightening 
And I love the way you know who you are 
And to me it's exciting 
When you know its meant to be 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
When you're with me, baby 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
Bay bay baby 

When we collide, sparks fly 
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away 

(You are) 
You are the thunder and I am the lightening 
And I love the way you know who you are 
And to me it's exciting 
When you know its meant to be 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
When you're with me, baby 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
Bay bay baby
