You're so hot (not?)
But if I can be honest
Baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool (not?)
But if you didn't notice
You got me playing a fool
With you
Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way

You're so... you (ew, grows)
But there's something about ya
It's making me feel like I do
With you
Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be true
We will
I'm all about you
If it's real
You got me sick
Cause I'm not letting go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way. ---
