I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Ah, but she can't take you any way
You don't already know how to go

And I got a peaceful, easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

I get this feeling I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

'Cause I get a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing, I'm already standing
Yes I'm already standing on the ground---
