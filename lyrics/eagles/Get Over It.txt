I turn on the tube and what do I see 
A whole lotta people cryin' "Don't blame me" 
They point their crooked little fingers ar everybody else 
Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves 
Victim of this, victim of that 
Your momma's too thin; your daddy's too fat 

Get over it 
Get over it 
All this whinin' and cryin' and pitchin' a fit 
Get over it, get over it 

You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash 
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash 
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right 
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight 
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king 
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing 

Get over it 
Get over it 
If you don't want to play, then you might as well split 
Get over it, Get over it 

It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak 
You're makin' the most of your losin' streak 
Some call it sick, but I call it weak 

You drag it around like a ball and chain 
You wallow in the guilt; you wallow in the pain 
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown 
Got your mind in the gutter, bringin' everybody down 
Complain about the present and blame it on the past 
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass 

Get over it 
Get over it 
All this bitchin' and moanin' and pitchin' a fit 
Get over it, get over it 

Get over it 
Get over it 
It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit 
Get over it, get over it ---Lyrics submitted by Paul Purcell Sr..
