They were duelin', doolin-dalton
High or low, it was the same
Easy money, and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain 
Go down, bill dalton, it must be god's will
Two brothers lyin' dead in coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood 
Lay down your lay books now, 
They're no damn good.
Better keep on movin', doolin-dalton 
'til your shadow sets you free 
If you're fast, and if you're lucky 
You will never see that hangin' tree 

Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains 
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waitin' for the names 
And a man could use his back, or use his brains 
But some just went stir crazy, lord, 'cause nothin' ever changed 
'til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton 
He was workin' cheap, just bidin' time 
Then he laughed and said,'i'm goin,' 
And so he left that peaceful life behind 
Mmm...---Lyrics submitted by Leeanne Hart.
