Late at night as I lay down to sleep
I think of all the secrets people keep
like how I feel for you
do you feel it too
or is it something we have to resume

We're just two people watching time fly by
in a world and it's obvious decline
but we are young and strong
we can carry on
find a little paradise of our own

'Cos no one saves the day
it's no one else's fault
if you're a day late or dollar short

Just think about how lovely life could be
excluding all the man-made misery
If we're too far behind
and really out of time
is there another world they plan to find?

Too many dreams of youth
that we never caught
Just a day late or dollar short

All the loneliness, the blues
feelings so distraught
when you're a day late or dollar short

Too many dreams of youth
that we never caught
just a day late or dollar short

And no one saves the day
it's no one else's fault
when you're a day late or dollar short---Lyrics submitted by Anniina.
