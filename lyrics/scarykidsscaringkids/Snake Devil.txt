All her systems go
this one she's outta control
She lost her grip, I think she fell off the edge
She sinks her teeth in, there's no letting go
we all come to find, she's just a snake
a snake devil

This is not up for discussion
Now we're a thing of the past
And I won't live to see the sunrise

She says I want you to know, before you let me go
it's your fault, I'm demoralized
But I won't let what she says, go to my head.
No, not again

She's taking over the world, one heart at a time
She'll chew you up and spit you out, like nothing
It's not her problem, well now we know
She's nothing more than just a snake, a snake devil

I won't live to see the sunrise
it's just a matter of time, only a matter of time
And I won't live to see the sunrise

She says I want you to know, before you let me go
it's your fault, I'm demoralized
But I won't let what she says, go to my head
No, not again

And I won't live to see the sunrise
No, I'd rather just die, than listen to your lies
No, I won't live to see the sunrise

You've already done the damage
We're a thing of the past
She's just a snake devil---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
