I swear that if i could
I'd take it all
Take it all away
All the sorrow and the pain
I'm not responsible
You always say
But you need your space
And this always ends the same

Hey, is your heart still beating?
I can't stop the bleeding
I've lost you completely
Hey, gather all the heartache
I'll hold it in my hand
Just to lose it all again

If there's a bright side
To this suffering
Can you help me see?
It's getting harder to believe
You always said this
Would not last long
But it's gone on and on and on
And i just can't make it stop

Hey, is your heart still beating?
I can't stop the bleeding
I've lost you completely
Hey, gather all the heartache
I'll hold it in my hand
Just to lose it all again

They're right this time
I wont pretend to smile
Because inside
I'm black and
I am hollow

This time you've
Took this way too far 
[x5]

I'm sick and tired
Inside, inside i'm black and hollow
Find a sign tonight
Inside i'm black and hollow
Find a sign tonight 
And now there's nothing left to show for

I'm dying to find 
What's missing from my life
And now the tables have turned
And this is only temporary

I'm dying to find 
What's missing from my life
And now the tables have turned
This pain is only temporary---Lyrics submitted by AubreyAnna.
