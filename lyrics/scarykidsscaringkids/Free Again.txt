Hey?
Are we out of our minds?
We can't live this way forever, forever.
So run run with me from the ordinary.
It's our time to escape.
Lose ourselves.

If we could find a way to break this chain regain the natural cycle.
Leave your riches behind
We'll be richer inside.
If we could find the strength to go our own way, to go our own way.
It will take your breath away would take your breath away.

Hey?
Are we out of our minds?
We can't live this way forever, forever.
So run run with me from the ordinary.
Come on!
It's our time to escape.
Lose ourselves.

We've finally found a way to make the change. 
We'll make the change together.
Old ways been left behind, chains will loosen over time.
We've finally found the strength to go our own way to go our own way.
No longer are we confined. 
The power of resolution shines.
Now we are free again we are free again.
We are free again.

Do I have your attention?
Look what we can create.
It will take your breath away
will take your breath away.
Away
Do I have your attention
Now's our time to escape.
Find the strength to go our own way
Now we are free again we are free again
Again
Now we are free again we are free again
Again
Again
We are free again.---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
