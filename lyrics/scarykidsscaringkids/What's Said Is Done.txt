We watch these days go by
The seasons changed and faded away,
and the the things I've learned to love grow old and die
(no reason why, no reason why, no reason why, no reason why)
cause life's too short to spend alone in misery
Everybody seems to look the same
I feel so alone and now my head is bowed in shame again,
so I look to the heart of the devil for answers

This path is like a loaded gun
but what's said is done
you don't have to say a word

I'm so afraid to ask
I turn my back, block out the past
find me something true that isn't sad
I'm so afraid to ask
this solace never seems to last
I turn away as the sunshine fades to black

I spend my nights and days
Locked away there all the same
I don't know how much more I can take
(what's left to say, what's left to say, what's left to say, what's left to say)
cause life's too short to spend alone in misery

This path is like a loaded gun
but what's said is done
you don't have to say a word

This path is like a loaded gun
but what's said is done
you don't have to say a word

This path is like a loaded gun
but what's said is done
you don't have to say a word
to say a word, to say a word

I'm so afraid to ask
I turn my back, block out the past
find me something true that isn't sad

I'm so afraid to ask
this solace never seems to last
I turn away as the sunshine fades to black

I'm so afraid to ask
I turn my back, block out the past
find me something true that isn't sad

This path is like a loaded gun
but what's said is done
you don't have to say a word...---Lyrics submitted by Britany.
