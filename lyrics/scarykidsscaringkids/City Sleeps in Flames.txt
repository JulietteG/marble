The empire will fall like they planned on
Can we even last through the night?
We watch as the skyscrapers crumble
Under the burning blue sky
That blinds our eyes

This is our last chance
To make things right
A world lost forever
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Let's try to find a place to sleep
It's going on days that we've been awake
A sadness that I've never seen
I said your name and you looked the other way

Because these are my last words
And this is my last breath
I'd give you everything
If there was something left
I have nothing left to prove
And I will live with my regrets
I'd give you everything
If there was something left


The disconnecting count of days
Are fading away, the lives that we made
Tear drops will spill from your blue eyes
Intentions were wrong, I apologize
The empire is falling
Like they planned on and we lost it all
The city sleeps in flames

Lost...
Time...
Everything's gonna be fine. Right?
Everything's gonna be fine. Right?
Everything's gonna be fine. Right?
I can't find a way to live in this life

The empire will fall like they planned on
Can we even last through the night
We watch as the skyscrapers crumble
Under the burning blue sky
That blinds our eyes

Because these are my last words
And this is my last breath
I'd give you everything
If there was something left
I've got nothing left to prove
And I will live with my regrets
I'd give you everything
If there was something left

Because these are my last words
And this is my last breath
I'd give you everything
But I've got nothing left---Lyrics submitted by AubreyAnna.
