There goes the sun!

Just trying to find your way anywhere...
But you've come to find your alone...
Its getting dark and you've lost your way...
I haven't let you go,
as long as you know that,

Im losing whats left of my dignity,
But I'll fight till the end for her heart.
I'll never give up on whats possibly,
For better for worse,
This love must be cursed...

Just trying to keep your head down,
But you've come to find that trust has come and gone.
Everyone out there is listening,
But you don't care at all,
And you're probably glad to know,

I'm losing whats left of my dignity,
But I'll fight till the end for her heart.
I'll never give up on whats possibly,
For better for worse,
This love must be cursed...

You've already let it pass through your lips,you cant take it back now.
You've already let it pass through your lips, you cant take it back.
You've already let it pass through your lips,you cant take it back now.
You've already let it pass through your lips,you cant take it back now.

I'm losing whats left of my dignity,
But I'll fight till the end for her heart.
I'll never give up on whats possibly,
For better or worse,
This love must be cursed.

Holding on to her.
(This love must be cursed)
Holding on to her.
(This love must be cursed)
I'm holding on.

Im afraid to say she never made it home.
Couldnt keep her head on.
She was so close.
Im afraid to say she never made it home [x5]---Lyrics submitted by mark.
