Stand up!
You know you have the right too!
Speak out
For the things you that you believe!
if we let them
And they will stab you in the back over again
Take your integrity

How long will you let this go on
They're drowning you in fear

Speak up!
Your voice just isn't breaking through
It's time now!
It's gone on way too long
if we let them
They will tear you into little pieces
I think there is something wrong

How long will you let this go on?
They're drowning you in fear

You're letting your hopes go straight to hell
and i know the end is near,is near

The time will come
The time will come
The time will come
You will be sorry for what you've done
The time will come

How long will you let this go on?
They're drowning you in fear

You're letting your hopes go straight to hell
And i know the end is near, is near

You say you're sorry
For what its worth---Lyrics submitted by AubreyAnna.
