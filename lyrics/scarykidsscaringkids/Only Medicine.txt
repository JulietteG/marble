I wash it down
Just to block out all the sound
I never thought I'd be alone
Well look at me now

Sleepless nights, painful goodbyes
Who the hell was I kidding?
The room starts to spin
All alone and bleeding once again
Can you help me make this.. make this fucking end?

Oh my god there must be something
Something to take the pain away
And so there's nothing you can give me
It's probably better off that way

Just forget, all I ever wanted was to forget
Bloodshot eyes and a starless sky
Who the hell are we kidding?

You look so content
I guess the bright side hasn't found me yet
Pull me out so I can catch my breath

Oh my god there must be something
Something to take the pain away
And so there's nothing you can give me
It's probably better off that way

I live my life in the shadows of the things I try to hide

Oh my god there must be something
Something to take the pain away
And so there's nothing you can give me
It's probably better off that way---Lyrics submitted by nutmeg.
