Would you agree that we're far from all right?
(We fall below the line! We fall below the standards!)
If only you could see
What we see through these eyes
(This plague is spreading, it will sink under your skin!)

I won't believe the horror that I see
It's more than your poison inside me

Lets tear away these faces we hide behind
Cutting through the airwaves
Open up our minds
Show ourselves to the world tonight
Cause we are.. No longer in disguise!

Well, Im aware of your lies, how do you sleep at night?
(It's all a matter of time, I think their catching on)
You dream of wars, that I refuse to fight
(While people disappear, another broken heart)

I won't believe the horror that I see
It's more than your poison inside me
I won't let go, while the plague is spreading
I won't let go

Let's tear away these faces we hide behind
Cutting through the airwaves
Open up our minds
Show ourselves to the world tonight
Cause we are No longer in disguise!

We can save ourselves
(Rise Up!)
You can't stop us
We can save our soul
(Rise Up!)
We dont need your help
We can save ourselves
(Rise Up!)
You cant stop us

Let's tear away these faces we hide behind
Cutting through the airwaves
Open up our minds
Show ourselves to the world tonight
Cause we are No longer in disguise!

Tear away these faces
Tear away these faces
Tear away these faces

We're no longer in disguise!---Lyrics submitted by CARLA.
