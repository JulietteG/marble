Time is becoming
More precious than gold
All those times wasted alone
Starving children the poison waters
And the suffocating skies
We won't get another chance this time
We won't get a second chance this time

You'll be lucky if you make it out alive
Haven't we lost our minds?
What the hell were we all thinking?
Now they're choosing sides
This is the world
This is the world

A virus known as rage
Is brutally destroying
And spreading all over the place
A bleeding culture
A dying nation
When the money controls the tide
We won't get another chance this time
We won't get a second chance this time

You'll be lucky if you make it out alive
Haven't we lost our minds?
What the hell were we all thinking?
Now they're choosing sides
Well this is the world as we know it
Have we lost our minds?

The tension is rising and rising
And the world is at stake
Take back what belongs to you, by God
Before it's to late
TAKE IT BACK!
TAKE IT BACK!
TAKE IT BACK!

So close your eyes
And paint the picture
The sunset staring back
Won't last forever, forever
Just close your eyes
And paint the picture
'Cause the world we could've had
Would have been better, much better
Just close your eyes
And paint the picture
'Cause the sunset staring back
Won't last forever, forever---Lyrics submitted by clarisse.
