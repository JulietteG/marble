Don't tell me im afriad of waking up alone
When it's waking up to find you've gone
Now you make it clear I had my chances
Only one way left to go so i'll follow it down 
She goes straight straight for the deep end
Deosn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now 
Be careful now

So she's traded my love for comfort
Gives it all away
So much for that happy ending
Now you make it clear you've got your options
Only one way left to go so i'll follow it down
She can't hold her own who would've known?
She is misery's company
She's got no place to go no place to call home 
Shes got misery's company

She goes straight straight for the deep end
Deosn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now 
Be careful now
Be careful, be careful now

She only comes to me in my dreams so sleep becomes routine
It's not healthy it's what makes you right
It's not healthy it's what makes you
She only comes to me to me in my dreams so sleep becomes addictive
It's not healthy it's what makes you right
It's not healthy it's what makes you
Hold her strength to harden my dreams 
It's not healthy it's what makes you right
It's not healthy it's what makes you

She goes straight straight for the deep end 
Deosnt hesitate to dive right in
She goes straight straight for the deep end
Deosn't hesitate to dive right in 
Be careful now
Be careful now
Be careful---Lyrics submitted by Elisa.
