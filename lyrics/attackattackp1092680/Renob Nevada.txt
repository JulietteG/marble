Go .
Your words are just as simple as the next
You know my heart meant no disrespect
It seems that there is nothing left
No honor, no respect
Your mind is just as confused as the next
Keep your opinion to yourself

Go take your opinion with you
Cause I dont want to hear it
Go take your decisions with you
Cause I dont need to hear them

Your voice is clawing at my ears all day
Leaving me restless and plaguing my mind
Your lies are clouding up my thoughts everyday
Seeing your motives realizing its jealousy

No honor, no respect
No honor, no respect

Your voice is clawing at my ears all day leaving me restless and plaguing my mind your lies are clouding up my thoughts everyday seeing your motives realizing its jealousy

You wear your jealousy on your sleeve
Why so much hate?
I cant pull myself away
People like you just waste my time
Keep your opinions to yourself

Go take your opinion with you
Cause I dont want to hear it
Go take your decision with you
Cause I dont need to hear them

Go.---Lyrics submitted by janae.
