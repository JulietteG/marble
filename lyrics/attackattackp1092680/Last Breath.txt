Is this my last breath?
Is this my last breath?
Oh... Yeah
Is this my last breath?
Is this my last breath?

I can't breathe, I'm choking on my own condeseding words.
Answer me! Will you ever answer me?

Aren't you gonna answer me?
When I'm crying out your name and I'm lost in shame.
Lead me on my way and give me words to say.
Words to say!
And I can't see, that I've lost my way.
Carry me, cause my heart is weak.

Is this my last breath?
Is this my last breath?
I can't sleep, this world inside my head is run by my anxious thoughts.
Give me peace,
Will you bring me off my knees?

Aren't you gonna answer me?
When I'm crying out your name and I'm lost in shame.
Lead me on my way,
and give me words to say.
Words to say!
And I can't see,
that I've lost my dreams.
Carry me,
cause my heart is weak.

Is this my last breath?
Is this my last breath?

Woah...

Oh!

I've been trying aimlessly,
over and over,
to fill this void inside of me.

My mind's in a cage,
and I'm on my knees.
On my knees!

I can feel a shift go on in my head,
am I going crazy?

And I can't see,
that I've lost my dreams!
Carry me,
cause my heart is weak!

Answer me!
