Oh the blood, oh the blood,
Oh the massacre.
Oh the blood, oh the blood,
Oh the massacre.

Your love will run and hide,
And leave me on my own,
The true one will fall,
So hard baby and that's why this hurts
I always thought that you would be the one
But baby,  just give me a chance

This is the last chance you get what you want,
And I'll never be the one to turn on you,
And I get what I want and said,
I'll do anything, anything for you.

I'll pull apart this possibility,
From one night stands,
You give it away for just one night,
I give you all I had.

I always thought that you would be the one
But baby,  just give me a chance
I always thought that you would be the one
But baby,  just give me a chance

Oh the blood, oh the blood,
Oh the massacre.
Oh the blood, oh the blood,
Oh the massacre.---Lyrics submitted by Cristina.
