Open your eyes, we live in filth and misery.
Listen to what I saw, do something that'll last forever.
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
And now I've got to find a simple Escape.

All I need, All I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind, as it struggles to be sane.
An escape from everything, finding changes on the inside.

Why do we focus, on the things that don't matter.
Listen to what I say, still something that will last forever
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?
And now I've got to find a simple escape.

All I need, all I need is a simple escape.
Can't you see my mind, as it struggles to be sane.
And Escape from everything, finding changes on the inside.

(Oh, oh oh, ooo.)

Don't hold you breathe for the things that you seek.
They will all burn to the ground with everything.
We are all looking for our freedom, from the things we want to run from.

(And all I need, all I need is a simple escape can't you see my mind..)
And it struggles to be sane.
All I need, all I need is a simple escape.
Can't you see my mind, as it struggles to be sane.
An escape from everything, finding changes on the inside.

Open your eyes, yeaaah.---Lyrics submitted by Griffin.
