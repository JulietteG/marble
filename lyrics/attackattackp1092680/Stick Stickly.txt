You never said that this would be easy,
so go on live,
you never said that this would be easy,
so go on live.

WOOOOOO!

This is the best part of the message,
and it only took one.

We live for what He's worth,
and thats more than youll know.
He died for what He loved,
and what he loved was you.

Ill wait for you,
you know ill wait for you,
ill wait for you,
you know ill wait for you.

You never said that this would be easy,
so go on live,
you never said that this would be easy,
so go on live.

Bow your head,
Go on live.

This is the time to let yourself go,
Lord pick me off the ground,
you never said this would be simple,
so pull me in and turn around---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
