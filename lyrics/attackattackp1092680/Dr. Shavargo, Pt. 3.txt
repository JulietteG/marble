As always its all for you
As always its all for you
As always its all for you
As always

I'm all yours, just take me now
I'm all yours, just take me now
I'll rip out your heart and your eyes until,
you see the love I have inside,
for you carry on this way,
and I will go and learn the truth.
I will go and let this down for me,
and its all for you,
take me never let me go,
take me, I'll go and seek the truth

I cannot live without you near,
I cant go on without you here,
you're the reason why,
Simply because you're everything,
I want and more.

Take my hand, I'll keep you safe,
take my hand.
Take my hand, I'll keep you safe,
take my hand.

The truth will set you free,
just hold my hand,
I'll keep you safe, I know you're confused,
but I will always refuse to take you for granted.

Ill rip out your heart and your eyes until,
you see the love I have inside,
for you, carry on this way, till you will go
and see the truth.

Come on girl, I've been waiting for you to make your move
Come on girl, I've been waiting for you to make your move
As always its all for you
As always its all for you---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
