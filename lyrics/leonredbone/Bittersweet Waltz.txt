Some say that life's an illusion
Who knows what's false or what's true
The distant horizon can be quite surprisin'
When finally the journey is through.

With all of its glories and all of its faults. It seems life is a bittersweet waltz.

Some say the grass is much greener once you get over the fence
If that's your objective, beware of perspective
Illusions don't always make sense.

In all of its glories and all of its faults. It seems life is a bittersweet waltz.

You'll never know what you're holding
Till it starts slipping away,
Your best protection is show some affection
To those who are with you today.

In all of its glories and all of its faults. It seems life is a bittersweet waltz.---Lyrics submitted by macabies.
