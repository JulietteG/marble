I built my fences too high
Had nowhere to go
No one could get inside
I was alone

I dug my trenches too deep
Couldn't see the sky
And then a bullet hit me
And I came alive

Oooh, I finally found a way
To open up and say I wanna let you in
I've kept you on the outside such a very long time

And now I see what i've been missing
All this time I took second guessing
Now I need to take a chance on me

I didn't want to be tied down
But now I see
Not being tied down ain't the same as being free
Yeah, you set me free, yeah

Oooh, I've finally found a way
To open up and say I wanna let you in
I've kept you on the outside such a very long time

Now I see what I've been missing
All this time I took second guessing
Now I need to take a chance on me
Yeah

No man is an island
No point in acting tough
We all need someone to make us smile
To make us cry
To make us love

I wanna let you in
I''ve kept you on the outside such a very long time
Oooh, I've finally found a way
to open up and say I wanna let you in
I've kept you on the outside such a very long, long time

And now I see what I've been missing
All this time I took second guessing
Now I see what I've been missing
All this time I took second guessing
Now I see
Oh, I need 
To take a chance on me---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
