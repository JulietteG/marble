The strongest structures ever built
 Are the ones that dont get built at all
 And the kind of bricks that dont get laid
 Are the only kind that never fall

He taught himself how not to lose
 By never really trying to win
 Thats how the man in front of you became
 The boy who never

Im afraid of what might happen if
 Together we build a wall
 Cause the only kind of love that never gets built
 Is the only kind of love that never falls
 So Ill forfeit future tears of joy to save us both from pain
 I could kiss you now but Id only miss you more
 When I walk away When I walk away

I never let my heart speak through my lips
 I never let my hands rest on your hips
 I never said I love you
 But a heart never lies
 I know you heard me say it when I said it with my eyes

So Ill forfeit future tears of joy to save us both from pain
 I could kiss you now but Id only miss you more

He taught himself how not to lose
 By never really trying to win
 Thats how the man in front of you became
 The boy who never The boy who never---Lyrics submitted by Lori Brown.
