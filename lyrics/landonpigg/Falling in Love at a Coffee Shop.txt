I think that possibly
Maybe I'm falling for you
Yes
There's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you

I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down 
I want to come too 

I think that possibly
Maybe I'm falling for you

No one understands me quite like you do 
Through all of the shadowy corners of me 

I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much 
All of the while I never knew 

I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much 
All of the while I never knew 

I think that possibly
Maybe I'm falling for you
Yes
There's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you

I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine 
Now I'm shining too 

Because
Oh 
Because I've fallen quite hard over you

If I didn't know you I'd rather not know
If I couldn't have you I'd rather be alone

I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much 
All of the while I never knew 

I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew

All of the while
All of the while it was you
You
You
You---Lyrics submitted by darbie.
