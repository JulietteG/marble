I've been kicked,
And I've been ripped
I've been thorned, baby
And I've been stripped

But the saddest thing to say
Is that I blew my life away
Now there's nothing left to do
Now that I wasted all my days waiting for you
Waiting for you (x2)

As time goes bye
I can't sleep
I can't live baby
And I can't eat
Days are long, and getting longer
And the pain baby,
Pain is getting stronger

But the saddest thing to say
Is that I blew my life away
Now there's nothing left to do
Now that I've wasted all my days waiting for you
Waiting for you (2x)

I'll never get you,
You ain't mine to take
Don't even know you,
You ain't mine to take

But the saddest thing to say
Is that I blew my life away
Now there's nothing left to do
Now I wasted all my days waiting for you
Waiting for you (x3)
