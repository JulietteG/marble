Years pass and the seasons change
Hopes that drown within life's pouring rain
Time weighs on the strands of faith
End of days, for you I wait

As I cross these oceans of time
Just so I can make you mine
These eyes of burden
I shall make blind
Just so I can make you mine

Thoughts of you
My world, it smiles
The cold embrace
Of one's endless mile
The snow that falls upon disheartened faith
End of days, for you I wait

As I cross these oceans of time
Just so I can make you mine
These eyes of burden
I shall make blind
Just so I can make you mine---
