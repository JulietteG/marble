Sittin sippin sorrow
Its gone straight to my head
I say the pain shall come and it shall go
a friend once said

You aint livin for no God, no
You be livin for the dollar sign
I say a frown upon your makers face
you shall find

So....Ooooh soo much wrong
You have tried, oh yeah

I waited far
Oooh far too long, yeah

Talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song
Im talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song

Wanting to know nothing
Living through a childs eyes
A smile comes upon your face
as I break and cry

If nothing seems to matter
In the end what are you doin it for
To see the trail of twisted broken souls
across the floor

So....Ooooh soo much wrong, yeah
Youve done tried, oh yeah

I waited far
Lord, I waited far too long (yeah)

Talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song
Im talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song

Ooooh so much wrong, child
You done tried, oh yeah

I waited far
Lord, I waited far too long, yeah

Talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song
Im talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song

yeah

Talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song
Im talking about your Evil Ways
And the pen that wrote this song

oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
