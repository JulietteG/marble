It'll leave you with nothin' to say
Lost without a way
Ain't it funny child
Love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday
Hoping to hold a handful of sunshine
Like a child told it cannot play
Never ever figured Lord love would leave me feeling
As dead as yesterday

Lord could you help me find some shelter?
Lord could you help me find some shelter?

It'll leave you feeling hollow & helpless
And there is where you'll stay
Ain't it funny child love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday---Lyrics submitted by Pierre.
