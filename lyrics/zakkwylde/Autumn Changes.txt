As I stand upon these shores of lies and deceit
The tides that turn against you
And the storms that one cannot see
Just like a storm that keeps on rolling
Forever rolling on
My autumn changes have come and gone
Like the falling leaves and the memory of what you've become

The cold wind blows upon your senseless fall from grace
Behind the mask of greed, I could not see your face
Just like a storm that keeps on rolling
Forever rolling on
My autumn changes have come and a gone
Like the falling leaves and the memory of what you've become
My autumn changes have come and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone...---
