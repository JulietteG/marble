Now that the storms have come and gone
And the war has begun to fade
All that the rains have gathered and washed away

Farewell to what remains
And as the setting sun disappears into the sea
And all that meant so much
Now it's nothing more than a forgotten memory

The hollow shadow of the clouds
So far yet always near
Scattering of ashes
Upon all that's draped in black

Farewells without tears
And as the setting sun disappears into the sea
And all that meant so much
No longer means that much to me
Now it's nothing more, no it's nothing more
Than a forgotten memory

It's getting hard, so hard to see
For I've seen these clouds before
And as they pour the rain down on me
For I shall carry on, I'll carry on
It's nothing more than a forgotten memory

Farewells without tears
And as the setting sun disappears into the sea
And all that meant so much
No longer means that much to me
Now it's nothing more
No it's nothing more than a forgotten memory---
