For here I stand
Broken pieces of the memories that fall through my hands
Taken for a fool
As they sharpen their knives
Stab me with my trust once again
So many sinners dressed as saints
Lies and the half truths they paint
Another day
Your memory fades

I shall not mourn
Yesterday's tears
All that is gone
And all that once was here
I shall not mourn the past
The days, the months or the years
Yesterday's tears

Saddened and betrayed
Yet unbroken, I walk amongst the liars and the thieves
Nothing ever lasts
It's been spoken
Compassion died, yet no one ever grieved
So many sinners dressed as saints
Lies and the half truths they paint
Another day
Your memory fades

I shall not mourn
Yesterday's tears
All that is gone
And all that once was here
I shall not mourn the past
The days, the months or the years
Yesterday's tears

All that's gone
All once was here---
