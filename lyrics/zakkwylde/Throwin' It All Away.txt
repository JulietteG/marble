You couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face.
You live in a world, a little out of place.
You couldn't here the ocean, you couldn't hear the waves.
I know you meant to come back, I know you meant to stay.
And all you touch, and all you knew.  and all you love, yeah.
Oh I can see you smile, can you see my tears.
I reach to hold you, but you ain't there.
You left a hole so big lord, beyond repair.
I try to find forgiveness in take'n what we will never share.
And all you touch, and all you knew.
And all you love, you just left me with nothing to say.
OOHH your just throwing it all away.
OOHH, no you didn't care to see the light of day
OOHH your just throwin' it all away
Like the sand's upon the shore, the crashin' waves, came took you away.---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
