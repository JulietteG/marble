Your self-made darkness has come and found
As the vultures gather and circle around
You stole my tomorrows, I buried my todays
All I loved - I watched its ashes fly away

Gone are my blue skies
You've painted them all black
With useless apologies
Some things in life you can't take back

As the sun rise awaits, so much left to see
You blinded my happiness, took everything from me
You stole my tomorrows, I buried my todays
All I love - I watched its ashes fly away

Gone are my blue skies
You've painted them all black
With useless apologies
Some things in life you can't take back---
