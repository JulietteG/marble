(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us

(Kanye West)
Mr. West is in the building
Swagger on a hundred thousand, trillion
Ayo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving do we even gotta question?
Hermes pastel I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means permanent so I guess I should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
Why he's so mad for? Why he gotta have it?
Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Na-Na-Na
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Na-Na-Na-Na-Na
Tryin' ta get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us

(Jay-Z)
(No one on the corner) Gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by jocking my fresh
Jockin' jockin' my fresh
Jockin' jockin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas know you thorough
And the girls say "Yes"
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks I'm a grad
And that all blue Yankee is my graduation cap, it's...
Hoooooooova
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hoooooooova
Could you even have any doubt that the doubt is over

(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us

(Lil Wayne)
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for these boi
I require what I desire, I got stripes, A-di-das
Mami scream "Papi no mas!"
Run up in your shit just me no mace
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagga' like these fo' guys
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
Type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special
Ha, what the fuck you boys talking about?
I know it's us cause we the only thing you talk about

(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
(And I'm gone)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
(Bye!)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us

(T.I.)
(Yea....You think?)You go see Weezy for the wordplay
Jeezy for the birdplay
Kan-yeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't living what you kickin' and you worthless
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me...
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstanding qualities
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that
But spitting real life on hot beats...
I'm the truth at, you kick it like me no exaggeration necessary
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
