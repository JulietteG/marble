Rappin for the hell of it
Hella rich never have to sell a brick again
Must I tell a bitch again
The Bullshit I'm addressing check I'm on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game I'm celibate
Rarely out my element,
Barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and one foot in intelligent as fellas get
Listen let's settle this
Be clear I could fall back seven years
Still ain't no one ahead of me

[Verse 1]:
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
Five star general
O.G. veteran
Caked like edimen
Blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury
Every single thing I ever done was done heavily
Rap until your seventy
Still ain't no catching me
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, Aunt Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
Ain't got long hot songs best cherish it
Whoever drop mine that's over, finito
You paying for your foul like a freethrow
Now how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the T.V.
You know I sold more mixtapes than your cd
Youre waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
You ain't made it far as DC on the low
I been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
Broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open just begging me to skeet! skeet!
You in a deep sleep stop dreaming
I'm 6 albums in for 10 years I been firin' hot semen
The limelights mine I'm gleaming
Beaming
That's why I say I'm King bitch
I got my reasons

[Chorus]:
Wrist so frosty
Neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that
Really? Is he?
Nigga I'm illy
Yeah! Haha haha, hey
I run this city
Clearly
Tell em get lost Im busy really
Nigga I'm illy

[Verse 2:]
Where niggas get off, piss off
Me and mine oughta take time to pop a lid off
Shit all over the way bouncing me is y'all
Seeing your fucking mind you figuring Im'a fizz off
Never cooled off Tip scorching
Minimal injury though they wishing me maximum misfortune
Number one hands down
Flow paints portraits
Everybody think you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some girl next door shit
A king go on sell 30 mil out the store quit
Of course this case lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
But Tip bankrupt according to your sources
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since Tupac
Before you rap bout me best ask bout me
I'm out my fucking mind need counseling
Please don't doubt me, trust me
Drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games till somebody start busting
Remember my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it better get to skedaddling
Pack your familys bags move 'em out to Seattle
You ever crawl back you'll need an ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous so extravagant
Mandarin, oriental worldwide traveling
Hip hop champion for real though
You couldnt fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga
But still though,

[Chorus (x2)]:
Wrist so frosty
Neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that
Really? Is he?
Nigga I'm illy
Yeah! Haha haha, hey
I run this city
Clearly
Tell em get lost Im busy really
Nigga I'm illy---Lyrics submitted by young.
