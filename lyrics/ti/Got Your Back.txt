(feat. Keri Hilson)

[T.I. Intro]

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.]
I got your back boy
We were high
We were low
but I promise I will never let you go
said I got I got I got I got your back boy
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(I know you got my back right)
keep my swagger
keep it looking good for ya
keep it looking hood for ya
shawty if you dont know
I got I got I got I got your back boy

[T.I. Verse 1]
Hey its whatever shawty
you aint gotta ask
yes Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check!
you can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses,
my missions to purchase Earth for her
present the gifts without the curse
her pleasure is my purpose
pleasure to be at your service
front row at fashion shows as well as Sunday morning service
but better days or for worse
if Im paid Im hurting in my pocket
she still got a n-gga back thats for sure
no matter what may occur in life
everyday with her is like a plus
Imma love her til she be like thats enough
pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill em up and lift em up
let us toast to the future heres to us
no, heres to her

[Keri Hilson - Bridge]
They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches me and you
stuck to your side like like like glue
be by your side whatever your gonna do

[Chorus]

[T.I. Verse 2]
This is for the women who man caught a sentence
who gon be there for a minute but they didnt keep their distance
they stayed home waiting on the phone
and on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
just wanna let you know we appreciate
everything you do for us on a day to day
and I know we dont show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
no bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
we do all thats in our power just to please you
see boo, f-ck them girls I would leave the World fore I leave you
may God say even now ()

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[T.I. Verse 3]
Sure enough
even though them chicks be hating on us
still Im gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon ride
make all my fantasies come alive
thats no lie now
Ill be () as long as your gon be beside me
10 million dollar mansions wont suffice
if you aint gon be in there with me at night
the pieces to my puzzles in my life
with all of my good days and all of my bad
you stood by your man and you know you got my back
worth every car every bag with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I aint never gon leave that
them b-tches best believe that
