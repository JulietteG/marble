[Chorus 2x:]
Do it [3x] what you waiting for
Do it [3x] what you waiting for
Do it [3x] what you waiting for
Now Lemme hear you say
Big shit popping, and little shit stopping [3x]
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option

Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational.
See I said I was king and them lames started laughing
Same sucker now I want the king on the track
I composed several classics
watch you know like top back, dope boys,
Bring 'em out, and what you know about that
Now they ask how I top what you know about that
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me raise hell, let 'em show just like that
Even Denzel say damn, I ain't know it like that
Nigga yea, still bank head you can tell
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail
Still kicking doors with them things in the air
Up in Beni Hauna's, see me slang in them chair
I will slang cane, no such thing as a jail
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale

[Chorus]

Do it like a ball player, when you see me balling
Stacks tall-ass ball player from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pulling out that pistol nigga who you think you finna scare?
20 rounds of missles have you pissing in your underwear
I tote a pair of 40 cals, so you better tone it down
I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it's going down
A-town, west side, Club Crucial catch me,
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the trap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted nigga I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down Nigga do the math
Think I won't pull up in something With 200 on the dash

[Chorus]

Do it like I wanna do it, do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimping I ain't seeing none of you
I Do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his momma too
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too
Do it for my daughters and my my youngest son momma who
go buy what she want cause she know it ain't a problem to.
You do something to them and its you I bring the Drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partner go make show them nigga stunting too
We doing with them choppers, ain't no problem where you running to?
We do it for the block, now why ain't nobody stopping me
I do it for my pop, and my cousins too they watching me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top, where I ought to be
Who do it this good, and do it different
No matter what I do you know I do it to death

[Chorus]

Now do it!---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
