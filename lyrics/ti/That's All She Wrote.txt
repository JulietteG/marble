[T.I] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
just as long as you dont call me rude 
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote 
streets like cold Chicago 
aint nothing new I've seen it all before 
but still I ball like no tomorrow 
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote 
all she wrote, all she wrote 

I said it's over with thats all she wrote 
all she wrote, all she wrote 
Goodnight its over with that's all she wrote 

[T.I Verse 1] 
Its stupid how I'm going on everybody knowing that 
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it 
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join 
others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn 
you tell lies, get caught, n-gga kick rocks 
you never did blend in with the big shots 
on the fast track, aint no need for no pit stops 
I just laugh at, n-gga wishing it was this hot 
guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off 
better that than pissed on 
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones 
catch me in the end zone 
high stepping prime time 
thought you n-ggas been on 
aint no blocking my shine 
like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time 
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes 
so call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time 
while I get stupid paper, hey my dough aint in its right mind 
(mind, mind) 

[Chorus] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
just as long as you dont call me rude 
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote 
streets like cold Chicago 
aint nothing new I've seen it all before 
but still I ball like no tomorrow 
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote 

[Eminem -Verse 2] 
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate 
Terrible fate, 
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape 
Cupid shot his arrow and missed 
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left. 
Mascara and egg smeared on your face 
Nights over goodbye, hoe 
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over 
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover 
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up, 
Any chick who's coming up after I blind fold her, 
To still come back to the crib, 
Must want me to mess with the mind hold up. 
She mistook me for some high roller. 
But i wont buy her a soda 
Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper) 
Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder. 
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya 
tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars 
you get your eyes swole up i'm on my straight grizzly 
so why would I buy you a gay ass teddy you're already bi-polar 

[Chorus 2 - Eminem] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
you can even call me cold 
these bitches know as soon as they saw me 
its never me to get the privilege to know 'em 
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go 
still I ball like there's no tomorrow until its over and thats all she wrote 

[T.I - Verse 3] 
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with 
But don't get mad at me 
go blame the chick who wrote this shit 
ya life is sure a bitch 
but she know I'm rich 
that why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick 
here I go again, 
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in 
Peso, Euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again 
see me posted in anything, wearing any chain 
never gon see me toting anything 
all you gon see is BANG! 
its so nice where I kick it, 
hate you never get to visit 
yeah I'm on another level 
but you n-ggas still can get it 
its all over 'fore you finish 
sorry bro this road we end it 
won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business 

[Eminem] 
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha aint it TIP 
and this one can say this shit 
shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief 
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine 
let em get a good taste of it 
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now, 
but in case you didnt 
this is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it 
life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it 
so I pace this shit a little bit quicker 
that clock come racing in double time in it 
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time 
it may take you pricks to catch on 
while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong 
man I still say K-mart's like theres an apostrophe-S on it dog 
and they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong 
but if you gon tell me that the A&W; aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg 

[T.I. Bridge] 
and on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane 
I'm as strong as they came 
they were gone 'fore they came 
now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys 
they just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty thats why 

[Eminem] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
you can even call me cold 
[T.I] 
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
Goodnight it's over with, thats all she wrote 
[Eminem] 
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go 
[T.I] 
But still I ball like there's no tomorrow 
Good night is over with thats all she wrote 
all she wrote, all she wrote 
I said its over with 
thats all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote 
"Goodnight it's over with" thats all she wrote---Lyrics submitted by anais.
