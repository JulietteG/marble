(feat. Iggy Azalea)

All I fuck is bad bitches
I dont want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Dont want no mediocre
I wont hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

Right hand in the air
I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she dont do her hair
No more, you wont get no dick if theres a bush down there
Girl I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
You come fuck with a nigga what better to do
He call to ask how you doin tell him better than you, yeah
Im kicked back with four pieces like a kit kat
Me fucking if you aint a dime, just forget that
Pretty face fat ass, if she dont have
Have one of these, well I think Ill pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back
You shoulda asked for a Benz
Thats mediocre bitch

All I fuck is bad bitches
I dont want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Dont want no mediocre
I wont hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

[Iggy Azalea]
Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice
Now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy
Rest in peace Whitney pardon me
But I dont think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get em a taste
Im still Grand Hustle first lady fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me

All I fuck is bad bitches
I dont want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Dont want no mediocre
I wont hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out dem tennis shoes
Throw some heels on a bitch
Im the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle
Drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can write this shit
No further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick
She wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach
From Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes
But Im looking for a cute bitch
You the shit
What she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around
Give a damn who you do it with
Super thick pretty face
Mnage  veinte
20 at the same time
Wanna get ya rent paid

All I fuck is bad bitches
I dont want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Dont want no mediocre
I wont hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
