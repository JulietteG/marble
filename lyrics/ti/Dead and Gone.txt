Chorus:
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy

Verse 1 (T.I.)
Ever had one of dem days u wish woulda stayd home
Run into a group of ni&&as; getting they hate on
U walk by they get wrong u reply then sh*t get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just u against them, pick one then rush em
Figure you'd get jumped hell thats nothing
They dont wanna stop there now they bussin
Now u gushin, ambulance rushin u to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times plus it hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now u lucky to be alive, Just think it all started u fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way u could *uck around get shot die anyday
Ni&&as; die every day all over bull sh*t dope money dice game ordinary hood sh*t
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually ni&&as; dont kno what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blo I guess, from Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now im straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

Chorus
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy

Verse 2 (T.I.)
I aint never been scared, I lived through tragic
Situations coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that sh*t didnt even have to happen
But u dont think about it when u out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Ni&&as; start sh*t didnt next thing ya kno we cappin
Get locked up then didnt even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that sh*t look back just laugh
Some sh*t still look back just sad
Maybe my homboy still be around
Had I not hit the ni&&a; in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my ni&&a; walkin out that door
Whoda thought Id never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I dont want no more
Cost a ni&&a; his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A ni&&a; put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk sh*t all night
Cuz I hit you , you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now im straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

Chorus
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home

Verse 3 (J.T.)
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright

Chorus
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
