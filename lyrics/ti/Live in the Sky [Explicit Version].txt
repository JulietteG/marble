Whats happening man this T.I.P. you kno I like to dedicate this song to anybody who every lost
somebody, to the grave, to the streets, to the jail sail, I done been in situations where I done had to
cope with all three you kno what Im saying, I feel like the only thing haven't done die you kno..Just
remember where you live while you here aint half as important as where you gone live when you leave you
kno what Im saying

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs they come and go ....but when I die I hope I live in the sky...All my folks who
aint alive I hope they live in the sky..pray to God when I die that I live in the sky ..It's true what
goes around comes back you kno..So when I die I hope I love in the sky..All my folk who aint survive may
they live in the sky...Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky...

[Verse 1]
My cousin Toot aint have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
give a damn what he done that my muthafuckin folk and I love that nigga til death no muthafuckin joke
I can feel my eyes feelin the lord is my witness
If I catch em Imma kill em I made it my bizness
back in the day you stayed in my bizness taught I didnt have to corporate yay in my bizness
coincedently that's why today you not wit me
my cousin died ova some yay and I miss em
plus he had his family out let's say she the eye witness
but her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave her life sentence
I heard that now Im dressed up in all black
shot up the whole apartments and still and brought back
the best friend I had in Jamel I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 2]
Who ever seen a nigga go to jail sleep til day two
well thats how sick I was when Jay blew

over-dosed on heroin died at 22
If you aint heard about
daughter she smile just like you
so cute even resorts to violence like you
you kno you ya baby mama
loose but ha what can you do
and I got 4 myself yep it's been a few
now everything I do is for
King, messiah, dazasha, demonte
lord they all I got so please don't take em from me
from me standin in the
trap wit corin and sir kap
laughin at the niggas who serve with no strap
tell them niggas man yall

ya robbing ask to borrow my pistol aint no hap
me, you, the crew just fell out ova
dough and a little crack
never could apolygize cause you died that's why they saying..

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 3]
I bet you niggas thinking that I living it up
til you see polices laughing as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many bitches i can fit in the truck
to 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what fuck how
many millions I got nigga so what if Im hot when I got prices on my head
Feds rushing my spot a million
haters wont me dead force to carry me gat
but you a seven time felon wat you doing with dat
It's a catch
22 either you lose or lose
Thats the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
and I aint never
been a busta alway stood on my feet
like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me
a pussy nigga
or polices wit a warrant for me
Im a "G" prepared to die for whats important to me
Look anybody in the
eye who say they want it wit me
put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to
learn and be patient
you telling me wit these seven years of probation
pistol charges and a host of
other open cases
if niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but
sometime I couldnt take it
got 4 kids wit smiles on they faces
mean more to me than my crown and my braclet
take that away from me and my life is butt naked
