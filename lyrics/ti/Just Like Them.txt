Put your sweet fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
It's hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now you're four whole hours behind

Just put your fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
I can't quite see the whites of your eyes
Though you bat your eyelids from across the ocean
And I fall over in their breeze

I don't bring you spices from the East
And I don't bring you the world's you crave
'cause everyday you need a new one

Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn

Put your sweet fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
We pass light bits in the night
Though you send your flare to the horizon
I just stare and blink in your light

No, I don't speak in all your tongues
So I don't even know if I'll be welcome
What if I appeared as if by magic?
Just like in Mr. Benn

Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn

So go if you're going
You keep pouring when I say when
Come home when your work there is done
Just like, just like

Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn

Just put your fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
It's hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now you're four whole hours behind---Lyrics submitted by Brightone.
