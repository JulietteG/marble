(Rihanna): 
You're gonna be a shining star, in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars. 
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far, 
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are. 
So live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
You steady chasing that paper, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
No telling where it'll take ya, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Cause I'm a paper chaser, 
Just living my life (Ay!), my life (Oh!), my life (Ay!), my life(Oh!), 
just living my life (Ay!), my life (Oh!), my life (Ay!), my life(Oh!), 
just living my life 

Nevermind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away. 
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away. 
Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today. 
You'd still be wasting days away, not had I never saved the day. 
Consider them my protg, homage I think they should pay. 
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way. 
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way. 
Some say they sold yay and no they couldn't get work on Labor day. 
It aint that black or white, their hands in areas the shade of grey. 
I'm West side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid. 
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away. 
I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make em put the k's away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break. 
If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away. 

(Rihanna): 
You're gonna be a shining star, in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars. 
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far, 
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are. 
So live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
You steady chasing that paper, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
You got no time for no hata's 
Just live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
No telling where it'll take ya, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Cause I'm a paper chaser, 
Just living my life 

(T.I.): 
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid. 
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics. 
Articulate but still I'd grab a nigga by the collar quick. 
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla 'tip 
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow 'tip. 
I got love for the game but ay, I'm not in love with all of it. 
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy. 
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing. 
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in. 
Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositing them checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty. 
Your values is in disarray, prioritizing horribly. 
Unhappy with the riches cause you piss poor morally. 
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning. 
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? 

(Rihanna): 
You're gonna be a shining star, in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars. 
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far, 
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are. 
So live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
You steady chasing that paper, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
You got no time for no hata's 
Just live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
No telling where it'll take ya, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Cause I'm a paper chaser, 
Just living my life (Ay!), my life (Oh!), my life (Ay!), my life(Oh!), 
just living my life (Ay!), my life (Oh!), my life (Ay!), my life(Oh!), 
So live your life---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
