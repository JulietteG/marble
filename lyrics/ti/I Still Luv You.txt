CHORUS 
I still love you [my love] 
I still need you [my heart] 
I love you honey [bunny] 
you are the only one [believe me] 
and I hope I be the only one for you 
can't you see 
I still love you, I still need you 

Yes I've done something wrong 
and I'm so sorry about that 
I'm so sorry about everything 

Forgive me - I thought you'd always be mine 
I thought I could never lose you 
but now I know - I feel - I believe 
there's an other guy 
you love - an other heart in your mind 

CHORUS - repeats 

I'm so scared 
that I could lose you now 
I'm so scared 
that I could see you 
with an other person in your arms 
oh help me my god 
tell me that I'm wrong 
tell me that this is not the truth 

BRIDGE 
Do you still love me 
do you still need me 
do you still know that I'm here for you 
if you need me too 

CHORUS - repeats
