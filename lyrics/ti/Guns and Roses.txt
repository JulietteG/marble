Aye, have you ever loved somebody so much you can't stand it but can't do without 'em?
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for 'em
Therefore your heart's torn
Between being with 'em forever, leaving 'em never
But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you will, you never known none better
My heart says nah, she can't leave, won't let her
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain't been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don't shut up
Love her to death, don't know whether to kiss her or kill her

Should've known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Still we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Hah, I guess I'd rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy alot of Prada, Gucci, and Belinciaga
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn, around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with?
Where the fuck have you been? Them pants  they don't fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don't get
No matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in
Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
I would go in your shit, real, no shit
But I love her so much that I can't forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I'm sick
Still, I don't like to feel like this
If I wouldn't miss her, I would probably to get a kill right here

Should've known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Still we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don't really ever know why
If I could live without you I'd try

Should've known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don't know which one to choose
When either way, we're gonna lose
Still we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses---Lyrics submitted by lee.
