(Chorus) (Swizz Beatz)
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Swang!

(T.I.)
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks, rubberbands 'round big cash
Got a sick swag til' the haters get mad (come on)
We in the club, homes gettin our thug on
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out
When it dark out get the squad out
We ball hard, suck a dick, eat ya heart out
I'm too advanced super swag in my Louis pants
Fallin on my Louis shoes, shirt match my Louis rag

(Chorus) (Swizz Beatz)
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Swang!

(T.I)
I say whoa, kimosabe, big ballin is my hobby
I'm boppin while I'm walkin, rag fallin out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic homie I ain't even talkin'
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossin' at the mall, talkin to a broad
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
3 pair of shoes, 4 shirts, 6 rags
Chick said damn, that's more than my bag
Shawty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf hangin outta my jeans y'all
Homie I ain't thinkin I'm just doin' my thing

(Chorus) (Swizz Beatz)
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Swang!

(T.I.)
I took some time off and now I'm back y'all
You in the line at the club I'm in the back dawg
And when this song on, ballas peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch the stacks fall
And pull your rag out and wave it left, right
Let it sag with ya pants get ya swag just right
Ride Bankhead flare flyin' out the Benz
Once a fool with it, we gon' bring em out again

(Chorus) (Swizz Beatz)
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Swang!---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
