[Verse : Flocka]
I'm drinking champagne one deep in my phantom ghost
Bad bitch with me with me where my manners go
I'm drinking champagne one deep in my phantom ghost
Bad bitch with me with me where my manners go
My youngins sick sick where the antidote
Aiming at your top bust your cantaloupe
I'm drinking champagne one deep in my phantom ghost
Bad bitch with me with me where my manners go
My youngins sick sick where the antidote
Aiming at your top bust your cantaloupe (Pussy!)
He 46 and he's still selling dope
How the fuck you ballin' with a car note
I'm in the trap real shit where the felons go
Cury never had a job he always use the bowls
Them youngins run up in your house what it's hitting for
No mans just to let you know who did it ho
I'm from Riverdale all I know is get it in
I got weed I got Molly's what you tryin' to spend

[Hook]
50k for a show and my niggas sellin' swag
She a red bottom bitch Versace shirt Birkin bag
I'ma get money nigga don't use the carlot to protect
Before I leave my fucking house grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the bands I be playing with a check x4

[Verse : Flocka]
My foreign car painted flat black
My girl hopped out ass fat
Paparazzi keep flashing pictures
Broke niggas looking wanna be these niggas (Pussy)
4 grams in my back wood, (I'm smoking)
Millionaire nigga still keep it hood (Riverdale)
Pay the extra 60 for that steel hood
Phantom ghost got a nigga living good
Turn up
I bet your bitch want a nigga
Hey come here shawty 
I bet she wanna fuck a nigga
Hey come here shawty 
Never be a broke nigga
Shawty see a platinum nigga

[Hook]
50k for a show and my niggas sellin' swag
She a red bottom bitch Versace shirt Birkin bag
I'ma get money nigga don't use the carlot to protect
Before I leave my fucking house grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the bands I be playing with a check x4

[Verse: Gucci]
Gucci Mane I'm the fucking man pocket full of zen
Whipping plans on the nigga grands change a nigga plans
Still know we keep it real chopping off your head
I'm leaving grounds, I'ma try the crown and I'm in the van
Say he hard and he goin' ham I don't give a damn
Say he broke and a hundred million just went through his hand
I don't cherish it I'm flying terrorist and crush you down
If you thinking he gon' take my grounds I'ma change your plan
You are a jam pussy nigga but I just came from Japan
I'm making fans off of growing weed super duper scram
I heard you found and jerked on your man now your nigga ran
Flockaveli you know that's my man called the kid a damn

[Hook]
50k for a show and my niggas sellin' swag
She a red bottom bitch Versace shirt Birkin bag
I'ma get money nigga don't use the carlot to protect
Before I leave my fucking house grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the bands I be playing with a check x4---Lyrics submitted by Drizzy Montanaa.
