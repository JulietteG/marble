There I go, magic trickin on yo ass, throwin every president except for Nixon on yo ass
Make you rich I feel I should make commission on yo ass,
Wonder what youd ever do If I went missin on yo ass, huh?

When I hit the scene girls yellin and they scream

Throw some money, throw some money, Imma let it go,
