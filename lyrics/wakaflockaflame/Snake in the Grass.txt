(Cartier Kitten Verse)
Cartier..no watch

with it off the head, ima need like two
nigga rich, what that make you

They say snakes in the grass so Ima cut this shit
All these girls want is cash so I can't trust the bitch
12 pull up run fast can`t go to jail for shit
I got cars, ice, and hoes shawty im nigga rich
