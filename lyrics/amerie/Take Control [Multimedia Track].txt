Hey 
Wait a minute 
Hey 

[Verse 1:] 
I said baby 
I love the way that you hold Me 
And you touch me like you know Me 
See I don't want nobody Else 
And I, I'm bout' to Offer All I can give Him 
Cause I'm a slave to his Rhythm 
I said I just can't help Myself 

[Hook:] 
Cause baby I love ya' 
And I Trust ya' 
You don't have to worry bout' Nothing 
Oh I'm alive right now, Look at me 
And I want ya' 
No I need ya' 
And I'll do anything to please ya' 
I just want you to take control of Me (take control) 

[Chorus:] 
I said Hey! (hey) 
Show me how you want it Now 
(Do you) Like it when I take it Down 
I got Everything 
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you Baby 
Hey! (hey) 
Come a little closer Now 
(Don't stop) Wanna go another Round 
You got Everything 
And anything I need, Want you to bring it to me Baby 

[Spoken:] 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control 

[Verse 2:] 
I said Baby 
I got to tell you how much I love It 
The way you kiss my neck in Public 
I try my best not to Blush 
Even when, An argument comes Around 
You take the time to break it Down 
And you're never ever in a Rush 
(Never never never, ever never Nev-er!) 

[Hook:]
And I'm Scared, And I'm Nervous 
Trying is always worth It 
Oh Im alive right now, Look at Me 
And I want him, I need him 
I'll find him, I'll forgive him, I'll feed him 
(Oh) I just want you to take control of Me (take control) 

[Chorus] 
I said Hey! (hey) 
Show me how you want it Now 
(Do you) Like it when I take it Down 
I got Everything 
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you Baby 
Hey! (hey) 
Come a little closer Now 
(Don't stop) Wanna go another Round 
You got Everything 
And anything I need, Want you to bring it to me Baby 

[Spoken:] 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control 

[Bridge:] 
Now if you feel what I feel, Come and take control of Me 
Don't you mind how you feelin' just take control of Me 
Cause you got my soul on fire, And I feel just Fine 
You got what I Need 
Na na na Na 
(Na na na Na, Hey hey Hey) Hey hey Hey! 
(Na na na Na, Hey hey Hey) 

[Chorus:] 
I said Hey! (hey) 
Show me how you want it Now (show me how you want it) 
(Do you) Like it when I take it Down 
I got Everything 
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you Baby (Oh) 
Hey! (hey) 
Come a little closer Now (come a little closer) 
(Don't stop) Wanna go another Round 
You got Everything 
And anything I need, Want you to bring it to me Baby 

[Spoken:] 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Take Control of Me (lost to me) 
Take Control of Me (take control of me) 
Why don't you come a little Closer? 

Hey!
