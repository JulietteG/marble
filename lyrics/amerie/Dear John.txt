dear john
by now youre probably wondering 
where i am who im with
and why you are reading this
but before i go into.. 
what im up to let me confess 
dear sweetheart 
i know about ur secret 
where you've been, who you with, i saw you out with her 
and yet you always try to maintain 
how i got a good thing and i cant do better 
do you remember what you told me? 
cause i remember it well (how could i forget) 
do u remember how u said no one could want me 
and i said time will tell 

thats why im so sorry 
that i couldn't be there 
to see the look up on your face 
and im so sorry that it took me so long 
so long to put you an your place 

im writin u this letter 
just to let u know that 
that i still love you 
but i wont be comin back 
u had me at hello 
now i gotta say goodbye 
cause one too many times u made me cry 

dear john 
im hopin that this find you well.. 
dear john 
but you put me through a living hell 
dear john 
you left me with nothin to do 
dear john 
dear john 
Im leaving u 
Im leaving u 

dear john 
by now ur probably see my clothes are gone 
keys are gone and i aint lovin 
so don't even bother 
to call my number 
cause i got it changed 
why john 
couldn't just see 
i gave my heart, gave my time 
and i got nothin 
so it shouldn't be surprising 
this letter im writin 
that you there by yourself 
do you remember what you told me? 
cause i remember it well (how could i forget) 
do u remember how u said no one would want me 
and i said time will tell 

thats why im so sorry 
that i couldn't be there 
to see the look up on your face 
and im so sorry that it took me so long 
so long to put you an your place 

im writin u this letter 
just to let u know that 
that i still love you 
but i wont be comin back 
u had me at hello 
now i gotta say goodbye 
cause one too many times u made me cry 

dear john 
im hopin that this find you well 
dear john 
but you put me through a living hell 
dear john 
you left me with nothin to do 
dear john 
dear john 
I'm leaving u 

but i can end this with those saying 
thank you for everything you put me through 
ive come so far alone 
im leaving im leaving im leaving 
im movin on 
and now im so much wiser 
cause the pain that you gave me 
never ever put me down 
ur only made me strong 
im leavin im leavin im leavin 
john, im gone 

im writin u this letter 
just to let u know that 
that i still love you 
but i wont be comin back 
u had me at hello 
now i gotta say goodbye 
cause one too many times u made me cry 

dear john 
im hopin that this find you well 
dear john

dear john
