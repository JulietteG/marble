Sometimes I feel like closing my eyes, and driving my car until i hit something hard.
Dont act like you havnt been there before, you hide from what you cant ignore.
So what happens when you are alone?

What happens when you are alone?

This once I looked into the mirror, abd stared into my bloodshot eyes.
And I wasn't even there.
And I stepped outside of my own skin.
And I glared at the sap who was looking in.
ANd I didn't even recogninze myself.---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
