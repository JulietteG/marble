I need to leave Michigan and everything I have not done.
Oh I'd die trying to be something worthwhile.
I promise so mcuh of myself that it makes it hard to breathe.
I feel the weight of what I say because its never what I mean.
We all need some direction and I lie to myself.
Im sick of this dependence, im sick of being helped. 
Oh, I lie to make myself believe that I'm worthwhile.

Open wounds; they turn to scars.
In time they heal like broken hearts.

We're so messed up living our lives.
That I can barely sleep at night.

All I see is where I am 
and everywhere I'm not.
I feel the place that I hace started
 is the place that I will rot.
I can't stay standing still too long,
I'm afriad I'll never leave.
Im afraid of myself and where I want to be. 
Everywhere looks better then right here.
Oh I swear...---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
