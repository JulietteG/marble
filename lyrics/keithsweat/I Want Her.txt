Seen you last night, say you standin' there 
Couldn't picture the color of your hair 
All I wanted to know were you really there 
I wanna know was it my imagination 
Ooh, you k now it was a sweet sensation 
Lookin' at you from a distance 
Ooh, it seems so real 

You and I together 
Dream that seemed for real 
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up 
It feels so real all I know is 

I want her (I want that baby) 
I want her (Get it, get it, get it, get it) 
I want her (I wanna do it like this, do it like that) 
I want her (Once I get it ain't no turnin' back) 

You turn me on and on 
The feelin', girl, is so strong 
My heart, girl, is on fire 
Ooh, you're my desire 

I've got a thing for you 
Dreams of you and me, baby 
She's bad, she's bad, she's bad 
All I know is 

I want her (I want, I want, I want, I want, I want her) 
I want her (Don't misunderstand me) 
I want her (I wish this dream was for real) 
I want her (You, you know the deal) 

I want her (Yeah, yeah...) 
I want her (I want that girl so bad) 
I want her (I had a dream of her last night) 
I want her (Yeah, yeah, yeah, ugh) 

Oh 
Mmm, mmm, mmm 
Yep-yep 
Ooh...ooh...ooh...yeah 
And I, ugh 
I 
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, ooh, baby 
All night long, girl 

I want her (Ooh, baby) 
I want her (I want that girl so bad) 
I want her (All night long) 
I want her (Let me, let me tell you somethin', I wanna do it like this, baby) 

I want her (I wanna do it like that, sugar) 
I want her (You know I need, girl, you know what I like, girl, like this, baby) 
I want her (I wanna do it like that, sugar) 
I want her (You turn me on and on and on and on) 

I want her (I wanna do it like this, baby, I wanna do it like that, sugar)
