Don't want you woman, please stay away from me 
Don't want you woman, please stay away from me 
Well the one I got she is, sure good enough for me 

Don't call me baby, I don't think it's kind 
Don't call me baby, I don't think it's kind 
Well, I got another woman - don't intend to leave her behind 

Don't call me baby, call me on the phone 
Don't call me baby, call me on the phone 
If you wanna be kind to me girl, kindly leave me alone 

Don't come on up to me baby, when you see me walkin' down the town 
Don't come on up to me baby, when you see me walkin' down town 
Don't wanna be unkind girl, but 
You ain't the kind of woman I want around - Hey right !

Don't want you woman, please stay away from me 
Don't want you woman, please stay away from me 
Well the one I got she is, sure good enough for me---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
