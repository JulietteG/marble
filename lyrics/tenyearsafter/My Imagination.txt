This desert heat this burning sky paints a picture in my mind
Beneath my feet the dusty ground shadows chase a passing cloud

Seeking shelter from the heat if i find myself on a empty street
All around this heartbreak town doors are closed and shutters down

And every day endlessly i keep on searching
And in my dreams and restless sleep i look for you
I close my eyes and drift away did i heard you call my name
I close my eyes and i see your face or is it my imagination

So much to learn so little time cant get back what once was mine
I watch the sun sail across the sky to kiss the earth and say goodbye

Every day endlessly i keep on searching
In my dreams and restless sleep i look for you
I close my eyes and drift away did i heard you call my name
I close my eyes and i see your face or is it my imagination

[solo]

Every day endlessly i keep on searching
In my dreams and restless sleep i look for you
I close my eyes and drift away did i heard you call my name
I close my eyes and i see your face or is it my imagination---Lyrics submitted by Mateus Herculan.
