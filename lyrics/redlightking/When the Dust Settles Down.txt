Been up and down these streets
I've seen both sides of town
I've been through the hardship
The long way around
The point of no return
That's just where I begin
I spent a lot of time with all seven deadly sins
Hated who I was
Who I became
Lost my faith in God
Put my faith in cocaine
Cheated on my girlfriends
Lied to myself
Put my whole family through hell

When the dust settles down
You've seen where you've been
You're runnin' on empty
Broken within
When the dust settles down
There ain't nothin' left
Turn it around
Start over again

And when you have nothin' left
Find out what you're worth
I came through the storm
Stopped diggin' in the dirt
I rewound the tape
Saw through the evil and hate
Started believin' that I had what it takes
I went back to the start
Workin' full shifts through the worst shit
Kickin' carpet and bouncin' punks at the bar
I got a new life now
Now that I'm legit
You can call the cops man
It don't mean shit

When the dust settles down
You've seen where you've been
You're runnin' on empty
Broken within
When the dust settles down
There ain't nothin' left
Turn it around
Start over again
[x2]

Start over again
Start over again
Start over again
Start over again

When the dust settles down
You've seen where you've been
You're runnin' on empty
Broken within
When the dust settles down
There ain't nothin' left
Turn it around
Start over again---Lyrics submitted by Brooke Welp.
