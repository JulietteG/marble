We were born to rise
We were born to rise

So what'd you know about sacrifice when the lights go out?
The price to pay when you're digging down
The skin of your teeth and the pain in your back
What'd you know about hope? What'd you know about that?

Write it off as criminal, a place to cast a stone
On and on we carry on when one is not enough

We are the ones who were born to rise
We are the ones with the fire inside
I go to war with the brothers I trust
And there ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us
We are the ones who will bring the rain
We are the ones who will break the chain
I go to war with the brothers I trust
And there ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us

What'd you know about standing up when the odds get stacked?
Time stands still, ain't no turnin' back
When everything you're worth is under attack
What'd you know about heart? What'd you know about that?

Write it off as criminal, a place to cast a stone
On and on we carry on when one is not enough

We are the ones who were born to rise
We are the ones with the fire inside
I go to war with the brothers I trust
And there ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us
We are the ones who will bring the rain
We are the ones who will break the chain
I go to war with the brothers I trust
And there ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us

We were born to rise
Ain't no stopping us, no stopping us
We were born to rise
Ain't no stopping us, no stopping us

We are the ones who were born to rise
We are the ones with the fire inside
I go to war with the brothers I trust
And there ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us
We are the ones who will bring the rain
We are the ones who will break the chain
I go to war with the brothers I trust
And there ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us

We were born to rise
Ain't no stopping us, no stopping us
We were born to rise
There ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us

We were born to rise
Ain't no stopping us, no stopping us
We were born to rise
There ain't no stopping us, there ain't no stopping us---
