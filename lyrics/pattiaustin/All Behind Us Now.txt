Hey, I'm so sorry
That it didn't work the way
That we'd always planned
Hey, I'm so sorry
That you went away
And somehow didn't understand

We pretended for so many years, but now
Its time wash away my tears

CHORUS
Cause/And it's all behind us now
Cause we've learned to live somehow without
Each other
And it's easy to see, it ain't never
Gonna be the same again
And it's all behind us now
Cause we found a way to live without
Each other
And in time we'll have to see
If it's ever gonna be that way again
Ohh......

Hey, I'm so sorry
That I couldn't find the words
That might have made you stay
And hey, it's so funny
How we both can say the same thing in a
Different way

We pretended for so many years,
But now it's over baby
And so are my tears

Repeat chorus

I was holdin' out for far too long
But now I finally found where I belong
Repeat chorus to fade..---Lyrics submitted by khamille dulong.
