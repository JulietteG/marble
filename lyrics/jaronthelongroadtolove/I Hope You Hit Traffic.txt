You want to leave
You want to find yourself 
But you dont want to do that with me
You want to drive
You want to feel the breeze
Between your fingers and the trees
And you dont know where youre going 
You get in the car and you hit the road

And though I still love you
I want you to know
I hope you hit traffic 
The magic gets lost and the wind sits still
I hope its a static erratic drive 
And youre slamming on the wheel
You get angry and graphic 
And I hope you hit traffic

You want to fly 
You want to spread your wings
And you got a hundred more clichs 
You think the road holds the truth
And no ones gunna get in your way
And you dont care where youre going 
You let the car decide when you hit the road

Though I still love you
I want you to know
I hope you hit traffic 
The magic gets lost and the wind sits still
I hope its a static erratic drive 
And youre slamming on the wheel
You get angry and graphic 
And I hope you hit traffic

You turn the radio up loud
But no station is clear 
Then a crackle from a cloud
And the rain is soon here
Could the car break down?
Could it be a sign? 
I wish you would, I really think you should 
But if you cant be mine

I hope you hit traffic 
The magic is lost and the wind sits still
And I hope its a static erratic drive
And youre slamming on the wheel

Na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na na

I hope you hit traffic 
The magic is lost and the wind sits still
And I hope its a static erratic drive
And youre slamming on the wheel
You get angry and graphic 
And I hope you hit traffic---Lyrics submitted by jennifer blackb.
