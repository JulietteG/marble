You were Juliet and i was into you.
 And i asked you out until you couldn't say no.
 And you finally felt it to.
I drove you down the blvd and that's where you took my heart; and that's where you gave me yours instead. And every day you find new ways to be beautiful.

You laugh at the garden that won't grow in the lawn.
Drink coffee in the kitchen with no make up on.
Sing all the wrong words to my favorite song.
You're beautiful,and that's beautiful.
You got lines on your face from sleeping on me.
Call me at work cause you lost your key.
Go to buy a dog,and you come home with three.
You're beautiful,and that's beautiful to me.

You turn every head as you walk into a room.
But your kindness and your sweetened soul lingers like perfume.
Babe,you could have gone with Romeo,but you let him go. And you stayed with me instead. And every day i find new ways that make you beautiful.

You say honey give me roses but don't get red.
You need forty-six pillows all over the bed.
Guess every punch line before it's said.
You're beautiful and that's beautiful.
What you doing with a guy like me?
You're so cool and i'm high tea.
I don't deserve to have a girl as beautiful as you.

You laugh at the garden that won't grow in the lawn.
Drink coffee in the kitchen with no make up on.
Sing all the wrong words to my favorite song.
You're beautiful,and that's beautiful.
You got lines on your face from sleeping on me.
Call me at work cause you lost your key.
Go to buy a dog,and you come home with three.
You're beautiful,and that's beautiful to me.

You're so beautiful and that's beautiful to me.---Lyrics submitted by kayden dickey.
