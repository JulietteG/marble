On a Monday Afternoon
I'm stopped at a light on the bolavard 
I'm lookin' around at faces in the other cars
And there's a cute girl looking back at me
The lights about to change I know this is a little strange
But in the meantime she will be my girl
In the meantime I promise her the world
In the meantime I'm hers and she is mine
I finally find the perfect girl and I am pressed for time
In the meantime

I turn on the radio 
Just lookin' for a song and I drift away
The light is still a ruby red as the music plays
And I keep hopin' she just looks my way
She finally does and smiles at me and I want so bad to ask her please
In the meantime will you be my girl
In the meantime I promise you the world
In the meantime I'm yours and you are mine
Yeah I finally find the perfect girl and I am pressed for time
In the meantime she pulls away

There goes my girl but she made my day
Yeah I'll see you in another lifetime but, if you don't mind you don't mind
In the meantime you will be my girl In the meantime I promise you the world
In the meantime I'm yours and you are mine
Be my meantime girl
Be my meantime girl
Oh Oh Ohhh
Be my meantime girl
Yeah Yeahh
Be my meantime girl
Yeah Yeahh
You know you wanna be my meantime girl
You know you wanna be my meantime girl
Yeah Yeahh
You know you wanna be my meantime girl---Lyrics submitted by Gabrielle.
