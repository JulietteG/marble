It was going to be you and me, 
But now your gone
I had planned the rest of my life,
How am I suppose to move on?
I can't sleep in our bed or on the couch, 
You left so many memories when you walked out

Kill me for loving you, 
Cause I can't stop no matter how hard i try to
Kill me for loving you, 
All I ever wanted to do..
Was love you

I've been crying every day and night,
For two weeks now
I've been looking out the window at the driveway, 
Every hour
I don't want to start over,
With someone new
Yeah, I've gotten so damn good 
At loving you

Kill me for loving you, 
Cause I can't stop no matter how hard I try to 
Kill me for loving you, 
All I ever wanted to do..
Was love you

Sometimes it's just mornings,
Sometimes it's all day long, 
Sometimes I just wish I begged you more to stay

Kill me for loving you,
Cause I can't stop no matter how hard I try to
Kill me oh for loving you
Yeah all I ever wanted to do 
Was love you
Yeah was love you---Lyrics submitted by carey.
