Now the premise of this album is very, very simple.
What's that?
To listen to messages of soul with a solid beat.
Make you move, rhythm beat.
Now the premise of this album is
To find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it.
Oh, come on!
Now the premise of this album
Well the dance actually, the dance business
The highest definition ever achieved in recording
I'll even tell you what two of the secret ingredients are

Pure electronic, modern electronics
That'll make 'em happy
Pure electronic, modern electronics
Oh they're making me wanna get up and dance
Pure electronic, modern electronics
Let's have a party we're gonna go swinging
Pure electronic, modern electronics
oh yeah ha ha ha 
Pure electronics, modern electronics
Make you move, rhythm beat.
Pure electronics, modern electronics
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up!
Pure electronics, modern electronics
I'm killing myself here just as much as you
Pure electronics, modern electronics
The highest definition ever achieved
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up!
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up!
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up! 
Do you hear? The whole world!
I believe that

Don't get carried away now.
Settle down
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up!
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up!
I'm gonna fuck the whole world up!
Do you hear? The whole world!
Supernaturally blow it up in there lives in a supernatural way for phenomenal increase
Supernaturally, abundantly bless you
Open the window to the heavens and brought abundant provisions on you today
Muah
Ha ha ha 
I'm so full of ideas, and here's a good one.

Makes it feel shortened, that'll make 'em happy

Now the premise of this album is very, very simple
What's that?
Tomorrow, together, where might we not go?
3 2 1 launch engaged, lift off
We have lift off
The tower is clear---Lyrics submitted by Jack Fredricton.
