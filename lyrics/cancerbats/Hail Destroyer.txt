Tear us down!

Welcome destruction with open arms
It's all too static, bring it on, bring it on
Routine's so boring it makes me scream
Tear us down! Just tear us down!
When fate just pushes us along
Children of nothing, this is our song

Hail destroyer! Hail Destroyer! Hail destroyer!
We're rising up from ashes!

Erase the comfort, erase the crutch
When given nothing we appreciate so much
A wake up call you want to just scream
Tear us down! Just tear us down!
On our own terms of right and wrong
Children of nothing, this is our song

Hail destroyer! Hail Destroyer! Hail destroyer!
We're rising up from ashes!
Hail destroyer! Hail Destroyer! Hail destroyer!
Our lives begin when we fall down

Keep me incomplete!
Keep it corroded the rust, the dust
Keep me incomplete!
All sense of order can self-destruct
Keep me incomplete!
Reduced to rubble and time to shine
Keep me incomplete!
Tear us down and carry on
Children of nothing, this is our song

Hail destroyer! Hail Destroyer! Hail destroyer!
We're rising up from ashes!
Hail destroyer! Hail Destroyer! Hail destroyer!
Our lives begin when we fall down---Lyrics submitted by Devin.
