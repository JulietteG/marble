Its a beautiful day
Feeling the sunshine on my face
Its a beautiful day
And I got some time to waste
Its a beautiful day
Hope its just like this tomorrow
Its a beautiful day
Oh, yeah

Im gonna wake up
And get myself a cup of coffee
Open the windows and the doors
Baby lets go outside
I can feel the air is warm
Lets go for a long ride
Speakers are blarin

Its a beautiful day
Feeling the sunshine on my face
Its a beautiful day
And I got some time to waste
On this beautiful day
Hope its just like this tomorrow
A beautiful day
Oh, yeah

Oh so here we are
Walking through the barn
Lets lay down this blanket
and listen to the birds sing
Its so nice to be outside
We can watch the sun go down
Burning that daylight
While were making out

Its a beautiful day
Feeling the sunshine on my face
Its a beautiful day
And I got some time to waste
On this beautiful day
Hope its just like this tomorrow
A beautiful day
Oh, yeah

I dont wanna stay inside
Cause anytime that I could die
And I just wanna live
I wanna take you by the hand
Love you like I know I can
And show you who I am

Its a beautiful day
Feeling the sunshine on my face
Its a beautiful day
And I got some time to waste
On this beautiful day
Hope its just like this tomorrow
A beautiful day
Oh, yeah

Its a beautiful day
Feeling the sunshine on my face
Its a beautiful day
And I got some time to waste
On this beautiful day
Hope its just like this tomorrow
A beautiful day
Oh, yeah---
