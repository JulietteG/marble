(Verse 1)
(MC Eiht)
Step in the arena

i'm kind of mean of
felony case catcher

mentality of a psychopath
when i catch you dippin slip into this blood bath (G'yeah)
the nine niggers aint no joke
so you gone bare witness, get this
like the fucking gun smoke
it dont matter cause i got you suspended
fuck up you're whole program, you're life ended
the tec'9 split up, im'a get you
unload these motherfucker hollows til i hit you
fucking with my mind
the wrong kind
evil as fuck
the glock goes buck, buck, buck, buck, duck
you're head, instead
the scene that is left is your mutherfuckin death
my glock goes up, to fools wanna be me
but them punk ass niggers don't wanna see me (come on, uh, G'yeah)

(Chorus)
Uh, G'yeah
uh, niggers cant fuck with this
it aint nothing but the eiht hype 
nothing but the eiht hype (x3)

(Verse 2)
To be or not to be, killed
hen you're fucking with the Eiht, Bam and Chill (G'yeah)

Original Baby fucking Gangster straight ass tappin'
i got that ass on cue
you be dazed and confused tryin to figure out
what we fix to do (whut tha fuck?)
you best hit the ground (G'yeah)
these killinh niggers
be spittin up the K and don't be fucking around
i seen two niggers fall (G'yeah)
but wait Eiht got slugs for all of y'all
Boom Bam picks the slack up (G'yeah)
for fools that's tryin to let off Chill gots the Mac up
them killing niggers doin drive bys,
lighten up yo whole fucking yard like fire flies
Little Hawk'n Bird got my back G (that's right)
the glock goes up to them punk ass niggers don't wanna see me

(Chorus)
Uh, G'yeah come on

it aint nothing but the eiht hype click 
niggers cant fuck with this

(Verse 3)

(Tha Chill)
Now i remember back when we use to hit lil licks
ever since thirteen i've been hittin the mean Joe Green
big strap in my back pocket
just in case a nigger wanted to act a fool i unlock it
cock it
peel his cap back
run nigger ya best ta run, jog to the cluck
buckin on my way tossed the gun
and now i'm rollin like ain't nothing went on
but i'm knowin i did that dirt
so i'm knowin i can't go home
shit just a little trip
puffin on a little endo, lay low
servin the cluckers and clockin a couple of c-notes
park around the corner from the spot uh
'cause nigger we slangin rocks and the spot it got hot
so i bails up the block with that gangster strut
remember the po po hot with my Cavi in my butt
stepped on the porch gave my nigger some dap
hating at the c-o-p's, tryin to see these.---
