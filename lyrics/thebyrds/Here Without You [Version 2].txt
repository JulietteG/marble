Daytime just makes me feel lonely
At night I can only dream about you
Girl you're on my mind nearly all of the time
It's so hard being here without you

Words in my head keep repeating things that you said
Wen I was with you
And I wonder is it true do you feel the same way too
It's so hard being here without you, being here without you

Though I know it won't last I'll see you some day
It seems as though that the day will come never
But there's one thing I'll swear though you're far away
I'll be thinking about you forever

The streets that I walk on depress me
The ones that were happy when I was with you
Still with all the friends I know and with all the things I do
It's so hard being here without you being here without you---
