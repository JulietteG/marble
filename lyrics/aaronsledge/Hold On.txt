Verse)

oh oh oh I gotta, I gotta hold on
I believe it was bout two years ago when I felt like giving up on you
I was going through so much and didnt have a clue when I would be okay
I felt like I was gettin hit from the left and the right
And I didnt have it in me back then to fight
But oh now, Im stronger
Im wiser
And I got some advice to share with ya

(Pre Chorus)
If you been down for a long time, listen to me right now
I got some news for you, some stuff that you can use right now

(Chorus)

Hold on, be strong
It wont be long now
You would lift your head up if you knew what I know
So what you failed 
Its not too late
Tomorrow comes another day
Trust me, I know
So if you ever feelin down and you need a shoulder
Lift your head up cause its not over

(Verse)
I tried so hard not to let it show
But people still knew what I was going through
I tried my best not to share my biz
It is what it is
You were the only one that knew
My going out, my coming in, my start my end
You were the only one that held me close when I needed it the most, my friend

(Pre Chorus)
If you been down for a long time, listen to me right now
I got some news for you, some stuff that you can use right now

(Chorus)

Hold on, be strong
It wont be long now
You would lift your head up if you knew what I know
So what you failed
Its not too late
Tomorrow comes another day
Trust me, I know
So if you ever feelin down and you need a shoulder
Lift your head up cause its not over(Bridge)

Just because you see a period doesnt mean its the end of it
Dont take what Im sayin lightly, this is serious
If you feel like you are runnin outta time
And you feel like youre at the end of the line
Dont trip
You know its bound to flip
And you gon be on the other side

(Chorus)
Hold on, be strong
It wont be long now
You will lift your head up if you knew what I know
Something something
Its not too late
Tomorrow comes another day
Trust me, I know
So if you ever feelin down and you need a shoulder
Lift your head up cause its not over---Lyrics submitted by kalyn.
