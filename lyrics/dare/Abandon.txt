the light of day is fading fast outside
i cannot hide the way i feel inside,no
i learn to live with something i cant find
i will never learn..i will take my turn

i cant forget the things you said to me
something inside my heart cant break free
i can see your eyes,i can see what you're after
and its no surprise to me

if you abandon me tonight will last forever
i'm stranded here within this desert called my soul
if you abandon me you turn you're back forever
you will abandon me, here

i step alone but yet i hear her voice
it takes my breath away i have no choice
i can see you're eyes, i can see what you're after
and its no surprise to me,yeah

if you abandon me tonight will last forever
i'm stranded here within this desert called my soul
if you abandon me you turn you're back forever
you will abandon me,you will abandon me..ahh

if you abandon me tonight will last forever
i'm stranded here within this desert called my soul
if you abandon me you turn you're back forever
you will abandon me

if you abandon me tonight will last forever
i'm stranded here within this desert called my soul---Lyrics submitted by Doug.
