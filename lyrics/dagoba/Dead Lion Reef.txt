A charming melody coming out
from a golden cave
You shiny diamond in the sea
Swinging swimmers, of skin and scales,
The smell of eternity, the sound of atrocity...

Bootyshaking on the beach, hidding your leach
You Serve us everything you got:
Your stupid laughes, kinkiest smiles...
Enslaving the world on doggystyle.

My heart is breaking,
Your lips are moving,
Your ass is shaking,
My mind is changing.
Hypnotizing witch
Can't crush my will!

For those about to love
For those about to love
I reject you!

Dead lion reef
Did you ever know that the perfect
drug got tits?
Dead lion reef-oh!
your heaven, I'll never run on ashore...

You're so wet my crown is rusting
But you cannot make black turns to pink.
Do you really think that a lion needs a cage?
I'm a fuckin' pirate, not your slave.

Still bootyshaking while i'm leaving
You served me everything you could
Your stupid laughes, loss of time
I took the part i wanted: the doggystyle!

My heart is breaking,
Your lips are moving,
Your ass is shaking,
My mind is changing.
Hypnotizing witch
Can't crush my will!

For those about to love
For those about to love
I reject you!

Dead lion reef
Did you ever know that the perfect drug got tits?
Dead lion reef-oh!
Your heaven, I'll never run on ashore...---Lyrics submitted by Jules.
