Oh no
Nobody knows where all the money goes
Hearts sleeves and overcoats
drift away in smaller boats

And I love it when I leave
In the middle of the heat
Eat the insides you would eat
Just to keep from feeling weak

Go anywhere
I will not follow
I sing the end 
and it treats me well
I caught your name
off the lips of the bottle
Humming the hum 
that you thought you just thought of now

That is my city
In the [undecipherable] of my friends
[undecipherable]
[undecipherable]

That is my city and
that is my city and
That is my city and

Rest and be strong
Wash and be clean
Start a new year
Whenever you need

Rest and be strong
Wash and be clean
Start a new year
Whenever you need

Rest and be strong
Wash and be clean
Start a new year
Whenever you need---Lyrics submitted by Lisa Hu.
