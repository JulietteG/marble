And we're driving just as fast as we can 
and we're racing to outrun the wind 
it's just me and you and you and me 
so wild and so young, bright eyed and free 
and we're trying to get out of here 
and a small town romance draws ever near 
and I swear we're in a movie the highlight comes when you kiss me and the stereo sings our song we don't hesitate to sing along 

Drive to dream to live, we could see the world tonight
Here to hope tomorrow we could see the world

And we're miles from the middle of nowhere 
and neither of us seems to care and that's why i love you so-oh-oh 
shut your mouth girl, no one has to know
and time seems to drip like Dali and neither of us has a place to be 
so for once and forever tell me all, tell me all of your dreams 
and the stereo sings our song we don't hesitate to sing along

Drive to dream to live. we could see the world tonight. Here to hope tomorrow we could see the world. x2

And we're driving just as fast as we can 
and we're racing to outrun the wind 
and the stereo sings our song we don't hesitate to sing along.

Drive to dream to live, we could see the world tonight
(we don't hesitate to sing) 
here to hope tomorrow we could see the world 
(Repeat x2)---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
