You make my teeth clinch and my hands shake
Do you ever see what you do to me?
You're wearing me out, just wearing me out
But I'm wearing you down

You're impossible lovely
So impossible to win or please
I'm wearing you out, just wearing you out
But I'm wearing you down

Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything from me it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive, harder to forget
Take what you want

I make your lips red
And your bones click
Try to think through
What I can do to you
It's wearing me thin
Can I begin to wear you out? 

Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything from me it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive, harder to forget
Take what you want

I'm impossible to figure out
So impossible you had your doubts

Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything honey it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive, harder to forget
Take what you want from me it means nothing now
Take everything honey it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive, harder to forget
Take what you want from me---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
