A red priest broke into our classroom
Caught us children by attention
Listen closely to the words I speak
Lord knows if Ill ever, ever again be

Spoke such words never spoken before
On the way he declared the world
Miracles like youve never seen
From a man who was raised up in the sea

A man is coming in thirteen-one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives I turn to your hand
Hold this tight while we run if we still can

What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
Tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
At the end of the world
Youll still belong

Before the red priest took his last breath
He told me child now dont forget
The sun will turn dark very soon
The days are numbered when theres blood on the moon

The earth will shake and the sky will fall
The eyes will open of those enthralled
Dont take the sun but youll be killed
By the man from seven hills

A man is coming in thirteen-one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives I turn to your hand
Hold this tight while we run if we still can

What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
Tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
At the end of the world
Youll still belong

Look up into the eastern sky
When you hear the voice, say your last goodbye
Look back to the eastern skies
When the ghost take hold of the men who died

Look up into the eastern sky
When your fathers weep and your mothers cry
Look up into the eastern sky

What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
Tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
At the end of the world
Youll still belong

Look up into the eastern sky
When you hear the voice, say your last goodbye
Look back to the eastern skies
When the ghost take hold of the men who died

Looked up into the eastern sky
When your fathers weep and your mothers cry
Look up into the eastern sky

Look children to the eastern sky---Lyrics submitted by jake.
