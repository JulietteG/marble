There's a hatchet,got a knife,
and I hope there was nothing real in this life,
The dreams are so intoxicating(intoxicating),
when you're doing this alone,

Gun,rope,brick gone away,
words have no meaning when they're to themselves,
I really do care, no baby I, I really do care!
[chorus]
Innocence gone!
Never take friendship personal,
If you can't hold yourself together,
Why should I hold you now?
and a sense gone!
Never take friendship personal!
If you can't you hold yourself together,
Why should I hold you now?

Once a Skeptic,now the critic,
And you think you finally found a place of your own,
Amongst the cold and timid souls,
Where only failure knows your name,

Look around for the closest to blame,
But look no further than the hands beneath your arms,
And now you're 6 feet down,
buried with,with your passing fame,fame,fame,fame,
[chorus]
Innocence gone,
Never take friendship personal!
If you can't hold yourself together,
Why should I hold you now?
And a sense gone!
never take friendship personal,
If you can't hold yourself together,
why should I hold you now?



Oh,oh,oh,you lie,
Tell me something more than what you tried to hide,
If you can't find yourself,then,
then how can I excpect to find you,



Oh,oh,oh, you cry,
Tell me something more than what you try,
the greatest tradgedy is not your death,
but a life without reason,
your life has no purpose,
your life has no reason,
your life has no purpose!
[Chorus]
Innocence gone!
Never take friendship personal,
If you can't holdyourself together,
Why should I hold you now?
And a sense gone,
Never take friendship personal,
If you can't hold yourself together,
Why should I hold you now?
