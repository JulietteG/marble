You wanna watch us break?
Be the first to take us down
But your teeth are worn
And theres no stopping us now
You gotta be mental
Your speeches are maligned
Take down this molotov of words
Penned with you in mind

Speak
Speak for yourself
You paper tigers
You'll crash where you stand
You've got a riot on your hands
Speak
Speak for yourself
You paper tigers
Too late to make demands
When you've got a riot on your hands

Silent alarms are ringing
Sounds of revolt draw near
A new united front
That you will come to fear
We will hold together
To become the change
Voice for the voiceless
With every common man engaged

Speak
Speak for yourself
You paper tigers
You'll crash where you stand
You've got a riot on your hands
Speak
Speak for yourself
You paper tigers
Too late to make demands
When youve got a riot


Ignite and watch us burn
Til every embers turn
Mankind will feel inspired
When we set your walls to fire

Speak
Speak for yourself
You paper tigers
You'll crash where you stand
You've got a riot on your hands
Speak
Speak for yourself
You paper tigers
Too late to make demands
When you've got a riot on your hands---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
