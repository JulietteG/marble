Up on this hill,
In this uncanny house.
The wind makes this place creep,
Lights they are flickering.
The moon she is lurking,
The clock it stopped working - at a quarter past three.

There's something dancing,
Here in the shadows,
And I wish it were us!

You haunt me baby,
You haunt me here tonight.
You haunt me baby,
You haunt me here tonight.
Tonight.
Tonight!

Can't get your memory,
Off of my mind - my mind.
Just want your heartbeat, on top of mine - of mine.

There's something dancing,
Here in the shadows,
And I wish it were us!

You haunt me baby,
You haunt me here tonight.
You haunt me baby,
You haunt me here tonight.
Tonight!

Up on this hill,
In this uncanny house?
Your spirit I can't see,
But I still believe.
I can feel your breath on me!

You haunt me baby,
You haunt me here tonight.
You haunt me baby,
You haunt me here tonight.
Tonight!

Up on this hill,
In this uncanny house.---Lyrics submitted by Andreas.
