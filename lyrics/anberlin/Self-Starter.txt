Last night rolled over beside my bed
That sort of madness could leave one dead
Our eyes deceive we were on fire
Mistook you for love and love desire

I still can't feel nothing just want to hold something
Tell me again what's real tell me again what to feel

Why do you stay until you see blood
Why does the weight fall upon us
We're on the same side in the same war
Why stay till you see blood

Where are we that we digress
Long for love but then undress
Our hands no bounds our hearts detached
We grasp for all that will not last

I still can't feel nothing just want to hold something
Tell me again what's real tell me again what to feel

Why do you stay until you see blood
Why does the weight fall upon us
We're on the same side in the same war
Why stay till you see blood---
