Don't try to wake me up, even if the sun really does come out tomorrow
Don't believe anything you say anymore
In the mourn, in the morning
Bricks to this old house a breaking
Steel would have weather but now forlorning

Its alarming how loud the silence screams 
No warn, no warn, no warning 
Addictions fill the table where their family used to sit and conversate, 
Conversate to the sounds 
To the sounds of a record player with its jumping needle 
And the lights that grow dim over time 

With down-cast eyes
There's more to living than being alive 
With down-cast eyes
There's more living than being alive

Oh-ahh-oh 

Are you where you thought you'd be
So beautiful and only twenty-three
Opposition rests on the hearts 
With no, with no, with no opportunity

It not that we don't talk
Its just no one really listens
And honesty fades
Like a politician who lost in the course
All smiles and no one remembers our names

With down-cast eyes
There's more to living than being alive 
With down-cast eyes
There's more to livin' than being alive


With down-cast eyes
There's more to living than being alive 
With down-cast eyes
There's more to livin' than being alive

Don't try to wake me up even if the sun really does come out tomorrow
Don't believe anything I say anymore
In the mourn, in the morning

With down-cast eyes
theres more to living than being alive 
With down-cast eyes
There's more to livin' than being alive
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
