If you need a friend, don't look to a stranger.
You know in the end, ill always be their.
And when your in doubt and when your in danger
Take a look all around, ill be their.

Chorus:

Im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say.
I know they dont sound the way I planned them to be.
But if you wait around a while, ill make you fall for me.
I promise, I promise you I will.

End of Chorus

When your day is done and so is your temper
You know what to do, where ill always be their.
Sometimes if I shout, its not whats intended.
These words just come out,

Chorus X2---Lyrics submitted by always.
