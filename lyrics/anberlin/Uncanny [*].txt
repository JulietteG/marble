Airports to Amsterdam
There's nothing that we can do now
I'm convinced, oh, that you're right
You're right where you belong,
Beside me, to remind me
Did you ever think this far behind me
You would see the world for what it was
And who we really were
Oh they love us American boys

Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world go by
Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world

Trains to Tokyo,
Staring out windows,
A place we've never been
While soundtracks play in backgrounds
To the stories of our lives
Non-fiction, oh envision,
if we never met and what we missed
And never really learned
Pacific Standard Time
Oh they love those American boys

Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world go by
Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world

Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world go by

Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world go by
Anywhere, say anywhere
As long as I'm with you
Anything, ask anything
We'll watch the world
