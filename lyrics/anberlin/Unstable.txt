You came out of nowhere
But who could you hold wild horse unstable
Do you still do as youre told
Think youre wild and youre free now
Think you can cover me, well save yourself
Pretend like you dont do what youre told
Come around, let me in
How can I talk you down from that ledge
Unless you let me in?
You heard when I called you
But you still lost your way
Are you able
To do just what youre told?
Taught me to trust now
Yet you have no faith
in yourself
Why cant you believe in what you know?
Come around (darling)
Let me in
How can I talk you down from that ledge
Unless you let me in?
How can I talk you down unless you come around,
Come around, come around?
Come around, darling
Let me in
How can I talk you down from that ledge
Unless you let me in?
Come around
Let me in
Ill talk you down from that ledge
Unless you let me in, lovely ---
