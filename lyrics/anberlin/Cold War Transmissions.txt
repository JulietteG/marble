Side by side we face each other
Standing here alone together
Your code I'll break, you made your last mistake
Called out cold war
Remnants now on the floor

This is Russian radio here
Calling you to come back home
This is Russian radio here
Run while you still, you still can

Different sides we take our stance
this could be our last goodbye forever
Your spies come clean, they told me everything
Your moves I make, penance the fire drake

This is Russian radio here
Calling you to come back home
This is Russian radio here
Run while you still, you still can

And if this is our last goodbye
let me kiss your lips of red tonight
and walk the other way (walk the other way)
Run away, run away
This is our last, this is our last goodbye
Go, go, go!

This is Russian radio here
Calling you to come back home
This is Russian radio here
Run while you still, you still can
Run while you still, you still can---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
