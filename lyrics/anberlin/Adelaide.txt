You're repeating the lines you think i want to hear, 
But i don't want to hear anymore
As sorry as any consolation
for what its worth,
you're stringing me along

S-S-Shouldn't need anyone, 
Shouldn't need anyone 
Just scared of being alone
But by the time you figured this out, I'm already gone

Adelaide, (Adelaide) you really had me going this time.  
Adelaide, (Adelaide) You need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, (Adelaide) you really had me going this time.  
Adelaide, (Adelaide) You need to quit, quit making a scene

You keep giving me signs
That you think i want to see
But your nothing like you seem
Hide behind your half-smile
But the truth is so undeniable

S-S-Shouldn't need anyone,
Shouldn't need anyone
Just scared of being alone
But by the time you figured this out I'm already gone

Adelaide, (Adelaide) you really had me going this time.  
Adelaide, (Adelaide) You need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, (Adelaide) you really had me going this time.  
Adelaide, (Adelaide) You need to quit, quit making a scene

Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
Something in life are unforgettable
Like love, loss, lies and us.
Somethings are undeniable

Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
Something in life are unforgettable
Like love, loss, lies and us.
Somethings are undeniable

Adelaide, (Adelaide) you really had me going this time.  
Adelaide, (Adelaide) You need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, (Adelaide) you really had me going this time.  
Adelaide, (Adelaide) You need to quit, quit making a scene---Lyrics submitted by Mya.
