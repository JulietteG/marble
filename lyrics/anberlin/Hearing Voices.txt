I feel lost
Conflicting thoughts course through
Clarity, she's gone
Don't know a thing I thought I knew
Everyone wants to see Heaven
But no one wants to say goodbye
Everyone wants to see Heaven
But no one wants to die

Can't escape this feeling
Fears are born inside
Can't escape this feeling
How can I deny?

I hear voices in my head
The choices I can't contend
I hear voices and they all know your name
They all know your name

Trapped inside a cell that I filled myself
Filled so very deep.

Everyone wants to know God
But they're afraid of what they'll find
Everyone wants to know God
But they want to live like he died

Can't escape this feeling.
Fears are born inside
Can't escape this feeling
How can I deny?

I hear voices in my head
The choices I can't contend
I hear voices and they all know your name
They all know your name

I know you're here with me

Can't escape this feeling
Fears are born inside
When this feelings moves you
How can I deny?

I hear voices in my head
Can't stand a ghost when the ghost's not dead
I hear voices and they all know your name
They all know your name

I hear voices in my head
The choices I can't contend
I hear voices and they all know your name
They all know your name---
