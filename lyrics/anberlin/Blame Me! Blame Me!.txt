And we could ride all night
To the pace of the blinking light
Wishing traffic was faster
Keeping safe distance but courting disaster
We could dance all night
To the sounds of a starting fight
Hoping change would come around
Amazing division how sweet the sound

Blame me, blame me, blame me
For mistakes you make but you can't own
Hate me, hate me, hate me
For every honest word that you have postponed
Leave me out of this your life's sinking ship
Blame me, blame me, blame me
For the mistakes you've make but you can't own

And we could stare all day 
At the problems that wont go away
Silence is pounding
You're wearing me down
These corners thy're rounding
We could scream all night
With no resolve still left in sight
Stop saying you're sorry
All of these words feel so very empty

Blame me, blame me, blame me
For mistakes you make but you can't own
Hate me, hate me, hate me
For every honest word that you've postponed
Leave me out of this your life's a sinking ship
Blame me, blame me, blame me
For the mitakes you've made but you can't own

Just torturing ourselves
We must be into the abuse
If you're the rope that ties us together
Then please make me a noose
Ask me to leave
Then beg me just to stay
Used to run to my arms
But now I walk away
You can come as you please
I'm like a part time lover with well worm knees
Well come on

Blame me, blame me, blame me
For the mistakes you've made but you can't own
Hate me, hate me, hate me
For every honest word that you've postponed
Leave me out of this your life's a sinking ship
Blame me, blame me, blame me
For the mistakes you've made but you can't own---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
