Are there no shadows where you are?
i can see everything is day 
problems that you try to hide away,
you're pushing me aside, you're pushing me aside.

could the winter calm come twice
could your heart seem so cold tonight
there's no substance, somehow isn't right
its killing me inside, its killing you inside, killing me inside

i dont want to be where you are,
i dont want to be here even now
i dont want to be by your side
something isnt right, something isnt right 

this is our last goodnight
say what you will
say all that you can, words have no meaning when ive seen where you've been
this is our last goodnight 
say what you will 
say all that you can, this is our last good bye
this is where love ends

i assume i have to right it wrong
how could you watch innocences forgone 
does what we've done ever really belong 
you're wasting me away, i feel so wasted away, 

god if you could hear me out alright
please take these feelings for her inside
my chest hurts when i breathe tonight
its wasting me away, there wasting me away, i feel so wasted away

i dont want to be where you are, 
i dont want to be here even now
i dont want to be by your side
something isnt right, something isnt right
this is our last (this is our last) this is our last goodnight
say what you will, say all that you can
words have no meaning when ive seen where you've been 

this is our last goodnight
say what you will, say all that you can 
this is our last goodbye (this is our last) this is where love ends 
this is our last goodnight, 
say what you will, say all that you can
this is our last goodbye, this is where love ends---Lyrics submitted by chelsea.
