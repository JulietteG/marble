Is this where the interstate ends, in coastal towns like this?
Waiting for my world to cave under.
We seem to invent ourselves in the places left unknown.
If hope could only find me out.
Is this the end of everything we know (we know)?
This is the end of everything I am.

Is anybody out there? Hello, hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knows.
Is anybody out there? Alone, alone!
Because the coldest winters thrive.

Depression is the unholy ghost in the coastal towns ahead.
Though I know a thousand names, I seem my only friend.
I've got the gun all I need is ten cents for the bullet.
I feel helpless sleeping at best waiting for your return. Are you ever coming home?

Is anybody out there? Hello, hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knows.
Is anybody out there? Alone, alone!
Because the coldest winters thrive on broken homes (broken homes).

Does anybody (does anybody) do they ever listen (do they ever listen)?
Does anybody (does anybody) care at all?
Do they care at all? Do they care at all? Do they care at all? Do you care at all? Do you care at all?!

Is this the end of everything we know (we know)? 
This is the end of everything I am.

Is anybody out there? Hello, hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knows.
Is anybody out there? Alone, alone!
Becuase the coldest winters thrive on broken homes.
Is anybody out there? Hello, hello!
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knows.
Is anybody out there? Alone, alone!
From a lesser known I'm here and there's hope. There's hope.---Lyrics submitted by Velsak.
