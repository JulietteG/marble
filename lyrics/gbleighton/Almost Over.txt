It's almost over
We've been doing this for so long.
Everything was right, now it's wrong
You're standing right next to the door.

It's almost over
How could we let this go so far?
That you would even stay in my arms
Long enough to tell me I'm yours.

Chorus:

What if I still love you?
What if I still care?
Would it change your mind?
Would it keep you here?
If I told you I'm sorry, for whatever I've done
Would it make any difference?  Would you still want to run?

It's almost over
I've tried to shake this thought but I can't.
Cause I still want the dreams that we've planned
The memories aren't nearly enough.

It's almost over
But I can't shake this thought from my head.
You and I layin' in this bed
With a baby in-between us.

Chorus:

What if I still love you?
What if I still care?
Would it change your mind?
Would it keep you here?
If I told you I'm sorry, for whatever I've done
Would it make any difference?  Would you still want to run?

If I tell you I love you, If I look in your eyes
If I tried to be softer,When I kiss you just right
If I reach out to hold you, when the tears start to fall
Would it keep you from leaving? Would it matter at all?

Chorus:

What if I still love you?
What if I still care?
Would it change your mind?
Would it keep you here?
If I told you I'm sorry, for whatever I've done
Would it make any difference?  Would you still want to run?

It's almost over, It's almost over.---Lyrics submitted by Music Man.
