Well i'm bad and you know it , clap your hands.
I'm bad and you know it , clap your hands.
I'm bad and you know it , clap your hands.
I'm bad and you know it , clap your hands.

Well I'm so misunderstood , but i'm trying to be good.

I'm bad and you know it , clap your hands.
Clap your hands,
Clap your hands,
Clap your hands, 

Well i'm bad and you know it , stomp your feet.
I'm bad and you know it , stomp your feet.
Well i'm bad and you know it , stomp your feet.
I'm bad and you know it , stomp your feet.

Well I'm so misunderstood , but i'm trying to be good.

I'm bad and you know it . stomp your feet.
Stomp your feet.
Stomp your feet. 
Stomp your feet.
Stomp your feet.


Well i'm bad and you know it , scream out loud.
I'm bad and you know it , scream out loud.
I'm bad and you know it , scream out loud.
I'm bad and you know it , scream out loud.

Well i'm so misunderstood , but im trying to be good.

I'm bad and you know it , scream out loud.
Scream out loud.
Scream out loud.
Scream out loud.

I'm bad you know it.
I'm bad you know it.
I'm bad you know it.


I'm bad you know it.
I'm bad you know it.
I'm bad you know it.---Lyrics submitted by Richard.
