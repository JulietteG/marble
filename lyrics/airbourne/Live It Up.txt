Lets go! Oh Yeah!
Spent all of my life breaking all the rules
Stepping out of line, the streets are my school
Cant get enough, all the good time
Down and live it up, while stand alive

Im a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till Im dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Id rather better been take the pain away
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up

The devil make em and I dont give a damn
To hell with the reason, its on stare
You got the invitation, I got the booze
Lots of vacation when theres nothing to lose

Im a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till Im dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Id rather better been take the pain away
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
Ah yeah

Nothing went live 
Sleep when I die
Dont you ever tell me to stop
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up

Im a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till Im dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
Oh live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
Im a hell raiser

Nothing went live 
Sleep when I die
Dont you ever tell me to stop---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
