I had a good job
And a good lovin' woman
But the world fell apart
And then I lost her
I cant ..?
?.. that you find
And drink enough whiskey
To make it all right

But the time will tell
Cause I have ?

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

You say I drink too much
And that is a problem
But thats how it goes
When you hit rock bottom
Dont need your advice
Or your helping hand
Cause Im living on the road
In a rock and roll band

The time will tell
And you will run

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

The time will tell (Yes it will) (Hey, hey)
Im gonna roll on (Hey, hey)
Im gonna stand strong (Hey, hey)
For the long haul (Hey, hey)
Its rock and roll

When the chips are down
You gotta make your play
'Cause there ain't no way (But the hard way)
There ain't no way (But the hard way)
I said there ain't no way (But the hard way)
Oh no there ain't no way
But the hard way

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it (Rock and roll)
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

There ain't no way but the hard way
No way but the hard way
No way but the hard way
So get used to it
The time will tell---Lyrics submitted by Jean-Philippe.
