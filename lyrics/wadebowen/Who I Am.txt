Well I love to watch the sunset, as it fades behind the trees
I love to talk with God as I pray down on my knees
And I love the times I've spent with my family and friends
And I love to dream about all the places I've never been

And I love to watch you laugh and smile I love to watch you dream
I love it when you take my hand let me know you believe in me
And I love it that your my girl, I love that I'm your man
Now that your in my life baby I know exactly who I am

Well I've always loved you baby and I may not always do what's right
but  I love it girl how we make up each and everytime that we fight
Well I love you oh so very much yes I love you more than words can say
And I don't know how or why but I love you more everyday 

And I love to watch you laugh and smile I love to watch you dream
I love it when you take my hand let me know you believe in me
And I love it that your my girl, I love that I'm your man
Now that your in my life baby I know exactly who I am

Well I love to watch you laugh and smile I love to watch you dream
I love it when you take my hand let me know you believe in me
And I love it that your my girl, I love that I'm your man
Now that your in my life baby I know exactly who I am

Now that your in my life baby I know exactly who I am---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
