Miles and miles in this old van
Things don't always go the way we plan
We always do the best we can
Out here on this honkey tonk road
With our boots and our drums and our guitars
We were born right here
In this hill country bars
We ain't afraid to go too far
Out here on this honkey tonk road

Oh oh oh
Out here on this honkey tonk road
Where the lights are hot
But the beer is cold
Out here on this honkey tonk road

We eat pretty well
But we don't sleep much
We gotta tear down we gotta set up
When we get time we go looking for love
Out here on this honky tonk road
We get paid in cash
We work for the door
Sometime we wonder
What we're out here for
But it's all worth it
When they scream for more
We get down on this honky tonk road

Oh oh oh
Out here on this honky tonk road
Where the lights are hot
But the beer is cold
Out here on this honky tonk road

Well we spend a lot of time in cheap hotels
Waking up feeling rough as hell
I called my momma just to send her my love
All she wants to know
Is when I'm giving this up
Looking for ways to pass the time
Trying to keep it between the lines
Trying to keep this dream from dying
Out here on this honky tonk road

Oh oh oh
Out here on this honky tonk road
Where the lights are hot
But the beer is cold
Out here on this honky tonk road

Oh oh oh
Out here on this honky tonk road
Where the lights are hot
But the beer is cold
Out here on this honky tonk road

God help me I love it out here so much
Out here on this honky tonk road---
