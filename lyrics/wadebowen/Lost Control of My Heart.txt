Saw her face, heard her voice
She made me laugh, I had no choice
Just like old friends from the start
Was that the day I lost control of my heart

Was it the night off river road
She kissed me softly, she kissed me slow
Down by the river, under the stars
Was that the day I lost control of my heart

Looking back all of those days just run together
In my mind I see it clear
I didn't know it at the time

Looking back all of those days just run together
In my mind I see it clear
I didn't know it at the time

Now she's gone I think too much
Should I give in
Should I just give up
I'm afraid
It's gone too far
I guess it's true
I've lost control of my heart

Yeah I've lost control of my heart---Lyrics submitted by Paige.
