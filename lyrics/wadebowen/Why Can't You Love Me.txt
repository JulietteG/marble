Why can't you love me, why can't you just be my girl
Why's it got to be so complicated, if you really love someone
I know you really don't love me, baby I guess that's alright
At least I had my moment with you, and I'll have that the rest of my life
Sometimes your dreams just don't work out, well you know I had my share before
Yea it's just another time that I'll have to walk thru, another unopened door

Why is it so hard, hiding all of my pain
Well I try not to be sad girl, I'll just hide my tears behind the rain coming down
If that's the only way to make you happy, then I'll do it against my will
Yea we could have been something really special
Now that's just a promise we left unfulfilled

Well I hope my heart can handle all of this
Oh and it's crazy how I'm feeling inside
Maybe someday I'll get over you, but for now I don't even want to try

Yea sometimes your dreams just don't work out
Oh and it's crazy how I'm feeling inside
Maybe someday I'll get over you, but for now I don't even want to try
Oh girl I don't even want to try

Why can't you love me, why can't you just be my girl
Why's it all got to be so complicated, in this complicated world---Lyrics submitted by Thomas.
