it's not easy anymore
everything seem to change
with one blink of an eye
i'm the man to lay the blame
well i've let you slip away
trying so hard to make this right
i have nothing left to do
no where else to turn
i know it's dark babe
----------
Please turn on the lights
let me see you cryin
your not here alone 
i'm in here with you tryin 
i wanna see the truth
find the broken pieces
we can make it right
but you have to, you have to
turn on the lights
----------
we can step into the sun
kiss the night good bye 
those things that hold you down
cut em lose and fly
reaching for my hand
might be hard for you to see
when shadows fill the room
baby i won't let you go
well i know it's dark babe
------------
please turn on the lights 
let me see you cryin
your not here alone
i'm in here with you tryin
i wanna see the truth
find the broken pieces
we can make it right
but you have to, you have to 
turn on the lights
------------
please don't be afraid, girl it's only me
yeah i'm here to help you
-----------
turn on the lights
let me see you cryin
your not here alone
i'm in here with you tryin
i wanna see the truth
find the broken pieces
we can make it right
but you have to, you have to
turn on the lights
-----------
ohhh turn on the lights
yeah you have to turn on the lights---Lyrics submitted by Peyton.
