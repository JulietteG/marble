I met you once, 
I loved you twice,
That's where this tale begins.
I played my hand,
I rolled the dice,
Now I'm paying for my sins.

I got some bad addiction baby,
It's you, that's right.
And I feel you taking over me,
Could luck be a lady in here tonight.

CHORUS:

My odds are stacked,
I've never been a gambling man,
I've never had the winning hand,
But for you I'd lose it all. (x2)
Baby I'd lose it all.

Oh could you be the queen of hearts,
or the devil in disguise,
With every move,
I'm blinded by those diamond in her eyes.

I got some bad addiction baby,
It's you, that's right.
And I feel you taking over me,
Could luck be a lady in here tonight.

CHORUS:
My odds are stacked,
I've never been a gambling man,
I've never had the winning hand,
But for you I'd lose it all. (x2)
Baby I'd lose it all.

I'm raptured in,
Your sweet loving,
But it feels just like a curse (feels just like a curse)
Your beneath my skin,
I start trembling,
This love's so dangerous

(place your bets) Oh won't you,
(place your bets) Why don't you just place your bets on me.

CHORUS:
My odds are stacked,
I've never been a gambling man,
I've never had the winning hand,
But for you I'd lose it all. (x2)

My odds are stacked (oh yeah)
I've never been a gambling man, 
I've never had the winning hand, (no I've never had)
But for you I'd lose it all. (but for you i would lose it all)

My odds are stacked (oh yeah)
I've never been a gambling man, (I've never been)
I've never had the winning hand,
But for you I'd lose it all.

Yeah yeah but for you,
I would lose it all.---Lyrics submitted by Charlotte.
