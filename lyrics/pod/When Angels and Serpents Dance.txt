Rhythmically moving, Emotions are rising.
Quivering to music, Trembling bodies in song.
Go unsteadily sliding, devious gliding.
So beautifully sailing and floating on.

Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.

Twistedly slipping, Radiance soaring.
Winding maliciously, creeping, flowing.
Righteous, moral, and just. Deceitful the creature is crawling.
The guardians flying, the dance is breathing,
Who's leading?

Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.

Who's leading? Leading you?
Everything you say, everything that you do!
Believe in what is true.
One must lead in the dance, Who's leading you?

Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.

Who's leading? Leading you?
Everything you say, everything that you do!
Believe in what is true.
One must lead in the dance, Who's leading you?---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
