The death sentence, capital punishment
Give of blood-shed, convict the innocent 
Eradicate the witness

Lynch the first, slaughter the last

Exterminate the absolute
Stain the just in the blood bath
Waste the pure, butcher the divine 
Annihilate the sunrise

And he was numbered with the transgressors
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

Eliminate the infinite 
Snuff the light and finish the truth
Kill the immaculate
Condemn beautiful virtue
Assassination of individual redemption
obliteration of this undeniable one

And he was numbered with the transgressors
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

Remember me when you step into your glory
Don't forget me when you step into your glory
Remember me when you step into your glory
Don't forget me when you step into your glory

YOUR GLORY!
The day that they murdered

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered LOVE---Lyrics submitted by Payden Merryman.
