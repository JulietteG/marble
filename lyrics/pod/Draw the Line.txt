Welcome to hard times, back again like its never been
For the first time it seem to mess with my head
When I realize what it takes, can I relate
With whatever, but never will it drive me to hate
Could be the next guy that you take before I wake
Now I lay me down to sleep, eyes tight when I pray
This her is real life, circumstances make you think
Should I be counting my blessings, the next second my eyes blink 

chorus:
Here in the Southtown you know that kid don't play
Put it down it the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

One love it's easier said than done
Can I rise above anything that gets in my way?
Like words you say, you let your tongue get loose
And when push comes to shove, I'm not used to walking away
I keep on looking up, because these times are getting tough
Tomorrow's gone and it's the same o' song
Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up
A life to shine, you're the diamond in this rough

It ain't got to be like this

Don't wanna throw up my fist, Don't wanna be like this
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist

It ain't got to be like this

(Chorus)

Here in the southtown
