Am I just floating around in this moment of time and space?
It makes me wonder.
A state of mind cause I'm just fading away
And my head is lost up in the satellites
I'm so far and gone to ever get it right
Through unseeing eyes, day dreaming again

Eternity is seemingly and endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time it's never ending
I'm lost in forever

Am I just hanging around all alone in my mindless haze?
It takes me under.
The infinite confined ready to blow you away
I'm too blind to see beyond the dead of night
But my spirit groans to see the after life
I'm so broken and small, come here and take me away

Eternity is seemingly and endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time it's never ending
I'm lost in forever

We live and we die. Given to faith and fear.
When my time is over, where do I go from here?

Eternity is seemingly and endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time it's never ending
I'm lost in forever ---
