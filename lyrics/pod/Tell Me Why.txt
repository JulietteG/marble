I thought you would come down today but some how i knew i needed to change and my life would be better off with you in it

I heard your voice,I heard your praise and i said please dont take me away let me breathe for the three more days

Help me pray I need you here today let me sit here and think about that and think about your praise.

Now that ive done with noing the from wrong i know your word and every christian song.

And i thought you would come down i figured it out by now i think im ready for you all i need is to Praise you 
 Just praise you 
 worship you 
 know your word 

because im ready to go and see this world let me be free let me see thee---Lyrics submitted by Traci.
