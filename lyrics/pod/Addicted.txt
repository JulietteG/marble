Intoxicated world, boys and girls
Deal me up another hit of self mutilation
Let me blow my brains, go insane
Throw it in my face and watch me chase
Stimulate, wide awake
Need to stop this pain inside my head, cause it's laughing at me
Injection, explosion, burning as it surges through my veins.

Cause I, I'm addicted to all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, love you when I know you're wrong.

Over and overindulges in anyone or anything that makes you feel, so alive.
I am electrified, I'm so high, known to all of you who are just out to get me.
Fascinate, magistate, cast a spell and maybe I might forget who I am.
Cowered in selfishness, thank you for letting us watch you die.

Because I, I'm addicted to all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
why do I love you when I know, love you when I know that I
I'm addicted to all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, I love you when I know you're wrong

Liar!

You are a liar!
Liar!
You are a liar!

Because I, I'm addicted to all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, love you when I know
that I, I'm addicted to all the colors that I see, that you hold in front of me
You have changed, yeah you have changed me
Why do I love you when I know, I love you when I know, you're wrong.---Lyrics submitted by sheldon.
