He never knew the meaning
Of love until he'd seen her
Oh man, she really drives him crazy
And she knows what she's doing
Heart aches, he can't fight this feeling
And won't stop until he tells her
She is his one and only lady
And you've got to believe me

Pre Chorus: 
It's what he said, what he said
This is what he said

Chorus: 
If you take my hand
We can run away
Stay close to my love
'Cause here we go again
Don't let go of my hand
So we can fly away
If you trust in my love
This will never end

She never did believe in
Love until she'd seen him
He's got to be pretty amazing
For her to share what she's feeling
She takes the chance, time for living
If she wants to get with him
She said you're gonna think i'm crazy
but you've got to believe me

Pre Chorus: 
It's what she said, what she said
This is what she said

Chorus: 
If you take my hand
We can run away
Stay close to my love
'Cause here we go again
Don't let go of my hand
So we can fly away
If you trust in my love
This will never end

Bridge:
Seems like we spend so much time
Driving this to our knees
I guess I won't really mind
If we're living for you and me
And this is what we said

Chorus:
If you take my hand
We can run away
Stay close to my love
'Cause here we go again
Don't let go of my hand
So we can fly away
If you trust in my love
This will never end---Lyrics submitted by trey.
