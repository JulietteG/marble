Everyday is a new day
I'm thankful for every breath that I take
I won't take you for granted (I won't take you for granted)
So I learn from my mistakes
It's beyond my control
Sometimes it's best to let go
Whatever happens in this lifetime
So I trust in love (So I trust in love)
You have given me peace of mind

Chorus:
I, I feel so alive for the very first time
I cant deny You
I feel so alive
I, I feel so alive for the very first time
And I think I can fly

Sunshine upon my face (Sunshine upon my face)
A new song for me to sing
Tell the world how I feel inside (tell the world how I feel inside)
Even though it might cost me everything
And now that I know this, so beyond, I can't hold this
It's like I can never turn my back away
And now that Ive seen You (and now that I see You)
I can never look away

Chorus:
I, I feel so alive for the very first time
I cant deny You
I feel so alive
I, I feel so alive for the very first time
And I think I can fly

Bridge:
Now that I know You (I could never turn my back away)
Now that I see You (I could never look away)
Now that I know You (I could never turn my back away)
Now that I see You (I believe no matter what they say)

I-I feel so alive (feel so alive)
for the very first time (for the very first time)
for the very first time, and I think I can fly.
I-I feel so alive (feel so alive)
for the very first time and I think I can fly,
and I think I can fly, and I think I can fly.---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
