One day......Some day 
This life not like you wanted it.
His eyes I can see again I need you here.
In your mind nobody's listening.
It's all right not to feel again, 
Just breathe again!

Time after time, I walk the fine line, 
But something keeps bringing me back.
Time after time, I'm going in blind, 
I don't know which way I need to go....

Feels like you world is caving in
And I cry failing to understand,
I wish I can.
It's all right if your missing him, 
In his eyes you can live again, 
Free again!

Time after time I walk the fine line, 
But something keeps pulling me back.
Time after time I'm going in blind, 
I don't know which way I need to go.

Time after time I walk the fine line, 
But something keeps bringing me back.
Time after time I cant see the signs, 
I don't know which way I need to go
Do all these road lead me back to you?....
I don't know which way I need to go.
One day? Some day!

Time after time I walk the fine line,
But something keeps bringing me back. 
Time after time, I'm going in blind,
I don't know which way I need to go.

Time after time I walk the fine line,
But something keep leading me back.
Time after time I can't see the signs, 
Do all these roads lead me back to you?
One day......---Lyrics submitted by Lyndsey.
