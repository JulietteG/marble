Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

(Yeah)
(The one)
(Uh huh)
(Baby you're a)
(California Gurls)

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me 
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream, 
The way you turn me on

I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever 
Look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe

This is real
So take a chance 
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Ima get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be a teenage dream tonight
(Tonight)
(You)

I know a place,
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, n wild
There must be something
In the water

You could travel 
The world,
But nothing comes
Close to the 
Golden coast

Once you party
With us,
You'll be falling in love,
Ohh oh Ohh

California Gurls 
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes 
Bikinis on top

Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Ohh oh Ohh
Ohh oh Ohh

California Gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock

West coast represent
Now put your
Hands up
Ohh oh Ohh

In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our
Promises, be us

Against the world
In another life 
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say 

You were the one
That got away
The one that got away

(The one)
(The one)
(The one)

In another life
I would make you
Stay, so I don't have
Say you were,
The one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
We're screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked out blur
And I'm pretty sure it ruled,
Damn

Last Friday Night
Yeah we danced 
On table tops
And we took too many shots

Think we kissed,
But I forgot
Last Friday Night
Yeah we maxed
Our credit cards

And got kicked out
Of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday Night
We went streaking 
In the park
Skinny Dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday Night
Yeah I think we 
Broke the law
Always say we're 
Stop-op
Whoa

This Friday night
Do it all again

(T.G.I.F)
(T.G.I.F)
(T.G.I.F)
(T.G.I.F)
(T.G.I.F)

You're so hypnotizing 
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing

Feels like I'm floating
Leaves my body
Glowing
They say, be afraid

You're not like the others,
Futuristic lovers
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole
Other world
A different dimension

You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go,
Lead me into the light

Kiss me,
K-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love
And fill me with your poison

Take me,
T-t-take me
Wanna be a victim,
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural,
Extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again

Do you ever feel,
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards,
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than
The moon, moon, moon

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than
The moon, moon, moon.---Lyrics submitted by Anne Acuna.
