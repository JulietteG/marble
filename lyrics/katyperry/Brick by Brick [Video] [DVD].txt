the weight of my words are like feathers from a bird
my mouth, it moves but you wont hear a thing
cause Ive dug myself deep,i managed to fit both my hands and feet
all my little white lies smell like a big old bucket of.. bleach

in one ear and out your other
so lock and key you wont open up for me

so brick by brick i am breaking through these walls
oh between you and me
im not giving up, im not giving up on us

i guess and it feels like youre in China and i am in Peru
when ever I am sleeping next to you, we can hear the crickets singing
oh all throughout the night oh boy can we just get used to something so right?

and sure I confess - im a mess..
im a mess of mistakes but please count to ten
before you go and throw it all away

so brick by brick i am breaking through these walls
oh between you and me
im not giving up, im not giving up on us


cause if you give up then what am i supposed to do?
all these dreams never will come true without you

so brick by brick i am breaking through these walls
oh between you and me
im not giving up yea yea yea yea yea yea
im not giving giving up im not giving giving up

oh baby dont give up on this love
dont give up on this lovethe weight of my words are like feathers from a bird
