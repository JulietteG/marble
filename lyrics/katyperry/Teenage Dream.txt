You think I'm pretty, without any makeup on
You think I'm funny, when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was a wreck but things, 
Were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my valentine, valentine
Let's go all the way tonight, no regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever.

(chorus) 
You make me, feel like i'm livin a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and dont ever look back, dont ever look back
My heart stops, when ya look at me, Just one touch
Now baby I believe, this is real so take a chance and dont ever look back, dont ever look back.

We drove to Cali, and got drunk on the beach, got a motel and built a floor out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece I'm complete 
Lets go all the way tonight, no regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die, you and i, we'll be young forever

(chorus)
You make me, feel like i'm livin a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and dont ever look back, dont ever look back
My heart stops, when ya look at me, Just one touch
Now baby I believe, this is real so take a chance and dont ever look back, dont ever look back.

I might get your heart racing, in my skin tight jeans, be your teenage dream tonight.
Let you put your hands on me, in my skin tight jeans, be your teenage dream tonight.

(chorus)
You make me, feel like i'm livin a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and dont ever look back, dont ever look back
My heart stops, when ya look at me, Just one touch
Now baby I believe, this is real so take a chance and dont ever look back, dont ever look back.

I might get your heart racing, in my skin tight jeans, be your teenage dream tonight.
Let you put your hands on me, in my skin tight jeans, be your teenage dream tonight. ---Lyrics submitted by sidnie.
