If you want me
with cherry on top
the pick of the peck
the creme de la crop
If you want me
you better do better than that tonight
oh oh

If you want me
it takes more than a wink
more than a drink
more than you think
If you want me 
you gonna have to brake the bank tonight
ooooh

Cause some don't have the patience
some call me high maintenance
but you pay the bill
cause that's the deal

Chorus:
If you wanna ride
just name your price
don't play cheap with your heart
don't make a bet
if you can't write the check
for me, for me
Cause i can be bought
but you pay the cost
if you can afford me

If you want me 
I'm not a piece of ass
a one night stand
a storage ship
I think you better walk by tonight
oh no

If you want me
then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me
there's no discount price tonight
oooooh

But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
Cause nothing free
except loving me

Chorus

If you want me
with cherry on top
the pick of the peck
the creme de la crop
