You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you change your mind like a girl I would know
And you always think, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

You're hot hot hot
Then you're cold cold cold cold
You gimme gimme gimme then you fall fall fall fall
You're hot hot hot
Then you're cold cold cold cold
You tease me tease me tease me then you go go go

T'es comme / ci comme ca
Ca va bien / je sais pas
J'aime le chaud / t'aimes le froid
Si je danse / tu fais quoi ?
Je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre
Que tu te decides
Tu ne m'auras plus comme avant avec un battement de cils

'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We hug, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh

You're Hot, Cold
You're Hot, Cold
You're Hot, Cold

You're Hot, Cold

You're hot hot hot
Then you're cold cold cold cold
You gimme gimme gimme then you fall fall fall fall
You're hot hot hot
Then you're cold cold cold cold
You tease me tease me tease me then you go go go

J'avance plus vite que la musique
T'as interet a me suivre
Si tu ne veux pas que je te quitte
Tu ne me va plus comme un gant
Je ne te vois plus comme avant
Je ne vais pas faire semblant
Surprends moi, ou va t'en

You're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love disorder
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love disorder
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love disorder---Lyrics submitted by gray.
