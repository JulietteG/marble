Im out on my own again 
Face down in the porcelain 
Feeling so high but looking so low 
Party favors on the floor 
Group of girls banging on the door 
So many new fair-weather friends 

(Chorus) 
Have you ever been so lost 
Known the way and still so lost 

Caught in the eye of a hurricane 
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade 
So sick of this town pulling me down 
My mother says I should come back home but 
Cant find the way cause the way is gone 
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space? 

(Chorus) 
Have you ever been so lost 
Known the way and still so lost 
Another night waiting for someone to take me home 
Have you ever been so lost 

Is there a light 
Is there a light 
At the end of the road 
Im pushing everyone away 
Cause I cant feel this anymore 
Cant feel this anymore---
