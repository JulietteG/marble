You gotta help me out
Its all a blur last night
We need a taxi
Cause youre hung over
And Im broke

I lost my fake I.D.
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin
Dirty looks now
Dont blame me

You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Dont be a baby
Remember what you told me

(Chorus)
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
Thats what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
Thats what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright
Did we get hitched last night
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring

Dont call your mother
Cause now were partners in crime
Dont be a baby
Remember what you told me

(Chorus)
You got me into this
Information overload
Situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.

Ha, and get some cash out
Were gonna tear up the town
No dont be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
You told me
You told me

(Chorus)
Thats what you get baby
Shake the glitter
Shake shake shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out baby
Gimme some cash out baby---
