(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you, for you)
(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you)

[VERSE 1]
Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You such a dirty doggy
It's your lucky night 'cause I'm in the mood
I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty
Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you
I can tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer
Pick a part, you dream it up
Like dirty dominatrix
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

[CHORUS]
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine to five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you

(Dressin' up for you, for you)
