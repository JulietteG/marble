I hope you hang yourself with your H&M; scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You dont eat meat
And drive electrical cars
Youre so indie rock its almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like boys
Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like

Youre so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal
Youre so skinny you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly youre so amused
That nobody understands you
Im so mean cause I cannot get you outta your head
Im so angry cause youd rather MySpace instead
I cant believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than

Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like boys
Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like

You walk around like youre oh so debonair
You pull em down and theres really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like boys
Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
Oh no no no no no no no
Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like boys
Youre so gay and you dont even like boys
No you dont even like
No you dont even like
No you dont even like oohh---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
