Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like Im letting em down
Cause $7.75
Isnt worth an hour of my hard working time
When you cant afford half the sh** they advertise
Oh Im worth more than an X
More then a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh I wont settle no oh
Oh I cant settle

I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air
Im not going down without a fight

(Chorus)
Its my life
And Im not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
Im leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
Im leaving my fingerprints
Im leaving my fingerprints
Im leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Dont you wanna go down in history
Rather than end up
Begging on the streets
Trading under table favors
For a place to sleep

Cause Im worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention

I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air
Im not going down with out a fight

(Chorus)
Its my life
And Im not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
Im leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
Im leaving my fingerprints
Im leaving my fingerprints

Dont give up
But dont give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

(Chorus)
Its my life
And Im not sitting on the sidelines watching it

Pass me by
Im leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

Its my life
And Im not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
Im leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
Cause Im leaving my fingerprints
Im leaving my fingerprints
Im leaving my fingerprints in the END---
