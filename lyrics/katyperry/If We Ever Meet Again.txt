What's somebody like you
Doin' in a place like this?
Say did you come alone
Or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's youre name,
What you drinking
I think i know what you're thinking
Baby what's your sign tell me yours 
And I'll tell you mine
Say what is somebody like you 
Doin' in a place like this

1,2,3, come on

Chorus:
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 
Wont let you get away if we ever meet again
This free fall's 
Got me so
Kiss me all night
Don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 

Do you come here much?
I swear I've seen your face before
Hope you don't see me blush
But i can't help but want you more more
Baby tell me what's your story 
I ain't shy don't you worry
I'm flirtin' with my eyes 
I wanna leave with you tonight
So do you come here much?
I've gotta see your face some more...
Some more... 'cause baby I....

Chorus:
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 
Won't let you get away if we ever meet again
This free fall's 
Got me so
Kiss me all night
Don't ever let me go 
I'll never me the same if we ever meet again

If we ever meet again again
I'll have so much more to say ( Say, If we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again
I won't let you go away (Say, If we ever meet again)
If we ever (ever meet again)
I'll have so much more to say (If we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again
I won't let you go awayyyy.....

Chorus:
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 
Won't let you get away if we ever meet again
This free fall's
Got me so
Kiss me all night
Dont ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 

I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 
Won't let you get away if we ever meet again
This free fall's
Got me so
Kiss me all night
Don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again---Lyrics submitted by myahmmm.
