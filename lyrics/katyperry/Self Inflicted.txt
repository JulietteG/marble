Remember when
I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee
Under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories

Every bones been broken
But my heart is still wide open

(Chorus)
I cant stop dont care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
Im going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing Im addicted to

With each scar theres
A map that tells a story
What a souvenir of
Young loves like
Jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave of
An ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

(Chorus)

And Id cover up these scars
But no make up can make up what we break up
And I cant stop seeing stars
Im so knocked out whenever youre around---
