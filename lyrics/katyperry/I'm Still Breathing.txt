I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
Im weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
Cause Im sending all the signs that

The clock is ticking
And Ill be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But dont say that you loved me

(Chorus)
Im still breathing
But weve been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
Were going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
I swear you didnt care
Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
Know its all for the better
That we end this here
Lets close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But dont say that you loved me

(Chorus)
Im still breathing
But weve been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
Were going down for sure
Oh weve been diagnosed
So lets give up the ghost

Cause Im still breathing
But weve been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
Were going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship---
