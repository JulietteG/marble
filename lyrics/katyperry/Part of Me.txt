Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade away
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus:]
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But youre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep and you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]

Now look at me Im sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You will never put me out again
Im glowin oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything yeah yeah
Except for me

[Chorus]

This is the part of me
No
Away from me
No
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me...
No
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But youre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no---Lyrics submitted by Cassie Dingwell.
