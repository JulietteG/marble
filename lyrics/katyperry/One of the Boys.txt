I saw a spider I didnt scream
Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dawg dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
Cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high five
Your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

(Chorus)
So I dont wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

So over the summer
Something changed
I started reading Seventeen and
Shaving my legs and
I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you
Staring at me

Cause I know what you know
But now youre gonna have to take a number
Its okay
Maybe one day
But not until you gimme my
Diamond ring

(Chorus)
Cause I dont wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your
Homecoming queen
Pin up poster dream
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day youre gonna wanna make out
Make out, make out with me

Dont wanna be (echo) x 3---
