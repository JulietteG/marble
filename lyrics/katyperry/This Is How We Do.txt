(This is how we do, This is how we do)

Sipping on ros, sipping on sun, coming up all lazy
(This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh, she's a Daisy
Playing ping pong all night long, everything's on me and then hazy
(This is how we do)

Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
All the girls vintage Chanel baby

It's no big deal, It's no big deal, It's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

Big hoops, and the room leaves, my clique happenning, my Maseratti
(This is how we do)
Said to Barbara, chique, at the super rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all japanese-y
(This is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah karaoke

It's no big deal, It's no big deal, It's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

This one goes out to ladies, at breakfast, in last night's dress
Uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet and it's Tuesday
Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money
Respect

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

This is how we do
This goes out to all you people going bed with a ten and waking up with a two
This is how we do
Ha, not me

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

What? Wait. No, no, no
Bring the beat back, that's right ---
