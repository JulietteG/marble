I was stuck in the ground
Trying to cover my eyes
Trying to move all this light
I spent all night
Trying to remember your face
Like trying to get blood from a stone
But there was nothing to save
And no one to lie to
And I watched as the bone dust hung in the sky
Like a dim flock of endless prayers
And I spent my days out chasing the wind
Trying to turn gold from your hair
But there was nothing to save
In the flux and decay
Of the changing winds---Lyrics submitted by Cindy Lim.
