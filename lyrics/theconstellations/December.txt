I recall every winter, spring and fall it comes and goes.
Like the earth spinning round and round, youre gone and no-one knows. 
Standing still like a broken clock that needs to rewound.
Without will, It relieves youre worried mind where you fall.

Chorus X2
The leaves fall in September. 
October gets a little colder. 
November in the rain cold freeze. 
By December, youll be on your knees, yeah. 

The coldest chill, in the time of fallen leaves. 
It makes me weak.
Harvest filled from all the seeds weve sewn in season; 
now we reap and we grow. 
A little closer to the end of what we know. 
And were blown like the ashes,
Dust to dust, and now youre gone. 	

Chorus X5
The leaves fall in September. 
October gets a little colder. 
November in the rain cold freeze. 
By December, youll be on your knees, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Adam Schrage.
