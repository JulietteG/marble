Shower you with love
Ohhhhhh owwwww
Again yeah baby
Yes you know that your love 
Is on my mind
You give me a special feeling
Each and everyday
And All I know is when were together, baby
I fight by tears of happiness
With you Ive been blessed
Gotta give you my love
Cause youre the lover of my dream
And all I want to do is shower you with love, girl
And give it all to you, 
Every minute, every hour,
All I want to do is shower you with love, yeah
I love you
---much much more
Nothing in my life compares to your love 
You mean everything to me
Im so in debt to you
Forever grateful Ill be
Cause youre the lover of my dreams
And all I want to do is shower you with love
Give it all to you
Every minute, every hour,
All I want to do is shower you with love
Ohhh baby
Nothing in my life compares to your love
You mean everything to me
Im so in debt to you
For grateful, Ill be
Cause youre the lover of my dreams
And all I want to do is shower you with love, girl
Give it all to you
Every minute, every hour
All I want to do is shower you with love,
---lover of my dreams, shower you with love---Lyrics submitted by Darryl.
