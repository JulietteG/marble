What goes around
Comes back around
When you least expect it
You dug this whole
Now dig it out
Cuz you've just got rejected

You had me right where you wanted me
Wo-o-a-o-ao-oh
I thought you knew me better
Better than I ever
Wo-o-a-o-ao-oh
Cant stop it now

The lies are falling down
And now they're coming after you
To take you down
Take you down
You're gonna hit the bottom
Oh-oo-oah-oo-oah
Watch and Learn
Oh-oo-oah
You're gonna crash and burn when you hit the bottom

One by one
You count it out
Loved to live in disconnection
And after all you've said and done
No ones gonna listen

You had me right where you wanted me
Woah-o-a-o-ao-oh
Thought you knew me better
Better than I ever
Woah-o-a-o-ao-oh (echo)
Cant stop it now

The lies are falling down
And now they're coming after you
To take you down
Take you down
You're gonna hit the bottom
Oh-oo-oah-oo-oah
Watch and Learn
Oh-oo-oah
You're gonna crash and burn when you hit the bottom

The waters rushing in and you should try to save yourself
From this disaster 
That you're after
 And you just cant win
Cant stop it now

The lies are falling down
And they're coming after you
To take you down
Take you down
You're gonna the bottom
Oh-oo-oah-oo-oah
Watch and Learn
Oh-oo-oah-oo-oah
When you hit the bottom
When you hit the bottom
You're gonna crash and burn when you hit the bottom---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine Osborne.
