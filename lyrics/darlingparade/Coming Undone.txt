Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow
But you can choke to death on your pride
Could you think you might be the reason?
Can you go to bed with your lies?

You should know that you're fighting for nothing
When deep down you know you're looking for something
You keep giving it the third degree
Well you don't stand a chance if you're messing with me-e
All this time you'll be getting the run around
Spreading it around
its running you outta town
You keep giving it the third degree
Well you don't stand a chance if you're messing with me-e

You're playing king in your ivory tower
It doesn't matter what happens to us
Well if this is your best then you got what you wanted
You can take whats left and have fun by yourself

You should know that you're fighting for nothing
When deep down you know you're looking for something
You keep giving it the third degree
Well you don't stand a chance if you're messing with me-e
All this time you'll be getting the run around
Spreading it around
its running you outta town
You keep giving it the third degree
Well you don't stand a chance if you're messing with me-e

So long
Just so long
To everyone that you've known
Cuz its not gonna work
No it never works on me
Or anyone

You should know that you're fighting for nothing
When deep down you know you're looking for something
You keep giving it the third degree
Well you don't stand a chance if you're messing with me-e
All this time you'll be getting the run around
Spreading it around
its running you outta town
You keep giving it the third degree
Well you don't stand a chance if you're messing with me-e-e---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine Osborne.
