Sing out the bells are ringing
Follow your heart that's beating
Inside she's crying
I cant stop denying

I've got this feeling
Running through my veins
I cant stop this feeling
I'm starting to change

Yeah
Oh we're just fighting for our lives

I'm losing it tonight
It's a never ending fight
I can't shake it off of my mind
I know I've got to stay around this time
And I'm dying just to find
That it is part of me that's trying to survive

What I know
Is that I'm
Getting so confused
I need you right beside me
All the time
I'm trying to reach you
Caught up in concentrating
I want this to be over
We're starting so frustrated

Oh
we're just fighting for our lives

I'm losing it tonight
It's a never ending fight
I can't shake it off of my mind
I know I've got to stay around this time
And I'm dying just to find
That it is part of me that's trying to survive

We are so alone in this place
And you can't make it on your own
I can't deny it
You can't deny it

I'm losing it tonight
It's a never ending fight
I cant shake it off of my mind
I know I've got to stay around this time
And I'm dying just to find
That it is part of me that's trying to survive
Sing out the bells are ringing
Follow your heart that's beating
Sing out the bells are ringing
Follow your heart that's beating
Inside she crying
Cant stop denying
Inside shes crying
Follow your heart that's beating---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine Osborne.
