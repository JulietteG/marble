Sitting in your front yard drinking lemonade
Surburban life, frigid wife, you think you've got it made
But you dont know what's in store for you and your family, ha ha
We're moving in right next door wont you welcome me

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood 
an I hope I didn't ruin your day
Won't you be my neighbor

Yeah I brought my life, my ugly wife, my dirty dog with fleas
My kid's a punk and I'm a drunk but this I'm sure you'll see
And you don't know what it's like to live in misery
Come on and welcome to home sweet hell dissatifaction guaranteed

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
And if I could I surely would
Invite you in and say
won't you be my neighbor
A won't you be my neighbor
A won't you be my neighbor

Oh come on I don't think you'll find (a could you be my neighbor)
A place to live in peace of mind (a could you be my neighbor)
You're gonna live in misery (a would you be my neighbor)
When you're livin' next to me

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Rahh 
Won't you be now
Won't you be my funky neighbor

An I drink
An I stink
An I smoke
I'm a joke 
And I know just what your thinkin'
It could be you out and your drinkin'
You see I can't drink an drive
It could be you in a little while
I hope i didn't ruin your day aaaaahhhhhhh

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
I did your wife she sure is good
A beautiful day in the neighborhood
Aaaaaahhhhhh ha ha ha---Lyrics submitted by steve.
