Back of few months ago I was headling
At a great big night club
And they put me up at what they call the Star Suite:
Now here I am headling
At one of the biggest night clubs
In the country and I wake up
At eight o'clock in the morning
In this Star suite all by myself.

Aah that's what I said "Aah".
But I did what I've always done to cheer myself up

I picked up my guitar

I sat down and wrote me a little song.
Now this is how it feels to be alone
At the top of the hill and trying to figure out why

Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way.
I can't wait to look in the mirror

'cos I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me

I must be a hell of a man.
O Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.

I used to have a girlfriend
But I guess she just could'n't complete
With all of these lovestarved women
Who keep clamouring at my feet.
Well I probably find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me

Who cares I never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company.

Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way.
I can't wait to look in the mirror

'cos I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me

I must be a hell of a man.
O Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.

I guess you can say I'm a loner

A cowboy outlaw tough and proud
Well
I could have lots of friends if I wanted
But then I wouldn't stand out from the drowd

Some folks say that I'm "egotistical
Well I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the
Way that I fill out my skintight blue jeans.

Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way.
I can't wait to look in the mirror

'cos I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me

I must be a hell of a man.
O Lord it's hard to be humble
We are doing the best that we can.---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
