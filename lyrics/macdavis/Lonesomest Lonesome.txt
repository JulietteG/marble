Well, I scorched your favourite pan this morning, trying to make some pancakes,
Spilled the grease and had to stop and mop the floor,
Sat there like a little baby crying in my cornflakes,
I don't think that I can take it any more.
Baby, come home--this is the lonesomest lonesome I've ever known.

Late last night I woke up trembling, with my arms wrapped 'round your pillow,
And a lump as big as Texas in my throat.
Sat there in the dark and played my guitar 'til the sun came up,
And wrote the saddest song I ever wrote.
Baby, come home--this is the lonesomest lonesome I've ever known.

Lonesomest lonesome, oh, the saddest sad.
The loneliest I've ever been alone.
You've been the best thing this poor boy ever had,
And now you're gone.

Well, tonight I'm going to get down on my knees and say a prayer,
For the first time since I can't remember when.
Maybe if I'm lucky, when I wake up in the morning,
You'll be soft and warm beside me once again.
Baby, come home--this is the lonesomest lonesome,
Lonesomest lonesome I've ever known.

Lonesomest lonesome...---Lyrics submitted by Leslie Turriff.
