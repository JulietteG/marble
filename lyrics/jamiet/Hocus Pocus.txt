Bullets Flying over head,
Hear them through the walls as you lie in bed,
Know you're fighting for the one you love,
But this time son I'm telling you to run.

Lost myself in things I shouldn't do,
Came 2 years later to without you,
The things l've done and the things I've seen,
I've been so wrong to so many the team,
Is all looking like they're all past up and away,
Disowned from their homes and their families,
Well I can't see myself in the dream,
The dream I saw was all round me got.

Hocus pocus three men jokers,
Barristers beast policemen thieves,
Three queens and broken dreams,
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend.

Well the jokers looking over as he pulling an ace,
The militia take cover under my staircase,
Witches in the kitchen bitching and itching,
While two old school friends haunt the hall ways,
The host proposed a toast all of the ghost,
And the ones that loved us the hearts we broke say,
I'll never make that promise again
Once was enough to all around me got

Hocus pocus three men jokers,
Barristers beast policemen thieves,
Three queens and broken dreams,
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend.

As I came to I looked for you in the cupboards and the drawers,
And the toilet queue,
Asked the medicine man it he had heard the news,
He told me I'd thrown you out last june,
Grabbed the politician by the neck threatened to use,
Fists in a fight to find out the truth,
He said you set the scene son everyday,
You can't blame the dammed for your own mistakes,
While the mason he was pacing in my living room.
Emma had a child growing up in the womb.
I said I'm staying in I never felt like I left,
My last breath was taken in conjunction with

Hocus pocus three men jokers,
Barristers beast policemen thieves,
Three queens and broken dreams,
A bottle full of trouble and a gambling fiend.---
