Friends in high places 
Others in cages 
Tips on the races 
And a bottle full of rum 
[HEY] 
You never will see him 
From here to the river 
If you do see him 
He'll be drunken in a cab 
[HEY]
I'm trying to cut tracks
Cus of helpless Smaritans
Little Brother sat and longing with a Pack
Brothers argue full blown
Full blown when they hang us
Mitchell number listen
and they'll never call 'im up

Ralbrooke's got decided
Ah-  and oh these answers
Down at the shop on the other side of town
Turned to Robbie's at university
watching clocks singing along
Nah and say until they stomp

Friends in high places 
Others in cages 
Tips on the races 
And a bottle full of rum 
[HEY] 
You never will see him 
From here to the river 
If you do see him 
He'll be drunken in a cab 
[HEY]

Quick satelite got the best on a man
and he's sorry he turned away
oh will they will they hang
Sitting in the fullback
Left it in a truck
We'll see it in the back seats
And lots along the back

Young professionals watching girls on poles
you work hard, play hard, dying to get old
try it til' your thirty
just securing gold
raising up a family, make sure they never know

Friends in high places 
Others in cages 
Tips on the races 
And a bottle full of rum 
[HEY] 
You never will see him 
From here to the river 
If you do see him 
He'll be drunken in a cab 
[HEY]



Frapapa
Baby you must know
the dance of the young professionals X 5

Friends in high places 
Others in cages 
Tips on the races 
And a bottle full of rum 
[HEY] 
You never will see him 
From here to the river 
If you do see him 
He'll be drunken in a cab 
[HEY]---Lyrics submitted by Hunter.
