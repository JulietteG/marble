I'm not gonna lie, I'm not a nice nice guy
But I tried and tried but I don't know why
Cause when I put my head down sleeping
I got this tiny little feeling creeping in the night

I'm not gonna say, there ain't no grey grey days
But it's cloudy in the best of times
Getting tired of wasting worries
Why not let the worries worry for themselves for a change?

Here's some fighting words for the sleeping
I heard the bells were ringing in the night
I know that you can hear them knocking
Banging at your doors

Why don't you want to answer anymore?
Cause I don't want to let you down

So good morning
Oh, good morning
Good afternoon

Day by day
Watched you wandering through the streets
Smiling through the window shield
How you doing today?
Are you sitting in the mad man's hands again?
I want you to know
You ain't alone

I know I saw something sinking in the back of your eyes
I hope it wasn't hope that was hoping
Hoping for the very last time
Hard to be optimistic and realistic at the very same time
Why can't we meet in the middle sometimes?

I know that I heard you screaming
You were screaming in the night
And I know the water is rising past your knees
I'm not gonna lie and it's so damn easy tonight

Aren't you getting tired of wrapping the sugar around your ears
Cause all the flashy people putting the candy in their eyes
And all I wanna do
Is lay there next to you
Instead of staring at the black mirror all night long

The only remedy is don't panic here my dear
And the only thing I'll tell you
You ain't alone here anymore
You ain't alone here anymore

Day by day
As you're wandering through the streets
Smiling like it isn't real
How you doing today?
Are you sitting in the mad man's hands again?
What you doing
In the mad man's hands, in the mad man's hands today?

No, I don't want to let you down
No, I don't wanna let you down
No, I don't wanna let you down---
