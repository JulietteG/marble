Here I am
Back where I started
Frozen over
Broken hearted
Chasing shoulders
Cold as ice
Shield your love
Or pay the price

It's funny
When I put 'em first
ooh
It's over and
Now we're in reverse

When I give them my heart
And let 'em in
that's when it ends
I show them my scars
They open them over again
Every time I gave my love
Love left me there to linger
When I give them my heart
That's when it ends

And that's why I'm single
That's why I'm single
That's why I'm single

Played the games
Those days are over
Things have changed
And now i'm older
Understand that love ain't easy
Lots to give
But don't receive it

It's funny
When I put 'em first
ooh
It's over and
Now we're in reverse

When I give them my heart
And let them in
that's when it ends
I show them my scars
They open them over again
Every time I gave my love
Love left me there to linger
I give them my heart
That's when it ends

And that's why I'm single
That's why I'm single
That's why I'm single---
