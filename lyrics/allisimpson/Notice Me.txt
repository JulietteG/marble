Tripping on a glances
Please take your time
But I won't, be here, forever

Once for taking chances
But keep in mind
That I won't, be here, forever

And I'm all ooo
What's a girl to do (ooo)
If I can't have you (ooo)
Then I don't want anyone but

If these tears were gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me
Swim in a line, it's all to make you see (eee)
Nothing to crazy, if it makes you notice me

Look at me, I'd walk a tight rope over storming seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing to crazy, if it makes you notice me

Like a supernova, you're blinding me
And we won't, be here, forever
When the day is over, come look for me
Cause we won't be her forever

And I'm all ooo
What's a girl to do (ooo)
If I can't have you (ooo)
Then I don't want anyone but

If these tears were gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me
Swim in a line, it's all to make you see (eee)
Nothing to crazy, if it makes you notice me

Look at me, I'd walk a tight rope over storming seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing to crazy, if it makes you notice me

I'm, not, giving up, I'm not giving up
I'm, not, giving up

If these tears were gasoline, I'd light a fire make you notice me
Swim in a line, it's all to make you see (ee)
Nothing to crazy if it makes you notice me

Gasoline, I'd light a fire make you notice me
Swim in a line, it's all to make you see
Nothing to crazy, if it makes you notice me

Look at me, I'd walk a tight rope over storming seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing to crazy, if it makes you notice me

I'm, not, giving up, I'm not giving up
I'm, not, giving up
I'm, not, giving up, I'm not giving up
I'm, not, giving up ---
