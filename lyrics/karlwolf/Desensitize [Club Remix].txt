Mmm
Mmm

Yo 
Uh
Check it out y'all

I'm a man of the world
And I'm standing still
Got a glimpse of the sun
And I like the way you dance
I'm banging on the walls 
That prevent me from th esea
So don't get me wrong mama
I thank God for what I have 
And I'll do it again

[Chorus:]
I'm jading in the warm glow
Gotta desensitize
Beach front
The ocean view
And my young candy wife
I'm fading in the burning light
Gotta desensitize
And right now
I just wanna know that I'm alive

Everybody to the back of the bus
Lay low if you're making a fuss
The world saw the crowd 
Producing the sound
It's flavor in your ear
Great stuff
Now y'all get down to the beat
Make magic with your feet
And clap to the rythm
And clap to the rythm
Let me hear hear your fucking scream

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

Theyre working me 9 to 9 and thieving my youth
Rewarded financially yet weakened my roots
Distracting all mighty future, its all put behind

So don't get me wrong mama
I thank God for what I have 
And I'll do it again

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by max.
