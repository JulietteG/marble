Get your body movin on the dance floor
Shake your body girl, Shake your body girl
Get your body movin on the dance floor
Shake your body girl, Shake your body girl

She wants to know, everything you do,
when your far away, or shes next to you
Baby, your in love, or ya just gettin down
only time will tell, so baby come around

Im on it, like water when your so hot like fire
Your body just burnin, till your feet are almost hurtin
You feel the pressure, Your loves like here to treasure
Cmon boy go get that girl, all she wants to do is rock your world !

She wants to know, will you be there for her till the end
She wants to know, gonna love her more than just a friend
She wants to know, that dude is feelin her for real (yeah)
She wants to know cos she loves you (x2)

Get your body movin on the dance floor
Shake your body girl, Shake your body girl
Get your body movin on the dance floor
Shake your body girl, Shake your body girl

Shes in the zone, shes rockin all alone
Showing off her body, you know i'd take her home with me
Now its time, to give you what i got
Girl just let me spend, hit you in the right spot

Im on it, like water when your so hot like fire
Your body just burnin, till your feet are almost hurtin
You feel the pressure, Your loves like here to treasure
Cmon boy go get that girl, all she wants to do is rock your world !

She wants to know, will you be there for her till the end
She wants to know, gonna love her more than just a friend
She wants to know, that dude is feelin her for real (yeah)
She wants to know cos she loves you (x2)

Get your body movin on the dance floor
Shake your body girl, Shake your body girl
Get your body movin on the dance floor
Shake your body girl, Shake your body girl

Im on it, like water when your so hot like fire
Your body just burnin, till your feet are almost hurtin
You feel the pressure, Your loves like here to treasure
Cmon boy go get that girl, all she wants to do is rock your world !
(all she wants to do is rock your world !)

She wants to know, will you be there for her till the end
She wants to know, gonna love her more than just a friend
She wants to know, that dude is feelin her for real (yeah)
She wants to know cos she loves you (x2)
