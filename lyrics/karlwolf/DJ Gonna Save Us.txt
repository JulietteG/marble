Its like oh oh oh oh
Dj gonna save us
Dj gonna save us tonight
Go dj
Sometimes i feel the world is ending
What if there was no tomorrow
I look around the walls cave in
And it feels like we`re running out of time
Mister dj turn it up 'cause i`m about to run this place
Fire fire fire fire
Dj come on put in on!
Put your put your hands in the air
And let the dj save you tonight
There`s a party up in here
So lets get it started
Its like oh oh oh oh dj
Oh oh oh oh dj
Dj gonna save us tonight
Oh dj oh dj oh dj
Dj gonna save us tonight
Oh dj oh dj oh dj
Dj gonna save us tonight
Oh dj oh dj oh dj
Tonight the light is shining on me
Only if the world could see me now
'cause i got all my people with me
Now i`m about to get this party started right now
Mister dj turn it up 'cause i'm about to run this place
Fire fire fire fire
Put ur put ur hands in the air n let the dj save u tonight
There`s a party up in here so lets get it started
