R O C
Mmm
Mmm

I'm jaded I wanna go
Gotta desensitize
Beach front
The ocean view
And my young candy wife
I'm fading in the burning light
Gotta desensitize
And right now
I just wanna know that I'm alive

Everybody to the back of the bus
Lay low if you're making a fuss
The world saw the crowd 
Producing the sound
It's flavor in your ear
Great stuff
Now y'all get down to the beat
Make magic with your feet
And clap to the rhythm
And clap to the rhythm
Let me hear, hear your fucking scream
Yo 
Uh
Check it out y'all

I'm a man of the world
And I'm standing still
Got a glimpse of the sun
And I like the way you dance
I'm banging on the walls 
That prevent me from the sea 
So don't get me wrong mama
I thank God for what I have 
And I'll do it again

I'm jaded I wanna go
Gotta desensitize
Beach front
The ocean view
And my young candy wife
I'm fading in the burning light
Gotta desensitize
And right now
I just wanna know that I'm alive

[Instrumental]

So don't get me wrong mama
I thank God for what I have 
And I'll do it again

I'm jaded I wanna go
Gotta desensitize
Beach front
The ocean view
And my young candy wife
I'm fading in the burning light
Gotta desensitize
And right now
I just wanna know that I'm alive
