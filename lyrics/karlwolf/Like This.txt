Verse 1
I, I'm looking at something you got,
I won't apologize
There's something in my mind
I gotta tell you I can't hide baby
I notice that your friends are hating on
me and feel a bad vibe
So I walk over to you and I tell it to you like this

Pre-Chorus
I want you now (like this)
I gotta have you (like this)
I need to know you (like this)

Your body's overflowing like a champagne bottle
She's so fine
She looks deep in my eyes
I can tell she's gonna be mine
So mammy won't you come and take a ride with me tonight

Verse 2
I, All I need is for you to realize babe
I'll be your man and one day you'll be my wife
And that is something we both just can't deny
Cause baby you got a hold on me

Hey baby you know I'm feelin' you, your flow, your style
And I know you want me girl it feels so good inside
What about your girls (you know I got your back)
Can we flex out the club (no not yet)
Why can't I just be with you like this

Pre-Chorus
I want you now (like this)
I gotta have you (like this)
I need to know you (like this)
