Abandon all hope who enter here
Eternal pain that runs among  lost
It's the fiction of life
What you are is what you live

It never made a fucking difference to you
In the eyes you can see the truth
It's the fiction of life
I'm going deep no other way

Lost, who enter here

Nothing seemed to go as planed
It makes no difference to the choices I make
I'm convicted in life
Don't wanna make the same mistakes

Lost, who enter here

Can't live with the faults
There is no remorse for you and me

Convicted in life,
Fiction in life,
Victim in life---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
