Roots bloody roots 
Roots bloody roots 
Roots bloody roots 
Roots bloody 

I believe in our fate 
We don't need to fake 
It's all we wanna be 
Watch me freak 

I say we're growing every day 
Getting stronger in every way 
I'll take you to a place where we shall find our 
Roots bloody roots 
Roots bloody roots 
Roots bloody roots 
Roots bloody roots 
Rain bring me the strength to get to another day 
And all I want to see 
Set us free 
Why can't you see? 
Can't you feel this is real? 

I pray we don't need to change our ways to be saved 
That all we wanna be 
Watch us freak---Lyrics submitted by Tim.
