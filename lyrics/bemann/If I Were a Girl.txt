If I were a girl
Even just for a day
Id rolled out of be in the morning
Put all on my make-up then go

Go shop with the girls
and get my nails done
i would flirt with who I wanted
And I never get confronted for it
cause they cover for me

If I were a girl
I think I could understand
what it needs to love a man
i swear at to the best I can

I'd to listen him
Cause I know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

If I were a girl
I would turn off my phone
i will lie and say its broken
so he wouldnt know that im unfaithful

Id put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know he'll always be there
faithfully waiting at home (waiting at home)

If I were a girl
I think I could understand
what it needs to love a man
i swear at to the best I can

I'd to listen him
Cause I know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

Its a little too late 
for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think I forgive you like that

If you taught I would wait
for you.. you taught wrong..

But you're just a girl
You dont understand (yeah you dont understand)

what it means to love a man someday
You learn to appreciate
You dont listen to him
You dont care how it hurts

Until you lose the one you wanted
cause you taken him for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

But you're just a girl....---Lyrics submitted by jhec.
