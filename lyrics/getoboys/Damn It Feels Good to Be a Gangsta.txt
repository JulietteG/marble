Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Verse 1
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right 
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin mouth 
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights 
And niggas always gotta high cap 
Showin' all his boys how he shot em 
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts 
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em 
And everythings cool in the mind of a gangsta 
'cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep 
Up three-sixty-five a year 24/7 
'cause real gangsta ass niggas don't sleep 

And all I gotta say to you 
Wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' prankstas 
'cause when the fry dies down what the fuck you gonna do 
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 

Verse 2
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 
Feedin' the poor and hepin out wit they bills 
Although I was born in jamaica 
Now I'm in the us makin' deals 
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 
I mean one that you don't really know 
Ridin' around town in a drop-top benz 
Hittin' switches in my black six-fo' 
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors 
Some got killed in the past 
But this gangtsa here is a smart one 
Started living for the lord and I'll last 

Now all I gotta say to you 
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eatin' cocksuckin' prankstas 
When the shit jumps off what the fuck you gonna do 
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 

Verse 3
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 
A real gangta-ass nigga knows the play 
Real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches 
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga little jake 
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign 
And play the role of little miss sweet 
But catch the bitch all alone get the digit take her out 
And then dump-hittin' the ass with the meat 
'cause gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas 
And everythings quiet in the clique 
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger 
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit 
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much 
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast 
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit 
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast 
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit 
Hit the pen and let the mothafuckas shank ya 
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game 
'cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta 

Verse 4
And now, a word from the president! 
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta 
Gettin voted into the white house 
Everything lookin good to the people of the world 
But the mafia family is my boss 
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down 
Like lettin' a big drug shipment through 
And send 'em to the poor community 
So we can bust you know who 
So voters of the world keep supportin' me 
And I promise to take you very far 
Other leaders better not upset me 
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war 
To all you republicans, that helped me win 
I sincerely like to thank you 
'cause now I got the world swingin' from my nuts 
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta.---Lyrics submitted by Corrina.
