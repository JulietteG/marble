if the lord never does anything else for me
he's done enough
if the lord never does anything else for me
he's done enough
he's blessed me once
and he's blessed me twice
the lord keeps on blessing me everyday of my life

ohh if the lord
(if the lord--doesnt do anything else for me....he's--done enough--)

ohh the lord has been good to me...
and the lord,
the lord has made so many ways for me
oh--
the lord has opened so many doors oh--
brand new mercies i see over and over and over again--
he blessed me once
and he blessed me twice
ooo the lord keeps on blessing me everyday of my life

ohhh if the lord
(if the lord--doesnt do anything else for me...he's done enough--)
