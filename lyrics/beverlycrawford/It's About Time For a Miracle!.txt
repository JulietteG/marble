All the faith you need 
It's about the size of a mustard seed 
Right now (it's about time for a miracle) 

Come on & clap your hands 
We're going over to the promised land 
Right now (it's about time for a miracle) 

Can't you see (can't you see) 
It's about time for a miracle 
Come on get ready to shout 
God already worked it out 
Right now (it's about time for a miracle) 

He's doing what you asked Him to 
And He's doing it just for you 
Right now (it's about time for a miracle) 

All the faith you need 
It's about the size of a mustard seed 
And He'll move (He'll move mountains out of my way) 

No matter how big or small 
My God will take care of them all 
Can't you see (can't You see) 
It's about time for a miracle 

God is 
Working 
A miracle---Lyrics submitted by mya.
