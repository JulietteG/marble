I wanna go higher 
Higher in the Lord 
I'm pressing on the upward way 
New heights I'm gaining everyday 
Still praying as I'm upward bound 
Plant my feet on higher ground 
Higher, higher, higher 
Higher in the Lord 
My heart has no desire to say 
Where doubts arise and fears display 
Though some may dwell where these abound, 
My prayer, my aim is higher ground 
Lord lift me up 
And let me stand 
By faith on heavens 
Table land 
A higher plane that I have found 
Plant my feet on higher ground 
Take me higher 
Plant my feet on solid ground.---Lyrics submitted by jamika johnson.
