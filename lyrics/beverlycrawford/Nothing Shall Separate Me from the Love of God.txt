(Choir)
(Chorus)
Who shalt be made?
No to separate me from his love
Who shalt be made?
No to keep me from Gods holy will
Who shalt be made?
No to separate me from his love
Who shalt be made?
No to keep me from Gods holy will

(Lead)
I wont let heights, 
And I wont let debts.
Principalities, nor distress.
Keep me from serving my king
For he is my closet friend
Im going to hold to his hand
On Christ the solid, the solid rock I stand
I want you to know that nothing shall separate me from his love
 (Chorus)
Ive been in the storm, 
Ive been in the rain.
Ive had sickness and god knows I got through pain.
But Ive seen God work, Ive seen Him work over and over again
Im going to send my cup, 
So lord, you can fill it up
Im determine, Im determine that nothing shall separate me from his love

(Chorus)
He so faithful and just (Choir)
He keeps on blessing me over and over again (Lead)
He so faithful and true (Choir)
Inspite of rain he keeps on proving it over and over again (Lead)
He so faithful and just (Choir)
This is what Im gonna do, Im gonna hold him, onto every word he said (Lead)
He so faithful and true (Choir)
Im determine that Im gonna tell no matter what nobody says (Lead)

(Choir Singing in Background)
Nothing shall be able to separate me
Nothing shall be able to separate me

(Lead singing over choir)
I wont let heights, and I wont let debts
I wont let principalities, I wont even let stress
Let them talk about, let them scandalize my name
Cause Im determine, that Im going to hold up the bloodstained banner
Talk about, you can scorn, call me all the things
Not my friends, not my husband, not my children, nobody

I stand by myself
You dont have to understand me
I aint worried about no money
Cause he told me, if I lean on him
If I trust in him, that nothing, that nothing that nothing
I dont care what you are going through tonight
Dont let it, dont you let it, dont you let it, dont you let it, dont you let it
Youve invested too much.
No 
I love my job, and I love my husband, and I love my children, 
But Im determined
Dont you let nothing, I dont care how hard it might be
But its not worth it 
But I cry to long, and I suffered to long
Im determined 
That I wont let nothing
I wont---Lyrics submitted by mark.
