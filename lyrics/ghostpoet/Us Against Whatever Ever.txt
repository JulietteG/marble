Check check check check

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah check

Round and round we go
Whens it gonna stop
I ain't been paid and i aint got alot,
But Its us against whatever babe
us against whatever babe

Round and round we go
Whens it gonna stop
I ain't been paid and i aint got alot,
But Its us against whatever babe
us against whatever babe

You know whats hard,
knocks on the door 
and the volumes up,
im giving up and your out there
missing out on the flick of air
told me once told me twice
falling deep in sound the vibes---Lyrics submitted by Kelly Braisby.
