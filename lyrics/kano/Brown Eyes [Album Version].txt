[Verse 1]
I love to make love 
I love it when you wear them things that i like and they slide down your thighs everything seems alright 
I love it when you put your back on my front and my things come alive 
I got a thing for them eyes, them pretty brown eyes and them city guys look back when they see us walk by 
When i see you smile i lock that cos me and you are tight and its been a while since we reacted and acted
wild but 
I love the fact that you trust me too, no other girls done it so it must be you 
Boys will be boys and yeah I get ***** to but i try my best to think of you 
I love the fact that you tell me anything and everything that i need to know 
If your girlfriends, boyfriends, boys have got dough, when your best friends telling you fuck that Kano 
I'm telling you shes bad minded, jealous, ill tell her for you 
I wont get violent but i know her type 
I love when you go silent when you know i'm right 
See the position i'm in people talk don't listen they see you and wanna be in your position 
And every boys wish is that it could be them and you, so i de-pend on you to keep them wishing 
Listen to me i lo.. i like you...wait...nobody above just me beside you see... 

But I don't wanna fall in love... 

[Chorus (repeat x2)]
Na...i don't wanna fall in love, i don't wanna fall in love but your brown eyes have got me hypnotized
maybe we could give it a try but i don't wanna fall in love 

[Verse 2]
Its not official but your mine and you know it 
So when boys move to you day move over in no time 
I love that you understand sometimes i got no time and you don't make me choose between you and studio time 
I could called if you'd gone i left a phone call to somebody to call you to call me when eastenders is on 
I don't tend to be wrong but are you right for me 
Would you link me after the show and stay up all night for me 
You want me to be faithful and i want you to be, lets meet in the middle Truthfully, i think how
beautiful our youths can be 
It used to be about your face n your body now 
i love to be with you cos chillin' with you's like my hobby 
I can see me livin' with you, no time soon, but imagine me and you shopping with tha baby in tha trolley 
But maybe if we fall in love too young we'll get bored remember life begins at 40 and by 30 we'll be
acting naughty 
But if we don't it might come back to haunt me 
But if you hurt me then ill hav to hurt you, then if I hurt you will you deserve me... 
But it should be you and me sittin in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g... 

But I don't wanna fall in love... 

[Chorus (repeat x5)]
Na...i don't wanna fall in love but your brown eyes have got me hypnotized maybe we could give it a try but
I don't wanna fall in love, but I don't wanna fall in love---Lyrics submitted by conor.
