So this is what it feels to breathe just one more taste and it starts to leave
then it goes and sways just like the trees then its gone

if this is what were fighting for not a single word walk out that door ive seen that look in her eyes before then its gone again

as the tears roll down her face and theres and this boy is left to blame, id rather be a million miles away
all the pieces fall in place still i dare not walk away id rather be a million miles away

you took away the best of me and left me with no room to see but nothings never how we dream we were wrong

control the steady flow of tears the price for being alone for years its broke its done my inner feels and grows strong again  

as the tears roll down her face and theres and this boy is left to blame, id rather be a million miles away
all the pieces fall in place still i dare not walk away id rather be a million miles away

in another time and place far from this cold embrace i will find my space a million miles away

as the tears roll down her face and theres and this boy is left to blame, id rather be a million miles away
all the pieces fall in place still i dare not walk away id rather be a million miles away

as the tears roll down her face and theres and this boy is left to blame, id rather be a million miles away
all the pieces fall in place still i dare not walk away id rather be a million miles away---Lyrics submitted by Vince.
