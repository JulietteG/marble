Ride her darkened horse
Her tempers lie untold
It's always the same
It's always the same.

A customary trend,
The course is laid to play
I noticed it's there,
I noticed it's there.
I noticed...

Shoot into the darkness with your hand
Shoot into the darkness with you hand

Ride her darkened horse
Her tempers lie untold
It's all insane
It's all insane.

Monster for a friend,
A liar to defend.
I noticed it's there,
I noticed it's there,
I noticed...

Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far.
Hold her by the reins,
It's worth it to stay.

Nothings stable,
Nothing patient here.

Ride her darkened horse
The pathway to the end
She's all alone,
She's all alone.

Trust was never there,
It's yours she needs to hear,
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there,
I noticed...

Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay.

Hold her by the reins,
The moon isn't far.
Hold her by the reins,
It's worth it to stay.

Nothing stable,
Nothing patient here.---Lyrics submitted by Sunny Akane.
