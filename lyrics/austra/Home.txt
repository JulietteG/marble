You know that it eats me when you dont come home at night
My body cant rest unless youre sleeping by my side
You know that it eats me when you stay away one night
What is it that keeps you there?
Keeping you occupied from my heart
My heart
Somehow

You know that it eats me when you dont come home at night
Youll see that its better than beyond the  side
You know that it eats me when you cant see straight at night
 will keep you there, keeping you glorified in my heart
My heart
My heart
Hope, hope, hope
You know that it eats me when
You know that it eats me when
You dont, you dont, you dont

You know that it eats me when you dont come home at night
My body cant rest unless youre sitting by my side
You know that it eats me when you stay away one night
What is it that kees you there?
Keeping you occupied from my heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
