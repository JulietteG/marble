Another thing that I would compromise,
Another thing that I would compromise.
To say at first,
Don't wanna sympathize,
Don't wanna sympathize
With the darkness,
With the darkness.

Don't wanna sympathize,
Don't wanna sympathize
With the darkness,
With the darkness.

Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed, oh who signed?
Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed, oh who signed?

It isn't something I would put you through,
To be afraid and left for black and blue.
At first,
It's hard to recognize,
It's hard to recognize
My apartment, my apartment

I couldn't sympathize,
I wouldn't sympathize
With the darkness,
With the darkness.

Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed, oh who signed?
Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed, oh who signed?

Who would, who would
Who would be so harmful to you?---Lyrics submitted by Sunny Akane.
