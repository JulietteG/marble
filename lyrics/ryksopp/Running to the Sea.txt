I could hear them howling from afar
I saw them rushing to your car
In a moment I went screaming wild
Until the darkness killed the light

I remember running to the sea
The burning houses and trees
I remember running to the sea
Alone and blinded by the fear

And the river flows beneath your skin
Like savage horses kept within
And all is wasted in this head
Like breaking diamonds with your hand

I remember running to the sea
The burning houses and trees
I remember running to the sea
Alone and blinded by the fear

And the river flows beneath your skin
Like savage horses kept within
And all is wasted in this head
Like breaking diamonds with your hand

And the river flows inside of me
And the river flows inside of me
And the river flows inside of me
And the river flows inside of me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
