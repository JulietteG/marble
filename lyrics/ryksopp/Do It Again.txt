(feat. Robyn)

One more time
Let's do it again
Blow my mind
Do it again

And then it arrives
The moment before the anticipation
You know it's like
Mmm mmm mmm

Wait for it
Wait for the buildup
And then let's do it again

Don't care what they say
It hurts so good

I don't wanna stop
I know I should
But let's do it again

One more time
Let's do it again
The thing you did
Do it again

And when it arrives
The moment before the anticipation
You know it's like
Mmm mmm mmm

Wait for it
Wait for the buildup
And then let's do it again

We do what we want
And as soon as it's done
We just do it again

Let's do it all
And when we come down
We just do it again

Don't care what they say
It hurts so good

I don't wanna stop
I know I should

We should not be friends
we'll just do it again
If you stay around
We'll just do it again
Let's do it again

Don't care what they say
It hurts so good
It hurts so good
Mmm

I don't wanna stop
I know I should
But let's do it again---
