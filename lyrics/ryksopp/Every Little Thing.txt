(feat. Robyn)

Been alone in here forever
Waiting in the dark
If you only knew me better
Open up your heart

Hey, every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, baby
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, it's for you!

Been waiting here forever
For you to come inside
Even though I never told you
God knows how I tried

Hey, every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, baby
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now, it's for you!

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here ---
