Oh, I can do, anything that I can do when I'm with you.
This love, this love, this love, It's you I need and you I'm dreaming of.

I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this

Anywhere I go I choose,
Anywhere I go I choose to be with you.
Anywhere I choose I go,
Anywhere I choose I go but not alone.

So, I can do, anything that I can do when I'm with you.
This love, this love, this love, It's you I need and you I'm dreaming of.

I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this

Anywhere I go I choose,
Anywhere I go I choose to be with you.
Anywhere I choose I go,
Anywhere I choose I go but not alone.

I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this this
I never felt nothing like this
I never felt nothing like this this

So, I can do, anything that I can do when I'm with you.
This love, this love, this love, It's you I need and you I'm dreaming of.

This love, this love, this love, It's you I need and you I;m dreaming of.---Lyrics submitted by erynn.
