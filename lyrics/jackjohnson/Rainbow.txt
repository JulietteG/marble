Well I woke up this mornin', a rainbow filled the sky
Yes I woke up this mornin', a rainbow filled the sky

Well that was God tellin' me, everything's gonna be all right

Well so long good friends, when will we meet again
I said so long good friends, when will we meet again

Well I don't know, I don't know
But I guess I'm-a see you then

Well I'm-a pack my old guitar, move on down the road
I'm-a pack my old guitar now, move on down the road

Oh, where I go I don't know
But I guess I just gots to go

Well I woke up this mornin', a rainbow filled the sky
Well I woke up this mornin', a rainbow filled the sky

That was God tellin' me, everything
Everything's gonna be all right---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
