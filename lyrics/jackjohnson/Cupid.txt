Well how many times must we go through this
You've always been mine
Woman I thought you knew this

How many times must we go through this
You'll always be mine
Cupid only misses sometimes

But we could end up brokenhearted
If we don't remember why all this started
And if they try to tell you love fades with time
Tell them there's no such thing as time

It's our time (4x)---
