Its such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out
Upside out of my mouth

By now we should know
How to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on a roll and there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control, isn't it strange
How we're all burning under the same sun

By now we say its a war for peace
Its the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could close our eyes its still there
We could say its us against them
We can try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all

We try to put it out, but its a growing flame
Using fear as fuel, burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words are burning same
And who we gonna blame now?

And oh
Its such a crying, crying, crying, shame
Its such a crying, crying, crying, shame
Its such a crying, crying, crying, shame, shame, shame

By now, its beginning the show
A number of people are numbers who ain't coming home
I can close my eyes its still there
Close my mind be alone
Close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all

Its a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?
Its such a tired game, will it ever stop?

Is not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out
Upside out of my mouth
And who we gonna blame?

On and on
Its such a crying, crying, crying, shame
Its such a crying, crying, crying, shame
Its such a crying, crying, crying, shame, shame, shame---
