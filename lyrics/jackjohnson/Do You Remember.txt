Do you remember when we first met
I sure do, it was some time in early September
Well you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind
So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on
Guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away, you might not roll back my direction really soon
Well I was crazy about you then and now but the craziest thing of all 
Over 10 years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time, let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are
We built our getaway up in a tree we found we felt so far away though we were still in town. 
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down, I took a picture that I don't like to look at. 
But all these times they come and go
Well it all don't seem so long, over 10 years have gone by, We can't rewind
We're locked in time, but you're still mine.
