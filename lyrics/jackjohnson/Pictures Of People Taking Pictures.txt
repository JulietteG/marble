I pictured us at the end up time
Just holding up a camera to your eyes
I took a picture of you took a picture of me
In the background of the picture was water running to the sea

So I pictured us standing there just
staying away from time
just watching her like a river as it
slowly washes by, washes by

Pictures of people taking pictures of people taking pictures of people taking pictures

the feedback loop is closing in so tight
surrounding ourselves with satellties

But I pictured us standing there just
staying away from time
just watching her like a river as it
slowly washes by, washes by

Pictures of people taking pictures of people taking pictures of people taking pictures (4x)

I picture us at the end of time
taking pictures of nothing---Lyrics submitted by Molly.
