Ive got an angel
She doesnt wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
She wears a smile that can make you wanna sing

She gives me presents, with her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for 
She gives me kisses on the lips just for comin home

She can make angels
Ive seen it with my own eyes
Youve gotta be careful when youve got good love
Cuz an angels will just keep on multiplyin

But youre so busy changing the world
Just one smile and you can change all of mine

We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh

We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh

We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Mm mm mm mmm---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
