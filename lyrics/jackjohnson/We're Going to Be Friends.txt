Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, Ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walkin' blues
Climb the fence, books and pens.

I can tell that we are gonna be friends.
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends.

Walk with me, Susi Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We can rest upon the ground and look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound.
We safely walk to school without a sound.

Well here we are, no one else.
We walk to school all by ourselves
Theres new dirt on our uniforms 
from chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
playtime, we will throw the ball
and back to class, through the hall
teacher marks our height against the wall
the teacher marks out height against the wall

We don't notice any time pass
'Cause we don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
The teacher thinks that I sound funny
but she likes it when you say
Tonight I'll dream in my bed
while silly thoughts run through my head
Of the bugs and alphabet
and when i wake tomorrow I'll bet
you and i will walk together again
'Cause I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Yes i can tell that we are gonna be friends---Lyrics submitted by E.
