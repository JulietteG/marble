They say, Taylor was a good girl 
Never want to be 
late 
Complain, express 
ideas in her brain
Working on the night 
shift
Passing out the tickets
Youre gonna have to 
pay her, if you wanna 
park here
Well, mommys little 
dancer has quite a 
little secret
Working on the
streets now, never
gonna keep it
Its quite an imposition and
now shes only wishing 
that she would have 
listened to the words they said
Poor Taylor

She just wanders around, unaffected
by
The winter wind yeah, and shell 
pretend that
Shes somewhere else, so far and 
clear
About two thousand miles from here 

Well Peter Patrick pitter patterns on the window
the sunny silhouette wont 
let him in 
Poor old Petes got nothing, 
cause hes been falling
Somehow, Sunny knows just 
where hes been
He thinks that singing on
Sunday is gonna save his soul
Now that Saturdays gone
Sometimes he think that hes 
on his way
But I can see that his brake 
light are on

He just wanders around,
unaffected by the
Winter winds and hell 
pretend that
Hes somewhere else so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here

Such a tough enchilada 
filled up with nada
Given what you gotta give to 
get a dollar bill
Used to be a lovely chicken 
times have been a tickin 
Now shes finger lickin 
to the man, with the 
Money in his pocket
flying in his rocket only 
stopping by on his way 
to a better world

If Taylor 
finds a better world
Then Taylors
Gonna run away---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa.
