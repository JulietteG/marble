Can't you see it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to 
Like waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes

Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe, hala ka ukulele
Mama made a baby
I really don't mind the practice
Because you're my little lady
Lady, lady love me
Because I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains

Pretend like there's no world outside
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that' it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Can't you see, can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind

Telephone singing, ringing, it's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough
It's just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow, wake up slow

But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to 
Like waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes

Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see
We've got to wake up slow---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
