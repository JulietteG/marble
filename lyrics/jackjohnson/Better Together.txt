There is no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
And no song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
And our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart
Why are we here? And where do we go? And how come its so hard?
Its not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
Ill tell you one thing, its always better when were together

Its always better when were together
Well look at the stars when were together
Its always better when were together
Its always better when were together

And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that theyll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things for tomorrow night you see
That theyll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
Id be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be well sit beneath the mango tree now

Its always better when were together
Were somewhere in between together
Its always better when were together
Its always better when were together

I believe in memories they look so pretty when I sleep
And when I wake up you look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
Were better together---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
