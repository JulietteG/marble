Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX

Come on!
Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX

Show up in the same dress
We don't know who wore it best
Not make a big deal
Act like it's a new trend
Look good when we go 'round here
Try on these boots
I found this boy who said you're sweet
He's got a best friend
(You'll always be mine)

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX (XOX)

I'm a better me when
You're here next to me
LJK can't you tell we're ROTF-eh-L
Who needs words when we got hearts, smile
T-t-t-time goes by so fast
But we are meant to last
(You'll always be mine)

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX (XOX)

TTYLXOX, come on
(You'll always be my)

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX (XOX)

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX (XOX)

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX (XOX)

Be be be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
