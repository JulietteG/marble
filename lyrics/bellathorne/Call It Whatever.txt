Everybodys asking what I'm thinking of you
Wanna show and tell about the things that we do
I know what I'm feeling and youre feeling it too, youre feeling it too
Youre feeling it too

Call me up and wonder why I'm making a fuss
Wanna hear the little little secrets of us
I wont tell them anything they dont have a clue, about me and you
About me and you

Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I' ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We got a thing we cant explain
Dont care what people say, lets call it
Whatever whatever
You, me, got everything
No i dont need a diamond ring
Dont care what people say, lets call it,
Whatever whatever
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want
Lets call it
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want

Dont you know I'm not another typical girl
Skip the fancy dinners we go straight for dessert
I dont need the flowers, you can give me the world, give me the world
Give me the world

We are never gonna try to play by the rules and
Every little thing that we should say or do
Uh oh, uh oh
Is wrapped around my little finger

Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I' ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We got a thing we cant explain
Dont care what people say, lets call it
Whatever whatever
You, me, got everything
No i dont need a diamond ring
Dont care what people say, lets call it,
Whatever whatever
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want
Lets call it
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want

Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close I'm ready for the ride

Our love needs no name
We got a thing we cant explain
Dont care what people say, lets call it
Whatever whatever
You, me, got everything
No I dont need a diamond ring
Dont care what people say, lets call it,
Whatever whatever
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want
Lets call it
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want
Lets call it
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want
Lets call it
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever we want ---
