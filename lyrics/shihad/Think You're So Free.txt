I walked for miles
So I could be
I climbed a mountain
Just so I could see
I searched for courage
I searched for proof
Looked for a leader
Whod stand and speak the truth

But there was none
And we still think were so free

I lit a fire to watch it burn
Went on vacation never to return
Its not the way I wanted it to be
I was afraid for my own privacy

There was none
And we still think were so free

When do you think well wake up
When do you think well wake up
When do you think well wake up
When do you think well wake up

I want a car
A steady job
An endless line of people I can rob
Aint that the way that its supposed to be
Theres less for them
That means so much more for me (too)

There was none
And we still think were so free

When do you think well wake up
When do you think well wake up
When do you think well wake up
When do you think well wake up
