Vasquez Jhoy Ohhh yeah
Oh, oh

[Verse 1:]
I was... See More
I was always quick to trip in turn and say I'm sorry
Guess I
Guess I always thought that nigga made everything ok
I did
Did my share of dirt I know you probably heard about me
When you
When you asked how I would just lie to your face
And I

[Hook:]
I didn't appreciate
Even when you walked away
I didn't realize

[Chorus:]
That you were the one thing
I should've kept 'part of me
And baby I just can't deal without you
Your all I need
I know I didn't say much
But girl your the only one
I'm trippin' without you
I think about it everytime I
I, I, I, I, I, I
Everytime I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I

[Verse 2:]
Told you
Told you you were insecure when you'd be asking questions
I had
Had you second guessing yourself and what you mean to me
If I
If I could take it back I would (I would)
If I could take it all back I would (I would)
Instead of playing games
It's time I play for keeps
And I

[Hook:]
I didn't appreciate
Even when you walked away
I didn't realize

[Chorus:]
That you were the one thing
I should've kept 'part of me
And baby I just can't deal without you
Your all I need
I know I didn't say much
But girl your the only one
I'm trippin' without you
I think about it everytime I
You are the one thing
I should've kept 'part of me
And baby I just can't deal without you
Your all I need
I know I didn't say much
But girl your the only one
I'm trippin' without you
I think about it everytime I

[Bridge:]
Think about how you use to do
When I'm nights alone when I'm rockin' with you
I can't help but kick myself in the ass
Cuz I'm sittin' here about to blow it ('bout to blow it)
I know I can't take no more
Time to change it up for sure
Cuz I'm not tryna let you go

[Chorus:]
You are the one thing
I should've kept 'part of me
And baby I just can't deal without you
Your all I need
I know I didn't say much
But girl your the only one
I'm trippin' without you
I think about it everytime I
You are the one thing
I should've kept 'part of me
And baby I just can't deal without you
Your all I need
I know I didn't say much
But girl your the only one
I'm trippin' without you
I think about it everytime I
I, I, I, I, I, I
Everytime I
I, I, I, I, I, I
Everytime I
I, I, I, I, I, I
Everytime I
I, I, I, I, I, I
Everytime I
Oh, ooh everytime I
Everytime I---Lyrics submitted by yabzqkuh_2en1.
