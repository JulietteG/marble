[Verse 1:]
Listen here now CoaCoa eyes 
Daddy's coming home soon (oh yeah) 
I know you sit there and you cry 
But Daddy's got work to do (oh) 
I know you don't care much for him 
Cuz your crazy for us 
I know you don't care much for him 
Cuz your reaching for us 

[Chorus:]
I still adore you 
Never ignore you 
You are my angel 
Sent from above 
Girl, I adore you 
Never ignored you 
Your my angel 
Sent from above 
From above, from above 
From above, from above

Him no have no job 
Look at him car 
Now me say Ala Ala 
Now we see dem wan' say hi 
And me say , me say Goodbye 
Now we no need no guided light 

[Verse 2:]
Babygirl don't shed a tear 
When I'm not near you 
No, no, no, no, no 
Babygirl just listen here 
I would do anything to keep you close to me 
But Daddy's got a lot of work to do now 
You know I'll never leave your side 
I'll stand strong by you 
You know I'll always make it right 
'Til the next time I see you again 

[Chorus:]
I still adore you 
Never ignore you 
You are my angel 
Sent from above 
Girl, I adore you 
Never ignored you 
Your my angel 
Sent from up 

[Hook:]
People use to talk 
Him no have no job 
Look at him car 
Now me say Ala Ala 
Now we see dem wan' say hi 
And me say, me say Goodbye 
Now we no need no guided light

That you are the one 
This is for the one 
Oh, yeah

Never ignored you 
You are my angel 
Sent from above
