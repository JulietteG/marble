Listen ah I met this guy and umm 
you know I just dont get down like that 
But we were together for awhile
you know things didnt work out but
 I cant even be mad with him you know 'cause we had some moments 
for true
 I'll explain listen we wrote fairy tales of how we'd live in castle's
 tight like Hansel and Gretel 
and grow old and settle in a town 
we'll like with our marry day we're
 gonna love like that
 like everyday like everyway 
like cant I stay at yours tonight
 we can hold tight 
love bite and share some soul
 we can pick and roll 
lose control and let me take it 
like how I let you break it 
dont forget we can get high on each other
 and serve time for it through
 the night and back into the morning 
cant cracks the habit you see 
I'm feenin in need of some 
more and you got me grinning 
like its money that I'm winning 
no way is this sinning 'cause 
you got me feeling purer then t
hou show me how you do this thing
 'cause you got me singing like like 
no for real he had me sing like like 
 some kind of opera shit
 I dont know where we when with it 
was like I use to turn to him and just whisper in his ear
 cause yo Id make these little promises 
like Id say I'll crown the king of this throne 
if you can take me home like run 
with no strikes doesnt have to be
 tonight hows about early morning 
I'm talking a.m. we can be the dawn 
or just chill through time barriers 
cant help the whispers of I do
 but you see through my proper test got me
 making game faces in London we say lacing 
you say making senses this shit is intense 
I kinda warn in defense 
cause you move me so
 I broke my roll and got freaky with it you
 chastise me with me own belt I aint gonna lie
 I felt the universe move you left me 
sing like opera like Cleopatra like Madame butterfly 
yo this shit so good you 
brought tears to my eyes I was like Im tellin you man
 this is no lie I could even let him walk pass me
 I was like grabbin on him 
and we were happy for a minute for true
 after a session we be like 
was that suppose to happen 
all the foot tapping
 voice breaking all while carving karma sutra diagrams
 with the headboard ignored 
the buzzer four time got off work telling lies 
even deprived myself in my kniving ways
 I dived in like he meant survival like
 he was christenings h2o like he
 could make the trees grow and the clouds spit smoke
 he laid kisses on my chest
 like his name was Zorro got me saying 
hell no when he said he had to go
 I was hiding clothes and play fighin like children
 we were clashing our titans 'til weight we were losing
 I had some village album on repeat 
we were knockin boot to hip hop beats 
I even reached my maximum in my sleep
 he had me singin like Im not lying the 
truth is I almost got goose pimples now just thinking about that shit
 just his voice if I could just hear his voice now
 Id answer the phone like naw listen if 
I knew where he was now you know 
we split we split ways we went about business
 I want to know if he's making someone 
else hit that opera cause I aint had none of that in a minute---Lyrics submitted by Tianna.
