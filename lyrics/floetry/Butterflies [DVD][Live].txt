All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
Dont acknowledge my smile when i try to say hello to you
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when im tryin' to get through
To keep me wonderin why and all i can do is sigh, I just wanna oh...

CHORUS:
I just wanna touch and kiss
And i wish that i could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I...

All i gotta say is i must be dreamin' cant be real
Your not here with me
Still i can feel you near to me
So i caress you let you taste us
so blissful listen baby i would give anything
to make my dream come true
Oh baby, you give me

(chorus x2)

BRIDGE:
If you will take my hand
Baby i will show you guide you to the light babe
If you will be my love baby i will love you, love you
TiIl the end of time...

(Chorus x3)---Lyrics submitted by Clarissa.
