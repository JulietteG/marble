So many possibilities
So many ways to go 
So many things to choose from 
All the things that I could know
I can learn and I can grow
I can do and I can know 
I can see and I can be what I will
I can write my story of life and glory
The pages are mine to fill

What will I be 
Where will I go 
What will my path be 
When will I know 
My life is spread before me
I see
Possibilities

So many possiblities 
So many ways to go
So many things to choose from
All the things that I could know

I will work and I will do
I will always make it through
I will learn my way to take and to give
I will take my journey
And while I learning
I'll never forget to live

What will I be 
Where will I go 
What will my path be
When wil I know 
My life is spread before me
I see
I see, Oh!

What will I be 
Where will I go 
What will my path be 
When will I know 
My life is spread before me
I see

Possibilities
Possibilities
Possibilities
Possibilities
I see!

Possibilities!
