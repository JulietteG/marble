You know we tried to make you understand
We tried to make you realise
Her fame is down and time is up
But somehow it don't seem enough
'Cos the world wouldn't listen anymore

Caught by social evil
Wasn't streetwise after all
Was she there at all?

Pictures in the mirror, pictures she never knew
Pictures in the mirror, always reflecting you
Not such an ordinary life

Pictures in the mirror [x2]

The sun goes down
The moon appears on the horizon
The streets are bare
She walks alone---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
