God help those who don't help the others.
God help those who don't help the others.

Some of us have more rights than the others.
Some of us have to fight more than the others too.

We all have our time to live,
But we don't have time for each other.
We all have our time to live,
But we don't have time for each other.

God help those who don't help the others.
Oh, God help those who don't help the others.

Well there ain't no reward,
For being a no one, for being ignored.
Some of us don't deserve a second chance.
Some of us don't deserve to make demands.

We all have our time to live,
But we don't have time for each other.
We decide how much we give,
And what goes around, goes around again.

God help those who don't help the others.
Oh, God help those who don't help the others.
Yeah, God help those who don't help the others.
Oh, God help those who don't help the others.

God help those who don't help the others.
Oh, God help those who don't help the others.
Yeah, God help those who don't help the others.
Oh, God help those who don't help the others.

Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
