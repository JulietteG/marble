Intro x2
All that i'm hearing from you
is white noise (white noise)
white noise (white noise)

Verse
If looks could kill
I'd be in trouble right now
Time stands still
When your around

I gave you all my time
And you gave me all your lies
And you've just come around to say goodbye. .

Now here we stand
With our hearts in our hands
Squeezing out all the life
All that I hear
Is a message unclear
What else is there to decide?

Chorus x2

All that i'm hearing from you
is white noise (white noise)
white noise (white noise)

Verse
You promised me your soul
But then left me in the cold
No one would end without
Without a reason

You place yourself in a world of mistrust
Making excuses it's not you its us
But how can something unspoken seem so loud?

Chorusx2
And now
All that i'm hearing from you
is white noise (white noise)
white noise (white noise)

The operator comes on the line
He said hurry up man cos' you aint got much time
White noise, white noise---
