Keep it up, keep it up
Youre going to kill the kid
Soon enough, soon enough
Hes gonna to flip the lid
Will you be happy then?
Wearing a satisfied grin

Take it up, take it up
Take it all out on him
Take away his heart
Drain all the life within
Will you be happy then?
Wearing a satisfied grin

You wear your heart on your sleeve
Living your life in a dream
Believe what you want to believe
And I thought this was supposed to be fun

Keep it up, keep it up
Youre going to kill the kid
Soon enough, soon enough
Hes gonna to flip the lid
Will you be happy then?
Wearing a satisfied grin

You wear your heart on your sleeve
You live your life in a dream
Believe what you want to believe
After all that weve been through now
Still so much to do now
With you now

That kids not right
Theres something wrong with him
Wound up too tight
Keeping it all within
Dont let them see your fear
Stand up and wipe away the tears
Keep it up, keep it up
Youre going to kill the kid
Soon enough, soon enough
Hes gonna to flip the lid
Will you be happy then?
Wearing a satisfied grin---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
