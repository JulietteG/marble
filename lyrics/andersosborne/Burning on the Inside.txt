Bid you greetings, welcome, don't be shy
Plenty of room, but we're a little short of supply
The river's dry, there's sand for everyone
Don't mind the vultures, they only come for the sun

One Man one woman
Had a hard luck spell
One man one woman smile
But they're burnin', burnin' on the inside
Burnin', burnin' on the inside out
Burnin', burnin' on the inside
Burnin', burnin' on the inside out

Work the land, gotta tend to every seed
I don't ask for much I'm a man with simple needs
Came and went the noose that slit my throat
You wrecked my plants before they bore their fruit

One Man one woman
Had a hard luck spell
One man one woman smile
But they're burnin', burnin' on the inside
Burnin', burnin' on the inside out
Burnin', burnin' on the inside
Burnin', burnin' on the inside out---Lyrics submitted by Jason Anderson.
