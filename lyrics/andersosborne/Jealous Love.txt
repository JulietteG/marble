Your pretty little face looks so alone
Sister, sister your boyfriend's gone
If he ain't here he don't care
Love is sweet but love ain't fair

Don't waste your time with a fool like that
Can't you see he ain't got your back?
I beg you honey I beg you please
Can't you see you ain't his main squeeze?

Jealous love
Jealous love
Jealous love
Honey you've got jealous love

You live on a ranch down in the valley
So how come you meet him in the darkest alleys?
Deep inside the damage done
He'll never be your number one

Jealous love
Jealous love
Jealous love
Honey you've got jealous love

Jealous love
Jealous love
Jealous love
Honey you've got jealous love

Mmm
Jealous love

Mmm
Jealous love---Lyrics submitted by James W. James.
