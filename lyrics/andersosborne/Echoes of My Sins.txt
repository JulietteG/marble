I've been looking for the golden truth
I've been filled with good intent
I held up the torch of love
And I have tried to do the right thing

But as my hands slowly lost their grip
All I could hear from deep within
Was the thunder of all my guilt
And the echoes of my sins

Yeah, I have bragged about what I have done
Of what I've seen and where I've been
You know I had friends stand up for me
When I did nothing for them (I did nothing)

But as I slowly lost my way 
The church bells were still ringing....
Like distant thunder of all of my guilt
And the echoes of my sins

You know, I have walked in the shadow of my self
I've been afraid of everything
And you have watched me play without the joy
That makes me who I am

But as I slowly gave away my life
I could hear the angels sing
So much louder than the thunder of my guilt
And the echoes of my sins
So much louder than the thunder of my guilt
And the echoes of my sins---Lyrics submitted by Jason Anderson.
