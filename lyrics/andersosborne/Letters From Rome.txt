We are all in this together
Said the Captain to his crew
It's pretty much a secret mission
You are all the chosen few
Let's sail in the morning
And no one else can know
We've got letters from Rome

The sun got up over Belize point
As they slowly left the coast
Heading straight for open waters
Somewhere they could be their most
Set course for tomorrow
And make this ship your home
We've got letters from Rome

To all the hustle and the commotion
Deck got filled with rum and pee
The salty wind ran their emotions
And four good men plunged to the sea
And no they won't seek tomorrow
Nor their names in stone
But they saw the letters from Rome

They reached the docks of midland glory
A people came from far beyond
Bring gifts and admirations
To the ship the king was on
And they all danced till the sun rose
And left the crew alone
With nothing but letters from Rome

Guess Desmond Jack jumped ship then he married
With a lady of the north
She brought him luck so goes the story
And he left the ocean for her warmth
They rode into the sunset
The beautiful unknown
No more letters from Rome

Yet this old boat has lost its direction
The Captain cried with all his might
Incoming storm make preparations
For this is a battle for our lives
And they were plagued by some sickness
The Captain overthrown
Fighting the letters from Rome

For ninety years they sailed the surface
And never once explored the depth
A sacrifice without a purpose
It takes just a heartbeat to forget
All gone in the morning
Never to be found
Just like the letters from Rome
Just like the letters

The Captain all away from home
The Captain all away back home
The Big Chief stand on the shoreline
To show the way back home
Don't heave or worry
Cuz you got to find a way back home---Lyrics submitted by Alexander A.
