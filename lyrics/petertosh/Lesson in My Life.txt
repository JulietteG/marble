I've learned some lessons in my life
       lessons in my life
Always be careful of mankind
     Be  careful of mankind
They'll make you promises today but tomorrow they change their mind
Make you faithful crosses today but tomorrow they'll change their mind

Cause I'm a lawful man and I love lawful people (lawful people)
I'm a progressive man and I love progressive people (progressive people)
I'm a truthful man and I love truthful people (truthful people)
I'm an honest man and I love honest people (honest people)

I've learned some lessons in my life
        lessons in my life
Always becareful of my friends be careful of my friends
Money can make friendship end- it makes friendship end
Money can make friendship end it makes friendship end

Cause I'm a lawful man and I love lawful people (lawful people)
I'm a progressive man and I love progressive people (progressive people)
I'm an honest man and I love honest people (honest people)
I'm an intelligent man and I love intelligent people (intelligent people)
I'm an progressive man and I love progressive people (progressive people)
I'm a fire man and I love fire people (fire people)
I'm a lawful man and I love lawful people (lawful people)
I'm an intelligent man and I love intelligent people (intelligent people)
I'm a progressive man and I love progressive people (progressive people)---Lyrics submitted by jason.
