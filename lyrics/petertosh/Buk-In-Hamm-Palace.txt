This here music
Reggae music
As far as I can see

This here music
Reggae music
It's got a spell on me

This here music
Rasta music
As far as I can see

This here music
Roots music
It's got a hold on me

It can make you feel so happy
Whenever problems get you down
It has itaficial respiration
Keep your heart functioning sound

Light your spliff
Light your chalice
Make we smoke it in buk-in-hamm palace

Lend me a paper
Lend me a fire
Mek we chase way all the vampire

Light up your spliff
Light up your chalice
Make we burn it in a buk-in-hamm palace

Lend me a paper
Lend me some fire
We ha' fe chase way vampire

Music and herb is the healing of the nation
Sent from Jah oo-ee grace

So take heed, heed and listen
Be a fan for better days

Light your spliff
Light your chalice
We gonna smoke it in a buk-in-hamm palace

Lend me a paper
Lend me some fire
Mek we chase way vampire

Light up your spliff
Light your chalice
We gonna burn it in a buk-in-hamm palace

Lend me a paper
Lend me some fire
Mek we chase way vampire

If you want to know my father
Said you've got to know his son

And if you try to compare us
You can see that we are one

Light up your spliff
Light up your chalice
Rasta don't keep malice
Light up your spliff
Light up your chalice
In a buk-in-hamm palace

This is a true imagination
Come to set the people free
Don't you let disco get you down
Give a listenin' to reggae sound

Light your spliff
Light your chalice
We a go smoke it in a buk-in-hamm palace

Lend me a paper
Lend me a fire
Mek we chase way vampire

Put down your face yes
Of called depressed yes
We gonna smoke it in the House of Congress
Lend me a (g)rizzeler
Lend me a fire
We a go chase way vampire

Can you feel, can feel it, can you FEEL it?---Lyrics submitted by Ronja Lwenherz.
