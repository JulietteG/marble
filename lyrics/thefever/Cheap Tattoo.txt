Dog or god?
You were so hot
But now you're not

But still I wear you
Still I wear you
Still I wear you like a cheap tattoo

Like the hit that never hit
Like the star that never shone
Like the dress that never fit

Like the itch that you can't scratch
Like the frown between your eyes
Like a pocket full of lies

I wear you
I wear you
I wear you like a cheap tattoo

I wear you
I wear you
I wear you like a cheap tattoo

Out of sight
Out of mind
You let me down too many times

But still I wear you
Still I wear you
Still I wear you like a cheap tattoo

Like the glitch that you can't fix
Like the pitch that makes you sick
Like the bitch that won't shut up

Like the system you can't beat
Like the shit that you don't need
Like the life that makes you bleed

I wear you
I wear you
I wear you like a cheap tattoo

Like a kite without a string
Like a pimp without his bling
Like all the stupid pretty things

Like a rumor to be spread
Like the voices in your head
Like wishing you were dead

I wear you
I wear you
You're skin deep like a cheap tattoo---Lyrics submitted by Lovely.
