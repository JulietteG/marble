You lost faith in the human spirit
You walk around like a ghost
Your star-spangled heart
Took a train for the coast
When you shine your hilltop mansion
So how'd you lose the light
Was it blown by the wind
In the still of the night

Chorus:
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're going to get back on your feet
(And you can't stop now)

I always saw you as a kind of keeper
Mother to a child
But your boys have grown soft
And your girls have gone wild
From the blue ridge to the black hills
To the redwood sky
The season may pass
But the dream doesn't die

Chorus:
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're going to get back on your feet
(And you can't stop now)

When they break your heart
When the night falls on the land
Remember What I said
Boy you was battle born
(And you can't stop now)
You was battle born

When the night falls on the land
Are you haunted by the sound?
It's going to take more than a hand
To turn this thing around
Rescue set me free

Chorus:
Up against the wall
Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're going to get back on your feet
(And you can't stop now)
Did they break your heart
Did they?
Remember What I said
Boy you was battle born
(And you can't stop now)

Come on show your face
Come on give us one
Sing a song on fire
Lest we fall into the dark ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
