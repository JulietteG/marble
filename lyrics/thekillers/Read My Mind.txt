On the corner of Main Street
Just trying to keep it in line
You say you wanna move on, and
You say I'm falling behind

Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

I never really gave up on
Breaking out of this two-star town
I got the green light
I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around

Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

The good old days
The honest man
The restless heart 
The Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze

Oh well I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go
Can you read my mind?

It's funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine

Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

The teenage queen 
The loaded gun
The drop-dead dream
The Chosen One
A southern drawl
The world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline

Oh well I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump
Tell me what you find
When you read my mind

Slipping in my faith until I fall
You never returned that call
Woman, open the door
Don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again

She said I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Put your back on me
Put your back on me
Put your back on me

The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds 
Cut out of the sun
Can you read my mind?---Lyrics submitted by Vivi.
