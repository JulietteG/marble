The emotion it was, electric
And the stars, they all aligned
I knew I had to make my, decision
But I never made the time
No, I never made the time

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

Exoneration lost his, eraser
But my forgiver found the sun
And there are twisted days
that I take comfort
Cause I'm not the only one
No, I'm not the only one

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, very far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

There is a majesty at my doorstep
There is a little boy in her arms
Now we'll parade
around without game plans
Obligations, or alarm

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, very far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home
In the dark---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
