Dustland fairytale beginin
Just another white trash
County kiss
Sixty one
Long Brown hair and foolish eyes
Look just like you gone into some
Kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
Moon river what'd You do to be
But i don't believe you

Some Cinderella in a party dress but
She was looking for a night gown
I saw the devil warping up his hands
Hes getting ready for the show down
I saw the minute that i turn away
I got my money on a pond tonight

Change came in disguised of revelation
Set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinking
Ships we persevere god gives us hope
But we still fear
We don't know
The mind is poison castle in the sky
Sit stranded vandalized
The draw bridge is closing

Some Cinderella in a party dress but
She was looking for a night gown
I saw the devil warping up his hands
hes getting ready for the show down
I saw the ending were they turned the page
I threw my money and i ran away
Strait to the Vally of the great divide

And were the dreams roll high
And were the wind dont blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky wont snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
Its such a bitter form of refuge
Ahh don't you know the kingdoms under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the of the cadence in the young mans eyes
And were the dreams roll high---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
