[Verse 1]
Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust
Drive by your house
Nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

[Chorus]
All my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl (another girl)

[Verse 2]
I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with someone else
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

[Chorus]
All my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world
She's just another girl (another girl)

[Bridge]
I could be reeling them in left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl

Now why can't I sleep at night
And why don't the moon look right
It sailed off but the TV's on
And it's a great big world

[Outro]
She's just another girl,
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
She's just another girl
All my friends say she's just another girl
Another girl ---
