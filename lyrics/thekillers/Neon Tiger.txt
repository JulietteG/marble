Far from the evergreen of old Assam
Far from the breakfall on the trails of old Siagon
Straight from the poster town of scorn and ritz
To bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz

But neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They promised just to pet you, but don't you let them get you
Away, away, away
Under the neon southwest sun

Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring
Came from the woodwork and the hopes they might
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big

But neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They'll set you down to pet you, but don't you let them touch you
You're far too pure and bold
To something the same of the hand as holed.

I don't wanna be kept, I don't wanna be caged, I don't wanna be damned oh hell
I don't wanna be broke, I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be s o l
Give me rolling hills so tonight can be the night that I send them up a thousand thrills
Can you cut me some slack, Cause I don't wanna go back, I want the new day and age

Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!

Run neon tiger there's a price on your head
They'll put you down and cut you, I'll never let them touch you
Away, away, away
Under the neon tiger roar Oh I'm gonna need a neon tiger roar

Under the neon
Under the neon
Under the neon southwest sun

Neon Tiger
There's a lot on your mind---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
