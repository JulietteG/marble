Theres an empty bottle of wine sitting by the bed
Images of you and him in my head
I threw the bottle across the room
Broke your picture on the wall
Trying to convince myself I aint missin you at all

The things that you think will keep you sane
Are the things thatll surely tear you down
An empty shot glass, a pocket full of pills
Until the love of a strange girl just dont seem real
an When the man in the mirror becomes a blur
All youre left with are hangovers and memories of her

You got holes in your story
That your smile cant erase
And I can tell that youre lying
By that love upon your face
And myself be easy, and my pride is one to cause
And youll wake up alone tomorrow
know your hearts the one that lost

The things that youll think will keep you sane
Are the things thatll surely tear you down
An empty shot glass, a pocket full of pills
Until the love of a strange girl just dont seem real
When the man in the mirror becomes a blur
All youre left with are hangovers and memories of her

Now all Im left with are hangovers and memories of her ---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
