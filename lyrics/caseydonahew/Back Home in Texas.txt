I went up to New York City, It's a yankee pity
Those crazy bastards don't have a clue.
I went down to Tennesee, rocky top I had to see
But I left there cause the corn wont grow
I went down to New Orleans, let me tell you bout that scene
I got drunk on Bourban Street

[Chorus]
But I've been up all night, sippin on whiskey drinkin beer
Back home in Texas, I wouldn't live anywhere but here
Thinkin bout all those night I spent so far away
But I'm back home in Texas, and this is where I'm gonna stay.

I went out to California, my friends I'll have to warn you
They got a kick-ass streak out there
And Las Vegas took all my money, didn't think that it was funny
I lost two grand but I got drunk.
Colorado's cold, the snow it gets real old
It's hard to ski in cowboy boots

[Chorus]

Oklahoma's near, It's not home I fear
I got a better view from the south
Mexico's still hot, don't think that it's my spot
Never heard of Shiner Boch

[Chorus 2X]---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
