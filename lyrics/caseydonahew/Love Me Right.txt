I grew up in a north Texas town
 And I was the guy your daddy wouldn't let you hang around
 'Cause I was on the move, and I was movin' fast
 Tell you that I love you but I know it'll never last
 Then I met a girl with a heart so true
 She took me by the hand, turned my gray skies back to blue

She said lay me down, you know I'm gonna love you
 Hold me tight and there's things I'm gonna show you
 Listen close, whisper when I tell you
 Love me right and we'll always get through
 Never lie, always stay true
 You can stay all night if you want to
 I don't mind the little things you do
 Love me right and we'll always get through

I was into gamblin', and I was into cars
 I was into goin' where the girls dance on the bars
 I was into trouble, I was up to nothin' good
 And I was always doin' little things I never should
 And I was always leavin', but she can make me stay
 All I had to do was to hear her say

She said lay me down, you know I'm gonna love you
 Hold me tight and there's things I'm gonna show you
 Listen close, whisper when I'll tell you
 Love me right and we'll always get through
 Never lie, always stay true
 You can stay all night if you want to
 I don't mind the little things you do
 Love me right and we'll always get through

Now I've changed my ways
 And I'm walkin' straight
 I'm in a hurry so don't make me late
 'Cause I've gotta see her
 I wanna know
 I'm gonna hold and I'll never let go

She said lay me down, you know I'm gonna love you
 Hold me tight and there's things I'm gonna show you
 Listen close, whisper when I tell you
 Love me right and we'll always get through
 Never lie, always stay true
 You can stay all night if you want to
 I don't mind the little things you do
 Love me right and we'll always get through
 Lay me down, you know I'm gonna love you
 Hold me tight and there's things I'm gonna show you
 Listen close, whisper when I tell you
 Love me right and we'll always get through
 Never lie, always stay true
 You can stay all night if you want to
 I don't mind the little things you do
 Love me right and we'll always get through

Love me right
 Just love me right
 Won't you love me right
 And we're gonna get through---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
