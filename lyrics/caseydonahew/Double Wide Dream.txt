Well, I'm spoken for
 I got a ball and chain 
I even gave her my last name 
She's my anchor, she takes the wind out of my sails 
Can't move our trailer 'cause she sold the wheels 
She's my plus one, you can do the math 
Top to bottom there's no better half 

And I love that pretty little country girl 
She's rockin' this redneck's world 
She's the welcome mat to my home sweet home 
She takes me as I am & loves me like she wants to 
Twists my heart up just like a corkscrew 
And makes me smile, as I make her scream 
Just a couple of kids livin' the double-wide dream 

She likes to cuss & fight & she can drink all night 
And she can roll one up till I'm feelin' right 
She drives a truck with swampers and rims 
And an Alpine pumping through Kicker tens 
She dips snuff & she don't spit 
Never owed a bra and her shirts don't fit 

And I love that pretty little country girl 
She's rockin' this redneck's world 
She's the welcome mat to my home sweet home 
She takes me as I am & loves me like she wants to 
Twists my heart up just like a corkscrew 
And makes me smile, as I make her scream 
Just a couple of kids livin' the double-wide dream 

Guns & dirt roads, cowboy boots & old blue jeans 
And she ain't no uptown hussy 
She's my down home trailer queen

Well, I love that pretty little country girl 
She's what's rockin' this redneck's world 
She's the welcome mat to my home sweet home

And I love that pretty little country girl 
She's rockin' this redneck's world 
She's the welcome mat to my home sweet home 
She takes me as I am & loves me like she wants to 
Twists my heart up just like a corkscrew 
And makes me smile, as I make her scream 
Just a couple of kids livin' the double-wide dream

The double wide dream
 We got double wide dreams---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
