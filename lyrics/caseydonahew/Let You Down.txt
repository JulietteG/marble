She turned 21 in April,
You know her birthday's the same as mine
When we first met she'd never left Texas
She was young and so confused
She got caught up in the bright lights
The whiskey, pills and all those late nights
From the mountain where we standing,
She fell so far that she could not see

[Chorus]
And I was angry when I woke up
When I found out that we broke up
She packed her bags, she was gone before the sun
She left a letter on the table,
Said catch me if you're able
But I'll be moving fast and I'm still hard to find
So I wont call you and I wont follow
Cause the truth is hard to swallow
Said I'd pick you up, but I'd only let you down.

Heard from a friend you moved back to Corpus
You always loved that ocean air
I know that you know that I'm headed down that way
Don't worry cause I wont call
It'd be strange for me to see you
You know there's so much left unsaid

[Chorus]

Said I'd pick you up but I'd only let you down

Wrote you a letter while in Corpus
It took everything I had
Went down to the pier and looked out across that bay
Took that letter then I watched it burn away

[Chorus]

Said I'd pick you up but I'd only let you down ---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
