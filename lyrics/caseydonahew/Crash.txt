Tap the brakes
 Were not slowing down
 The bridge is burning
 Theres no turning around
 And she was screaming
 But I dont hear a sound
 And all my friends
 Keep on waiting for this to come unwound

And I dont know why I care
I Dont miss that cold stare she use to give to me
 And I keep hopin that somehow I'll find my way out now that I can see
 That Ive crashed

It was rainin
 She was dressed in white
 We were dancing
 Holdin on so tight
 Just romancing
 And this could be the night
 It was the last time
 Everything just seemed to feel so right
 Now she wont stop complaining she driving me insane and I cant breathe

And I keep hopin that somehow I'll find my way out now that I can see
 That Ive crashed
 You know Ive crashed

And I dont know all I can do
 But I cant stay
 And I keep holdin on for something to get me through today

And I dont know why I care
I Dont miss that cold stare she use to give to me
 And I keep hopin that somehow I'll find my way out now that I can see
 That Ive crashed
 You know Ive crashed---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
