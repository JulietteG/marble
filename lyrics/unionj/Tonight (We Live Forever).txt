Feels like a party every time you come around
Even though it's just the two of us in my house
I don't know what you do, but you're making everything feel right
I may not know much, but this feels like love
Ooh ooh oooh oooh oh oh oh
I knew when I met you I was onto something good
You made me love you like I thought I never could
I have the best time, every time you're by my side
'Cause we're living for tonight

Tonight we'll live forever (we'll live forever)
Do things we won't remember (we won't remember)
But it's all good (it's all good)
If we can, we should (if we can we should)
As long as we're together
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
It's all good! Ooh oh oh

You'll take a bad day and you'll make it feel alright
It might be dark outside, but you'll make my sun shine
I don't know what you do, but you're making everything feel right
'Cause this feels like love

Tonight we'll live forever (we'll live forever)
Do things we won't remember (we won't remember)
But it's all good (it's all good)
If we can, we should (if we can we should)
As long as we're together,
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
As long as we're together

We're gonna live forever,
Gonna do whatever!
If we stick together, it will be all good
And if we stick together we can live forever
We can do whatever
It will be all good

Tonight we'll live forever (we'll live forever)
Do things we won't remember (we won't remember)
But it's all good (it's all good)
If we can, we should (if we can we should)
As long as we're together
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
It's all good! Ooh oh oh
It's all good! Ooh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
