Looking out the window,
The moon is smiling as you're lying next to me
For the first time I know
In my soul that I am where I'm meant to be
Here with you, it's time like this I know that I have everything I need

I love to watch you sleep
'Cause I love to see you dream
And I hope that you are dreaming off me
And I hope that I am the one you see
And I hope that we can live this dream forever
'Cause where you are is where I'm meant to be
I love to watch you sleep
'Cause I love to see you dream

In this silence I can feel you breathe
And your heart beating next to mine
Lost inside this moment
I just wanna spend this moment all my life
Here with you
Just know that you're in my world
That makes my world complete

I love to watch you sleep
'Cause I love to see you dream
And I hope that you are dreaming off me
And I hope that I am the one you see
And I hope that we can live this dream forever
'Cause where you are is where I'm meant to be
I love to watch you sleep
'Cause I love to see you dream

Wide awake, thinking Ebout my life before you found me
Every day, I wanna wake up with you wrapped around me

And I hope that you are dreaming off me
And I hope that I am the one you see
And I hope that we can live this dream forever
'Cause where you are is where I'm meant to be
I love to watch you sleep
'Cause I love to see you dream---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
