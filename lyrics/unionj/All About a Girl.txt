We fell in love so quickly
Her smile lit up the city
Just like a million lights
(Just like a million lights)
Yeah, we burned out, we lost it
Didn't know just what I wanted
I wanna go back to that night

'Cause since that day
(Ooh, ooh)
I've been searching all my life for you
(You, you)
I've been all the way
From Verona to California
I tried to find you
You're my world
Nobody told me that my last story
Would be all about, be all about
Be all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl

Every place I've been through
I think that I see you
New York, London, LA
And every melody of every song I sing to
Always reminds me of you
But still I wanna press play

'Cause since that day
(Ooh, ooh)
I've been searching all my life for you
(You, ooh)
I've been all the way from Verona to California
I tried to find you
You're my world
(You're my world)
Nobody told me that my last story
Would be all about, be all about
Be all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl

I've been all the way
I was waiting all my life for you (ooh)
I've been searching all the world for you (ooh)
Everything's reminded me of you (ooh)

From Verona to California
I tried to find you
You're my world
(You're my world)
Nobody told me that my last story
Would be all about, be all about
Be all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
