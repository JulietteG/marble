She sees the world through TV screens
All of her friends in magazines
But everyday she lives a broken dream
Making a wrong reality
There's lots of make up on her face
To cover up an empty space
But theres a lot behind those big blue eyes
She just don't realize
Everybody's gone and lost their mind
Its just the days we live in
Most of the time
Get up of the dark
Open up your eyes,
you discover
theres a world outside,
and to fix the broken heart,
you have to try,
pick it up,
pick it up,
it's a beautiful life.
Beautiful life
Its a beautiful life
Beautiful life
He got his fortune on the plate
But all that money won't change faith
He got six zeroes but no one to share it with
No friends,No girl,No one in the world
Everybody is gone and lost their mind
It's just the days we live in
Most of the time
Get up of the dark
Open up your eyes,
you discover
theres a world outside,
and to fix the broken heart,
you have to try,
pick it up,
pick it up,
it's a beautiful life.
Beautiful life
Its a beautiful life
Beautiful life
We are not so different, 
you and I 
Coz everybodys got a place to hide 
But its just the things we live in, 
hmm Most of the time 
Get up off the dark (get up off the dark) 
open up your eyes 
Youll discover theres a world outside (theres a world outside) 
To fix a broken heart (to fix a broken heart) 
You have to try 
Pick it up, pick it up 
Its a beautiful life 
Beautiful life, 
beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life
Beautiful life---Lyrics submitted by Shelley Lover.
