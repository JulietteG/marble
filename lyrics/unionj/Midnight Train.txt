I would run one million miles to the moon 
If I knew that youd be there too 
Will you be there too? 

I would cross oceans and fields for your touch 
The sound of your voice aint enough 
Its never enough 

Im running out the door into the dark 
Guided by the beating of your heart 
Stay right where you are tonight 

You have never felt so far away 
If I dont have you now Ill go insane 
Stay right where you are 
Im on a midnight train 

I will crawl, swim through the desert alone 
No footprints to lead me back home 
Never going back home 

Your body is a river, yeah, 
Its twisting and its turning 
I miss you and I miss the way 
You let me watch it burn, yeah 

Your body is a river, yeah 
Its twisting and its turning 
I miss you, yeah, I miss you 
So Im running running running 

Im running out the door into the dark 
Guided by the beating of your heart 
Stay right where you are tonight 
You have never felt so far away 
If I dont have you now Ill go insane 
Stay right where you are 
Im on a midnight train 

Midnight train 

I would cross oceans and fields for your touch 
The sound of your voice aint enough 
Nothing is ever enough 

Im running out the door into the dark 
Guided by the beating of your heart 
Stay right where you are tonight 

You have never felt so far away 
If I dont have you now Ill go insane 
Stay right where you are 
Im on a midnight train 
Im on a midnight train 
Im on a midnight train---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
