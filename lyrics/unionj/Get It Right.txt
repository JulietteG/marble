(Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey)
Josh 
Weve been holding on
Stronger, now we made it to the shore
The hurricane wont follow us no more
And together we know what were fighting for
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
George
'Cause we're here to stay
Living in the moment, its our day
Know the love we had it still remains
Never going back the way we came
(Hey hey, hey hey!)
All
'Cause we've been waiting for this all our lives
But well try to get it right, get it right
Yeah I swear well get it right
All alone, you and I
Been the one thing to survive
I see the love in your eyes
As I lay with you tonight
Every time you and I
Oh, I swear well get it right
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, well be alright
Singing la la la la la and well be alright
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, well be alright
Singing la la la la la and well be alright
JJ
Our victory, is learning how to live and what well be
Dont forget were making history
Promises are built on what we dream
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Jaymi
'Cause we've been waiting for this all our lives
