Tonight, watching the sun go down in your eyes
Its just you and me, and memories of good times
Now its the final night of the summer
Lets do it one more time

Turn it up, were up all night
Lets get on it
You cant deny, when the sun comes up
Well say goodbye
Lets get on it
One more time

Turn it up girl
oh oh oh
One more time

So, call all of your girlfriends, Ill get my guys
Well raise a cup and drink it up
Some beach guitar by the firelight
One more party, one more time

Turn it up, were up all night
Lets get on it.
You cant deny, when the sun comes up
Well say goodbye
Lets get on it 
One more time

Turn it up girl
oh oh oh
One more time

Turn it up girl
Well say goodbye
One more time

Yeah
You and me girl
You and me girl
You and me girl
Ooooh

Turn it up, were up all night
Lets get on it
You cant deny, when the sun comes up
Well say goodbye
Lets get on it 
One more time

Turn it up girl
oh oh oh
Well say goodbye
One more time

You and me girl
You and me girl
One more time---
