[Josh] 
You took a diamond from the dust 
Made it brighter with your love 

[JJ] 
How will it shine now you're gone? 

[George] 
It's like a broken melody 
You're the missing half of me 

[JJ] 
Don't know how my heart still beats 

[Jaymi] 
And I hear it in the air, the song for you and I 
Every dream that we share is written in the sky 
But I won't forget the day you left and said goodbye 
I let you go, that's when I wrote the song for you and I 

[All] 
Singing oh, oh oh oh 
Oh 

[Josh] 
The song for you and I 

[All] 
Oh, oh oh oh 

[Josh] 
Cus I let you go 
That's when I wrote the song for you and I 
I see you when I close my eyes 
Get to hold you every night 

[JJ] 
When the morning comes I'll smile 

[George] 
I feel the rhythm of your heart 
Even though we're miles apart 

[JJ] 
Got me wishing on these stars 

[Jaymi] 
And I hear it in the air, the song for you and I 
Every dream that we share is written in the sky 
But I won't forget the day you left and said goodbye 
I let you go, that's when I wrote the song for you and I 

[All] 
Singing oh, oh oh oh 
Oh 

[Josh] 
The song for you and I 

[All] 
Oh, oh oh oh 

[Josh] 
Cus I let you go that's when I wrote the song for you and I 
Yeah I let you go, that's when I wrote the song for you and I 
Music keeps playing, now you're gone 
I hear it playing all night long 
Our dreams were written in the sky 
Cus I let you go, that's why I wrote the song for you and I 

[Jaymi] 
Song for you and I 

[All] 
Singing oh, oh oh oh 
Oh 

[Josh] 
The song for you and I 

[All] 
Oh, oh oh oh 
Cus I let you go, that's when I wrote the song for you and I 
Oh, song for you and I 
Oh, song for you and I 
Oh, song for you and I 
I let you go, that's when I wrote the song for you and I 

[Josh] 
Cus I let you go, that's when I wrote the song for you and I---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
