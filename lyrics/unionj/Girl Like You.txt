Jaymi
Well I'm not the kind of guy you show to your mother
'Cause when I got somebody, I'm looking for another
Josh
I only know how to play it cool
But you're the exception to the rule
George
'Cause with the lips like that
Any guy's gonna suffer
Josh
And it makes me wonder
Jaymi does the melody with harmonies of the others
What is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
I can show a girl like you
How to have a real good time
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So what is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
JJ
Let me show you all the ways that we can get in trouble
We could go all night, regret it by tomorrow
Josh
I only know how to walk away, (hey, hey)
But here with you I just wanna stay, (hey, hey)
JJ
Cause a single shot of you makes a guy want a double
Josh
And I have to wonder
Jaymi does the melody with harmonies of the others
What is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
I can show a girl like you
How to have a real good time
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So what is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
Jaymi
What is a girl
George
What is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
I can show a girl like you
How to have a real good time
Jaymi
And it makes me wonder
Jaymi does the melody with harmonies of the others
What is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
I can show a girl like you
How to have a real good time
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So what is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So what is a girl like you doing
In a mind like mine?
What is a girl---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
