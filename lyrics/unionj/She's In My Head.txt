[Jaymi] 
One step forward 
Two steps back 
I never know if I'm on track 
And she does it just for fun, she does it just for fun 
I wish that I was more relaxed 
When she comes around, my heart attacks 
And my words all hit the ground 
My words all hit the ground 

[George] 
She told me her name was Stacy 
I know that's not true 
I'm not sure what she's trying to do 

[Jaymi does the melody with harmonies of the others] 
And I've been dreaming 
Now for so long 
I've been waiting 
To call her my own 
She's been hiding 
From the feeling 
I know she sees me 
And it's starting to bring me 
I know 

[Jaymi] 
She's in my head 

[Josh] 
I'm hoping that the world won't end 
Cause if I'm by her side, she'll see me then 
Even if it's just for fun 
Even if it's just for fun 

[JJ] 
Cause I've wondering lately ways to bring her down 
So I can be the one to bring her round 

[Jaymi does the melody with harmonies of the others] 
And I've been dreaming 
Now for so long 
I've been waiting 
To call her my own 
She's been hiding 
From the feeling 
I know she sees me 
And it's starting to bring me 
I know 

[Jaymi] 
She's in my head 
Sometimes I feel she sees me way far in the crowd 
Every time I turn, she's gone and I don't know how 
I'm never gonna get to say the things I need to say 
To get her out of my head 
And I've been dreaming 
Now for so long 
I've been waiting 
To call her my own 

[Jaymi does the melody with harmonies of the others] 
She's been hiding 
From the feeling 
I know she sees me 
I know she sees me 
And I've been dreaming 
Now for so long 
I've been waiting 
To call her my own 
She's been hiding 
From the feeling 
I know she sees me 
And it's starting to bring me 
I know---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
