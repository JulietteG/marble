Starring down an endless Avenue,
The sun last and now the end of June
Even in the crowds got found my ways looking out for you
One man band's still playing by the lights
This time around some thing just don't feel right
Heart shape up above my head the things I should've said
You never knew,
Oh I make my way back to CENTRAL PARK
Trace the pieces of my broken heart,
I'm chasing down the fallen star
To where you are!

I'm held together by your memory
Baby won't you just come back to me?!
I'll trace the pieces of my broken heart back to CENTRAL PARK
