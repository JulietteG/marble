The night seems to fade, 
But the moonlight lingers on 
There are wonders for everyone 
The stars shine so bright, 
But they're fading after dawn 
There is magic in Kingston Town 

Oh Kingston Town, 
The place I long to be 
If I had the whole world 
I would give it away 
Just to see, the girls at play  

And when I am king, 
surely I would need a queen 
And a palace and everything, yeah 
And now I am king, 
And my queen will come at dawn 
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town 

Oh Kingston Town, 
The place I long to be 
If I had the whole world 
I would give it away 
Just to see, the girls at play 

And when I am king, 
surely I would need a queen 
And a palace and everything, yeah 
And now I am king, 
And my queen will come at dawn 
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town 

She'll be waiting in kingston town---Lyrics submitted by jimjam.
