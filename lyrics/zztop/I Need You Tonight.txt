It's 3 o'clock in the morning
As the rain began to fall
But I know what I needed
But I dont have it all
I'm needing someone like you
That I just want to do love to
Baby Baby I need you tonite

Outside my window
It's lonely and cold
But inside my heart there's a fire
Burnin out of control
Burning for someone like you
I just want to do love to
Baby Baby I need you tonite

Your loves comin to me
Like a wolf howling at the moon
But that just doesnt do me
If I cant get you soon
I'm calling for someone like you
That I just want to do love to
Baby Baby I need you tonite---Lyrics submitted by jim.
