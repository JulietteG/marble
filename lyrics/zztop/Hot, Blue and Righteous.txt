Hot, blue and righteous,
an angel pulled me aside.
Hot, blue and righteous,
said, "Stick by me and I'll be your guide."

I heard the word as I closed my eyes
down on my, down on my bended knees.
It felt like a glove and I realized
something  good's happenin' to me.

Hot, blue and righteous
angel pulled me aside.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.---Lyrics submitted by Joe Farmer.
