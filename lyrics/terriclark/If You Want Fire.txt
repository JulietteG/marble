I got this dream Ive been dreamin
The perfect picture of love.
Sparks and fire were flyin 
almost too hot to touch
And everything I wanted and then some
Suddenly walked in the room
I said I need different 
maybe I spoke too soon

(Chorus)
Its every kind of crazy I could ever imagine
A battle raging between my head and my heart
But if you gotta have it all 
that madness and passion then youll learn
(ooh youll learn) 
If you want Fire 
Better be worth the burn

Were either laughing or crying
Flying high or running away
But in between the thunder and lightning 
Theres always another day(another day)

(Chorus)
Its every kind of crazy I could ever imagine
A battle raging between my head and my heart
But if you gotta have it all 
that madness and passion then youll learn
(ooh youll learn) 
If you want Fire 
Better be worth the burn

Sometimes it feels all or nothing 
Sometimes its nothing at all
But in between those moments its magic
Softens the fall

(Chorus)
Its every kind of crazy I could ever imagine
A battle raging between my head and my heart
But if you gotta have it all 
that madness and passion then youll learn
(ooh youll learn) 
If you want Fire 
Better be worth the burn(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Steph.
