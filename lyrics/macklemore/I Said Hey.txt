Yo, the first time I heard digital underground I was in the first grade
My homie, Lace brought it over and he dubbed it on a mix tape
I would do the humpty hump and performed to his verses 
Twelve years later I learned that Shock G and him were the same person
I loved him, I cant front, he taught me how to dance
Along the bell with the bow, I had J-Os and a pair of zebra pants

This was the foundation, what would come to be
I like law and passion, journey and drive and M.C
Some people asked me what it means, 
I dont know where to start, its the deepest connection between my soul and my heart
When I first stepped into a cipher and jam in the park, I got served, nah for real, I got served
See I learned something, observed others, and watched, 
and urged hunger and watched burn on that clock

And I dont care who you are, where youre from, or what you believe in,
But if you love hip-hop, I bet its more or less for the same reason
This is it, cuz when you spit, you exist in that moment
And if youre sick with that gift, then you rip it when you perform it
Then all the shit youve been to live begins to lift up your shoulders
And the audience will then get to experience where your soul is
The most amazing feeling, rocking the crowd to your anthem 
From the front to the back, with their mother fuckin hands up
Cuz imma M.C, wont be the first, wont be the last, just another B.Boy and imma die in my stance

If you got a pen and a pad, put your heart down,
If you got a record, and can grab, lay a scratch down,
If you got a marker and a can, bomb your art now, 
If you got a floor and youre fast, kill that ill style
If you got a pen and a pad, put your heart down,
If you got a record, and can grab, lay a scratch down,
If you got a marker and a can, bomb the whole damn town,
But if you live for hip-hop, dont ever put your hands down

Now, I dont know if the clothes, the hoes or the cars that make people rap like their trapped inside of these bars
This shit aint complicated man, just be who you are
Too busy, searching for the light, missing the fact that you're a star
Now, whose got passion, stand the hell up
Cuz I wanna hear somebody rapping thats got it inside their cuts
Now you can get intricate thats playin your fancy games 
But if youre not speaking the truth, then you might as well not be sayin shit
I said, whose gonna teach the kids? 
Youd rather blow up and get famous n get some new rims
All the money in the world can help you look like a star 
But money cant buy you the heart to put inside your bars
And I like nice shit too and believe me, 
I gotta closet full of Nikes and a whole bunch of Valor suits
If it wasnt for the white Ts, and the icy earrings, like the old you
Population of hip-hop but look beyond it when I record too
These beats, cuz if I dont speak me then whats the difference between my lyrics,
And what you hearin on MTV?

People fearin that if theyre steerin away from the main stream, then their album wont sell, well I could give a fuck
Im jus gonna free style, n spit whats in my gut,
And if you want to, you can go n label me conscious,
But remember, theres a kid at a bus stop, beat boxin
Whose life will be affected by whats inside of his walk-man


If you got a pen and a pad, put your heart down,
If you got a record, and can grab, lay a scratch down,
If you got a marker and a can, bomb your art now, 
If you got a floor and youre fast, kill that ill style
If you got a pen and a pad, put your heart down,
If you got a record, and can grab, lay a scratch down,
If you got a marker and a can, bomb the whole damn town,
But if you live for hip-hop, dont ever put your hands down---Lyrics submitted by andrew h.
