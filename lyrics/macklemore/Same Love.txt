When I was in the 3rd grade 
I thought that I was gay 
Cause I could draw, my uncle was 
And I kept my room straight 
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face 
She's like, "Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K" 
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she 
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head 
I remember doing the math like 
"Yeah, I'm good at little league" 
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant 
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics 
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision 
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion 
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition 
Playing God 
Ahh nah, here we go 
America the brave 
Still fears what we don't know 
And God loves all His children 
And somehow forgotten 
But we paraphrase a book written 
3,500 hundred years ago 
I don't know

And I can't change 
Even if I tried 
Even if I wanted to 
And I can't change 
Even if I tried 
Even if I wanted to 
My love, my love, my love 
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay 
I would think hip-hop hates me 
Have you read the YouTube comments lately 
"Man that's gay" 
Gets dropped on the daily 
We've become so numb to what we're sayin' 
A culture founded from oppression 
Yet, we don't have acceptance for 'em 
Call each other faggots 
Behind the keys of a message board 
A word rooted in hate 
Yet our genre still ignores it 
Gay is synonymous with the lesser 
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion 
Gender and skin color 
The complexion of your pigment 
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins 
Human rights for everybody 
There is no difference 
Live on! And be yourself! 
When I was in church 
They taught me something else 
If you preach hate at the service 
Those words aren't anointed 
And that Holy Water 
That you soak in 
has been poisoned 
When everyone else 
Is more comfortable 
Remaining voiceless 
Rather than fighting for humans 
That have had their rights stolen 
I might not be the same 
But that's not important 
No freedom 'til we're equal 
Damn right I support it

I don't know 

[Mary Lambert] 
And I can't change 
Even if I tried 
Even if I wanted to 
And I can't change 
Even if I tried 
Even if I wanted to 
My love, my love, my love 
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Macklemore] 
We press play 
Don't press pause 
Progress, march on! 
With a veil over our eyes 
We turn our back on the cause 
'Till the day 
That my uncles can be united by law 
Kids are walkin' around the hallway 
Plagued by pain in their heart 
A world so hateful 
Someone would rather die 
Than be who they are 
And a certificate on paper 
Isn't gonna solve it all 
But it's a damn good place to start 
No law's gonna change us 
We have to change us 
Whatever god you believe in 
We come from the same one 
Strip away the fear 
Underneath it's all the same love 
About time that we raised up 

[Mary Lambert] 
And I can't change 
Even if I tried 
Even if I wanted to 
And I can't change 
Even if I tried 
Even if I wanted to 
My love, my love, my love 
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
