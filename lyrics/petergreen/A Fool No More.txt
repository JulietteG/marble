Yes, Ive packed up my clothes
Im moving away from your door
Lord, Ive packed up my clothes
Said, Im moving away from your door
Ive been your fool for so long
Babe, I wont play that fool no more

I gave you all my money
I work as hard as I can
I came home early one morning
I found you with another man
Babe, Ive packed up my clothes
Im moving away from your door
Said, Ive been your fool for so long
And lord, I wont play that fool no more

Solo

So good-bye baby
You dont even care
Yes, I had a love so strong for you
But you treat me so unfair
Said, Ive packed up my clothes
Im moving away from your door
You know, Ive been your fool for so long
And babe, I wont play that fool no more---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
