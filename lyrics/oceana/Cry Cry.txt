When she was a young girl 
She used to play with me 
I was her best friend 
We were inseparately 
We loved to ride our bikes 
Playin hide and seek 
Sneeking all the night 
Dancing in the street 
I look back at the time 
Now i realise 
She loved to play with fire 
I should have seen it in her eyes 
I should have seen it in her eyes 

Ref: 
Deep inside, you cry cry cry 
Dont let your hopes,die die die 
Deep inside, you cry cry cry 
Dont let your hopes,die die die 

Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na 

She fell in love for the first time 
He was older than her 
Then he made her do things 
First she wouldnt dare 
She left everything behind 
Couldnt find a place 
Running through the night 
Loosing all her faith 
She throws away the pain 
Turning off her lies 
But still he makes her see like everythings alright 
Like everythings alright 

Ref: 
Deep inside, you cry cry cry 
Dont let your hopes,die die die 
Deep inside, you cry cry cry 
Dont let your hopes,die die de (x2)---Lyrics submitted by cecile.
