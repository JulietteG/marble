Ignorance is bliss
You'd always hear me say
But at times you can't deny
Those eyes looking your way

Let me begin by saying what I mean
It's a crime against the heart you know
To be somewhere in between

Well don't be shy
I've got an open heart and hand
And I just might have to confess just where I stand

Lately you make me weaker in the knees
And race through my veins baby every time you're close to me
Take me away to places I ain't seen
They say you've got a hold on me:
And I won't disagree

Rock-a-bye my baby
Don't be blue tonight
Oh I'm on my way
And I'm gonna make it right

Cause I've got the feeling
You'll be needing love
And of all the lonely hearts
You're the one I'm thinking of

I've been told it's gonna take an iron hand
To break the mold and stand above all of the rest

Lately you make me weaker in the knees
And race through my veins baby every time you're close to me
Take me away to places I ain't seen
They say you've got a hold on me:
And I won't disagree

I'll be thinking of that evening
When there's nothing for me to do
And I'll be wondering if by some slim chance
You've been wondering too

Lately you make me weaker in the knees
And race through my veins baby every time you're close to me
Take me away to places I ain't seen
They say you've got a hold on me:
And I won't disagree---Lyrics submitted by Marina.
