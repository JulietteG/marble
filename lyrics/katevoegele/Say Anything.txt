been here before
revolving door
were caught up and I dont know what for
anymore
we had the best
and nothing less
but the second we fell out of step
you up and left
this is so you this is what you do
youd rather make do than make a move
whatll it take now how do I make
this matter enough to you?

say youre a mess
say its a shame
why cant you at least pretend?
say I should leave
youre over me
say something, say anything
anything
say anything
please

what happened to
the plans we made
and that contagious smile upon your face?
its all begun to fade
you used to be
so careful with me
making sure that we would always be
each others missing piece
well we can still save
these tattered pages
what do you say we
start over baby?
this is our chance
and youre all I have
dont let me slip through your hands

chorus

you know I miss you, you know I wish you
missed me too, baby tell me you do
