The city sleeps
So silently
I wish I could say the same for me
But I've got this dead ended street
To keep searching

For a tunnel underneath the bitter truth
Or a bridge invisible I won't fall through

And I don't know how much I can keep
Letting you unravel me
Cause the more you learn the more we share
We were worlds apart and you see
It was so much easier to be
Cause now I know what we can't have and it's so unfair

I never meant
Most of those pretty words I said
But I wanted you to think I did
Cause telling you all this makes no difference
It's useless

Cause those who get to know our hearts the most
They always seem to be the ones we'll never hold

And I don't know how much I can keep
Letting you unravel me
Cause the more you learn the more we share
We were worlds apart and you see
It was so much easier to be
Cause now I know what we can't have and it's so unfair

Can't you see it's destroying me?
I can't stand the closeness
But don't you dare go avoiding me
It kills me and yet it keeps me going

And I don't know how much I can keep
Letting you unravel me
Cause the more you learn the more we share
We were worlds apart and you see
It was so much easier to be
Cause now I know what we can't have and it's so unfair---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
