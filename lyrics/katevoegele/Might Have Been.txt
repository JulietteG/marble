I break away from every situation like this one most times baby 
But since you been round here I've given in, my dear, to your captivation daily

I'm not the type who gets voted most likely to be victimized by those old butterflies but
You're the exception your love is infectious, and the fever is climbing high

Well I hope you don't mind if I fall asleep on your shoulder
Now turn out the lights and let the night begin
And I hope it's alright if you're still mine when we're older
Cause I wont spend another day wondering what might have been

I was so cynical just inconvincible, nobody seemed worth trusting
But sure enough just when id near given up you appeared there among the destruction

Now it's official I've lost my initial suspicions and skepticism
You got me caving in; feeding the craving, I see now what I've been missing 

Well I hope you don't mind if I fall asleep on your shoulder
Now turn out the lights and let the night begin
And I hope it's alright if you're still mine when we're older
Cause I wont spend another day wondering what might have been

Got my permission to
Break the tradition
No limited editions
This is a persistent
Change of disposition
No more inhibitions
I don't wanna spend my life wishing

Well I hope you don't mind if I fall asleep on your shoulder
Now turn out the lights and let the night begin
And I hope it's alright if you're still mine when we're older
Cause I wont spend another day wondering what might have been---Lyrics submitted by Marina.
