I've said it once and I'll say it again
I've got something hanging over my head
I was laying on your shoulder, perfectly content
Until you told me all over again
I ain't got no sob story to write
Just like everyone else I'm living this life
You don't need to win me over
There ain't no other side
To shelter me from I belong where I decide
And you say

We don't mess around you've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels, from the sky, oh no
We don't mess around you're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel, but that's a lie
Oh oh oo oh
Oh oh

Well I suppose you think I'm so flattered to hear
That I'm the whispered conscious in you're ear, yeah
And that's exactly the reason I'll, never fit in here
Nothing's ever that black and white my dear, no
But you say

We don't mess around you've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels, from the sky, oh no
We don't mess around you're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel, but that's a lie

I'm not your angel darlin'
I'm not your angel darlin'
I, am never gonna be
I'm not your angel darlin'
I'm not your angel darlin'
I, am never gonna be

We don't mess around you've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels, from the sky, oh no
We don't mess around you're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel, but that's a lie

We don't mess around you've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels, from the sky, oh no
We don't mess around you're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel, but that's a lie

We don't mess around you've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels, from the sky, oh no
We don't mess around you're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel, but that's a lie

I'm not your angel darlin'
I'm not your angel darlin'
I, am never gonna be
