Im going home
Downhearted and hoping
Im close to some new beginning
I know
Theres a reason for everything
That comes and goes

But so many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But Im just surviving
I may be weak but Im never defeated
And Ill keep believing
In clouds with that sweet silver lining

Most days
I try my best to put on a brave face
But inside
My bones are cold and my heart breaks
But all the while
Somethings keeping me safe
And alive

Chorus

I wont give up like this
I will be given strength
And now that Ive found it
Nothing can take that away

So many are looking to me 
To be strong and to fight 
I'm just surviving
And I'll keep believing 
In clouds with that sweet silver lining

(Repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Abigail.
