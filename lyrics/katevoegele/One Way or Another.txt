One Way or Another

I can tell by the way you've been yelling her name
That it's more than a friendly game
With a smile and a "I'm gonna fight to the death" expression in her eye
You think I'm so dramatic;
Just imagining again
You come to her defence
Insisting that she's innocent
Well excuse me for wanting to be 
The one and only lock that fits your key
Oh you believe there's nothing up her sleeve
Oh baby, well just wait and see

You say that love is blind
Well I say open up your eyes
She's a mastermind
She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
I'll be gone one way or another

Take a minute to see it from my side of things
Don't you think you would feel the same?
Like you still gotta play for the victory in a game
You won yesterday
I shouldn't have to fight for something that's already mine
But her pursuit of you has undermind my peace of mind
But it's no use crying to you
You're who her plan has done the damage to 
What's done is done
I should just hold my tongue
But someone's got me outdone

You say that love is blind
Well I say open up your eyes
She's a mastermind
She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
I'll be gone one way or another

You're going under, yeah
And baby, it's no wonder, no, no
Cause she's stepping up her game
She's making you a prisoner for her hall of fame
She's looking for a winner for her trophy case
And you need to consider
What you think you deserve
Is that all that you're worth?
No, no, no, no

You say that love is blind
Well I say open up your eyes
She's a mastermind
She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
I'll be gone one way or another

(You say that love is blind
Well I say open up your eyes)
You're going under
(She's a mastermind
She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her)
And baby its no wonder
(Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?)
I'll be gone one way or another
I'll be gone one way or another
I'll be gone one way or another---
