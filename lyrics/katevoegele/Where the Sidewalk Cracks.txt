Where the sidewalk cracks
I stood here on this same old ground one year ago, oh
And now standing here at the edge of the woods, Im all alone, whoa
Dont tell me Im your shooting star 
Cause youre not here and the distance is too far 
Ive wasted time here 
I searched the station but by estimation you left hours ago 
Well, dont come home, cause

Falling once, it showed me the place where the sidewalk cracks
And now I look before I leap 
And calling out my name isnt gonna bring me back
Sometimes just being blind for awhile will teach you to see

The skys the limit, its funny how I flew the day you left, hey
You say you made that big mistake again, Ive got no sympathy for that, oh no
Well, soon Ill find my shooting star, so you can show your chances to the door
Youve wasted my time 
My eyes are straightforward and you dont have me cornered anymore 
No, no, cause

Falling once, it showed me the place where the sidewalk cracks
And now I look before I leap 
And calling out my name isnt gonna bring me back
Sometimes just being blind for awhile will teach you to see

Falling for you one time
And crawling on a thin line 
Was worth it all the while 
All the while 
All the while 
All the while 
All the while

Falling once, it showed me the place where the sidewalk cracks
And now I look before I leap 
And calling out my name isnt gonna bring me back
Sometimes just being blind for awhile will teach you to see
Seeing the place where the sidewalk cracks
And now I look before I leap 
And calling out my name isnt gonna bring me back
Sometimes just being blind for awhile, oh
Sometimes just being blind for awhile, yeah
Sometimes just being blind for awhile will teach you to see
Sometimes just being blind for awhile, oh
Sometimes just being blind for awhile will teach you to see---Lyrics submitted by emma.
