We were young in the summer of some year I don't quite recall,
but it feels like yesterday.
I was teaching you guitar on the hood of your pickup under the stars,
you were in town for the holiday.
When you left I took a moment,
got a coffee and set off in my car,
just to be where you are.
Well I had to drive all night
to get to you.
I thought I'd lost my mind,
but I just know,
that we would be so fine
and I was right
oh, now I know.

Chorus:
It's no wonder that you're such a natural. 
You got everything I want, from your head to your toes
and underneath that smile that has me sold
is your hundred million dollar soul.
End chorus

I was sitting on the front porch with the only dinner I know how to make
with a Neil Young record on.
A board game by the fireside turns into a pillow fight as always.
Oh, this is where I belong.
You kept me up all night, just like you do.
I laughed so hard I cried.
When I'm next to you.
Your brightness is a virus
that lights up the room 
oh, and now I know

Repeat chorus


And when I feel your touch
I still get such a rush.
Your body next to mine,
go ahead and drive me wild.

Repeat chorus---Lyrics submitted by Lori Moss.
