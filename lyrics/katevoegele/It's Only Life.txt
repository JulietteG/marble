Tears are forming in your eyes
A storm is warning in the sky

The end of the world it seems
You bend down and you fall on your knees 
Well get back on your feet yeah

Don't look away 
Don't run away
Hey baby it's only life
Don't lose your faith
Don't run away
Hey baby its only life
Yea it's only life

You were always playing hard
Never could let down your guard

But you can't win
If you never give in
To that voice within
Saying pick up your chin
Baby let go of it


Don't look away 
Don't run away
Hey baby it's only life
Don't lose your faith
Don't run away
Hey baby its only life
Yea it's only life

Take your hesitance 
And your self-defense
Leave them behind, it's only life
Don't be so afraid 
Of facing everyday
Just take your time, it's only life
I'll be your stepping-stone
No, don't be so alone
Just hold on tight, it's only life

Don't look away 
Don't run away
Hey baby it's only life
Don't lose your faith
Don't run away
Hey baby its only life
Yea it's only life---Lyrics submitted by Marina.
