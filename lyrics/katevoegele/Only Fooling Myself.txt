I stop to catch my breath 
And I stop to catch your eye
No need to second-guess 
That youve been on my mind
Well I dream days away, but thats okay 
Its like I want to hear a silent sound 
And then hold it in my hand
But a rose wont blossom from a ground 
Of desert sand, but I like to pretend that

One day Ill turn around 
Ill see your hand reach out
Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
But maybe when you smile 
It means youd stay awhile 
Just maybe youd save me now 
Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Im only fooling myself

Well, now its etched in stone 
That I cant survive alone 
You have the missing piece 
That I need so desperately 
Yes, I slip away to a day thatll never come
Its like a splash of water to my face 
When I suddenly realize 
That you could never find a place 
For me in your eyes, and I dont know why I keep thinking

One day Ill turn around 
Ill see your hand reach out
Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But maybe when you smile 
It means youd stay awhile 
Just maybe youd save me now 
Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Im only fooling myself

Its love in disguise 
Im lost in your eyes 
Im lost in your eyes

One day Ill turn around 
Ill see your hand reach out
Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But maybe when you smile 
It means youd stay awhile 
Just maybe youd save me now 

One day Ill turn around 
Ill see your hand reach out
Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But maybe when you smile 
It means youd stay awhile 
Just maybe youd save me now 

Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Im only fooling myself
Oh save me now

Im only fooling myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah save me now---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
