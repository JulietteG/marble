If your travels
ever take you to sea,
then I'd say to you 
dip in your feet.
And if you battle
the wind along the way,
then I'd tell you to 
challenge the waves.
It's a world
of peculiar people
and places that look nothing like home.
But it keeps turning 
and turning even though

Chorus:
Gravity happens
and we don't know it 'til 
after we've hit the ground.
And the world's spinning faster
with each day that passes 
and each dashing hour.
What am I to do?
I've broken my parachute.
So if gravity happens,
then I'll fasten wings to my shoes.
End Chorus:

I have gathered
that the moments that shaped me
were the ones that have tested my faith.
And all that matters
is the courage they gave me.
I fell down and my fears were erased.
'Cause in the wreckage 
of heartache and hindsight
a new beginning
starts to unfold.
And if you let it,
it just might save your life.

Chorus

I'm not
gonna 
let the world get me down.
I got so much 
more to live for
and I'm starting right now.
