I never feared the unexpected
until i found myself in this peculiar place
unaware of where i was headed oh,
it turns out it was your footsteps i had chased

well i should know so much better than this yea yea yea yea 
but you've occupied the center of my universe 

so, i'm moving in reverse 
under your mighty curse
i hate myself for loving you
i turn my head away but my heart will remain 
til' the day i learn you're no good for me no

so how you called is outrageous
the way i let you keep me hanging along
your character is that contagious
oh i know i should have thought before i loved

i've gone and let my impulse be my guide 
and on that note i'll be defenseless for some time 

oh, i'm moving in reverse
under your mighty curse 
i hate myself for loving you
i turn my head away but my heart will remain
til' the day i learn you're no good for me

hey you there, keep your distance
don't you come around here
don't test my patience baby cause i ain't gonna let you off easy
no no no no no
ooh you're no good no
no good no good no good no 

i'm moving in reverse 
under your mighty curse
i hate myself for loving you
i turn my head away but my heart will remain
til' the day i learn you're no good for me
i'm moving in reverse 
under your mighty curse 
i hate myself for loving you
i turn my head away but my heart will remain
til' the day i learn you're no good 
til' the day i learn you're no good
til' the day i learn you're no good for me no oh

you're no good, you're no good,
you're no good, you're no good for me

you're no good, you're no good,
you're no good for me
no no good oh you're no good
no oh you're no good
no oh you're no good---Lyrics submitted by Tori.
