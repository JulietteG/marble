Tell me where'd the day go?
I'm lyin' wide awake wonderin'
how it escaped,
the sun got away.
Lately there's a part of me
thinkin' soon enough,
I'll be ten more years old,
the next thing I know.
I'm not about to let that happen,
call me drastic
and old fashioned.

Chorus:
I think it's time that we take a drive down the scenic route.
Baby, sittin' here talking 'bout it really doesn't count.
Can we slow down, just take our time.
Close our eyes
and just enjoy the ride.
End chorus

I remember last year
I told myself I'd take every
picture and chance.
Like each day was my last.
It's easy saying things like that,
but life has got a way of
distracting your dreams,
and handing you worries.
I'm not about to let that happen.
Call me drastic
and old fashioned.

I think it's time that we set our sights on the here and now.
Baby, sittin' here talking 'bout it really doesn't count.
Can we slow down, just take our time.
Close our eyes
and just enjoy the ride.

Repeat chorus

Just enjoy the ride.---Lyrics submitted by Lori Moss.
