I don't know what to do,
but stare into space.
Wish I could shut my eyes,
I used to sleep at night.
I used to feel safe
but now I'm terrified.
So take away
this darkness in the air.
It's like a black flames
are everywhere.
Someone say
there's hope on the way.

Chorus:
Oh can you shake it down on the sea
and rain down the water.
Make it count,
can't you see our hearts are breaking harder.
Rain down, rain down the water.
Rain down, rain down the water.
Have you heard us screamin' out?
We're burning the harbor.
End Chorus

We took a holy place,
we taught it violence.
Called it efficiency.
We've seen the hell it creates,
but we've chosen silence,
and kept it viciously.
So take away
this darkness in the air.
It's like a black flames
are everywhere.
Someone say
there's hope on the way.

Repeat chorus

Maybe we need a second chance
Maybe it's out of our hands.
Maybe it's time we take a stand.
