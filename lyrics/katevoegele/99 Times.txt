So, you see
You've got me back again for more
And it seems
Your song is in my head
This is war
Mystery; how I could feel you breathe me

I was sure you would keep
Every promise; you would keep
Every word

Well,
I try to put your stories in line
But nothing adds up right

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
And you're not invited

Its a shame
That you left me hanging like you did
It was brave
But it was much more foolish
Don't you think?
Cause you know I wont be satisfied
Until you realize

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
And you're not invited

These things are oh, all so typical
These things are unforgivable
I'm gone and you're invisible now
Don't let me catch you followin'
Don't ask, cause I'm not offering
You've caused enough of my suffering, oh

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
And you're not invited
