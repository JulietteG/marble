Pretty girls, they have it easy
Living the strawberry kiwi life, ah

And me, I just fill up on coffee
And let the caffeine do the talking, ah

I'll always miss you and I'll always wish you'd been mine

If I was an English teacher
I probably could get you to dance with me

Cause Robert Frost is in your wallet
The road less whatever you call it, ah

I'll always miss you and I'll always wish you'd been mine

And love I'm afraid
That after tonight
There won't be a way
To see you
But for the sake
Of our storyline
I'll wait a day to break
The bad news

So I'll buy myself a cheap apartment
And I'll buy my heart a secret compartment ah, yeah

And when your memory starts to surface
I'll toast to mistakes made on purpose, yeah

I'll always miss you and I'll always wish you'd been mine

It takes an idealist to know one
And me and you we've had that going for us, yeah

And we the dreamers chase forever
So at least in that we'll be together, oh
I guess
Well I'll always miss you and I'll always wish you'd been mine
Yeah I'll always miss you and I'll always wish you'd been mine---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
