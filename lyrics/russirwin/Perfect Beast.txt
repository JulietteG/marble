Could you build the perfect beast?	
To make my life complete
Strong as any man 
But gentle like a lamb
A little lamb 
A little lamb

He would tell my friends hello 
He would come to every show
He would get me in the zone 
And adjust my microphone
My microphone 
Into the zone

He would drive me when Im drunk 
He could help me find the funk 
He could take this silly song 
And move it right along
Move it right along 
Yes let's move on

(Mmm)
Could you build the perfect beast 
(Mmm)
Could you build it piece by piece 
(Mmm)
Dont tell the animal police
The animal police might take my beast

No, no, no 
Dont take my beast 
(No, no, no, ahh)

Cause he helps me keep it real 
Gives me my sex appeal 
He could be my sounding board 
To change that minor chord 
That minor chord 
To a major chord

On tour he would tag along 
And help me with my songs 
He would write my only hit 
But wed fight over the split 
Over the split 
Oh to hell with it

(Mmm)
Could you build the perfect beast 
(Mmm)
Could you build it piece by piece 
(Mmm)
Dont tell the animal police
The animal police might take my beast
The animal police might take my beast

(No, no, no)
Don't take my beast
(No, no, no, ahh)---Lyrics submitted by Tristan Arnold.
