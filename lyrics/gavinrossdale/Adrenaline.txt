You don't Feel The Pain

Too much is not enough
nobody said this stuff
makes any sense
we're hooked again.

Point of no return
see how the buildings burn 
light up the night
such a pretty sight

Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
wilder than your wildest dreams
when you're going to extremes
it takes Adrenaline

You don't Feel The Pain

Sail through an empty night
It's only you and i 
who understand
there is no plan

Get closer to the thrill
only time will kill
what's in your eyes
is so alive

Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
wilder than your wildest dreams
when you're going to extremes
it takes Adrenaline

Run through the speed of sound
everything slows you down
and ill color that surrounds you
are bleeding to the walls

all the things you really need
just wait to find the speed
then you will achieve
escape velocity

Too much is not enough
nobody gave it up
I'm not the kind
to lay down and die

Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
wilder than your wildest dreams
when you're going to extremes
it takes Adrenaline

Adrenaline screaming out your name
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
wilder than your wildest dreams
when you're going to extremes
it takes Adrenaline

You don't even feel pain
You don't even feel pain
I'm going to extremes
There is nothing in between

You don't even feel pain
You don't even feel pain
I'm going to extremes (you don't even feel pain)
And I'm going to extremes
There is nothing in between

There is nothing in between
And I'm going to extremes
And I'm going to extremes
There is nothing in between

You don't even feel pain (feel pain feel pain...)---Lyrics submitted by Piyush.
