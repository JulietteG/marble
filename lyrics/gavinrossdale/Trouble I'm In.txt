Who do you lie between
Who has your love
You give it like poppy seed
You flow in the blood

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't want to see you crying
I don't want an all out war
You got soul that's dying again and again
You gotta let me in
You gotta let me in
She's under my skin
She's under my skin

Not looking for a scientist
I don't want a lift
Not looking for a doctor
To get me fixed

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't want to see you crying
I don't want an all out war
You got soul that's dying again and again
You gotta let me in
You gotta let me in
She's under my skin
She's under my skin
All the trouble I'm in (x4)

All eyes are  watching me
I'm a stranger in this town
I must have lost my way
Since I took a turn awhile ago
These streets I do not know

Who do you lie between
Who has your love
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't want to see you crying
I don't want an all out war
You gotta let me in
You gotta let me in
She's under my skin
She's under my skin
All the trouble I'm in (x4)

All the trouble I'm in (x2)---Lyrics submitted by kristi.
