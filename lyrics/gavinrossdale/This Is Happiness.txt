pleasure comes in all disguises
to each their own their devices
if you need anything at all
i have a range of different advises
a treasure chest to keep you biting
adrenaline souls looking for the rush

that was my favorite new york
you are the sea so i dive in you
yeah

this is happiness
(woohoo)
dig yourself right back out
never thought it would come to this
(woohoo)
never thought we'd get so far down

last time i felt this good
she was the fire i was the wood
i love your mouth
i love all your breath

that was my favorite new york
you are the sea so i dive in you
yeah

this is happiness
(woohoo)
dig yourself right back out
never thought it would come to this
(woohoo)
never thought we'd get so far down

you make me so much better
i hope i don't make you worse
i'll meet you somewhere in there
if you get there first
where have you been

that was my favorite new york

you make me so much better
i hope i don't make you worse
i'll meet you somewhere in there
if you get there first
where have you been
where have you been
where have you been

that was my favorite new york

this is happiness
(woohoo)
this is happiness
(woohoo)
dig yourself right back out
(dig yourself right back)
dig yourself right back out

outta my mind again
outta my face again
outta my head again
outta this world again
outta the place i'm in
outta the state i'm in
outta the car i'm in
outta the skin i'm in
outta my mind again

outta my mind again
outta my mind again---Lyrics submitted by Hartanto.
