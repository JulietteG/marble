take it easy on yourself.
 take it easy on yourself. 
the silent sounds of yesterday. t
he ghost of you-dancing in the hallway
lunar to base
let's get this on
the kids have all gone mad
they've been insane all along
forever my you run
you don't deserve to get lost
soon come the waves will stop
in the still of the night
silhouettes in the half light
may your struggles all be won
lunar to base--let's get this on
the kids have gone mad
they've been insane all along
forever may you run
i'm working it till the end
i got nowhere left to go
i got so in between
didn't make it to the disco
the president's in bed
they're trying to find the king
buddha, he was busy
Jesus wasn't in
forever may you run
there is snow over the road
we'll have to wait before we go
let the heat come in
where you end i begin
low   low   low
forever may you run
you did it all to yourself---Lyrics submitted by kristi.
