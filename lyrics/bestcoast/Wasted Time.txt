On and on, I walk along
I wait for you at the end
I say what's wrong and all along
I wait for you at the end

I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time

Just wish that I had something to show for it

On my mind, all the time
I wait for you at the end
I don't have a real reason why
I wait for you at the end

I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time

Just wish that I had something to show for it

I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time

Just wish that I had something to show for it---
