I close my eyes at the end of the day
Nothing seems to be going my way
I've tried it all, I've tried it all
But my brain just wants to fall asleep

Sometimes I'm scared that I won't wake up
Maybe that's why this process seems so tough
I've tried it all, I've tried it all
But my brain just wants to fall asleep

Sleep won't ever come
Sleep won't ever come to me
Sleep won't ever come to me

I blame it on the mood, I blame it on my mood
I blame it on the world cause it can be so cruel
I've tried it all, I've tried it all
But my brain just wants to fall asleep

Sleep won't ever come
Sleep won't ever come to me
Sleep won't ever come to me

Can't you tell by the look of my face?
I don't feel like I'm floating through space

Sleep won't ever come
Sleep won't ever come to me
Sleep won't ever come to me---
