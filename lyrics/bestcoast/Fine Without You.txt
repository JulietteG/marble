Guess you spent all your life
Comparing yourself to her
Eventually you will find
There's no one like you in this world

I know it's hard
I know it's hard
I know it's hard to understand
You've got to let it go
The situation is out of your hands

If you spend all your life chasing after him
Eventually you will find
That there was nothing right
To begin with

I know it's hard
I know it's hard
I know it's hard to understand
You've got to let it go
The situation is out of your hands

Sometimes I feel like I'm forever right
I always shine
And I know I can't sing it on my own
Wondering how to be fine without you
Fine without you

If you spend your life
Wasting all of your time
Eventually you will try
It's outside of your mind

I know it's hard
I know it's hard
I know it's hard to understand
You've got to let it go
The situation is out of your hands

Sometimes I feel like I'm forever right
I always shine
And I know I can't sing it on my own
Wondering how to be fine without you
Fine without you

All of our feelings got caught
Now I can't quit
I'm not fine without you---
