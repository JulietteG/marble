Wake up, you know I feel ok
Go to sleep, it's just another day
I know, someday I'll find it
Where I, I least expect it

My doctor says that I should take it
At least I won't have to keep faking
I know, someday I'll find it
Where I, I least expect it

Today I know I feel ok
Baby look at me with those eyes of grey
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
I know it's love that's got me feeling ok

I took my own advice for once
I gave it up, I gave it up
I know someday I'll find it
Where I, I least expect it

Today I know I feel ok
Baby look at me with those eyes of grey
When I get down, I get so down
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
I know it's love that's got me feeling ok
Feeling ok, feeling ok, feeling ok, feeling ok---
