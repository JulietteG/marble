We try to get along all the time
But it's hard
I look at you, you look at me
What do you see?

We share the same cares
The same ideas
Why don't you like me?
What's with the jealousy?

We've been taught to get along,
Respect one another
And after all this time
We still fight over the small things

Girls will be girls and boy will be boys
It's just the way it is
I don't wanna hate you, I don't wanna judge you
So I'll try
So I'll try get to know you before I decide
It's just not fair

What's with the jealousy?---
