This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human

They like to drink
They like to smoke
They like to eat
And when they eat it's 'til they choke
They like to fight
They like to steal
They like to lie and cheat
And then pretend it's real

They'll turn it up and get it real loud
They like to dive right off the stage into the crowd
They want it all, then want some more
And when it's gone, it's gone and then they'll start a war

This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human
This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human

Those city lights light up the fight
They shine on all the evil things you do tonight
Don't be ashamed, it's just their way
It's how the live and not the kind of place you stay

They'll turn it up and get it real loud
They like to dive right off the stage into the crowd
They want it all, then want some more
It's a fact they say they're rotten to the core

This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human
This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human

Let's go

This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human
This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human

They live on planet
Planet Earth
They live on planet Earth
They live on planet
Planet Earth
They live on planet Earth

They'll turn it up and get it real loud
They like to dive right off the stage into the crowd
They want it all, then want some more
And when it's gone, it's gone and then they'll start a war

This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human
This is how to be
This is how to be
This is how to be a human

Like monkeys in a tree crawling from the sea
This is how to be a human

They live on planet
Planet Earth
They live on planet Earth
They live on planet
Planet Earth
They live on planet Earth---
