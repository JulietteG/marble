Chip off the block
Seems that I'm not
As good as I thought
Or as bad as you want
The line has been drawn
What side are you on?
Try to do it right
But everything is wrong

And so I stare at
The dregs of the earth
Clear blue skies
To the deepest of dirt
With hands stretched out
Looking pious and pure
To the ten padlocks
Strapped on your front door

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
But can you tell
One from the next?
Can you go down from zero?

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
All lined up
From the east to the west
Black hat born or an 'S' on your chest

Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now

(Go! Yeah! Come on!)

Who got in your head?
Who told you those things?
You better put 'em up
When you hear the bell ring
Seeing things clear
In the blackest of night
And sometimes the good guys
They dont wear white

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
But can you tell
One from the next?
Can you go down from zero?

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
All lined up
From the east to the west
Black hat born or an 'S' on your chest

(That's right, that's right
Now check this out)

Gangsters and mobs
With itchy trigger fingers
Do-gooder knights
Or some love song singers
They all got their rules, man,
Are trades of the trick
But give 'em one chance and
I swear they'll all switch

(Put your hands up in the air, let me see you tonight))

Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
But can you tell
One from the next?
Can you go down from zero?

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
All lined up
From the east to the west
Black hat born or an 'S' on your chest---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
