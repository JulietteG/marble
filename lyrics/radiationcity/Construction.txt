Here is all that i have
Its not enough
Now looking back i can tell
It never was 
And never would be

All that you have
Has now fallen down on me
Like the bees that have stung endlessly

Ooh-ohh
Ooh-ooh,oo-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh,ooh,ooh
Ooh-ooh

Decide right now
To take your wooden pitchy heart
Apart
And only you would let this city
Feed you its babies

Feeling all of this now
Is not so bad
I might never be the same 
As when you first met me
But i'll always be true

I will never go away
From you
Oh, woah, oh

Ooh-ohh
Ooh-ooh,oo-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh,ooh,ooh
Ooh-ooh

Decide (ooh, hoo) 
Right now
To take your wooden pitchy heart apart
Ooh, ooh
This'll be (the only you)
This'll be-e (the only you)
Oh-oo-oo
This'll be (the only you)
Oh, oh, oo, oo, oo, oo
Oh x9---Lyrics submitted by gabby miller.
