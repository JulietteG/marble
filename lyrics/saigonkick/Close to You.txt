Well my little baby
I'm gonna get so close to you
I'd walk a hundred thousand miles
Just to get you into view
Well my little darling
When I see you I het hot
I'd lay upon the red fire coals 
Just to see all you got

Well my little darling
I'm gonna get so close to you
Well my little baby
I'm gonna make my dreams come true

When I was a boy
I used to dream about you
You used to tease me so
I would really come unglued

Well my little darling
I'm gonna get so close to you
Well my little baby
I'm gonna make my dreams come true

When you're all alone you know
I'm not that hard to find
When I am in need
You are divine

I have searched both high and low
All beneath the desert moon
I've suffered so it's left me
Feeling quite like the loon

Well my little darling
I'm gonna get so close to you
Well my little baby
I'm gonna make my dreams come true

I'm gonna get so close to you
I'm gonna get so close to you
I'm gonna get so close to you---Lyrics submitted by Kristy.
