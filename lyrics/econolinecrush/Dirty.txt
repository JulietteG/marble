I see the walk
I hear the talk
I watch the moves, man
I know the lay of the land

I see the smile
After a while
There's no illusions
That girl is nothing but bad

She's all I'll ever want
She's all I'll ever need
Decadence in a little black dress, uh-huh

She is dirty
She is dirty

Once in her web
[wake???] dead under the spell now
Sometimes a man just can't [fight???]

I take one look
And I am hooked
She makes me reckless
She is the perfect disease

She's all I'll ever want (want her)
She's all I'll ever need (yeah-ah)
Decedance in a little black dress, uh-huh

She is dirty
She is dirty
Oww-wow-howw
She is dirty
She is dirty

I see the walk
I hear the talk
I watch the moves, man
I know the lay of the land

I see the smile
After a while
There's no illusions
That girl is nothing but bad

She is dirty
Oww-wow-howw oww-wow-howw yeah
She is dirty
Oww-wow-howw oww-wow-howw yeah

She is dirty
Oww-wow-howw oww-wow-howw yeah
She is dirty
Yeah-hah yeah

She is dirty (I want her)
Yeah-hah yeah
She is dirty (I want her)
Yeah-hah yeah

She is dirty (I want her)
yeah-hah yeah-hah yeah
She is dirty (I want her)
Dirty, dirty, oww-how yeah-ah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Myra.
