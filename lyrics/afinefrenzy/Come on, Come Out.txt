Come on, come out
The weather is warm
Come on, come out
Said come on, come on

A spot in the shade
Where oranges fall
A spot in the shade
Away from it all

Watching the sky
Watching a painting coming to life
Shifting and shaping
Staying inside
It all goes, it all goes by

A blanket unfolds
A blanket tonight
The pieces of gold
They light up your eyes
Now we're alone
Now we're alive

Watching the sky
Watching the painting come to life
Shifting and shaping
Staying inside
It all goes it all goes it all goes by

Stopping the time
Rushing, waiting
Leave it behind
Shifting and shaping
Keep it inside
It all goes it all goes it all goes by
It all goes passing by
It all goes passing by---Lyrics submitted by Ruby.
