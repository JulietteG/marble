thick as thieves
the last of leaves
in the winter sun
holding fast 
this freezing branch
is home to us

step, step right over the line 
and onto borrowed time
when its life, not waiting to die
waiting to divide to divide

counting stars 
and passing cars 
on the interstate
the end is near 
I feel it dear, 
but I am not afraid

step, step right over the line 
and onto borrowed time
when its life, not waiting to die
waiting to divide 
to divide

but you say youre getting tired
youre tired and so am I 
when you fall Ill fall behind

step, step right over the line 
onto borrowed time
when its life, not waiting to die
waiting to divide to divide
but you say youre getting tired
youre tired and so am I 
when you fall 
Ill fall behind---Lyrics submitted by Nuwong.
