somethings causing feet to fly,
rising like a dark knight 
in silence
traffics slow with broken boats 
heading for the sea 
and Im an island

I watched you disappear into the clouds
swept away into another town

the world carries on without you
but nothing remains the same
Ill be lost without you
until the last of days

the sun is in the east,
rising for the beasts 
and the beauties
if only I could tear it down, 
plant it in the ground to warm your face

I built myself a castle on the beach
watching as it slid into the sea

the world carries on without you
but nothing remains the same
Ill be lost without you
until the last of days
until the last of days

through wars and harvest moons
I will wait for you.
the world carries on without you
but nothing remains the same
Ill be lost without you
until the last of days
until the last of days---Lyrics submitted by Nuwong.
