Theres snow on your collar
And boy, theres snow on the bench.
Theres snow on the sleeping grain
And the crooked fence.

And if youve been cryin
With my hand on my chest
I swear, Ill never tell.

The town is a glow with lights,
A caroler sings.
Your sister wont sleep tonight
For the morning creeps.

That old happy Christmas
You came here to find it,
I did as well.

For joy doesnt come in boxes,
Nor peace in a heavy watch.
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught,
But the search it never stops.

The son of a holy man
You dream of the saints,
So thin with your poet hands
And your eyes aflame.

And Id like to kiss you,
Full on the mouth,
I dont care if you tell.

For love doesnt come in boxes,
Nor truth in a crowded shop.
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught,
But the search it never stops.

For faith doesnt come in boxes,
Nor God in a silver cross.
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught.

But the search goes on and on,
The search, it never stops.---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
