You say your time has come
You're tired of waking up
Don't be obscene, I can't conceive of living without you

You say you drag me down
No one should want you now
I start to cry, you kiss my eyes and say i'm not allowed to

Burning beacon in the night
Can't feel its heat, or see its light
That single solitary guide, it must get lonely there sometimes

You were a child forgot
Lessons of love untaught
Now no embrace can quite replace
the one that never found you
I was raised tenderly
All that was taught to me
I will apply, your parents tried but they didn't know how to

burning beacon in the night
Can't feel its heat, or see its light
That single solitary guide, it must get lonely there sometimes
Let me stand by you
The honor is mine
Let me stand by you
Loneliest light, loneliest light, loneliest light---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
