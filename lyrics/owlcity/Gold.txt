[VERSE 1]
Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there, and it's showing
There's no need to look around
You're the best we've got going

Shoutout to the dreams you'll chase
Shoutout to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you now
I guess you better be goin'

[PRE CHORUS]
You'll never be far, I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart, you're here
Go on, it's about to be time
You're starting to shine

[CHORUS]
'Cause what you got is
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night,
I found my treasure.
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.

[VERSE 2]
It wont take you long to get
When you feel like you're soarin'
So write it all and don't forget
You gotta tell us your story

Shoutout to the friends back home
Shoutout to hearts you've known
You gave 'em nothing but the best
Yeah, and you can tell 'em your story

[PRE CHORUS]
You'll never be far, I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart, you're here
Go on, it's about to be time
You're starting to shine

[CHORUS]
'Cause what you got is
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night,
I found my treasure.
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.

[CHORUS]
'Cause what you got is
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night,
I found my treasure.
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old,
I know, You're gold.

You're gold
You're gold---
