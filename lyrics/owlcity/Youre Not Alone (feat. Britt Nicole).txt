Some days I barely hold on
When life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my spirit is weak
You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul

Im lost without You
Ill never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer

You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
Ill never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
Youre not alone!
Youre not alone!

Some days I just cant go on
I stumble and fall
And I hang my head
But You reach out for my hand
And You lift me up
Again and again
Oh, yes, You do

Im lost without You
Ill never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer
You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
Ill never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
Youre not alone!
Youre not alone!

In the face of my depravity

For God so loved the world He died for me
Yeah

My fire burns til He returns
And takes me home beyond the galaxy

You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity

All eternity!

Ill never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
Youre not alone!
Youre not alone!

Youre not
Youre not alone
Never alone...---
