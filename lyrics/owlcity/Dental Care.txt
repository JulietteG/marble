I brush my teeth 
And look in the mirror
And laugh out loud 
As I'm beaming from ear to ear
I'd rather pick flowers 
Instead of fights
And rather than flaunt my style
I'd flash you a smile
Of clean pearly whites
I've been to the dentist 
A thousand times
So I know the drill
I smooth my hair
Sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills
Have a seat he says pleasantly
As he shakes my hand
And practically laughs at me
Open up nice and wide
He says, peering in
And with a smirk he says
Don't have a fit this will just pinch a bit
As he tries not to grin 
When hygenists leave on long vacations
That's when dentists scream 
And lose their patience
Talking only brings the toothaches on
Because I say the stupidest things
So if my resolve goes south
I'll swallow my pride
With an aspirin
And shut my mouth
Golf and alcohol don't mix
And that's why I don't drink and drive
Because good grief
I'd knock out my teeth
And have to kiss my smile goodbye
I've been to the dentist a thousand times
So I know the drill
I smooth my hair 
Sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
