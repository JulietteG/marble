Breath and I'll carry you away,
Into the velvet sky,
And we'll stir the stars around.
And watch them fall away,
Into the hudson bay,
And plummet out of sight and sound.
The open summer breeze, 
Will sweep you through the hills,
Where I live in the alpine heights.
Below the northern lights,
I spend my coldest nights,
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love.

Home, among these mountain tops,
Can be so awfully dull.
A thousand miles from the tide.
Put photos on the walls,
Of new york shopping malls.
Distract me so I stay inside.
I wish the rocket stayed,
Over the promenade.
'Cuz I would make a hook and eye.
And fish them from the sky.
My darling she and I,
Were hanging on, so take us high,
To sing the world goodbye.

I am floating away,
Lost in a silent ballet.
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue,
And I am right beside you.
A way to take in the view.
Late nights and early parades.
Still photos and noisy arcades.
My darling we're both on the wing,
Look down and keep on singing.
We can go anywhere.

Are you there?...(x5)
Or are you just a decoy dream,
In my head?

Am I hung,
Or am I simply
Tumbling all alone?

I am floating away, (Floating away)
Lost in a silent ballet. (Silent ballet)
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue,
And I am right beside you. (I'm right beside you)
Away to take in the view. (View)
Late nights and early parades. (Early parades)
Still photos and noisy arcades. (Noisy arcades)
My darling we're both on the wing,
Look down and keep on singing. (Look down and keep on singing)
We can go anywhere. (We can go anywhere)

Are you there?...(x5)---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
