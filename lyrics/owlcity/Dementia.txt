(Dementia you're driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)
(Dementia, Dementia)

Every light in the night flickered in and out
Every bone in my back shivered up and down
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Every voice in my head shouted yes and no
Every freight train of thought fought to stop and go
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, I'm a star in the summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy

Every tear in my eyes dripped and wouldn't drop
Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Every hand let me go that I tried to hold
Every warm-hearted love left me freezing cold
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

[Chorus]

(Dementia, you're driving me crazy)
(Dementia, you're driving me crazy)

This is driving me crazy
(You're driving me crazy)
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, I'm a star in the summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, Dementia

Through the skies you're en-route at the speed of light
So realize there's chaos in the air tonight
This is love, this is war, this is pure insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy

This is driving me crazy
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
'Cause this is driving me crazy
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
(This is driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)
