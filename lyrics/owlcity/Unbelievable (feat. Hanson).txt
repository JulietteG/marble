It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate "Spaghetti Os", played laser tag and GI Joe's
And if you vowed no girls allowed then you could join the club
When I was I was a kid I spent my Saturday's
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King and I could feel the love

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Hanson:]
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees and Dr Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of "Jurassic Park" was how real the Raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, Zack Morrison, the first cell phone, it was off the hook!

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

Cat, pogs, and floam and home alone, Berenstein bears and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-sketch
What happens next?
Grape juicy juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip-n-slides, McDonalds Fries, those were the best
What happens next?

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

Its unbelievable
When I think back on my name
Its unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
Its unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
Its unbelievable, its unbelievable

(And Im so amazed!)
(Those were the days!)---
