Wonder if I gave an Oreo to the Big Bad Wolf,
How would the story go?
Would he still go huff and puff?
Or would he bring those pigs cool stuff?
To decorate the deck he helped them build,
Would they not get killed?

Wonder if I gave an Oreo to a vampire
In a creepy show,
Would he not act so undead?
Would he thirst for milk instead?
Ive just got this feeling that it might work out all right. 

Cause cream does wondrous things inside a chocolate sandwich dream.

If I gave em to great white sharks, 
Would they share em with baby seals?
Would they call up a giant squid for a friendly meal?
Wonder if I gave an Oreo
Wonder if I gave an Oreo
What if I gave an Oreo to you?---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
