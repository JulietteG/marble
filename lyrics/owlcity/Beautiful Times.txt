(feat. Lindsey Stirling)

The sparks soaring down
Through love pouring rain
And restoring life to the lighthouse

The slow-motion wave
On the ocean stirs
My emotion up like a rain cloud

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to sky diver
Then to survivor
Dying to break down.

A blood brother, surrogate mother
Hugging each other
Crying their eyes out.

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

I'm ecstatic
Like a drug addict
Locked in the attic strung out and spellbound

I fought all through the night
Oh oh, but I made it alive
The sun starting to rise
Oh oh, these are beautiful times
This fight my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh oh, these are beautiful times

The bad feeling burns
Through the ceiling
Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A dead fire rose
And rose higher
Like a vampire up from the graveyard

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

We all suffer
But we recover
Just to discover life where we all are

I fought all through the night
Oh oh, but I made it alive
The sun starting to rise
Oh oh, these are beautiful times
This fight my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh oh, these are beautiful times

This fight my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh oh, these are beautiful times

My heart's burning bad
And it's turning black
And I'm learning how to be stronger
And sincerely I
Love you dearly
Oh but I'm clearly destined the wonder.---
