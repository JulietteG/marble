I'm tired of waking up in tears,
'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain;
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain.

The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I'm sick of the past I can't erase,
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace,
The mountains of things that I still regret,
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
(No matter where I go)

The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go

I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever love again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home
I watch the summer stars to lead me home---Lyrics submitted by Matteo Pianezzola.
