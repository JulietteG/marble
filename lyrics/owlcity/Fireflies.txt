You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world
As I fell asleep
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say
That I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

Cause I get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say 
That I'd rather stay awake 
When I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
Cause I feel like such a insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
We'd all know where several are
If my dreams get real bazaar
Cause I saved a few
And I keep them in a jar

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say
That I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say
That I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

(When I fall asleep)

I's like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say
That I'd rather stay awake 
When I'm asleep

Because my dreams 
Are bursting
At the seams---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
