(First Verse)
June was the lobster shell I dug by hand
A haven that hid me well beneath the sand
The white windy waves washed in, but I stayed dry
The great breakers broke again as I nodded off inside

(Chorus)
And then, when the empress ran aground and my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound and thats when it became a dream
When the sky fell in when the hurricanes came for me 
I could finally crash again, and thats how I became the sea

(Second Verse)
I wrenched the engines off and dragged them down
The depths turned the iron soft as they swiftly drowned
And I brought the ocean side to its rusty knees
As I felt the even tide deepen my shallow dreams.

(Chorus)

(Conclusion)
When the sky fell in when the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again, and thats how I became the sea
Thats how I became the sea
Thats how I became the sea---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
