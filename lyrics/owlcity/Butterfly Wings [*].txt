If i was a raindrop
You'd be my thunderstorm
Its cold so surround me
With rain clouds to keep me warm
I feel like im falling
So darling don't let me go
The thought is appalling but should I slip away 
Into the stormy see will you remember me

Asleep in a warm cacoon
We dream of lovely things
Were both gonna wake up soon
So we hope that tomorrow brings 
Us our butterfly wings

If i was a grain of sand
Would you be Miami Beach
So dusty with starlight
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me
I'll try not to wake you
We'll make a sound while your dosing off
But in the night shift the hide tides sweep me away from you
Tell me again my dear will you be waiting here

Whenever we leave the ground
And take to the sky
I'll smilie as im gazing down
Cause I've always wonder why we won't need feathers to fly---Lyrics submitted by Miguel.
