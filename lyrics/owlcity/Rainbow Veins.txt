High rise, veins of the avenue
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you
Street lights glisten on the boulevard
And cold nights make staying alert so hard

For heavens sake, keep me awake so I wont be caught off guard
Clearly I am a passerby but Ill find a place to stay
Dear pacific day, wont you take me away?
Small town hearts of the New Year
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear

City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
With new taste for speed, out on the street
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
The feeling of letting go, I guess well never know

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And Ill blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of color and we shouldve known
That wed grow up sooner or later 'cause we wasted all our free time alone

Your nerves gather with the altitude
Exhale the stress so you dont come unglued
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway

The high tide could take me so far away
VCRs and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age
'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align

We were the crashing whitecaps
On the ocean (on the ocean, on the ocean)
And what lovely seaside holiday, away.

A palm tree in Christmas lights
My emotion (my emotion, my emotion)
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
As we spent the day alone

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And Ill blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of color and we shouldve known
That wed grow up sooner or later 'cause we wasted all our free time alone---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
