Toupee or Not toupee, that is the question
It refused to stay as it all turned gray
A William Shakespeare's receding hair
Please excuse the pun it's hair today, gone tomorrow
So be thankful for what precious locks you have

Toupee or Not toupee that is the question
And, by the way, I just gotta say thank the lord I'm not going bald
And, if i may quip, my curls and I are just like heaven
Cause rest assured there'll be no parting there
But should my head get bare, like fire tuck, hard chase to swallow
It makes me smile
Cause I know just what I'd do

Yeah, if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with
I'd open a second-hand store
And if you ever went wrong, you'd recall it
Cause I'd cleverly call it Rugs From Me to You.---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
