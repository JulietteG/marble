VERSE: 
You said 
Forget about Francesca 
You'll always reign supreme 
You just been spending time 
To pimp your self-esteem 

What is it with you 
Silly silly man 
Once you had a sweetheart 
That would have done all she can 

Now you're fucking her 
Lie around in her bed 
But i'm the sweetest gone mama 
You ever gonna get 

CHORUS: 
So don't say I didn't 
I told you so, I told you so, I told you so 
You kept wishing I was her 
I'm afraid we don't concur 

And don't say I didn't 
I told you so, I told you so, I told you so 
What am I supposed to play 
Gotta mean just what you say 

VERSE: 
Memories keep calling 
But I refuse to fall 
Back to where we started 
You never knew me at all 

Never met a man 
That could lie as good as you 
I just wonder how she got you 
And what she'll put you through 

Now you're fucking her 
And I hope you're satisfied 
You been busy for a while now 
Watch my senses die
