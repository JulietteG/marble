You ask me out bout your upcoming tattoo-I couldnt care less.
You ask me if I like your new shoes-I couldnt care less.
And everyone loves your new girlfriend, well, according to you.
But when I tell you bout this guy I met, suddenly you get upset
Monsieur would rather change the topic if its not all about you.

Oh shut up I couldnt care less
I want to kick your ass
wearing ten-centimeter heels
Please shut up I couldnt care less
Why, why, why dont you have your own ideals?

You mention names from people I dont know
so that I couldnt care less
You saw this concert and that show- I couldnt care less
Youre not talking big, no, so why dont I care a bit more?
Why dyou admire all these people not worth to care for?
I see the things a bit different: youre a would-be, shes a whore

So shut up I couldnt care less
I want to kick your ass
wearing ten-centimeter heels
Please shut up I couldnt care less
Why, why, why dont you have your own ideals?

And now youre thinking why Im writing this song then
Well Im just running out of ideas

But I couldnt care less
Why dont you have your own ideals
Oh shut up I couldnt care less
I want to kick your ass
wearing ten-centimeter heels
Please shut up I couldnt care less
Why, why, why dont you have your own ideals?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
