See that man dressed in black
 Pass him by don't look back
 Keep in a line and walk straight ahead
 One false move could be dead

 'Cos he's an underground undercover agent for the CID
 CID, CID
 Got a loaded 44
 Walking armoury store

 Take a tip and hear what I say
 Don't take no trip down Soho way
 If you do you better keep in a line
 Make one false move could be doing time

 'Cos he's an underground undercover agent for the CID
 CID, CID
 Got a loaded 44
 Walking armoury store

 Watch it

 Take a tip and hear what I say
 Don't take no trip down Soho way
 If you do you better keep in a line
 Make one false move could be doing time

 'Cos he's an underground undercover agent for the CID
 CID, CID
 Got a loaded 44
 Walking armoury store---Lyrics submitted by Tony Bown.
