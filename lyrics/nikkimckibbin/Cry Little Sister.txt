Last fire will rise
Behind those eyes
Black house will rock
Blind boys don't lie

Immortal fear
That voice so clear
Through broken walls
That scream I hear

Cry, little sister (Thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (Thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (Thou shall not fear)
Love is with your brother (Thou shall not kill)

Blue masquerade
Strangers look on
When will they learn
This loneliness?

Temptation heat
Beats like a drum
Deep in your veins

I will not lie to little sister (Thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (Thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (Thou shall not fear)
Love is with your brother (Thou shall not kill)

My Shangri-la
I can't forget
Why you were mine
I need you now

Cry, little sister (Thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (Thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (Thou shall not fear)
Love is with your brother (Thou shall not kill)

Cry, little sister (Thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (Thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (Thou shall not fear)
Love is with your brother (Thou shall not kill)

Cry...little sister...---Lyrics submitted by Brianna Sixx.
