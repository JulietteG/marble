Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should've said and done
I just never took the time

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied

If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind(3x)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
