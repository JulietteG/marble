Holidays are coming .. 
Love for everyone 
Lalalalala lalala lala 
Love is the reason its always the real thing 

When the world is ever changing 
Light a candle in the dark 
Theres a source of inspiration in the air 
Let the magic dry your tears and heal your heart 

Chorus: 
A wonderful dream of love and peace for everyone 
Of living our lifes in perfect harmony 
A wonderful dream of joy and fun for everyone 
To celebrate a life where all are free 

Watch out look around 
Somethings coming coming to town 
Coming to your town 
Love is the real thing 

Now the childrens eyes are shining 
Like they never shown before 
Let their dreams and aspirations light our way 
Living life in harmony forever more 
Chorus:

Lalalalala lalala lala 
Holidays are coming ... 
Celebrate a life where dreams come true 
Love is the reason its always the real thing 
Watch out look around 
Celebrate a life thats free 
Watch out look around 
Love is coming feel it all around 
Watch out look around 
Love is coming feel it all around 
Watch out look around 
Feel the love this wonderful dream 

Lalalalala lalala lala 
Lalalalala lalala lala 
Celebrate a life where dreams come true 
Loves the reason its always the real thing---Lyrics submitted by Mirka.
