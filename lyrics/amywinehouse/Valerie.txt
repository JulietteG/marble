well, sometimes i go out by myself
and i look across the water
and i think of all the things, what you're doing
and in my head i paint a picture

'cause since i've come on home
well, my body's been a mess
and i've missed your ginger hair
and the way you like to dress

won't you come on over 
stop makin' a fool out of me 
why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

did you have to go to jail
put your house up for sale
did you get a good lawyer

hope you didn't catch a tan
hope you find the right man
who'll fix it for you 

are you shopping anywhere
changed the color of your hair
are you busy

and did you pay that fine
you was dodging all the time
are you still busy 

since i've come on home
well, my body's been a mess
and i've missed your ginger hair
and the way you like to dress

won't you come on over Valerie
stop makin' a fool out of me 
why don't you come on over Valerie
Valerie, Valerie,Valerie

well i sometimes go out by myself
and i look across the water
and i think of all the things, what your doing 
and in my head i paint a picture

cause since i've come on home 
well, my body's been a mess
and i've missed your ginger hair
and the way you like to dress

wont you come on over Valerie
stpo makin a fool out of me
why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

won't you come on over Valerie---Lyrics submitted by kat.
