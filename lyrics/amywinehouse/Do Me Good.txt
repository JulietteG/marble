Got back together with my man last night 
But I think I was dreaming, he didnt feel quite right 
I pressed his chest under my fingertips 
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips 

I'm confused and quizical 
Funny want you now 
I just wan get physical 
Let me tell ya how 

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear 
Do me good do me good do me good do me good 
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear 
Do me good do me good do me good do me good

Its like he was designed with me in mind 
Hes so brought from behind 
Hes beautifully defined 
I miss him most of all when it got late 
Attempt to hear him breathing 
Or feel his shifting weight 

Though I'm confused and quizical 
Funny wontcha know 
I just wan get physical 
Let me tell ya how 

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear 
Do me good do me good do me good do me good 
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear 
Do me good do me good do me good do me good---Lyrics submitted by Aline.
