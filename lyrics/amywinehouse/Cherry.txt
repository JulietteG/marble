Her name is Cherry , we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after 18 years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If u was made of wood and strings
well i love every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

And u're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts u to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry there 
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and u don't care
You won't call me back, u're stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could 'bout things
If u was made of wood and strings
You might think I 've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar---Lyrics submitted by theresa.
