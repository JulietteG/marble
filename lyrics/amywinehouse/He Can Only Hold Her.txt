Wooooo OooooOoo 
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no ones home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks 'What's she running from?'

CHORUS
Now how can he have her heart, when it got stoned?
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with her decisions
So she kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be

CHORUS

So he tries to pacify her 
But what's inside her it never dies No
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies---Lyrics submitted by Natasha Jenkins.
