All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we know
And this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right when we were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
I dont know why I got so attached
Its my responsibility and you dont owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I dont understand, why do I stress the man
When theres so many better things at hand
We could a never had it all, we had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stop wanting you, a perspective pushes through
Ill be some next mans other woman soon
I cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friend
Not **** myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could sing no regrets and no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im gone
And in your way my blue shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry---Lyrics submitted by Kara.
