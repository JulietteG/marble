Our families are weird machines
There's too many parts to tape back together before you turn 18
You shake because your not ready
But fear comes back for more
Be a light in their darkness, be a glow on the shore.
He'll turn it around

Chorus: A new fire lit in you
A new fire circles this room
And may you never be afraid of your faith in
A new fire lit in you
A new fire circles this room
And may you never be afraid of your father.

Families are a precious thing
There's too many hearts to break all at once before you turn 23
You scream because you weren't honest
You left cause you were wrong
I pray for grace in your decisions and hope you wont be gone too long
He'll turn it around
Come back to us god
I swear he'll turn it around

Chorus

Take, take that knife from your neck
Take that knife from your neck
