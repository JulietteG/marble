Sometimes its hard, but try and youll make it, believe you me.
In order to achieve, go forth and take it, set yourself free
With, obstacles in the way you may fall before you rise
But if yuh really want good yuh nose affi run, so get up and keep your eyes on the prize

And as part of yuh plan yuh fi have ambition
Have the almighty one as your foundation
hey, Nobodda get rich and switch caz dat is definitely wrong
Mi a beg unnuh dont forget yuh friends and where yuh come from

if yuh a tief tief remember God naw sleep
and although yuh rob a man and yuh get weh last week
yuh ago laugh outta street but yuh beaten gwine steep
caz God annuh silent river and jah know him run deep

throughout history lots of great men and women
went about things the old fashion way 
they just kept on winning and winning.


So strive, step up in life and go for what you know
Youve got to strive 
Remove the doubt from out your mind and let good flow.

Be not move by slight remarks from people who think theyre witty
Keep moving on mind got to be strong and dont indulge in self pity

but strive, step up in life and go for what you know
Youve got to strive 
Remove the doubt from out your mind and let good flow.

With obstacles in the way
You may fall before you rise
But if you really want good yuh nose affi run 
So get up and keep your eyes on the prize

So strive, step up in life and go for what you know
You've got to strive 
Remove the doubt from out your mind 
And let good flow 

Be not move by slight remarks from people who think theyre witty
Keep moving on mind got to be strong and dont indulge in self pity

but strive, step up in life and go for what you know
Youve got to strive 
Remove the doubt from out your mind and let good flow.


The race is not for the swift
But for who can endure
Its not  what you wear
But how you wear it
Its not where u live but how u live it
Mind doesnt matter what you visualize it will materialize
So striiiiiivvvvvveeee---Lyrics submitted by kayon.
