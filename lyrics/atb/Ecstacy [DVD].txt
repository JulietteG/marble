Have you ever noticed?
Like i?m not acting as i used to do before
Have you ever wondered?
Why i always keep on coming back for more

What have you done to me?
I?ll never be the same i tell you for sure
I?ll never be the same i tell you for sure
I?ll never be the same i tell you for sure

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

Not that i?m complaining
A more beautiful vision i have never seen.
If you don?t want me saying,
A life long ambition to fullfil my dreams

What have you done to me?
I?ll never be the same i tell you for sure
I?ll never be the same i tell you for sure
I?ll never be the same i tell you for sure

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
Uuhh

You really are my ecstasy
(there can be no other while we still have each other)
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
(there can be no other while we still have each other)

You really are my ecstasy
(there can be no other while we still have each other)
My real life fantasy, oh yeah
Uuuh

You really are my ecstasy
