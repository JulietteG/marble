Gravity, it takes hold of me
It takes me unwillingly away from you
Paradise, its more than a role of dice
Are we willing to pay the price
Can we be true?

For a while are we willing to really smile
Cause I cant read this borrowed style
Searching for you
As I go promise me I will know
The moment I see you so I know what to do
I know what to do
When its you, you

The light poors into my heart more
As you come into view more
Its perfect
Its all I could ask for
Beautiful
As you come into view more

For a while are we willing to really smile
Cause I cant read this borrowed style
Searching for you
And as I go promise me I will know
The moment I see you so I know what to do
I know what to do
When its you

I know what to do
When its you

The light poors into my heart more
As you come into view more
Its perfect
Its all I could ask for
Beautiful
As you come into view more

Gravity, it takes hold of me
It takes me unwillingly away from you
Paradise, its more than a role of dice
Are we willing to pay the price
Can we be true?---Lyrics submitted by Meraj.
