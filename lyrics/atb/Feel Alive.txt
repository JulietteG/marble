You`ve killed my days, my innermost
State of mind, so don`t stay close
I am back through all the highs and lows
No more belief in chemicals
So pack your things, you`d better go
There`ll be no regrets, so little do you know

I feel, I feel so alive
Meet me at the station, or maybe in another life
I feel, I feel so alive
There`ll be no more drifting back and forth in time

Another day, another life
To feed with all that I call mine
Is what it takes, so I go out tonight
Shining lights of crossing cars
An open sky, a million stars
They open up my eyes and this is just because

I feel, I feel so alive
Meet me at the station, or maybe in another life
I feel, I feel so alive
There`ll be no more drifting back and forth in time

I`ll take it slow
I feel so alive
I`ll turn back time

Another day, another life
To feed with all that I call mine
Is what it takes, so I go out tonight

I feel, I feel so alive
Meet me at the station, or maybe in another life
I feel, I feel so alive
Meet me at the station, or maybe in another life
I feel, I feel so alive
There`ll be no more drifting back and forth in tme
I feel---Lyrics submitted by Asael.
