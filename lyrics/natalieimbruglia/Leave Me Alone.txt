Leave me alone Natalie Imbruglia:

I ask you to hold me but you don't wanna to hold me
It don't work like that
I want you to love me but you don't wanna love me
I'm losing patience now

Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
Stop asking for more
I'm going home on my own
Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
I'm walking out of the door
I'll make it on my own
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone

You like me to stroke you, careful I don't choke you
Did you read my mind?
You say, "Don't be blue", is that the best you can do?
I've lost my patience now

Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
Stop asking for more
I'm going home on my own
Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
I'm walking out of the door
I'll make it on my own
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone

Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
Stop asking for more
I'm going home on my own
Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
I'm walking out of the door
I'll make it on my own

Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
Stop asking for more
I'm going home on my own
Oh, leave me alone
(Oh, leave me alone)
I'm walking out of the door
I'll make it on my own---Lyrics submitted by Ama Lewkows.
