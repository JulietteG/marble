[Verse] 
Tic, Im a bomb, turn me on, put me in the zone 
Got my hands in the sky right where they belong 
Right on the wall, falling down, Im about to blow 
Feelin right, feelin thriller, feelin every song 

[Bridge] 
I dont wanna do nothing but dance tonight 
I feel the rhythm in my blood 
Hit me with the bass and please control my mind 

[Hook x4] 
Have the DJ turn it up 
Loud loud loud la la la loud loud loud 
Dont turn it down down down 

[Verse] 
Sick, yes I meant, I admit Im out of control 
Seven days of the week, yea I live alone 
Drink, you get kissed, get your fix, get your sexy on 
Right through the lights, on the beat of my favorite song 

[Bridge] 
I dont wanna do nothing but dance tonight 
I feel the rhythm in my blood 
Hit me with the bass and please control my mind 

[Hook x4] 
Have the DJ turn it up 
Loud loud loud la la la loud loud loud 
Dont turn it down down down 

[Verse] 
Fly, flying high, through the sky 
On the beat of my favorite song 
Flying high, through the night 

[Bridge x2] 
Loud loud loud la la la loud loud loud 
Dont turn it down down down 

[Hook x3] 
Have the DJ turn it up 
Loud loud loud la la la loud loud loud 
Dont turn it down down down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
