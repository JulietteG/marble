Woke up in the morning you were gone, gone, gone
I wonder why I always take you home, home, home
Can't believe you made me wanna smile, smile, smile
Baby, 'cause I still believe that you'll be mine, mine, mine

Pa pa papa pa prrra pa papa
Gonna talk about us all over the town, town, town
Pa pa papa pa prrra pa papa
Never blame you even though you let me down

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one that's running like a hound
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

Boys are always playing silly games, games, games
If I fall, then I'm the only one to blame, blame, blame
Trouble wants to find me all the time, time, time
That's why you're never gonna see me cry, cry, cry

Pa pa papa pa prrra pa papa
Gonna talk about us all over the town, town, town
Pa pa papa pa prrra pa papa
Never blame you even though you let me down

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one that's running like a hound
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys

Came to this party looking for fun
I saw this hottie looking like a number one
He was so suave, said "baby, come"
We did that until we saw the morning sun

Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one that's running like a hound
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
You shot me with your love gun
I'm falling to the ground
Boys will be boys
They like to play around
So tell me how to love one that's running like a hound
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys ---
