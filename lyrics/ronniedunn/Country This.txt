Everybody talkin' 'bout dirt roads
Everybody talkin' like Jethro
Everybody talkin' 'bout the tall pines
Everybody runnin' on moonshine
Everybody's sayin' that "y'all" word
Thinking we're all a little backward
Everybody thinkin' they can put us in a box of grits

Well country this

Well I don't know what you call it but I sure love haulin'
Got the jukebox bumpin', got the red lights pumpin'
Got the cowgirls teasin' all the boys on the floor
Got their heads all bobbin', everybody wantin' more
If you don't like it out here in the boondocks
Give that knob a twist

Country this

Everybody talkin' that slow talk
Nothing but scarecrows and corn stocks
Out here in the city limit backside
Where the necks run a little on the red side
Everybody talkin' 'bout rhinestones
Everybody's soundin' like George Jones
Everybody from the city tryin' to tell you what country is

Well country this

Well I don't know what you call it but I sure love haulin'
Got the jukebox bumpin', got the red lights pumpin'
Got the cowgirls teasin' all the boys on the floor
Got their heads all bobbin', everybody wantin' more
If you don't like it out here in the boondocks
Give that knob a twist

And (?)
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Don't need a pickup truck
C'mon and crank it up

Well I don't know what you call it but I sure love haulin'
Got the jukebox bumpin', got the red lights pumpin'
Got the cowgirls teasin' all the boys on the floor
Got their heads all bobbin', everybody wantin' more
If you don't like it out here in the boondocks
Give that knob a twist

Country this
