Verse 1:
Sweating on a tractor in Oklahoma
Sunset in a canyon in Arizona
Midnight on the top of the Empire state
In the middle of the traffic on the Golden Gate
Standing in front of the Mona Lisa
Chilling in Cabot with a Margarita
On the roof of the Buckingham palace
On the  line in Dallas
Oh-ooo-oh, 
Oh-ooo-oh, 

Chorus:
I wanna kiss, I wanna kiss you
I wanna kiss you there
Youll never know when, Ill lay one on your lips
It could be anywhere, I wanna kiss you there
Oh-ooo-oh, 
Oh-ooo-oh, 
Oh-ooo-oh, 

Verse 2:
Top of the wheel at the fair in Ohio
Rolling in Vegas at the Grand Casino
Taking a walk on the wall of China
Lying on a beach down in Carolina
Throwing beads in the old French corner
Tijuana coffee on the Mexican border
In Atlanta cruising on 
Rockn'roll board in the music city
Oh-ooo-oh, 
Oh-ooo-oh, 

Chorus:
I wanna kiss, I wanna kiss you
I wanna kiss you there
Youll never know when, Ill lay one on your lips
It could be anywhere, I wanna kiss you there

Someday when you say yes, in a white dress
Baby looking like a rincess
Nobody and  gonna stop me
In front of God and everybody

Chorus:
I wanna kiss, I wanna kiss you
I wanna kiss you there
When you say I do, Ill lay one on you
I wanna kiss you baby
I wanna kiss you there

Chorus:
I wanna kiss, I wanna kiss you
I wanna kiss you there
Youll never know when, Ill lay one on your lips
It could be anywhere, I wanna kiss you there---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
