on my way(4 times)

i would like to reach out my hand 
how may see you 
how may tell you to run
you know what they say about the young
Well pick me up with golden hand
how may see you 
how may tell you to run
you know what they say about the young

Well I would like to hold my little hand 
How we will run we will 
How we will crawl we will 

Well I would like to hold my little hand 
How we will run we will 
How we will crawl

Send me on my way(7)

i would like to reach out my hand 
how may see you 
how may tell you to run
you know what they say about the young
Well pick me up with golden hand 
how may see you 
how may tell you to run
you know what they say about the young

Well I would like to hold my little hand 
How we will run we will 
How we will crawl we will 

Well I would like to hold my little hand 
How we will run we will 
How we will crawl

send me on my way (7 times)

Well I would like to hold my little hand 
How we will run we will 
How we will crawl we will 

Well I would like to hold my little hand 
How we will run we will 
How we will crawl

Send me on my way (5 times)

i would like to reach out my hand 
how may see you 
how may tell you to run
you know what they say about the young---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
