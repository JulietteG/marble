I would like to reach out my hand
I may see you, I may tell you to run (On my way, on my way)
You know what they say about the young.

Well pick me up with golden hand
I may see you, I may tell you to run (On my way, on my way)
You know what they say about the young.

Well, I would like to hold my little hand
And we will run, we will, we will crawl, we will
I would like to hold my little hand
And we will run, we will, we will crawl

Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Mm hmm (On my way)

I would like to reach out my hand
I may see you, I may tell you to run (On my way, on my way)
You know what they say about the young.

Now pick me up with golden hand
I may see you, I may tell you to run (On my way, on my way)
You know what they say about the young.

Well, I would like to hold my little hand
And we will run, we will, we will crawl, we will
I would like to hold my little hand
And we will run, we will, we will crawl

Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Send me on my way (On my way)
Mm hmm (On my way)

Well, I would like to hold my little hand
And we will run, we will, we will crawl, we will
I would like to hold my little hand
And we will run, we will, we will crawl

Send me on my way
Send me on my way
Send me on my way
On my way
Send me on my way
Send me on my way

I would like to reach out my hand
I may see you, I may tell you to run (On my way, on my way)
You know what they say about the young.---
