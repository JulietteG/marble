Baby, there's someone in your shirt
That's not you, my lover
You're somewhere in the dirt
And I'm the drive-by miracle
Coming to you curb-side

You sum' your garbage man
I've come to take all your misguided plans
And throw them all away
Yeah, away
We're gonna throw things out
Maybe I burn them up, just to pull you out of your fire
I'm your garbage man

(Ooh, tonight) Baby, tonight
(Ooh, tonight) Things won't come
(Ooh, tonight) Just right
To get to you there might have to be a showdown

I'm swallowed up by black holes
I'm coughing up my ancestors bones
Yeah, they're standing at attention
They're ready to rumble
Left, right
We're gonna throw things out
Maybe I burn them up
Just to pull you out of your fire
I'm your garbage man
Is this your garbage can'
I need to throw these things out
Like your misguided plans
(Garbage man) Hmm, I'm your garbage man
When you're star-lit, you're star-lit
Distant fallin' stars
You're so free here with me
But you're gonna uncapture yourself
Free, free, to uncapture yourself
We made a whole world
Put out the trash tonight
Hear me out
We made a whole world
Put out the trash tonight

(Ooh, tonight) Maybe things will go just right

I'm gonna throw these things out
Maybe I burn them up, just to pull you out of your fire

I'm your garbage man
Is this your garbage can'
I need to throw these things out
Like your misguided plans
(Garbage man) Hmm, I'm your garbage man
(Garbage man) Is this your garbage can'
(Garbage man) I need to throw these things out
(Garbage man) Like your misguided plan---
