Come and hear the funeral marchin
Maybe this is your suicide
Maybe this is more pure
Pure and simple
Maybe this is all I have for
Home, home, home, daddy

Why have all your beautiful people,
Brushed you on down, down
Brushed you on down
Whoo, home, home, home, daddy, yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Whoo, home, home, home, daddy, yeah.

I saw the shame inside your addiction.
Hatin to see what was passed on by
I saw the shame and wondered why
I should live and die.
Leave a note and tell me
Leave a note and tell me why
Leave a note and tell me
Leave a note and tell me why

Why have all your beautiful people,
Brushed you on down, down
Brushed you on down
Whoo, home, home, home, daddy, yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Hoo, hoo, daddy yeah
Whoo, home, home, home, daddy, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
