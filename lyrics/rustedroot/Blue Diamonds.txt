We go out 
On the world tonight
With our blue diamonds
That were once our fears 
Pressing down
On the town
We go out my love
Holdin all our bets
Oh my lady 
Resurrect this breath
On this hour of the night
Well make it love
Well make it love
Cause I found you now
And forever 
I wont waste this breath
That time be by our side
It now or never 
I wont waste
This breath

Now dont you wait
I feel it in my heart
Ooh my lady youre the woman I search
To roll my heart
Roll my heart this way
Hee-ey-ey-ey
Cause I found you now
And forever 
I wont waste this breath
That time be by our side
It now or never 
I wont waste
This breath


I remember a time
A little less tame
Roll my heart 
Home This way
This way

On the world tonight
With our blue diamonds
That were once our fears
Pressin down on the town
We go out my love 
Holding all our bets
Oh my lady 
Resurrect this breath
On this hour of the night
Well make it love
Well make it love
Cause I found you now
And forever 
I wont waste this breath
That time be by our side
It now or never 
I wont waste
This breath---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
