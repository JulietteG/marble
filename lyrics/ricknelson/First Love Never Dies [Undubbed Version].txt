I tried to live without you
Although I find it hard to do
I thought of yesterday
How sweet the love we shared
And I just can't forget you
`Cause first love never dies
Now I'm alone without you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
You've been a part of me
I'm lost without your love
I need you badly baby
I'm down here on my knees
First love never dies
I just wanna say
That I still love you
First love never dies
Through the years it come and go
I still will say

I love you
Now I'm alone without you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
You've been a part of me
I'm lost without your love
I need you badly baby
I'm down here on my knees
First love never dies
I just wanna say
That I still love you
First love never dies
Through the years it come and go
I still will say
First love never dies
I just wanna say
That I still love you
First love never dies
Through the years it come and go
I still will say
I love you---Lyrics submitted by edward.
