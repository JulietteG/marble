If you see my one eyed man, please send him home
If you see my one eyed man, please send him home
You see, I havent had a peaceful night since my one eyed mans been gone.

When I had that one eyed man, I didnt know just what I had
People, when I had that one eyed man, I didnt know just what I had
I used to treat him so mean, I used to treat him oh so bad
Now, I used to pick a fight just to see that eyed man cry
I used to pick a fight just to see that eyed man cry

Girl I used to think it was so funny to see him crying out one eye
One thing I can say about him that one eyed man sho looked out for me
One thing I can say about him that one eyed man sho looked out for me
He didnt believe nothing he heard and only half of what he see

But one day my one eyed man went and found him a one legged girl
Then, my one eyed man went out and found him a one legged girl
Now I dont think thats really funny cause that thing rocked my world
I dont get mad. I get even and Im too mean to cry

I dont get mad. I get even and Im too mean to cry
So I caught the two of them together and I closed his other eye
Now that girl swung her crutch at me and she was about six feet tall
That girl swung that crutch at me and she was about six feet tall
So I reached and got my two by four, now she and got no legs at all

Now everybodys wonderin about what the two of them are gonna do to me
All my friends keep wonderin about what the two of them are gonna do to me
Well Im not worried
I said Im not worried
Im not worried yeah

Cause she cant run and he cant see
Now my friends keep wonderin about what the two of them are gonna do to me
All my friends keep wonderin about what the two of them are gonna do to me

Oh but Im not worried
I said that Im not worried
Im not worried 
Cause she cant run and he cant see---Lyrics submitted by mikaela.
