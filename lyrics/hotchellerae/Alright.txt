I took a drive in the middle of the night
The first time I've done that, without you by my side
And our song was playing on the radio
It seems to follow me everywhere I go
Where I go

So would you come back in the middle of the night
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, it's alright
Without...

You here, everything is grey
The color faded when you packed your bags
And you drove away
It's hard to act like everything's the same
The closest I can get to you is in the frame
I wanna hear you say...

That you will come back in the middle of the night
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, it's alright
Were face to face while the stars are burning bright
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

And in the dark, you come to life
Memories of you and I
I wanna keep you here with me
Don't wake me up, just let me dream

Come back in the middle of the night
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, it's alright
Were face to face while the stars are burning bright
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

It'll never be alright, without you...---
