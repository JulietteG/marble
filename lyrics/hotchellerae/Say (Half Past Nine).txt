Well I've got the ticket
We're out of time
Girl, ready or not
It's a half past nine
Half Past Nine

And this city is red 
There's nothing left 
No looking back,
and no regrets
No regrets

Take my hand
This train won't wait for you
I'd do anything if I could make you 

Come away with me
And don't waste time 
Say say that you're 
leaving with me 
Say say that you're 
leaving with me tonight

Could be the night 
We'll be just fine
Say say that you're 
leaving with me
Say say say that 
you're coming with me

And let's change 
the pace
You pick the place
Make up your mind
It's Half Past Nine
Half Past Nine

Let's take a chance 
We've come this far
A motion picture
romance
The world is ours
World is ours

Take my hand 
This train won't wait for you
I'd do anything if 
I could make you 

Come away with me
And don't waste time 
Say say that you're 
leaving with me 
Say say that you're 
leaving with me tonight

Could be the night 
We'll be just fine
Say say that you're 
leaving with me
Say say say that 
you're coming with me

You're coming with
me tonight
You're coming with 
me tonight
You're coming with 
me tonight

It's now or it's 
never
I won't wait forever
I know this is right
Let's let love live 
our lives tonight

Come away with me
And don't waste time 
Say say that you're
leaving with me 
Say say that
you're coming with
me tonight

Could be the night
We'll be just fine
Say say that you're 
leaving with me
Say say say that you're 
coming with me 
Say say say that you're 
coming with me---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
