Let's get it on, yeah, y'all can come along
Everybody drinks on me, bought out the bar
Just to feel like I'm a star, now I'm thanking the academy
Missed my ride home, lost my iPhone
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say

I like it like that!
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on
I like it like that!
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
I like it like that!
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough of everybody
Sing it right back, I like it like that!
(I like it like that, I like it like that)

Till the break of the dawn, yeah, party on my lawn
Whistle as the girls walk by if the cops roll up (so what?)
Pour the cops a cup cause everybody's here tonight
Call a taxi, pack the back seat
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say

I like it like that!
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on
I like it like that!
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
I like it like that!
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough of everybody
Sing it right back, I like it like that!

Oh oh oh oh, like that
Oh oh oh oh, like that
Oh oh oh oh, sing it right back, I like it like that

Oh the homie brought the booze
I like it like that cause the girls playin' beer pong in the back
We havin' fun partying til the break of dawn
Go grab a cup I dunno what people waitin' on
And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
In the zone, where I think I had lost my phone
You can tell by looking in the party's straight crack
And don't worry 'bout it girls cause I like it like

I'm max faded at my grandma's house
And leave your clothes over there, that's grandma couch
I be filmin' her friends too, yeah I'm back on that
Double D chicks huggin', I got racks on racks
Like, I don't want the luxuries of a superstar
I'm just tryin' to chill with Miley at the hookah bar
You like cartoons? I'll make your heart melt
With the seat back, playin in the back, like

I like it like that!
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on
I like it like that!
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
I like it like that!
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough of everybody
Sing it right back, I like it like that!
[x2]

Oh oh oh oh like that
Oh oh oh oh like that...
Oh oh oh oh everybody, sing it right back, I like it like that
