Kiss me I taste him on your lips
Touch me he's on your fingertips
Don't say that you were with your friends
Your eyes lie and I'm staring into him again
I see the faces that you've seen
Kills me the way it used to be
I know that places that you've been
Your eyes lie and I'm staring into him again

When you feel the way I feel inside
you know that everything won't be alright in the end
the end of the night
and when the whole damn city knows your name 
and you know that everyone figured out your game 
You're exposed
The darkness changed to light 
when you've got nothing left to hide

The beast waits in the shadows alone
why stay here when your not coming home
tongue in check you've perfected the art
I've become the animal waiting in the dark
words dance a jester for her king
you say love but i don't feel a thing
space goes as far as i can see
I'm the animal you're the enemy

When you feel the way i feel inside 
you know that everything won't be alright in the end
the end of the night
and when the whole damn city knows your name 
and you know that everyone figured out your game
You're exposed
The darkness changed to light
when you've got nothing left to hide

When you feel the way I feel inside 
you know that everything won't be alright in the end
the end of the night
and when the whole damn city knows your name
and you know that everyone figured out your game 
You're exposed

when the darkness changed to light
when you've got nothing left to hide
and when the whole damn city knows your name
You're exposed

When you got nothing left to hide
to hide
When the darkness changed to light---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
