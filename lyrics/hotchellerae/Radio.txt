(If you miss me, like I miss you)

I stayed up till 5, last night, 
Just to say I missed you, 
Thank God for free, wi-fi, 
And the key to the mini bar, 
We fell asleep, on Skype, 
I almost missed my flight

You know that, I need ya, I'm out the door, 
Hasta la vista, one, two, three, four! 

No matter where I'm at, no matter where I go, 
I'll be singing for you on the radio, 
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh, 
You could be in Nashville, and I could be in France, 
And here's a little something just to make you dance, 
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh

Turn me up all, the way, 
Pretend I'm right beside you, 
Like we're on holiday, 
And pounding to Buck Truck, 
Yeah I've been everywhere, 
I've turned the Mona Lisa, 
And nothing, I'm seeing, 
Compares to you, 
Cause nobody does it, the way you do! 
No matter where I'm at, no matter where I go, 
I'll be singing for you on the radio, 
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh, 
You could be in Nashville, and I could be in France, 
And here's a little something just to make you dance, 
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh

If you miss me, like I miss you, 
Through the airwaves, I'ma kiss you, 
Let's g-ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh

Everywhere I go, I need ya, 
Comin' for ya, through the speakers, 
Right there on the radio, 
Even when we feel the static, 
Know our love is automatic, 
Right there on the radio

Hey turn me up, turn me up, ah ah, can you hear me?
Singing to you clearly, even when you ain't near me, 
Make love through the airways, 
I hope this song's in your head like hairspray, 
I heard your friends say I change so they'd hear say, 
They only say that when they're drunk, so that beer say, anyway, 
I wrote you this little song because I wish you were with me, 
I'm callin' up the station, requesting it in your city, girl

No matter where I'm at, no matter where I go, 
I'll be singing for you on the radio, 
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh, 
You could be in Nashville, and I could be in France, 
And here's a little something just to make you dance, 
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh

If you miss me, like I miss you, 
Through the airwaves, I'ma kiss you, 
Let's g-ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh
Radi-ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh
Let's g-ohh-oh-oh, radi-ohh-oh-oh, 
Ooohh-oo-oo, ooohh-oo-oo---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
