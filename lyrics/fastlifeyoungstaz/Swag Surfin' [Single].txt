[Intro 2x]

Man I got that swag
My hat matchin' my bag
You know about them tags
'Cause man I got that swag

[Hook]

I'm on Hpnotiq, exotic
with Polo on my body
Got a bad girl beside me
and her friend right behind me
And I'm swagin', I'm surfin'
I'm swagin', I'm surfin'
I'm swagin', I'm surfin'
I'm clean like dish detergent

On Patron yeah I'm gone
Purple by the zone
Yeah I'm smoking strong
and you know I'm on
'cause I'm swagin', I'm surfin'
I'm swagin', I'm surfin'
I'm swagin', I'm surfin'
I'm clean like dish detergent

[Verse 1]

O.K. I popped off in the club
with a pocket full of band
Bitch stupid fresh
like her wrapped up in Saran
Swag super cool 
blowing strong like a fan
Man my chain shinin' hard
it just gave my neck a tan

Pockets on Popeye
'cause it's swole off that spinach
Peace tree swag
you can call me Mr. (?)
Bottles in my hand
puttin' on till I can't hold
Surfin' on the fiends
like the (?)

[Repeat 2x]

I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
Now watch me surf and swag

[Verse 2]
Swagin' in the club
you goin' see me throwin' money up
Catch me with a bad chick
and all her friends are fine as fuck
(Tres?) we gonna pull them up
Exotic what we rollin' up
On Patron, Goose or Hennessy
They got it I'm goin a drink it up

I'm always wearing Polo
Nigga I'm Ralph Lauren's mascot
Kate on Debby
I don't hesitate to cash out
Pay (?)
the black and blue Jag out
Pockets on half time
I'm always bringin' bags out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

When I hit the club
it's like I gotta catch a wave
Biggie boy shorty
got me surfin' off the stage
Herc' got me geeked
something like a Eddie Bauer
And I'm surfin' like I'm Arnold
'cause I got that rocket power

Gone on Patron
taking shots like a camera
Flat screen shorty
Man I'm surfin' like the channels
Paper towel money
Man I'm all about my count
And I'm screaming "Cowabunga"
while ya'll boys wipe it out

[Verse 4]

I got that Polo on my body
with a (?) swag
Yeah Purple Label man
go on and check the tag
(Manny?) got the shoes
so you know I bought the bag
Clean gel like dish detergent
with a Tide colored swag

Chain swangin' hard
like a bouncer throwin' punches
Pop and duck shorty
ya'll on no (sack lunches?) 
I'm in the party surfin'
like I'm standing on a wave
Shorty check my (?)
like she (?)
