Just what I said wrong , is anybodys guess ?
But the bruise on my face was as blue as my dress
Broken bottle on the table , broken lamp on the floor 
Couple thousand miles from the bed to the door
Lipstick on his cheek from my last kiss
Took a ten from his wallet , left the maid a tip

Chorus 
Aint gonna be your tattoo
Aint gonna be your tattoo
End up faded and blue
Aint gonna be your tattoo

Slipped out of robe , tryin not to be seen 
Only sound , old ice machine
I was feeling so scared , nowhere to go
How did my life end up so low
They say 30ss young but Im feelin old
Guess that's when the night got even colder

Chorus x2
Aint gonna be your tattoo 
Aint gonna be your tattoo
End up faded and blue
Aint gonna be your tattoo 

And I looked so pretty on his arm
Same when your eyes becomin' harm

Well I picked up a ride , rided to Reno
He got us a room above the casino
The music was loud and the drinks were cheap
But I know right away I wouldnt get no sleep
Then I got the fear all over again
When I saw that drawing all over his hand
