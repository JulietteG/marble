One last slow blues
To close the show
I watched you dance with her
And, you know, it hurted me so...

Why would you bring a new love around, around so soon?
Why  would you have to rub
SALT in my wounds?

I ain't bitter or want to judge
She won fair and square
And I hold no grudge

Why would you bring a new love around so soon?
Why would you wanna rub 
SALT in my wounds.

Couldn't you wait till these healing hands of time
Squeeze the pain, the pain from my heart.
Couldn't you wait till my bruised and bitter pride
Till it ain't, till it ain't torn apart

Solo piano, solo guitar, stop

Take your price now, and just Walk away
We can both live to love another day
Why would you bring a new love around so soon?
Why would you wanna rub 
SALT in my wounds.
Why would you wanna rub 
SALT in my wounds.

Coda:
Make me feel low down
Make me feel so bad
Why would you have to bring a new love 
around so soon?
Why would you have to hurt me?
Oh, made me feel so bad
Rubbing SALT in my wounds
Yea yea yea yea...---Lyrics submitted by margherita trov.
