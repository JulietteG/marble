He was weary
When last I saw him
But smiling still just as always

We laughed for hours
At favorite stories
Of the three of us in younger days

Now its important
That you rejoin me
At the parting request of our companion

Dreams of glory
Just beyond us
Sent me off chasing gold

When he kept trying
To reunite us
When my pursuits had left me cold

Now its important
That you rejoin me
At the parting request of our companion

And so he brings us
Back together
But he had to go to such extremes

And in your eyes now
As real as ever
Is the love I traded for my dreams

Now its important
That youve rejoined me
At the parting request of our companion

And its important
That you forgive me
At the parting request of our companion
Of our companion---Lyrics submitted by Pat DAndrea.
