[Verse1] 
You are my one true love 
You are the voice that is so sweet 
In everything I do, you bring the best out of me 
You are my wings to fly 
You are the wind beneath them 
I miss you every night, when I close my eyes 
You put your feelings down 
You stopped your tears you brought me love 
You held onto my heart 
You held with hope to have me near 
Sometimes I close my eyes 
Sometimes I let my hunger rise 
I think of all you are, you are the love of my life 

[Chorus] 
All of my dreams and my passions 
Are in your hands [x3] 

[Verse 2] 
You reached me in my need 
Your rhythm flows under my skin 
I need you desperately, 
A sweet healing that will begin 
You are my one true love 
You are the voice that is so sweet 
In everything I do, you bring the best out of me 
My everything is you 
The very motions that I move 
And everything with richness 
The richness of the peace you bring 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Always, always you are with me 
Always, always you are with me 
Always, always you are with me 
Always, always you are with me 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Love of my life 
You are the love of my life 
You are the love of my life 
You are the love of my life 
You are the love of my life 
You are the love of my life 

He comes to find you on your knees 
He comes to find you on your knees 
He comes to find you on your knees 
He comes to find you on your knees---Lyrics submitted by Wendi.
