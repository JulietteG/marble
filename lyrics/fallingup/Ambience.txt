Legacy will never burn
Hard to breathe, I'll never learn
And it moves me towards where I want to leave
In the silence we all speak
Laying down and suffering
And I move nothing and embrace what I don't need
So I stand, all alone
With no chance, on my own
Will I just sustain moving on in vain?
cause this glow, you and I
Have come to know, is a lie
And I must move on

(Chorus)
I can see past these fine lines that you stepped through
I can see through these glass eyes that led me on 
I'm in this room, You're in that and you play hearts like instruments

Listen deep, you're hell the sound
Whispering, it's all around
Echoes grasping in, echoes lasting sin
Out of this, please open up
Move from this, it's taken us
And I need to change, and I need to say
So I stand, all alone
With no chance, on my own
And I just sustain, moving on in vain
Cause this glow, you and I 
Have come to know, is a lie
And I must move on

Tell me the things that I need to keep my heart
From breaking clean
Leave me with numbness and watch me lock
Myself in a disbelief
Where does this movement come from, I'm holding on so desperately
This love is so intricate it leaves me taking---Lyrics submitted by Kaili.
