This is everything that I wanted
Do you believe that I tried so hard to take it home
But never felt a single moment
Life has been a place where Ive wandered
Moving slowly to understand what I can grasp
But understand that its still not right

So come back to me

(Chorus)
I cant find it but maybe Ill cope
Can't you hide it and never let go?
Come back to you, I only knew

Lies have covered all of the smiles
And wakened thoughts that have turned my heart
To face the wind
And then fall to where I know Ill fit, but you 
Do you believe that I wanted
Something other than fallen hearts that just
Belong
To places where the bridges give in
(Back to chorus)

Can you see what I felt when I told you
Can you cope when it runs right through you
Cause my heart it is broken with love that is
Coped
And now you tell me that I have something thats missing?---Lyrics submitted by Kaili.
