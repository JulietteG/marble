Light breaks the morning glaring headlights in the fog
To see how measurements and aerospace is moving up
This sudden danger is my calling I can swear
When I am ready I'll release

''I'm so lost for words" this stranger heard
That I'm gone forever
Leapt before the fall

In a million, in a million pieces I am breaking up
To the future, to the future where science is the circle taught
And light breaks the morning flooding headlights in the fog
With measurements and aerospace

I'm leaping out too far
I've never been so sure
Letting go of charts
And falling close to stars

In a million
In a million---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa.
