Stop this,
Never gonna find it
When you complicate
You are left behind but

Longing,
Steals away the night
And steps away form eyes
That are always searching

This time,
You can feel His voice
And He's never gonna stop
Until it sinks in deeply

Falling,
Consecrated lies
And your letting go with time
Cause your through with keeping

It's so real, 
Never gonna stop til you
Want it, want it
It's so real,
Never gonna stop

Cause we're moving with the symmetry
And we're crashing like the waves in the sea
And we're moving with your heart this time
Release

Cause we're moving with the symmetry
And we're crashing like the waves in the sea
And we're moving with your heart this time
Release

Crashing,
Feel the way we move
Open your eyes to the
Things around you

Haunting,
Take away the tears
Cause you know that
Heart is so close to beating

This time,
You can feel His voice
And He's never gonna stop
Until it sinks in deeply

Falling,
Consecrated lies
And your letting go with time
Cause your through with keeping

It's so real, 
Never gonna stop til you
Want it, want it
It's so real,
Never gonna stop

Cause we're moving with the symmetry
And we're crashing like the waves in the sea
And we're moving with your heart this time
Release

Cause we're moving with the symmetry
And we're crashing like the waves in the sea
And we're moving with your heart this time
Release

It's so real, 
Never gonna stop til you
Want it, want it

It's so real, 
Never gonna stop til you
Want it, want it

Cause we're moving with the symmetry
And we're crashing like the waves in the sea
And we're moving with your heart this time
Release

Cause we're moving with the symmetry
And we're crashing like the waves in the sea
And we're moving with your heart this time
Release
