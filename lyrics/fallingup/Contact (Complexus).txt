Run away
Run away

Breath this in the waters way
waters way

Wide awake 
Wide awake

Starts to pull him

In this race 
in this race

To question who you

Are

Are

Erase everything within you will feel
Erased now
Erase every thing within you will feel erased now

Every day,
Every day
houses full of no escape
No escape

Starts to feel him
in this place
in this place
to ? who you 
are 
are 
erase every thing within you will feel erased now
erased every withing you will feel erased now.

Who am I?
Now who am I?

I will face

Who am I?
Now who am I?

I will fade.

Erase everythin within you will feel erased now.
Erase every thing within you will feel erased now.---Lyrics submitted by B.A..
