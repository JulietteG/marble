I... I who have nothing
I... I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but hope

I love you

You... you buy her diamonds
Bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear, when I say
That she can give you the world
But she'll never love you the way

I love you

You can take her anyplace she wants
to fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
Oooo...

I... I who have nothing, oh
I... I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
But darling, it's I...

Who loves you

I love you
I love you---Lyrics submitted by KL Scriven.
