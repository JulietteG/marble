Boys, boys
He you wanna know something?
Boys, boys
Boys like girls

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys want
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I seem them looking (looking)

I make them want me
I like to tease them
And they want to touch me
I never let them

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like me

I got my cat moves
That so upsets them
Zippers and buttons
Fun to frustrate them
They get so angry
Like pouty children
Denied their candy
I laugh right at them

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys want
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

I know what boys like
I got what boys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like, boys like me

I think you're special
I might let you
You're so much different
I might let you
There's no one like you
I might let you
Or would you like that?
I might let you
Sucker!

Boys, b-b-boys
Boys, b-b-b-boys

G-g-g-g-got what boys want
G-g-g-got

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys want
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

I know what boys like
I got what boys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like, boys like me

I know what boys like
I got what boys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like, boys like me

Yeah, I know what boys like
Come on girls, you know what they like
It ain't no secret

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys want
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
