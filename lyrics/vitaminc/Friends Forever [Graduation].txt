Verse 1:
And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn 25
i keep thinking times will never change
keep on thinking things will always be the same
but when we leave this year we wont be coming back
no more hanging out cos we're on a different track
and if ya, got something that u need to say
you better say it right now
cos u dont have another day
cos were moving on and we cant slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound
and i keep thinking of that night in june
i didnt know much of love but it came too soon
and there was me and you and we got real cool
stay at home talking on the telephone with me
we'd get so excited
we'd get so scared
laughing at ourselves thinking lifes not fair,
and this is how it feels

Chorus:
As we go on
we remember
all the times we
had together
and as our lives change
come whatever
we will still be
FRIENDS FOREVER

Verse 2:
so if we get the big jobs
and we make the big money 
will we look back now
will our jokes still be funny
will we still remember everything we learned in school
still be tryin break every single rule
will little brainy bobby be the stockbroker man
Can Heather find a job that wont interfer with her tan
i keep,  keep thinking that its not goodbye
keep on thinking its a time to fly
and this is how it feels

(Chorus x1)

la la la la la la la la...
yeah yeah
la la la la la la la la...
FRIENDS FOREVER

(instramentle)

will we think about tomorrow like we think about now
can we survive it out there
can we make it somehow
i guess i thought that this would never end
and suddenly its like we're woman and men
will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
will these memories fade when i leave this town?
i keep, keep thinking that its not goodbye
keep on thinking its a time to fly

(chorus x3)---Lyrics submitted by yas.
