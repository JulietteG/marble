In the moonlight
I was mistaken
Young hearts were breakin, 
while we were apart. 
I heard a crow caw, 
I heard a dog bark
I saw the snow fall 
and you were in my arms
I know it's me, who just could not agree
It wasn't them, who just wanted to pretend
Oh, Mama can't you see?

In the moonlight
I was mistaken
I wasn't fakin 
on my quest to love you less
I tried to romance 
I go out to dance, but I have no chance when it's You I love the best. 
Last nite I walk alone
tonight I want to take you home
Say, Children

I know it's me, feels rooms always bend (?)
It wasn't them, with left less innocence (?)
No Mama can't you see?
I love you... 
I need you...
I got to have you.---Lyrics submitted by Regina.
