All I do is think of you
As I go around the world
All I do is think of you
Long, cool girl

Long, cool girl
I like to say her name
Long, cool girl
With a showgirl frame

You took a look at me
I took a look at you
Now I just cant see
What a mans supposed to do

Long, cool girl
I like to say her name
Long, cool girl
With a showgirl frame

Me and you were 3 and 2
Somethings gonna happen now, it has to
Me and you were 3 and 2
Somethings gonna happen now, it has to

Pressure drop and weather change
All around the world
You got me at point blank range
Long, cool girl

Long, cool girl
I like to say her name
Long, cool girl
With a showgirl frame

All I do is think of you
As I go around the world
All I do is think of you
Long, cool girl---
