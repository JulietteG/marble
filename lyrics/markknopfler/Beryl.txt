 Beryl
Was on another level
When she got her Booker medal
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave

Beryl
Every time theyd overlook her
When they gave her, her Booker
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
Its all too late now
Its all too late now
Its too late to dabble it is all too late
Its too late to dabble it is all too late

Beryl
The tobacco overtook her
When they gave her, her Booker
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
Its all too late now
Its all too late now
Its too late to dabble it is all too late
Its too late to dabble it is all too late

Beryl
Was on another level
When she got her Booker medal
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
After all she gave
After all she gave---
