Je suis dsol, mais la vie me demande a

I am turning, turning
From a land that I loved well
Look ahead my darling one
Across the rolling swell
And you can hear the seagulls crying
As we're slipping out of the bay
Yesterday is dying, love
And je suis dsol, je suis dsol

Je suis dsol, mais je n'ai pas le choix
Je suis dsol, mais la vie me demande a

We are sailing, sailing
For a land that's proud and free
I had no more endurance
For what had become of me
And I will do that which I must do, love
And now we're under way
All that I can say to you
Is je suis dsol

Je suis dsol, mais je n'ai pas le choix
Je suis dsol, mais la vie me demande a
Je suis dsol, mais je n'ai pas le choix
Je suis dsol, mais la vie me demande a

We are leaving, leaving
Leaving on the tide
Come and stand beside me love
The water is so wide
You can hear the sailors calling
At the dawning of the day
Yesterday is falling, love
And je suis dsol, je suis dsol

Je suis dsol, mais je n'ai pas le choix---Lyrics submitted by bibdel.
