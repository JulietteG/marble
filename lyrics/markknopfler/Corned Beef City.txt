Early in the morning
gonna see the man
wants the truck unloading for cash in-hand
you don't ask questions
when there's nothing in the bank
you gotta feed the kids and put the diesel in the tank

bacon, egg and sausage
double chips and beans
tea and bread and butter and a day on the machines
Christmas is coming
with the final demands
so what you got going for cash in-hand?

'cos it aint too pretty
corned beef city
it aint too pretty
corned beef city

It's early in the morning
where the trucks all stand
I got a pocket full of foldin'
and a pair of Jerrycans
gotta keep it going
'cos they're layin' off folk
I'm only one step ahead
of my room and board

it aint too pretty
corned beef city
it aint too pretty
corned beef city

early in the morning
gonna meet the man
wants the truck unloading for cash in-hand
Christmas is coming
with the final demands
so what you got going for cash in-hand?

it aint too pretty
corned beef city
it aint too pretty
corned beef city---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
