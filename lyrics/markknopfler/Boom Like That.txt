I'm going to san bernardino
ring a ding ding
milk shake mixers
that's my thing, now
these guys bought a heap of my stuff
and I gotta see a good thing sure enough, now 

or my name's not kroc
that's kroc with a 'k'
like crocodile
but not spelled that way,  yeah
It's dog eat dog,   rat eat rat
kroc-style
boom, like that

the folks line up all down the street
and I'm seeing this girl devour her meat, now
and then I get it, wham
as clear as day
my pulse begins to hammer
and I hear a voice say

these boys have got this down
oughtta be a one of these in every town
these boys have got the touch
it's clean as a whistle and it don't cost much
wham, bam  you don't wait long
shake, fries  patty,  your gone
and how about that friendly name?
heck, every little thing oughtta stay the same

well my names not kroc
that's kroc with a 'k'
like crocodile
but not spelled the way, now
it's dog eat dog   rat eat rat
dog eat dog   rat eat rat, now
Oh, it's dog eat dog  rat eat rat
kroc-style  boom, like that

you gentlemen ought to expand
your going to need a helping hand, now
so, gentlemen well,  what about me?
we'll make a little business history, now
or my names not kroc
you can call me Ray
like crocodile'
but not spelled that way
it's dog eat dog  rat eat rat
kroc-style
boom, like that

well we build it up
and I buy 'em out
but, man they made me grind it out, now
they open up a new place flipping meat
so I do too
right across the street

I got the name
I need the town
they sell it up in the end
and it all shuts down
sometimes you gotta be an S.O.B.
you wanna make a dream reality
competition? send 'em south
If they're gonna drown
put a hose in their mouth
do not pass 'go'
go straight to hell
I smell that meat hook smell

or my name's not kroc
that's kroc with a 'k'
like crocodile'
but not spelled that way, now
oh it's dog eat dog  rat eat rat
dog eat dog  rat eat rat
oh it's dog eat dog  rat eat rat
kroc-style  boom, like that
