There'll be no shelter here
There'll be no shelter here
There'll be no shelter here
There'll be no shelter here
Nah uh check it

The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty your pockets son,
They got ya thinkin' what you need is what they sellin'
Make you think that buyin' is rebellin'
From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war

The front-line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here
Spielberg the nightmare push it for 
The Amistad was a whip
The truth feather to tar
Memories erased and burned to scar
Trade in ya history for a VCR

Cinema,simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream
They got ya searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here 
The front line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere

Hospitals not profit full
The market's bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View the world from American eyes
The poor adore keep feeding for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
Fix the need, develop the taste,
Buy their products, or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola was back in our veins in Saigon
And Rambo too, we got a dope pair of Nikes on
Godzilla pure motherfuckin' filler
Get your eyes off the real killer

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream
They got ya searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere
There'll be no shelter here
The front-line is everywhere

American eyes, American eyes
View the whole world through American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind, and leave nothing behind
American eyes, American eyes
View the whole world through American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind, and leave nothing behind

Just stare,
Just stare,
Just stare,
Just stare,
And live the nightmare---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
