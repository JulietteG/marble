Lord, it's awful.  Jeez, it's lonely.  Just hangin' around.
I have always been a dreamer.  

Thinking of you.  But what can I do?

I had nothing.  You had nothing.
But we had a dance.  Such a dance.

Since I've always been a dreamer,
I took a chance then I watched you dance away.
What can I say? It always ends this way.

When I thought that I'd found something,
It seemed to just slip away... slip away.

I have always been a dreamer, so I'll try again.
I just can't let it end.  

Oh, what would I do?  
But, live in my dreams with you.

(Bridge)...

Stars above... the world seems to push and shove you away from me.
Darling, darling can't you see?
This is my plan.  I want to be your man.
I really hope you understand.

God, I'm tired.  
Man, it's useless.  
Just waiting around.

I have always been a dreamer.
Wasting my time.  Dreaming my life with you.

It's useless it seems.  But, I live here in my dreams... with you.

Ah-h-h-h, Lord it's awful.
Lord, I'm tired.
Useless waiting, waiting for you.
Hanging around.
Dreaming about you.
Wishing you were here.  Wishing, wishing...---Lyrics submitted by Randy Dean.
