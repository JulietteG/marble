I don't even know what day it is
My head's on back to front
I fight myself
but you pull me in
hope this feeling goes
I'm staring at your mouth again
I could kiss you and be wrong again
fight myself
but you pull me in
hope this feeling goes
have to let it go
I'm dizzy.
Just as I begin to stop
it all begins again
It's just like waking-up
with my eyes shut
the skin is broken on the milk
I don't even know what day it is
my water's muddied up again
why does this feeling stay with me
I don't even know my name
I fight myself
but you pull me in
hope this feeling goes
catching dust
beneathe the pillow---Lyrics submitted by Luke.
