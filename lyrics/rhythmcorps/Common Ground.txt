Can we meet on common ground
Are our views so far apart
there's no room to be found
Can we speak without the sound
Of a world gone quite insane
Can we start settling down

I'll not play the scene where the 
threats start flying
You'll not have to scream
'cause we're not that stupid

Are your walls all brick and stone
and far from tumbling down
Can we seat ourselves around
A table for a while and talk like
friends we have found

We'll not have to dream 
of a peaceful one day

Are our views so far apart that
there's no room to be found

Tell me can we meet on common ground---Lyrics submitted by FT.
