I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Too nice, too clean
Too white, too green
Little haters, big dreams
I don't care what you think about me
Two faced, old friends, told me, the end was near, forget them
See a lot of things changed since then
Don't they know that I came from Nebraska
Am I gonna quit? Nice of you to ask
But momma told me go and chase what you after
I'm on track, so I'm gonna rap faster
I will break it down for you and get a lil' diva
Slaying on a prayer, on the record grim reaper
Running on thermometer, and yep I got a fever
Hi, konichiwa, are you a believer?

I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Too hard, too soft, too rough, too posh
Lemme know what I want
Lace it up, baby tighter than nutter
Raise track, two legs, Hollywood, big break
Suck it up, intake
Let me tell ya how it happened real quick
Touchdown in the middle of the city
Massive street, jammed up to new weary
Know you done a party
Now tell me who you wearing
Loads of new hair held high you can carry
I will break it down for you and get a lil' diva
Slaying on a prayer, on the record grim reaper
Running on thermometer, and yep I got a fever
Hi, konichiwa, very nice to meet ya

I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Let me keep going, baby till I'm dead and gone
That's my only wish
And if you don't know I'll be singing my song
I got a lot to give

I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before ---
