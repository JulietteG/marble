The way that you're moving
You know what you're doing
I want you to prove that I'm right about you
Do it, hey, admit it
Ooh, sing it

Oh, I got the feeling down deep inside
Got the feeling I can't deny
Got the feeling that makes me high
Only thing is baby, I want it all
I want it all

All I need is one more night with you
It's amazing what just one more night can do
I want it all
I want it all

All I need is one more night with you
It's amazing what just one more night can do
I want it all
I want it all

You get me excited
But I keep it private
My world is divided without you
It won't be the same, can't take it
Ooh, sing it

Oh, I got the feeling down deep inside
Got the feeling I can't deny
Got the feeling that makes me high
Only thing is baby, I want it all
I want it all

All I need is one more night with you
It's amazing what just one more night can do
I want it all
I want it all

All I need is one more night with you
It's amazing what just one more night can do
I want it all
I want it all

Got the feeling down deep inside
Got the feeling I can't deny
Got the feeling that makes me high
Only thing is baby, I want it all
I want it all

All I need is one more night with you
It's amazing what just one more night can do
I want it all
I want it all

All I need is one more night with you
It's amazing what just one more night can do
I want it all
I want it all---
