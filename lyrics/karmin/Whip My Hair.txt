I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

Hop up out the bed turn my swag on
pay no attention to them haters cuz
we whip, em off
and we ain't doing nothing wrong
so don't tell me nothing,
I'm just tryna have fun
so keep the party jumping

so whats up (yea)
And I'll be doing what to do
we turn our back
and whip our hair and just shake them off
shake them off, shake them off,shake them off

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
Keep my head up i know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until i get there (yea)
When Im down and i feel like giving up

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I'ma get more shine in a little bit
Soon as i hit the stage applause im hearing it
whether its black stars black hearts dont
feeling it
but cant none of them whip it like i do
I, i gets it in hmm yeah i go hard
when they see me pull up
i whip it real hard
i whip it real hard,real hard,i whip it real hard

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
Keep my head up i know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until i get there (yea)
When Im down and i feel like giving up
