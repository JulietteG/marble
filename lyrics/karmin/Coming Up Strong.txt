Why you crying?
It's okay now
If I hold you, will you calm down?
It's your way with words, that can make me burn
When you say it, do you mean it?
When I shout out, can you hear me?
When it's all too much, look at what we've done

That's when I'm comin up strong
I'm comin up strong, comin up
Comin up strong, comin up oh

Now, now nothin you can do to break us now
Singing our song, getting lost in the sound
Once I was lost, but now I'm found
Shining through the dark
Can't hold us down

That's when I'm comin up strong
I'm comin up strong, comin up
Comin up strong, comin up oh

Now, now nothin you can do to break us now
Singing our song, getting lost in the sound
Once I was lost, but now I'm found
Shining through the dark
Can't hold us down

Call me ruthless, we've been through this
Who's to blame now? Babe it's useless
Cause it's no ones fault if the lights were off
When we're shining, then we're flying
Through the wheel house, that we're grinding
When it's all too much, look at what we've done

That's when I'm comin up strong
I'm comin up strong, comin up
Comin up strong, comin up oh

Now, now nothin you can do to break us now
Singing our song, getting lost in the sound
Once I was lost, but now I'm found
Shining through the dark
Can't hold us down

That's when I'm comin up strong
I'm comin up strong, comin up
Comin up strong, comin up oh

Now, now nothin you can do to break us now
Singing our song, getting lost in the sound
Once I was lost, but now I'm found
Shining through the dark
Can't hold us down

So easy we forget and say
Clouds are movin in, rain starts to fall again
As soon as you tell me it's okay

That's when I'm comin up strong
I'm comin up strong, comin up
Comin up strong, comin up oh

Now, now nothin you can do to break us now
Singing our song, getting lost in the sound
Once I was lost, but now I'm found
Shining through the dark
Can't hold us down

That's when I'm comin up strong
I'm comin up strong, comin up
Comin up strong, comin up oh

Now, now nothin you can do to break us now
Singing our song, getting lost in the sound
Once I was lost, but now I'm found
Shining through the dark
Can't hold us down

Why you crying?
It's okay now
If I hold you, will you calm down?
When it's all too much, look at what we've done---Lyrics submitted by Eric Onyan.
