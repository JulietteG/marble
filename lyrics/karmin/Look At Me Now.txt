I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can't even get in
Hahaha, let's go!

Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah
That stuff look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
He wax it on and off, Mr.Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari Kari

[Chrous]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a mo-... what?

Lil jigga bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killing every jigga that try to be on my stuff
Better cuff your man if you want him, I can get him
Cause he accidentally slip and fall on my crack
Oops I said on my crack
I ain't really mean to say on my crack
But since we talking about my crack
All of you haters say hi to that
I'm done
NO really though, I'm not done

Ay ay ay ay ay ay
'Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day
See they don't really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never stop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
Oh you ain't never gonna flop me
Every time I come a jigga gotta set it, then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that any little thing that nigga think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple jiggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again
And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A jigga better call a ref, and everybody knows my style
And jiggas know I'm the the best when it come to doing this
And I be banging on my chest, and I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next?
See the way we on it and we all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
Cause we struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it
And always gotta do it take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through his traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Gotta know I gotta have it, have it

[Chorus]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a mo-...what?

Man forget these haters, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the stuff, no pollution or substitution
Now I'm chililn playin movies in my Jacuzzi, fruit is juicy
I never gave a damn about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with an elevator
You jiggas ain't eatin', go tell a waiter
Marley said, "Shoot 'em", and I said, "Okay"
You on that bullsh-- then I'm like ole
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, yo I'm outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain't hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying
What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' forget 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these jiggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and sprite on a private flight,
Yo I've been tight since "Guiding light",
and my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy's gone
You peeps be scared 'cause I'm too wild, been here for a while
I was like no trial I put it down
I'm so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, oh

[Chorus]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, I'm fresher than a mo-...what?

Okay, okay
Is that right?
I'm fresher than a mo-...what? ---Lyrics submitted by paulo rabago.
