[Hook:]
Hey mr. tally man, tally me banana.
Daylight come and we wan' go home.
Day me say day me say day me say day-o.
Daylight come and we wan' go home.
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1:]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call me Al Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?
Two chicas at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the man twisted 'cause he open when you twist him
Never met the guy, but I treat him like I missed him
Life is the witch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what an awkward family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, forget segregation
Screw that foo', my money up, you jiggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running this and you jiggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'm a keep on doing this stuff
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish

[Hook:]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I'm goin' back in
Okay, yo stop playin, I do it like a king do
If these jiggas animals, then I'm a have a mink soon.
Telling peoples I say, "put my name on the wall"
I speak the truth but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all.
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't see the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money

Paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Yo, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Man of my dreams- I don't sleep, already found ya.
You jiggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on a bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my butt, call it kiss and tell

Yeah word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, yo, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you jiggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you jiggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the floor like Luda
Yo, I flow like scuba, yo, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep it killer dough, I'm a blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Jiggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, yo, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these jiggas out they mind
I told these stupid jiggas, so many times
That to get them bucks to be on my mind
Suck these, I tuck these on my mind, pause
Too on my grind, did I get a little love?
Yeah bit by God
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, oh
I'm a girl, I visit bathroom lines abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a GX jigga, ya heard?
Gunna gunna yeah-

Daylight come and we wan go home.
Daylight come and we wan go home. ---Lyrics submitted by Bella.
