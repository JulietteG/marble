I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the World one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I would leave it when I'm saying that
Ya'll start to creep in, everyday its so grey and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for em
They just say its wack
Thye don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep
When I wrote this,
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me, I dont see why you dont see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
See this light in you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brigthen me and lighten you
I dont think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gonna either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gonna hug me
But I'm not an option, theres nothing else I can do cause...

Im about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there pieces so I'm puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Cant make a decision keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your susposed to be my fucking mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me When everyone was telling you dont sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Thats why I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my time to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I aint giving up faith and you aint giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying I need you, come back for fuck sake

Im about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life---Lyrics submitted by jasmine mae.
