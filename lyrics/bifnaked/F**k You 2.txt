I'm, I'm losing my world
cuz you're leaving
and  I'm dieing without you
so now I am nothing to you
so f**k you too

Now you tell me that you'd rather be with him
but you promised
yah you promised
you'd be mi-i-i-ine

I know I, I won't cry
I know I, I won't cry
you tear me apart
but you won't break my heart
cuz you took it
man you took it from my soul
so now I am nothing to you
so f**k you too

I'm I'm out of my mind
cuz you bruise me
and abuse me 
all the time
and no I'm nothing to you
so f**k you too

will he hold you 
like I hold you in the night
can he tell you
 that he loves you when you're ri-i-i-ight

I know I, I won't cry
I know I, I won't cry
you tear me apart
but you won't break my heart
cuz you took it
man you took it from my soul
so now I am nothing to you
so f**k you too

I'm, I'm losing my world
cuz you're leaving
and  I'm dieing without you
so now I am nothing to you---Lyrics submitted by sasha.
