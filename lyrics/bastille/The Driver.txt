Shout out from the bottom of my lungs
A plague on both your houses
This thing
Its a family affair
Its drawing out my weakness

Big boys dont cry
They dont ask why

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldnt ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
Cause everything will change tonight

I want to be back on the ground
Where my feet touch my shadow
I want to dig my heels in the dirt
Feel it break between all of my my toes
Anything to stop floating round
Bring me down
Back down below, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take back
And push the anger down
Try to remember calmness

Big boys dont cry
They dont ask why

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldnt ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
Cause everything will change tonight

Hey now
Whats the gravity upon your face
So Im the one whos bleeding
Real men
Always thinkin with our fists
My turn to be the victim

Big boys dont cry
They dont ask why

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldnt ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
Cause everything will change tonight

There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldnt ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
Cause everything will change tonight ---
