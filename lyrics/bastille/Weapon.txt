(Bastille VS. Angel Haze VS. F*U*G*Z Vs. Braque) 

This is vocal detection 
Front line open intellection 
Outlining all his imperfections 
This is his fucking confession 
Right now you cause that what 
Screaming you want it and more 
Sit down and amass the weapon 
Right now your voice is a weapon 

Wake up to stars in the sky 
Watch light revolve with your mind 
Watch all the storms in the rise 
And put all your palms in the sky 
No more falling to pressure 
No more failing acceptance 
Throw all your hells towards the heavens 
'Cause your voice is a weapon 

And your voice is a weapon 
And well do with it what we can 
And your voice is a weapon 
And well do with it what we can 

Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms 

We dance with the devils 
And make your halos the color of sinners portraits 
And smothering it means everythings lovely again 
Nothing is quite as it seems 
Societys all a disease  
Kill all your fear in your sleep 
'Cause everythings formed in a dream 

Breathe in insanitys grip 
Words from insanitys lips 
Falling from sanitys cliff 
Watching your vanity slip 
No more falling to pressure 
No more failing acceptance 
Throw all your hells towards the heavens 
'Cause your voice is a weapon 

And your voice is a weapon 
And well do with it what we can 
And your voice is a weapon 
And well do with it what we can 

Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms 

Pressure that deepen the cut 
When will the evil erupt? 
Volcanic fever is lost 
That shit will even it out 
Pressure is feeding the dust 
Breakfast is keeping the cut 
Vengeance is me speaking up 
This is me speaking up 

And your voice is a weapon 
This is vocal confession 
And its shooting you down, down, down 

And your voice is a weapon 
This is vocal confession 
And were shooting you down, down, down 

And your voice is a weapon 
And well do with it what we can 
And your voice is a weapon 
And well do with it what we can 

Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms again 
Ill fall into your arms 

And choose your voice and etch that on your soul 
Make them heard when crowds drown out your cold 
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions 
The wake has to be left so never falter down, down 

Your voice is a weapon 
So do with it what you can 
Your voice is a weapon 
So do with it what you can 

Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions 
Your voice is a weapon 
So do with it what you can---
