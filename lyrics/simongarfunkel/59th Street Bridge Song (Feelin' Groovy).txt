Slow Down, you move too fast
You've got to make the morning last Just
kick'in down the cobblestones, lookin for fun and feelin groovy

la da da da da  feeling broovey

Hello lamp post what cha knowin
I've come to watch your flowers growin
Ain't cha got no rhymes or me
Doot in doo doo Feelin Groovy

la da da da da  feeling broovey

Got no deeds to do
No promises to keep.
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me. Life, I love YOU.

fa da da da da  feeling broovey
All is Groovy---Lyrics submitted by Linda.
