When your weary, feelin' small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side, (woa)
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Chorus:
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When your on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part (woa)
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Chorus

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine (woa)
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind---Lyrics submitted by Donna.
