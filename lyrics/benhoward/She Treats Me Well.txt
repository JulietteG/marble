Seen fortune in my lifetime
gave it all to the man instead
still tomorrow comes
I'm still standing on my own two feet
got a woman at home
she treats me well

Anger
I've seen it rise
from a careless word that I said
well guilt is wasteful
pride is childish
got a woman at home
she told me that
got a woman at home
she taught me well

Well she's alright
when everyone is wrong
well she's alright
lets me waste another song
stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven I'll make it hell
one day to the next
and now that serves me well
now I've got a woman at home
she treats me well

Found sorrow
in my mind most times
gave it all back to the life I led
but since times changed
it all just rolls away
I've got a woman at home
she treats me well
(she treats me well)

Slumber
not in my lifetime
won't spend my days in my bed
make a whole scene, gather round come see it my way
now I've got a woman at home
she treats me well

Well she's alright
when everyone is wrong
well she's alright
lets me waste another song
stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven I'll make it hell
one day to the next
and now that serves me well
now I've got a woman at home
she treats me well---
