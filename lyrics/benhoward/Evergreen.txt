Christmas flared amongst the somewhere cold deep evergreen
Built a world without your love and I built it in me
Christmas flared amongst the somewhere cold deep evergreen
Built a world without your love, now I'm all out at sea

Take me back to the catacombs, I am tempted by her love
Bluest eyes against my own skin, I have never been so caught up
Looking around I see memories, what it was, oh, what it was
There in the crowds you said something but I can't remember what

And my mother cursed the town for closing me down
Closing me down

Take me back to the catacombs, I am tempted by her love
Bluest eyes against my own skin, I have never been so caught up
Looking around I see memories, what it was, oh, what it was
There in the lights you said something but I can't remember what

And my mother cursed the town for closing me down
Closing me down---
