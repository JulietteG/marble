Wrapped up in dissonance,
I'm sorry that I just walked away
Lost in the insignificance of mine,
I had no words to say
Now I am better, I implore you
To say it isn't right
But somewhere deep in history
Your father pulled your teeth out of your face

Hold it in, now let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, now look who's laughing,
You again, oh you, oh you, oh you

Hold it in, now let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, now look who's laughing,
Me again, all fired up on you

Now she's caught between
What to say and what she really means

Wrapped up in empathy,
The chemicals are pushing passed my blood
Hold all my cliches on the tip of my tongue
To tell you that it's love

Hold it in, now let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, now look who's laughing,
You again, oh you, oh you, oh you

Hold it in, now let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, now look who's laughing,
Me again, all fired up on you

And now she's caught between
What to say and what she really means
And I am finally coloring,
Inside the lines that I live between

Hold it in, now let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, now look who's laughing,
You again, oh you, oh you, oh you

Hold it in, now let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, now look who's laughing,
Me again, all fired up on you---
