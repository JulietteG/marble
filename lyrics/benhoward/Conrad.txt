Climb out
Out to where you see
The curl of the world

We're alone
Just like you said
Cold, cold world

Life lasts
Only one thing left to roll
Last year to learn

You were the boat that breached
In a tale of Conrad's
We will never be the change to the weather and the sea
And you knew that

You were the boat that breached
In a tale of Conrad's
Oh I loved you with the good and the careless of me
But it all goes back

Climb out
Out to where you see
The curl of the world

We're alone
Just like you said
And last year to learn

You were the boat that breached
In a tale of Conrad's
We will never be the change to the weather and the sea
And you knew that

You were the boat that breached
In a tale of Conrad's
Oh I loved you with the good and the careless of me
But it all goes back

You were the boat that breached
In a tale of Conrad's
We will never be the change to the weather and the sea
And you knew that

You were the boat that breached
In a tale out of Conrad's
Oh I loved you with the good and the careless of me
But it all goes back---
