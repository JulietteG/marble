I got a velvet
I got a velvet itch in my jeans
I got a velvet
I got a velvet itch in my jeans

Can you scratch it
Can you scratch it
Can you scratch it
Can you scratch it, scratch it for me

I got a medecine
I got a medecine in my weed
I got a medecine
I got a medecine in my weed

Oh yeah, I'm bastard
Oh yeah, I'm bastard
Oh yeah, I'm bastard
Oh yeah, I'm bastard aaah you set me free

I talk to Elvis
I talk to Elvis in my sleep
I talk to Elvis
I talk to Elvis in my sleep

He said I'm cracked out
Oh yeah, I'm cracked out
Oh yeah, I'm cracked out
But at least, I got nowhere to be
nowhere to be

I've got an itch (7xs)---Lyrics submitted by Zack Blur.
