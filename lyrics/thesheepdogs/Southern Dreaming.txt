Look on down baby
It looks nice
You don't have to tell me more than 
Once or twice
Pump on the brakes
And find my walkin' shoes
I'm on my way to Rig and Sold
And I can't lose.

(Chorus)
Now she donate
But would ya keep on pushing?
Would ya keep on riding?
Oh no they'd understand 
Well, I can't leave town. 
Oh, no, no.
I guess I'll spend my days
Southern Dreaming.

Yeah, I'm set in my ways
Baby, I'll fight through that malaise.
Well, look down in now 
Until my dying days.

Be there, now sleep, baby
All through my dreams
And write in the pavements and books and magazines 
Oh!

(Chorus)
