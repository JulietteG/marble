Colorful,serene the earth emerges into view
Heavenly the scene,a world so pure green and blue
Harmony and balance existed long ago
Something you and I will never get to know

Man has been unkind
The world needs our help
Now is the time
 to see beyond the wealth

Wake up to reality
The earth is fading fast 
We only have one life to live

Started out as paradise for all of us to share
But that has all been sacrificed by people unaware
Industries advance,people progress
We all things for granted and ignore the S.O.S

So many voices so many minds
Why does it take so much to open our eyes?

Wake up to reality
This life is not a game
So take a stand and do something
It's time to make a change

The children are our future
And they need us to be strong
We must take matters in our hands
Put the world where it belongs
We can't waste time,there's no more rope
There is the magic,we're the cure
To give the whole world hope

Wake up to reality 
the earth is fading fast
We only have one life to live
We've got to make it last
Wake up to reality
This life is not a game
So take a stand and do something
It's time to make a change---Lyrics submitted by brian reyes.
