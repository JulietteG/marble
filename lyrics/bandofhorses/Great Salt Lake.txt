Back of the boat was painted Wrecking Ball
There was country music playing but he don't like it at all

A red fire popping on a rained out woody
His whiskey spilling in a lake that's made of salt
Look out Michael there's a note on the door saying everybody listen be the next Omaha

Now if you find yourself falling apart
I'm sure, I could stand, on, the great salt lake

And your old man was but a wishin' machine 
It's time that you could spend, but now he's gettin old
When Billy the rabbit found a watering hole it's a place to lay yourself or the heads of Coyotes

Now if you find yourself falling apart
I'm sure, I could stand, on, the great salt lake

Following home, We want one
Following home, we all want one

If ever beat down, we know who we are
they know we all want one

If ever beat down, we know who we are
they know we all want one---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
