Better things come to those who wait
Then appearness left for all too late
Greatness achieved, and darkness defeated

Ram shack crew with something to prove
And the truck blew up believe it

You see me go, theres something coming your way
Everything I want, and everything I need

So say it to me, say it to my face
Theres no time to be reserved or safe
Call just chill, whenever
Glory till the end
Everything I want, and everything Ill get
Its coming now, Its going down
The stars are falling, walls are coming all of hour

Knocking on the doorway, look whos coming your way
Everything I want, everything I need
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Uh-u-u-u-uh
Uh-u-u-u-uh

No ones gonna know it
The right ones are green
roving wrong the other ones winning
were fine, when Ill win

Look whats in the door
Theres something coming your way
Everything I want, everything I need

Knocking on the doorway,
Hey look whats coming your way
Its Everything I want, Its everything I need

Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door

Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door
Knocking on the door---Lyrics submitted by Nathan Calvert.
