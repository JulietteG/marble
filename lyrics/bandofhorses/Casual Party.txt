Talking television at the casual party
Here's some brand new friends
To get you started off, so start it off
Since Ben got that he's a sociopath
Only playing games, don't be distracted
It's all or nothing, all or nothing
So you really got something to lose
It's coming around as it did before
Gettin' your attention, but where's the door?
I can't located it, where's it located?
I got plenty to live for
Blind faith, it don't sit right.  You got rage
Wound so tight, I wanna leave
Best get out of the way

Blind faith
Don't sit right
You're full of rage
Wound so tight
I'm gonna leave
Best get out of the way

Awful conversation at the casual party
The job, the babble on
The recreational hobbies
No it never stops
Kids and the dog
A freshly mowed lawn
Retirement plans
For a mountain home
Been arrested
Lived in Texas
My God, I'm gonna
Leave it with you

Blind faith
Don't sit right
You're full of rage
Wound so tight
I better leave
Best get out of the way

Blind faith
Don't sit right
You're full of rage
Wound so tight
I'm gonna leave
Best get out of the way

Talking conversion at the casual party
Awful television, don't get you started
No it never stops
Children and dogs, and manicured lawns
All your future plans, vacation homes

I wanna go
Home---
