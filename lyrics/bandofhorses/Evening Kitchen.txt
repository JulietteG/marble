Ooh ooh ooh x7
Drive out with the sun in your eyes
You wasted my time
It's true, its true

My god, don't you hold out your hand
I called off my plans
I counted on you, on you

And if you're ever left with any doubt
What you live with and what you'll do without
I'm only sorry that it took so long to figure out

Ooh ooh ooh x7

Got lost in the places I've been
I should go out with my friends
I'd go tonight but I know you'd be there too, there too

For me, this bottle of wine
Is to slow down my mind
And forget the things that I knew, I knew

And if you're ever left with any doubt
What you live with and what you'll do without
I'm only sorry that it took so long to figure out

Ooh ooh ooh x7---Lyrics submitted by Carly McGrane.
