Well I like to think I'm a mess, you'd wear with pride
Like some empty dress on the bed you've laid out for tonight

Maybe I'll tell you sometime
Time...sometime

You were right...right
You were right

Outside by your doorstep
In in a worn out suit and tie
I'll wait for you to come down
Where you find me
Where we'll shine

Outside by your doorstep
In a worn out suit and tie
I'll wait for you to come down
Where you find me
Where we'll shine

Outside by your doorstep
In worn out suit and tie
I'll wait for you to come down
Where you find me
Where we'll shine---Lyrics submitted by Justin Nichols.
