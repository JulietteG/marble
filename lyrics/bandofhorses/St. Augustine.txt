The silver sands of St. Augustine
Fire in the ground
Between my bitter teeth
We're dancing on the poisoned in their graves
At the end of the night
We'd all seen better days

I know you tried
I know you're cursed
I know your best was still your worst
When Hollywood was calling out your name
Saint Augustine

If I stayed behind
Would you let your hair grow?
I will forget
The favors that you owe
I'm dreaming of car wrecks and thunderstorms so bright
Let's bury ourselves
And go haunt someone tonight

I know you tried
I know you're cursed
I know your best was still your worst
When Hollywood was calling out your name
Saint Augustine
Saint Augustine
Saint Augustine
