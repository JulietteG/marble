Oh, what a noble, distinguished collection
Of fine little friends you have made
Hitting the tables without you again
"No we'll wait, no we promise we'll wait."
Well, June makes these excellent sewing machines
Out of common industrial waste
She spends a few months at a time on the couch
But she's safe, she wears shades, she wears shades

Oh, but no one can stare at the wall 
As good as you, my baby doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
And you're learning that just because they call themselves friends
Doesn't mean they'll call
They made the comment in jest
"But you've got the needle,
I guess that's the point of it all."

Maybe a week in the tropics would help
To remind you how nice life can be
We propped you right up in a chair on a deck
With a beautiful view of the sea
But a couple weeks later we came back
And you and the chair were nowhere to be seen
You had magically moved to the closet 
Eyes fixed to where the child had been

Oh, but no one can stare at the wall 
As good as you, my baby doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
Why on Earth would I keep you propped up in here 
When you so love the fall
Patterns laid out on the bed
With dozens of colors of thread
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point in the end

Well, it's better to waste a day
Watching the scenery change at a comatose rate
Than to put yourself in it
And turn into one of those cigarette ads that you hate
But while you were sleeping, some men came around
Said they had some dimensions to take
I'm not sure what they were talking about
But they sure made a mess of your face

But still no one can stare at the wall 
As good as you, my baby doll
And you're aces for playing along
You're almost human, even now
And just 'cause they call themselves experts
It doesn't mean suite fuck all
They've got the permanent dress
And homes with a stable address
And they've got excitement
And life by the fistful
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
