I have to drive
I have my reasons, dear
Its cold outside
I hate the seasons here

I suffer mornings most of all
I feel so powerless and small
By ten oclock Im back in bed
Fighting the jury in my head

You learn to drive
Its only natural, dear
You drive all night
We havent slept in years

We suffer mornings most of all
We saw you lying in the road
We tried to dig a decent grave
But its still no way to behave

It is a delicate position
Spin the bottle
Pick the victim
Catch a tiger
Switch directions
If he hollers
Break his ankles
To protect him

Well have to drive
Theyre getting closer
Just get inside
Its almost over

We will save your brothers
We will save your cousins
We will drive them far away
From streets and lights
From all signs of bad mankind

We suffer mornings most of all
Wake up all bleary eyed and sore
Forgetting everything we saw
(Ill meet you in an hour
at the car)---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
