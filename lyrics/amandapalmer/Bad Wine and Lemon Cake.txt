(featuring The Jane Austen Argument)

I have a little house
Close to town but not to the city.
Far from home but near my family
No waterviews but so close to the sea
I see
This is how my little life could be.

And I'm filling it with things
Like furniture I find on the street
And all the special things I like to eat
Pictures of people that I'd like to meet
I'll meet them while I'm orbiting the world
And it's so pretty and so lonely

My little love affairs
Are all scheduled 'round the TV Guide
And my sex life has all been plagirized
In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline.

I'd like to rent a wife
Then rent a husband to keep her for life
The three of us, we could be so happy
Them with each other and me with company
I'll see when I'm off flying around the world
And it's so pretty and so lonely

I could just die
I might just die
I could just die
I might just die

And at my funeral
They will say "Tom, he was such a nice guy.
He went too early but he went in style."
They'll play my music and then they will cry

Then they'll have a little wake
They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake
And my mother's little heart will break
And she'll say "Wait!There must be some mistake!
He can't be dead; take me instead."

Oh, but I'm not dead
They'll tell me I'm not dead
They say that I'm not dead
That I won't die for some time

I'm in my little house
Just writing little songs to pass the time
Which incidentally is seven forty nine
So don't you worry, I'm completely fine (I'm fine)
And don't you worry, I'm completely fine (I'm fine)
Don't you worry, I'm completely fine (I'm fine)
Don't you worry, I'm completely fine (I'm fine)
Don't you worry, I'm completely fine (I'm fine)
I'm just so fucking fine.---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
