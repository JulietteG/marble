A peculiar thing happened to me this morning.
Just as I reached into my pocket to find it empty of any sough
I saw two broken twigs on the ground,
Shaped like the Greek letters F and S.
F and S helium, F and S
These are the chemical symbols for iron and sulfur
It was a sign, Im sure, for me to make gold from these two elements
I have been working all day
Over these hellish flames

Locked in his bedroom
He saw the world
A world of answers
And gunshot girls

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick

Dont bother blaming
These games and guns
Hes only playing
And bullets just want to have fun

He flicked a sound check
And packed his bag
He hung his Walkman
Around his neck

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick

Its so simple
The way they fall
The final impact
No sound at all

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
Boom---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
