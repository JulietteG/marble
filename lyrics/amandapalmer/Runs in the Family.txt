My friend has problems with winter and autumn. 
They give him prescriptions and shine bright lights on him. 
They say it's genetic, they say he can't help it, they say you can catch it - but sometimes you're born with it. 
My friend despite he gets shakes in the night and they say that there's no way that they could have caught it in time takes his toll on him. 
It is traditional. 
It is inherited. 
Predispositional 
Day I've been wondering what is inside of me, who can I blame for it? 
I say it runs in the family 

This family that carries me to such great lengths to open my legs up for anyone who'll have me. It runs in the family, I came by it honestly, do what you want who knows it might fill me up

My friend's depressed she's a wreck, she's a mess. 
They've done all sorts of tests & they guess it has something to do with her grandmother's grandmother's grandmother saving war soldiers who probably infected her. 
My friend has validation in some allergies that she dates back to the 17th century. 
Somehow she manages in her misery. 
Strips in the city and shows all her best tricks. 
I mean well, I'm well well I mean I'm in hell well I still have my healthy at least that's what they tell me. 
If wellness is this what in hells name is sickness? 
But business is business and business runs in the family. 

We tend to bruise easily. 
Mad in the blood. 
I'm telling you cause I want you to know me - know me and my family. 
We're wonderful folks, but don't get to close to me cause you might knock me up

Mary have mercy now look what I've done but don't blame cuz I can't help where I come from. 
Running is something that we've always done well and mostly I can't even tell what I'm running from. 
Run from their pity, from responsibility. 
Run from the country and run from the city. 
I can run from the law, I can run from myself. 
I can run from my life, I can run into debt. 
I can run from it all, I can run til I'm gone. 
I can run for the office and run for my cause. 
I can run using every last ounce of energy. 
I cannot, I cannot, I cannot run from my family. 

They're hiding inside of me. 
Don't change my life. 
Help me if you might but don't tell my family. 
They'd never forgive me. 
They'd say that I'm crazy. 
But they would say anything if it would shut me up......Shut me up.....Shut me up 
me up 
me up 
me up 
me up 
me up 
Shut me up 
me up 
me up 
me up 
me up
