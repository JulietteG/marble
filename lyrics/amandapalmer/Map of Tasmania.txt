oh my god...fuck this!
oh my god...fuck this!

they dont play this song on the radio
oh my god...fuck this!
they dont play this song on the radio
oh my god...fuck this!
they dont play this song on the radio
they dont show that its on the video

they dont know that we are the media
they dont know that we stopped the video
i dont want to see what im making you

i see up and it is shaking you
walking down down the street im the lidyale 
showing off my map of tasmaina!

oh my god...fuck this!
oh my god...fuck this!

soft and sweet and shaped like a triangle
some girls want no shape so they shave it off
thats so whack he hurts with the number

walking around and look like an emo
soft and sweet and shaped like a triangle
some girls want no shape so they shave it off

thats so whack he hurts the number
walking around and look like an emo
i say the girl that shoot like a jungle

give him some thing strong to hold onto
let it fly in the open wind!
if you get to bushy you can trim!

they dont play this song on the radio
they dont show that its on the video
they dont play this song on the radio
they dont know that we are the media

they dont know that we stopped the video
i dont want to see what im makeing you
i see up and that it is shaking you

walking down the street im the lidyale
showing off my map of tasmania!
they dont play this song on the radio

they dont show that its on the video
they dont know that we are the media
they dont know that we stopped the video

i dont want to see what im makeing you
i see up and that it is shaking you
walking down the street im the lidyale

showing off my map of tasmania!
oh my god...fuck this!
showing off my map of tasmania!
oh my god...fuck this!

showing off my map of tasmania!
oh my god...fuck this!
showing off my map of tasmania!

oh my god...fuck this!
showing off my map of tasmania!
oh my god...fuck this!

oh my god...fuck this!
showing off my map of tasmania!---Lyrics submitted by Cameron.
