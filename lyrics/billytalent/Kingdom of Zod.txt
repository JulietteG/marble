We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
Masters of broken promises are born to manipulate
Your mind is a vault of prejudice but we see through the door
Your dirty little secrets aren't so secret anymore

We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
You're tied to an ideology from a book that's out of date
No room for your daft intolerance left in this day and age
We're not gonna go down quietly
We're not gonna be afraid

'Cause under the cloak of sanity's a madman in disguise
Are we blind, blind, blind?

(It's a lie)
I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie)
I feel it coming like the back of a hand
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

(It's a lie)
If I think you'd be the one in command
(It's a lie)
It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

It's a lie

We're slamming the doors of democracy on those who are not the same
We're casting the stones at liberty but no one takes the blame
Your cup is full of promise but there's nothing left in mine
Tell me why, why, why?

(It's a lie)
I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie)
I feel it coming like the back of a hand
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

(It's a lie)
If I think you'd be the one in command
(It's a lie)
It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

(Are we blind?)
We'll never make it like a thief in the night*
Will they cover up the evidence of their crimes?
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)?

(It's a lie)
When they tell me to surrender the fight
I'll surrender the fight, I'll surrender the fight
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

All that I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes
Until they lead me to die*
To the edges of knife

All that I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes

(It's a lie)
I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie)
I feel it coming like the back of a hand
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

(It's a lie)
If I think you'd be the one in command
(It's a lie)
It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)

(Are we blind?)
We'll never make it like a thief in the night*
Will they cover up the evidence of their crimes?
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)?

(It's a lie)
When they tell me to surrender the fight
I'll surrender the fight, I'll surrender the fight
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
A big fuckin' lie
