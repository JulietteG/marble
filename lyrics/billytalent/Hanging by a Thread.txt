Hello, hello, hello my darling.
Have we reached the end?
'Cause when the stitches fall apart
We're hanging by a thread.

Hello, hello, hello my darling
Some things never change
When our words are dipped in gasoline,
Our love goes up in flames.
I tried so hard to get behind your mental barricade.
But every time it leaves me feeling damaged, torn, and frayed

Hanging by a thread.
Hanging by a thread.
When you break my heart, I'll fall apart.
Until you stitch me up again.

I'm tired of all the drama that unravels in your head.
Well it's easy to get tangled up,
When your world is torn to shreds.
And every time you spit at me,
Someday you will regret.
An ounce of insecurity is worth a pound of lead.

Hanging by a thread.
Hanging by a thread.
When you break my heart, 
I'll fall apart until you stitch me up again
Oh! Hanging by a thread
Oh! Hanging by a thread
C'mon patch me up or cut me loose,
'cause these rags are turning red.
C'mon patch me up or cut me loose,
'cause im hanging by a thread.

I'm torn to shreds!

Woah, woah, woah!

Hello, hello, hello my darling .
Have we reached the end?
'Cause when the stitches fall apart
We're hanging by a thread.

For all the times we've hurt each other,
With all the things we said.
Well, it's hard to hold this olive branch
With a gun against my head 

Hanging by a thread.
Hanging by a thread.
When you break my heart, 
I'll fall apart until you stitch me up again.
Oh! Hanging by a thread
Oh! Hanging by a thread

C'mon patch me up or cut me loose,
'cause these rags are turning red.
C'mon patch me up or cut me loose,
'cause these rags are turning red.
C'mon patch me up or cut me loose,
'cause I'm hanging by a thread!---Lyrics submitted by Philip Phan.
