What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)
What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)

Today I don't feel pretty
And I'm tired of trying to fit right in
Don't think that your so great
'Cause being great must suck

We don't always see the bright side
We all need ego suicide
You hung my head today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So stand up straight and firmly say

What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)
What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)

My heart is in the right place
So wipe that smirk right off your face
Don't make me feel like that
Cause that's just plain not nice

We don't always see the bright side
And I lied when I said I was fine
You slapped my face today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So stand up straight and firmly say

What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)
What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
You stole my luck from me
And now my fortune cookie's empty!
Cause you came and you stole it all from me!
So stand up straight and firmly say

What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)
What you see is what you get (don't ya know)
(Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker)
Look at me and don't forget (don't ya know)
(Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers)---Lyrics submitted by Kurtis.
