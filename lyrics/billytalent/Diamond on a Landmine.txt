Slapped my face, slammed the door, a dozen roses lay on the floor.
I saw her friends and I was told, she'd blocked my number from her cellphone.
You said we... were meant to be, now this obsession is killing me.
Until I have a heart attack, I'll keep on trying to win you back.

Alone at last, I cant wait 'till we're alone at last,
All I wanted was a second chance,
second chance, to hold you in my arms and last...

Forever, forever, I'll walk a thousand miles,
just to tell her, to tell her our love is still alive,
and i'll never, i'll never, i'll never let it die.
Well you'd better watch your step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.

I'm not so sure about this word, but she kept calling me 'insecure'.
I tried to quit, but there's no use 'cause i'm addicted to her abuse.
She's in control... of everything, i'm just a puppet, she pulls my strings.
Denying truth, i'll test my fate, and keep on playing this wicked game.

Alone at last, I cant wait 'till we're alone at last,
All I wanted was a second chance,
second chance, to hold you in my arms and last...

Forever, forever, I'll walk a thousand miles,
just to tell her, to tell her our love is still alive,
and i'll never, i'll never, i'll never let it die.
Well you'd better watch your step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better watch you step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better watch you step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
Waiting to explode.

We're dancing on thin ice before.
Frozen from the winters cold.
And if it were to crack below,
I'd never let you go.

Alone at last, I cant wait 'till we're alone at last,
All I wanted was a second chance,
second chance, to hold you in my arms and last...

Forever, forever, I'll walk a thousand miles,
just to tell her, to tell her our love is still alive,
and i'll never, i'll never, i'll never let it die.
Well you'd better watch your step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better watch you step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better watch you step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
Waiting to explode.

You'd better watch you step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better watch you step,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better not touch,
she's diamond on a landmine.
It's better to forget,
she's a diamond on a landmine.
Waiting to explode.---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
