blinded by the light
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night

madman, drummers, bummers, indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
with a boulder on my shoulder, feeling kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
with this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground

the calliope crashed to the ground and she was blinded by the light,
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
    (blinded by the light)
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
    (blinded by the light)
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
    (blinded by the light)
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
    (blinded by the light)

some silicone sister with her manager mister told me you got what it takes
she said i'll turn you on son to something strong
play the song with the funky break
and go kart mozart was checkin' out weather chart see if it was safe outside
and little early pearly came by in his curly wurly and asked me if i needed a ride

asked me if i needed a ride and she was blinded by the light
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
      (blinded by the light)
she got down but she never got tight she's gonna make it to the night
she's gonna make it to the night

but mama that's where the fun is...

but mama that's where the fun is...
mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun,
but mama that's where the fun is ...

some brimstone baritone, anti cyclone rolling stone, preacher from the east
says de-throne the dictaphone hit him in his funny bone that's where they expect it least
and some new mown chaperone was standing in the corner
watching the young girls dance
and some fresh sewn moonstone was messing with his frozen zone reminding him of romance

the calliope crashed to the ground and she was blinded by the light
reved up like a deuce another runner in the night
   (blinded by the light)
revved up like a deuce another runner in the night

madman, drummers, bummers, indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
    (blinded by the light reved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
in the dumps with mumps as the adolescent pumps his way in to his hat
   (blinded by the light reved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
with a boulder on my shoulder feeling kinda' older I tripped the merry-go-round
   (blinded by the light reved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
with this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground
    (blinded by the light reved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
    (blinded by the light reved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
and some bloodshot forget me not his daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band
    (blinded by the light reved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
some silicone sister with her manager mister told me i got what it takes
    (blinded by the light revved up like a deuce another runner in the night)
she said i'll turn you on son into something strong
she got down but she never got tight she's gonna' make it through the night.---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
