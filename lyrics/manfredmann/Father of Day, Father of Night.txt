Father of night, father of day,
Father, who takes the darkness away,
Father, who teaches the bird to fly,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Father of day, Father of night,
Father of black, Father of white,

Father, who build the mountain so high,
Who shaped the cloud up in the sky,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Father of night, father of day,

Father of grain, father of wheat
Father of cold and father of heat
Father of air and father of trees
Who dwells in your hearts, and your memories
Father of night, father of day,
Father, who takes the darkness away,
Father, who teaches the birds to fly,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Father of night, father of day,

Father of night, and father of day,
Father, who takes the darkness away,

Father of black, Father of white,

Father who turned the rivers and streams

Father of night, father of day,

Father, who takes the darkness away,

Father, who teaches the bird to fly,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Father of grain, father of wheat
Father of cold and father of heat
Father of minutes, father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.

Father of loneliness and pain,

Father of night, father of day,---Lyrics submitted by Fernando.
