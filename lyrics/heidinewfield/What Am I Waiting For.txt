I got a streetlight green, I got an ole mustang
I got small town get out anywhere but here dreams 
and an open road
What am I waiting for?

Well I'm 5 years in to a 2 year plan
I'm still standing here with the walls closing in 
behind this open door
What am I waiting for?

Oh What am I waiting for?
I stayed here for love watched it disappear
Now there's nothing but yesterdays holding me here
I can't take no more
What am I waiting for?

Chorus: 
Oh What am I waiting for?
Yeah these blue skies and sunshine 
and good times are mine for the taking 
I'm always saying I'm crazy for staying, 
So What am I waiting for? 

Bridge:
I can hear God now, from a silver cloud
I got plans for you child whatcha worried for?
You know life's too short.
What are you waiting for?

(chorus)

Oh What are you waiting for?

What am I waiting for?---Lyrics submitted by Loretta.
