I get dressed in the dark each day
You used to think that was so sweet
By 6:15 I'm in the car driving

I keep my change in the car ashtray
I haven't smoked in years and years
But lately at night I've been craving

I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you

Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately all I do seems to wreck you

Every now and then after work
I don't go straight home
I might sit out by the lake and wonder

But I can almost see the face
Of a little blue eyed girl
And the boy who thought he knew everything about her

I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you

Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately all I seem to do is wreck you

I don't know what the hell you want from me
Is there something or someone I can be
One of these nights should I keep on driving
Drivin'

'Cause I don't know how to pull you back
Don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you

Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately all I do seems to wreck you

Lately all I do seems to wreck you
Lately all I do seems to wreck you
Wreck you

I get dressed in the dark each day---Lyrics submitted by Maddy.
