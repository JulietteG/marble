What if i climbed the mountain
what if i swam to that shore
what if ever battle was victorious
then would you love me more
would you love me more

what if i was everyone's first choice
what if i went farther than before
what if i stood high above the rest
then would you love me more
would you love me more

you say that i belong to you
apart from the things i do
you say i belong to you
i'm in awe of why you do (why you do, why you do)
im in awe of you

what if i ignored the hand that fed me
what if i forgot to confess
what if i stumbled down that mountain
then would you love me less
lord, would you love me less

what if i was everyone's last choice
what if I'm mixed in with the rest
what i fail what i passed before
then would you love me less
lord would you, would you love me less

you say that i belong to you
apart from the things i do
you say i belong to you
i'm in awe of why you do (you do, you do, you do)

what have i done, 
to deserve your son
he said to die for me
what can i give
i want to live
give me eyes to see

in a world in  that keeps changing
there is one thing that i know is true
your love is the standing
there is nothing else i hold on to

you say that i belong to you
apart from the things i do
you say i belong to you
i'm in awe of why you do (why you do)
(2x)

the way you love me,
the way you do, the way you do
the way you love me---Lyrics submitted by katie.
