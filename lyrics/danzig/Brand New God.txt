I am a walking screaming hell
A thing of torture to behold
This vivisection splits my sould
A thing of torture to behold

Yeah!

Oh, Where you run to
Wont take too long
Oh, I've come to get you
Oh, Wont take too long
Oh, And death should know me
Hey!

Oh, No hesitating
Oh, Give up your heart
Oh, It's so lonely
Oh, Without your heart
Oh, And death should know me
My hands are dirty with his blood

And I could take you there
I got a brand new god
And if I lay you there
Unto my brand new god
And I will slay you there
For my brand new god
Brand new god
Brand new god

Oh, Where you running to
Oh, It didn't take too long
Oh, I've come and gone now
Oh, It didn't take too long
Oh, And death should know me
My hands are dirty with his blood
Oh, And death should know me
Afterall
I prepared you for the second coming of my god!---Lyrics submitted by will.
