No place of our own 
Nowhere we can be alone 
Nowhere we can go 
Where the people don't know 
That we're devil's angels 

Angels on the run 
We can't see the harm that's done 
Thinking all along 
That it's right to be wrong 
When we're devil's angels 

Angels riding into hell 
Riding into hell 
Like thunder 
Motherfucker!

Looking for the way 
Hoping we don't have to pay 
But we never learn 
Angels can't get burned 
When we're devil's angels---Lyrics submitted by Santos.
