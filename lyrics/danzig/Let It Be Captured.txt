All I want
All I get
Let it be captured
In my heart

World on fire
World of pain
Find myself wanting you again
All I want
All I need
Let it be captured
In my heart

Slip my hand up inside
Cradle the soul
That you hide
From my eyes
I can see
So many things
That you want
That you need
I can give
Let it be captured
In my heart---Lyrics submitted by will.
