Bodies, please dont cry
Bodies, dont die
Bodies, please dont cry
Bodies

I been taking all the silver
I been saving all the gold
Im gonna stuff it down the throat
Of a week old corpse
Save that doggone soul
I been saving up my pain
Im gonna give it back in spades
I been strangling the cries 
From the murder of love
Save your soul tonight

Bodies, please dont cry
Bodies, dont die
Bodies, please dont cry
Bodies

I been raising up the dead
Gonna send them to the house of cain
I been praying in light
Of the waning moon
Slay your doggone soul
I been taken out of heaven
I been put upon this world
I been walking up and down, to and fro
Save your doggone soul

Bodies, please dont cry
Bodies, dont die
Bodies, please dont cry
Bodies

I got bodies on the left
I got bodies on the right
I got bodies up and down, all across town
Save you doggone soul---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
