If you feel alive
in a darkened room
do you know the name
of your solitude
if you ain't got the answer
if you don't know the true
if you want the power 
then let it flow through

would you let it go
would you let it go
they cannot end this mourning
of my life

show me 
how the gods kill

if you feel alive
if you got no fear
do you know the name
of the one you seek
if you want the answer
if you want the truth
look inside your empty soul
there you 'll find the noose

would you let it go
would you let it go
they cannot end this mourning
of my life

show me
how the gods kill---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
