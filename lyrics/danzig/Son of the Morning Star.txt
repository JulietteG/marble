Do I need thoughts so cold
Could I feel more alone
Am I more damned than thou
Should I wear tortures crown

Should I live my life a lie
Could I be less alive
Shall I bask in god's light
Shall I fall one more time

(Son of the morning star)
(Son of the morning star)

Should I feel lost somehow
Do I feel less than thou
Could I be less undone
Could I fall deeper down

(Son of the morning star)
(Son of the morning star)---Lyrics submitted by will.
