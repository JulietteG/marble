It takes a makes? to learn,
We're only getting older.
Not that it's my concern,
You only give me shoulder.

Don't you know what's good for you?
I'll tell you if you ask me to
This 225? won't take you far.
Then I not have to remember you 

To the red?
to the reh-eh-eh-ehed
Its not the same as before
its in your he-eh-eh-ehad.
and then he said.

I'm never going to pull through
I told you
There's to promise to be made 
I, can't help you

to the left?
to the red
tell me why I can't help you
the love is dead 

you should know whats good for you.
after all i'll have done for you
don't you know how lucky you are
you are you are you are

I'm never going to pull through
I told you. 
theres promises to be made
I, can't help you

I'm never going to pull through
I told you
there's promises to be made
I, can't help you

I'm never going to pull through
I told you
There's promises to be made 
I can't help you---Lyrics submitted by San Jay.
