It's easiest to say we are young,
It's okay.
You look like someone else
Seasons change, you're not the same
Seasons change, you're not the same
Seasons change, you're not the same

I wait for you outside
In your head, I'm cast aside
I'm taken by surprise
When I stare into your eyes.
I am taken by surprise
I am taken by surprise

Can you be my hardest decision?
Can you be my hardest decision?
Can you be my hardest decision?
Can you be my hardest decision?---Lyrics submitted by Andrian Alifirw.
