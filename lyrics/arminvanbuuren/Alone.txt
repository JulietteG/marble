Everyone is walking on the edge of life 
Like the ghost of a shadow barely alive 
Even time's in a rush but it's going no where 
Everyone's connected, but no one is connecting 
The human of a man has long been missing 
Tell me have you seen it? 
Have you seen it? 

Or are we alone? 
Cause I needed something to believe in 
Tell me are we alone? Where is the light? Where is the feeling? 
Is anybody out there? 
Is anyone listening? 
Is anyone left in this whole world? 
Or are we alone? Alone!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
