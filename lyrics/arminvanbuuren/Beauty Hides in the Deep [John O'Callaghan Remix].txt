Just before dawn comes

Sadness is on

Just one more moment

And I am leaving



Few words on a small note

While you are asleep

I can only steal away

That's how I tend to be



I always wonder

Why don't I feel

What the world out there is like

And how I can fit in



I don't expect you to know me

Or how I lost all my dreams

When I can't even find myself

In the choices I made



I want you to know

I'll never forget you---Lyrics submitted by Vinod.
