JUST A LINE TO LET YOU KNOW
The Fortunes

Just a line to let you know
Im still so very much in love with you
They said that time would heal my broken heart
I found out it isnt true

All the love I have for you
Its very hard to find
I cant get over losing you
No matter how I tried

Love like a summer morning
All and everything you see
Warm and golden like a meadow
I will gladly give if only you come back to me

Just a line to let you know
I havent sleep a wink since youve been gone
I still have your photographs
And memories of all the things weve done

All the letters you wrote to me
After all this time
I cried a river
On every single line

Love like a summer morning
All and everything you see
Warm and golden like a meadow
I would gladly give if only you come back to me

Just a line to let you know
Im still so very much in love with you
La... la la la
La... la la la
