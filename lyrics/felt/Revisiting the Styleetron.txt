Verse 1: 
(MURS)
I grab the mic like my name was on it
and spit the fly game that get the ladies goin
i'm a superfly southern California emcee
makin earthquakes shake and shake destiny

(Slug)
I'm like X, Y, and Z, i stick by the back door
let it go free, that's what the track's for
my jobbie-job is rock a party
taught ya mommy to karaoke loddie-doddie

(MURS)
We blowin up, but the flow is so rough
that them mainstream suckas won't notice us
but so what, who gives a damn?
'bout to change the whole world wit this mic in my hand

(Slug)
yea, make ya stand up, big and tall
pitch the ball, and i promise i'ma hit it y'all
and when it falls, i'll be around the bases
my clothes in a suitcase, my phone and some toothpaste

(MURS)
this is my life
(Slug)
i'm runnin this show
(MURS)
everybody in the place just lose control
(Slug)
turn out the lights
(MURS)
so we can see y'all glow
(Slug)
throw ya hands in the air if you know you got soul

Verse 2:
(Slug)
And it grows, and it builds
until it kills from the pills, bills and drum fills
free will, spin or sit still
everybody just tryin to feel somethin real

(MURS)
Deep down we reach down to teach clowns
how to rip it, how to rock it when the beat pounds
sweet sounds burnin bright throught the speaker
while i'm lookin for a chick in nice jeans and tight sneakers

(Slug)
We the kings of fuckin ya queens up
you can mean mug, i just want the green stuff
out in Boise, set the voice free
up in Omaha, we make em all noisy

(MURS)
Out in Utah, bringin you the truth y'all
talkin Salt Lake all the way to Sioux Falls
and while these fiends on the scene do nothing
we do damage and make it mean something

(Slug)
if you feel this shit
(MURS)
put a smile on ya face
(Slug)
get ya ass on the floor and burn down this place
(MURS)
now if ya filthy rich
(Slug)
or ya minimum wage
(MURS)
let me hear ya make some noise if ya just got paid

Verse 3:
(MURS)
And when the cops come, tell them fools 'stop frontin'
this is our world y'all don't run nothin
don't reach for ya wallet cause you might get shot
screamin 'justice and peace!' til the casket drops

(Slug)
Ha, we can't stop, naw, it's not an option
so put ya hands up, you are now rockin wit
the blessed, so make it messy
about to break the levee, cause the party stays ready

(MURS)
now if ya rich and famous, or broke and seductive
MURS and Slug the wrong crew for you to fuck wit
brainstorm, couldn't hold the flow in buckets
a flash flood warning, don't press ya luck, kid

(Slug)
Uh-huh, North American characters
when i'm on stage it's in my nature to embarrass ya
the pair of us wanna share the rush
now put two up if you care too much, now

(MURS)
i love my job
(Slug)
i'm puttin in work
(MURS)
all the ladies in the crowd, let he hear y'all flirt
(Slug)
FELT don't stop
(MURS)
diggin up the dirt
(Slug)
peace to anybody who's got a 2Pac shirt---Lyrics submitted by Deronte.
