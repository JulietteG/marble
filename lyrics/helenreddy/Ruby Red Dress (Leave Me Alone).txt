Big ole Ruby Red Dress
Wanders round thye town
Talking to herself now
Sometimes sitting down
Don't you get too close now
Ruby runs away
Poor ole Ruby Red Dress
Born on a sorry day
I can hear her saying

(Chorus)
Leave me alone 
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Just leave me
Leave me

Big ole Ruby Red Dress
Everybody laughs
Say sge's got no future
And never made no past
But something hurt thagt Ruby
Something she can't bear
Yolu look at her real close now
You see a little tear
When she says now

(chorus)

Some folks say some farm boy
Up from Tennessee
Taught it all to Ruby
Then just let her be
Her daddy tried to hide it
Tried to keep things cool
But something happened to Ruby
She broke down to a fool
Who just says now

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Tiff.
