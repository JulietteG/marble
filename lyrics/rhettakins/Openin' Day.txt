Leaves are turnin theres a chill in the air
Campfires a burning were sittin round in chairs
Three generations of huntin in our veins
Talkin bout what might happen
On openin day

Weather mans calling for southwest wind 
Gonna have to change my plans
Guess I wont be huntin the power line
Im movin to the boat seat stand
Sighted in my rifle and she sure is shootin straight
But Ill meet up with the gitters yall 
Its opening day

Ive been workin all summer and its sure been hot
Tractor tore up but I planted my plot
Deer trail running through there looks like a highway
Ive got my heart set on that drop tine buck
Theres plenty of room in the back of my truck
Its been a long year but its gonna be worth the wait
Its openin day

4am came early we chugged that coffee down
Headed to the stand with my little man and he didnt make a sound
Sat there til 9:15 and old drop tine didnt show
Saw a couple of squirrels a fat raccoon a possum and a doe

Then outta the blue came cow horn spike and my little boy started to shake
But he manned up and took his very first buck
On openin day---Lyrics submitted by James Krueger.
