now these chicken head hoes see this platinum thick as white gold 
see the 20 inch Pirelli's roll 
mane thank the vogues 
dodgin all my foes 
ridin Cady truck wit dvd 
a flock of broads follow me 
from the club to break they knees 
knowin that's all i want 
straight out tha club 
tha rest ain't smellin right 
the last thang on they mind is freshin up 
its goin down tonight 
weave in they head 
weed in they purse 
still crunk 
baby seats all across the back wit close in the trunk 

(Juicy J) 
i been known to hold my own 
i been known to ride on chrome 
i been known to flip a platinum watch wit the diamond stones 
i'm the fool supplyin tha dro 
i'm tha fool supplyin tha blow 
i'm tha playa who got u chicken heads knockin at my do 
tellin me that you diggin me 
tellin me i'm yo man to be 
girlfriend its gone cost a fee 
get yo rags and work that streets 
pay ya boy and make me rich 
so we keep them swisher's lit 

(???)

cashin it from all you chicks
