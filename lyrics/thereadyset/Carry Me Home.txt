I feel on top of the world.
Across the bar, I saw my ex best girl.
I might make a move, I might make amends.
So I told her this, "I've got a lot on my mind and
Got you a drink.
If you'd like to go, baby, let's roll.
And can I come home?"

Then she said,
"Shut up, don't you speak.
You do this to me every week.
And I won't carry you home, carry you home."

Oh, girl, you got me so fucked up
That I could run around my world,
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home.

Saying words, don't know what they mean.
But I know you belong with me.
I think I better slow down, slow it down.

She's like, "Don't come around, then.
I should just be alone."
I know you're making a joke.
I'm coming back home.

Then she said,
"Shut up, don't you speak.
You do this to me every week.
And I won't carry you home, carry you home."

Oh, girl, you got me so fucked up
That I could run around my world,
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home.

Carry me home, carry me home.

Lovestruck, I am oblivious.
Oh yes, you know, know.
For you, I don't mind making
A fool of myself, no, no.
It goes a lot like this.

I got plans and a feeling.
It's no ordinary feeling, no.
I'm on a roll, I'm coming back home.

Then she said,
"Shut up, don't you speak.
You do this to me every week.
And I won't carry you home, carry you home."

Oh, girl, you got me so fucked up
That I could run around my world,
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home.

Carry me home, carry me home.
Carry me home, carry me home.

Then she said,
"Shut up, don't you speak.
You do this to me every week.
And I won't carry you home, carry you home."

Oh, girl, you got me so fucked up
That I could run around my world,
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home.

But I won't, so carry me home,
Carry me home.
But I won't, so carry me home,
Carry me home.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
