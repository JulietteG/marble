My mind has left the building and I shouldn't be speaking,
But now I can, so I will, and to tell you the truth,
It's that these terrible things that she's done to me
Tend to creep into my dreams and it's impossible to sleep.

And to my left, it's a beauty, Sleeping Beauty.
Yeah, she's pretty, but by now, 
I'm quickly finding out that looks can be deceiving.
And I'd say it to her face, but I'd miss the taste
Of blood in my mouth when she is knocking me out.

Rock bottom, have I sold my soul?
I don't wanna, wanna know.

I'm gonna fall back to back to back in love with you.
I'll take the black and blues.
I've got everything to lose.
I'm gonna fall back to back to back I love with you.
What else can I do?
I've got everything that I should lose.
Everything I gotta lose.

The arrow missed, oh, the mark.
And now I'm finally finding out,
Having doubts, she's been bringing me down.
It's been a terrible dry spell.
The last time the rain fell,
We had only met, and this was prior to our debt.

We're going out.
Better get her, wish I never met her.
But I did, so I do everything and it's clear
She was so greatly, she seems to hate me.
Head in the clouds, I let her knock me out.

Rock bottom, have I sold my soul?
I don't wanna, wanna know.

I'm gonna fall back to back to back in love with you.
I'll take the black and blues.
I've got everything to lose.
I'm gonna fall back to back to back I love with you.
What else can I do?
I've got everything that I should lose.
Everything I gotta lose.

It's time to leave you and stop pretending
That it's worth mending, yeah.
It's time to let my love break free.
It's time to take my heart in my own hands,
In my own hands, yeah.
Cause you were all I'll ever need.

I'll fall back to back to back in love with you.
I'll take the black and blues.
I've got everything to lose.

Bto back to back in love with you.
I'll take the black and blues.
I've got everything to lose.
I'm gonna fall back to back to back in love with you.
What else can I do?
I've got everything that I should lose.
Everything I gotta lose.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
