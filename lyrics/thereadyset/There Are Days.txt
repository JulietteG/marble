And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh

I've been asleep since Monday morning
But I won't let time control me
Putting in my two weeks now
Yeah, yeah

And everyday it's hard believing
It's getting worse each night I'm dreaming
In one split second I'm falling back
Yeah, yeah

It's all perfect in my life
Perfect in my life

I wave hello to the world
If you're falling down
I will catch you now
Watch from the stars and see
That you're falling down
I will catch you now

A monumental mess worth meeting
I took a couple more nights
Stuck staring at the ceiling
Oh do I really feel this way
Yeah, yeah

Cause I'm a spector spectating
Wishing I could feel the warmth of spring
And it's thoughts like this that keep me up
Yeah, yeah

It's so perfect in my life
Perfect in my life

I wave hello to the world
If you're falling down
I will catch you now
Watch from the stars and see
That you're falling down
I will catch you now

And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh
And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh

There are days
When I would rather be alone
Not picking up the phone
It feels like I've been set free
But there is never a time
I wish I was gonna
Whoah, whoah

I wave hello to the world
If you're falling down
I will catch you now
Watch from the stars and see
That you're falling down
I will catch you now

And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh
And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh
And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh
And I'll catch you now
Oh catch you now
Oh catch you now, oh---Lyrics submitted by Alexis.
