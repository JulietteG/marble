the way that i acted, so irrational.
you saw me lying useless on the asphalt.
and that other girl, i'm pretty sure she didn't know.
played out with cables but i jumped it so it's not slow.

and was i everything you asked for now?
and was i everything you asked for now?
Take what you can get

so when a robot falls in love, we clap clap.
i saw an angel from above, i had a heart attack,
and i awoke with blood on my nose,
'cause everyone's an enemy and everyone's a memory,
and i am so sick of this town.

so what would you say,
we leave just you and me?
and we can make some memories.
we'll drive to the south, live on some texas beach,
our lives will be in perfect harmony.

so was i everything you asked for now?
under the floorboards, inside the walls, i am you.
the vampire's smile has got you here,
any last words now?

so when a robot falls in love, we clap clap.
i saw an angel from above, i had a heart attack,
and i awoke with blood on my nose,
'cause everyone's an enemy and everyone's a memory,
and i am so sick of this
I am so sick of this.


if i could see you fall in love, i'd clap clap,
'cause you're an angel from above, giving me heart attacks.
and you awoke with blood all on your nose.
'cause everyone's a enemy and everyone's an memory
and i am so sick of this town.

don't give up anything you want,
'cause it all comes in time
lately i've been having these dreams,
i saved my spot in line

the only things i'm sure of, baby, you will hear right now
i'm feeling more than touch my words have said enough
i swear that what i love is what i'll live.
sing with conviction, be sincere
