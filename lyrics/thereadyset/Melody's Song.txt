assuming i know the people around
they're moving to downtown
they're learning to get down
let me stay here
i'm glad that they lost their fears
i'm glad that they cut their tears
cause i'm over that

and change can
run around your head
kill your thoughts and say hey
baby you're spinning around and all out of control
lately
oh, it's amazing
i'm not letting it phase me
but i'm feeling alive tonight

you spelled my name
when i was young, i need you right there
ran so fast, so fast
you stayed the same
oh melody, i hope that you care, you care, you care, you care
girls on the west coast, sing it like you used to
boys on the east coast, scream with some heart

six years
and i'm learning about the darker side
i'm getting a feel for the faster life
i took some time
long nights
and the drives we made through
oh, what i did for you
well it took some time

you spelled my name
when i was young, i need you right there
ran so fast, so fast
you stayed the same
oh melody, i hope that you care, you care, you care, you care

and i never see the world without you
and i'm all about 
how it's gonna be
and i'm all about
how it's gonna be
and you open up the world around me

i couldn't have made it through
i'm counting all my debts in my head, in my head

you spelled my name
when i was young, i need you right there
ran so fast, so fast
you stayed the same
oh melody, i hope that you care, you care, you care, you care
girls on the west coast, sing it like you used to
boys on the east coast, scream with some heart
i'll write a song to remember where i came from
just give me that sound i'll be fine---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
