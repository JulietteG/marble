you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

started out with a single touch
if i said i'd leave, it'd be a bluff
i'm locked and loaded, it's so clear
i'm alone, i'm insane
she's my hometown hurricane
the weather's bitter from out here
i can think, i can dream of you
but that gets so quizzical
and maybe i'm a bit less suitable

shine like a centerfold
tore out your page, i'll keep you right here
my head is spinnin' now
rotate and turn my world around here

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

run away, it's a test
if i fail, i must confess
my mind will wander at times, dear
i'm alone, i'm insane
it's the only price i pay
to ride the storm out, with the sights so clear
i can think, i can dream of you
and it comes off lyrical
you stole the show

shine like a centerfold
tore out your page, i'll keep you right here
my head is spinnin' round
rotate and turn my world around here

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

oh, you're irresistible
i can't get a grip, i know
focused on your moving so slow
am i predictable
you've heard it before i know
but it's alright, alright, alright

shine like a centerfold
tore out your page, i'll keep you right here
my head is spinnin' round
rotate and turn my world around here

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around

you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around
you keep spinnin' around---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
