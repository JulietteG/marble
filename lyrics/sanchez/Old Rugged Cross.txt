On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffring and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

    Refrain:
    So Ill cherish the old rugged cross,
    Till my trophies at last I lay down;
    I will cling to the old rugged cross,
    And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then Hell call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever Ill share.

Refrain:
    So Ill cherish the old rugged cross,
    Till my trophies at last I lay down;
    I will cling(cling) to the old rugged cross,
    And exchange it some day for a crown

Je Je Je Je I love your name sweet refrain the name of God and so......(repeat refrain)---Lyrics submitted by Joe Mikes.
