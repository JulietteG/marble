Verse 1
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part

Chorus:
Each night I ask
The stars up above
Why must I be
A teenager in love?

Verse 2:
One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess, I'll learn to take
The good with the bad

Chorus

Verse 3
I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one, if you
Should say we're through
Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Chorus
