Scared to look ahead
Instead I fold my arms waiting
The trains arriving with the goodies I'm entitled to
All along I never felt I got what I deserved
Oh what a shame (why me why me)

I never take a thing for granted
I'll never be a hypocrite
(what would you know)

Fly, watch your fucking sunset
I can't remember when I ever heard you say
Thank you for everything you gave I'm so thankful
(hang on) to your fallen sunset

Don't you see I'm talking can't you wait until I'm done
Hold on a second here's another one you haven't heard
You think you're owed the world well look at me
I'm owed it too (your feelin sorry for yourself once again)

I never take a thing for granted
I'll never be a hypocrite
(can't stand to hear you)
Always taking things for granted
You're such a hypocrite
(what would you know)

Fly, watch your fucking sunset
I can't remember when I ever heard you say
Thank you for everything you gave I'm so thankful
(fly) watch your fuckin sunset

Come away with me
I'll show you the way to happiness
Then is when you'll see
The peace that'll put your mind to rest
Come with me come with me
Ease your bad memories
You made your choice
You're so fucked up go

Fly, watch your fucking sunset
I can't remember when I ever heard you say
Thank you for everything you gave I'm so thankful
(hang on) to your fuckin sunset
(fly)---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
