(verse 1)
A universe to fill
I cant scratch the surface now
A slow pay still
Why is everyone watching?

It's like im real tired of the clones
I'm real tired of the clones

(chorus)
Whatever you, you say 
Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light 
Make my life worth something more 
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light 
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

(verse 2)
Where is the space I fill
Where is the sympathy I kill
I need to find a meaning 
I'm useless, I'm useless
Trapped inside my own web

(chorus)
Whatever you, you say 
Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light 
Bring a light

Bring me a light 
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

(bridge)
When I'm all alone
I stare at nothingness
Painful silence
Painful silence

KILLS

(chorus)
Bring me a light 
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Whatever you say
Whatever you, you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light---Lyrics submitted by John.
