So sick I can't swallow
So green I can't follow
So weak I can crumble
So we have all crumbled

Wipe my face - get up again
get up again
Wipe my face - get up again
get up again

So you think you ca wander my soul
Pick me up I'm a fuck
I'm a bastard
So weak I can crumble
So we have all crumbled

Wipe my face - get up again
get up again (repeat)

I wish you knew how it could be
A broken soul - now you will see
I wish you knew how it could be
A broken life now you will see - with me

So sick I can't swallow
So green I can't follow
So weak I can crumble
So we have all crumbled

Wipe my face - get up again
get up again
Wipe my face - get up again
get up again
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Clayton.
