Bleeding soul - I feel I'm dying
I persist - I persist - I think I'm hiding
I've lost my soul - No happiness
I feel so...

Are you ashamed
- of what you've become
You call my name ___
You call my name ___ I try to run
I've lost m soul ___ no happiness
I feel so...
What did you say? (what did you say?)
I don't understand
Why I feel this way (why do I feel so...)

Bleeding soul - I feel I'm dying
I persist - I persist - I think I'm hiding
I've lost my soul - for happiness
I feel so...

What did you say? (what did you say?)
I don't understand
Why I feel this way
I feel so...

What did you say?
I don't understand
Why I feel this way (why do I feel so...)
I've...lost...my...

What did you say? (what did you say?)
I don't understand
Why I feel this way
