Again I try & change my ways
Something for some reason
Takes me from you again
Time nor season (season)
Burnin' for a reason
Killin' myself with guilt
Gave nothin' - taking all
How my life has changed - Repeat
Was it ever sacred

Feel it...
Let it go...
I know
I know...what you...feel

Step down on the silvering snake
Rescue yourself from the prick
End it
Make it fade

Can I get witness
Can I get witness from this rage (Rage)
Suffocate
From the pain
What the fuck - can't believe what you said
Motherfuckers our there
Don't even know me
Gave nothin' - takin' all
How my life has changed
Feel it...
Let it go...
I know (what you said)

Step down on the slivering snake
Rescue yourself from the prick
End it, make it fade

Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up (repeat)

Feel it...
Let it go...
I know

Step down on the slivering snake
Rescue yourself from the prick
End it, make it fade
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Clayton.
