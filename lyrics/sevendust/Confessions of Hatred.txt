Impossible to reason with the thoughts in mind
To direct to forget about my pastimes
I assure you of one thing
This is something you'll never forget

In time I'm sure you'll understand
That the sound of the crack
The slap of my hand was only intended for one thing
The one thing I never had

Palms sweaty - thoughts dry
Hand fed by a broken mind
Hands shak'n - don't cry it'll all be over

And then you'll have the chance to see the hole inside
The painted picture of a wounded mind
I can never escape this
(you helped me create this hate)

(my - undying - addiction)
How were you the last to know
(you - brought - this - on - yourself)
Now you're the next in line to see
All that I've become
(confessions of hatred)

Responsible for bringing out my darkest side
I tried to hide what I feel but it's my time
To inflict all the damage
Some indescribable pain

Heart beating, last cry
Anticipating what I have in mind
Lick my lips an approach you
(with undeniable fucking hate)

(my - undying - addiction)
How were you the last to know
(you - brought - this - on - yourself)
Now you're the next in line to see
All that I've become
(confessions of hatred)

One day I'll become whole again
Till then I'll just remember
I thought you understood being misunderstood
How wrong was I to think you ever would?
One day I'll become whole again, whole again

(my undying addiction)
I never thought you'd be the last to know
(you brought this all on yourself now)
You will be the next in line to see
All that I've become
Victim till your last breath
All the hope is gone
(confessions of hatred)

(I'll show you pain)---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
