Forever after
You killed my laughter
All I've done
Doesn't matter...sell
Create...Create...Create

Head trip drama
With your head so in the cloud
Never be the same
Never forget the pain

Head trip drama
With your head so in the cloud
Never be the same
Never forget the pain

Stuck in my head
Every word you said
And all of you is dead
Create...Create...Create
Create - Self-Destruction
Create - Self-Destruction
Create - Self-Destruction

Head trip drama
With your head so in the cloud
Never be the same
Never forget the pain

Head trip drama
With your head so in the cloud
Never be the same
Never forget the pain

Head trip drama
With your head so in the cloud

Create - Self-Destruction
Create - Self-Destruction
Create - Self-Destruction

Create - Head trip drama
Create - With your head so in the cloud
Create - Never be the same
Never forget the pain

Create - Head trip drama
Create - With your head so in the
Cloud - Self-Destruction
Never be the same - Self-Destruction---Lyrics submitted by Clayton.
