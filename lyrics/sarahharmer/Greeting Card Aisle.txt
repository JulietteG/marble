I see twinkling in the window
It's a sparkle on the snow
Hovering to see if I can see you come and go

I came down the dark road, arms under my coat
and my breath is nearly freezing my eyes closed.

The car that dropped me off
did it turn around 
and watch me walk the long way down
past the glow of town like a setting sun?
Horizon's alive with electric light and hum.

Were you standing in the greeting card aisle
when you called me up
and held me to the end of the long line?
Have you got me in your bleeding heart file 
next to Lady Luck?
Well this light of your life has drawn the blind.

There was something about the handwriting
that made me keep every scrap
Something about the way the eyes 
looked away at the last.
I've kept something burning on the sill real low
but now I don't know...

Were you standing in the greeting card aisle
when you called me up
and held me to the end of the long line?
Have you got me in your bleeding heart file
next to Lady Luck?
Well this light of your life has drawn the blind.

The wind from the river will swirl like a scream
and wrap itself 'round you.
There may be a friend somewhere down the road
but from here you have to walk it out alone.

'cause you were standing in the greeting card aisle when you called me up
and held me to the end of your long line.
And you've got me in your bleeding heart file
next to Lady Luck
and this light of your life
will not shine twice
this light has drawn the blind.---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
