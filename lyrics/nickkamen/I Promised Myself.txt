I Promised myself
I Promised Id wait for you
The midnight hour
I know youre shine on through

I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

How many of us out there
Feel the need to run and look for shelter

I promised myself 
That Id say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all you wish comes true

I promised myself
That Id make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know Im in love with you

How many of us out there
Feel the pain, of losing what was once there
God I know what people say about her
No mistake,  who can live without love

How many of us out there 
Feel the pain, of losing what was once there
God I know what people say about her
No mistake, who can live without love

I promised myself
I promised Id wait for you
The midnight hour
I know youll shine on through

I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You make my dreams come true

In the midnight hour I will wait for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you---Lyrics submitted by mattias.
