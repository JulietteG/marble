Your mother wants to know when youre coming home for the weekend
She wants to know if youre ever gonna talk to your brother again
She has some cash if you need it
She knows what she did and she didnt mean it

Your mother wants to know how much you remember
She wants you to like her, so try to forget
And shes sorry for all the abuse
What happened to you when you were a kid

Tell her anything
Tell her anything
Tell her
Tell her Im not home

Your mother has a lot of things shed like to get off her chest
Your mother wants to know if youve ever wished that you were dead
She wants to know if youve ever wished that you were dead

Tell her anything
Tell her anything
Tell her anything
Tell her anything
She wants to know if you remember
She wants to ask you to forget (Tell her)
Tell her
Tell her Im not home (Im not home)---Lyrics submitted by caitlin oconnor.
