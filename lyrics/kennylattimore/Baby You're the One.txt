Baby you're the one, you the only one
So know that I'll do anything just to keep you close
That's how it's gotta be, just so I can breathe
Say you'll be with me
Share my world and be my girl

Thirty seconds ago we just got finished talkin on the phone
And even though we talked for hours, why am I feeling all alone?
Could it be that I just never got enough of hearing your tone, your sexy tone
Cause if being here without you girl is right, I guess I'm gonna be wrong
Cos you're the only one

[Chorus]
Baby you're the one, you the only one
So know that I'll do anything just to keep you close
That's how it's gotta be, just so I can breathe
Say you'll be with me
Share my world and be my girl

My girl, see what it all comes down to
Is you're definitely where I need to be
And where I'm gonna be
Four hundred acres and a horse, picture it a mansion on the beach
Spending time with you, that's all I wanna do
The situations clear, I gotta have you near

[Chorus X 2]
Baby you're the one, you the only one
So know that I'll do anything just to keep you close
That's how it's gotta be, just so I can breathe
Say you'll be with me
Share my world and be my girl.

[Bridge]
I want to share special times with you here
Never let you go no, keep you in my arms and hold you close
Real close
I want to spend every minute with you
Never let you go keep you in my arms and hold you close
Real close, you're the only one.

[Chorus X 3]
Baby you're the one, you the only one
So know that I'll do anything just to keep you close
That's how it's gotta be, just so I can breathe
Say you'll be with me
Share my world and be my girl.---Lyrics submitted by BabeAv.
