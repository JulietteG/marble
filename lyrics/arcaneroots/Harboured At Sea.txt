It's been loud on the streets at the earliest moment
Fall asleep to the sea just to show that we care
And the memories were made just as soon as we saw them here

Show the sun to the East just as soon as we saw him
And the hope that we keep will have shown you we care
And now that we know that it comes with no warning here

So live like someone, who doesn't know they've risen and fallen
Give like someone, who doesn't know that they're here

And all the fault will be left from the way that we saw them
And all the thought will be spent on the ways we had left
I will know that the plea is just to ignore them here

So live like someone, who doesn't know they've risen and fallen
Give like someone, who doesn't know that they're here---Lyrics submitted by Sue Herbert.
