I was demanding to be the oh so strong
Truth be told I only want myself to tag along
Following my shadow, loaded with guilt
See what I didn't know was, patching up only
Makes a quilt

Have too much pleasure from illusions of right
It seems I'd rather lose a friend then a fight
But I'm not young enough to know everything
See what I do know is
My alter ego is up-coming

I'm slippin
Cause I can't get me off of this throne
I'm slippin
Its too much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin
Cause I can't get me off this throne
Cause I can't get me off of this throne its too
Much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin

I'm slippin

Use persuasion as my strongest approach
I preach my wisdom as a neat friendly poach
Respect you don't get, its something you owe
If your can't do what I do its cause
You reap what you sow

Taking my time sharing my week
Yeah I am good at listening when I hear myself
Speak
Once I swell attention tasted
Enough want do
Every weekend I am wasted

I'm slippin
Cause I can't get me off of this throne
I'm slippin
Its too much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin
Cause I can't get me off this throne
Cause I can't get me off of this throne its too
Much of a comfort zone
I'm slippin

Oooooooo . . . 

Once I swell attention tasted
Enough want to 
Every weekend I'm wasted---Lyrics submitted by Kolton Lane Landreth.
