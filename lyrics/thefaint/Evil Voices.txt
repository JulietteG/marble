I write down my nightmares
Stalk my dreams
Undress my future
Decode my enemies

I give hope my money
But waste my time
Give ghosts attention
When they need denial

Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices

No ghosts to side with
No glyphs to hang
I can't fight the prophet
No one sees him

Stare through these eyelids
Deep mirror gorge
But why the eye the inside the mind to fill the void

Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices

Evil voices
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone

Lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices---
