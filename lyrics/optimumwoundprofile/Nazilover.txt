It's war vs zog reborn 
With a rod for God 

As a prop for a weak ego that needs absolute white control

Their pride is violated
Their thoughts are cable regulated

They peddle their electric hate contaminate state to state

They mourn for the death of a nation
Their time spent perpetuating

The myth of a caucasian Christ to prove right the anaemic life

So get loaded up for penetration proud man in their Aryan nation

They play with superior toys but their games are all for sick little boys 
The grand dragon is a phallic name 
They use to hide his impotent state

Face masked by a secret shame
The real length of the snake
Spread hate with genetic lies
Castrate and sterilize

At the gates of a molecular hell 
Stands a Reaper with a sickle cell

Their order... is just a friendly metaphor 
For club law... with a 44 more 
Goosestepping... with the NRA
When they can feel... their grip slipping away---Lyrics submitted by SkullSplitter.
