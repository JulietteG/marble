Hold up girl, just wind it slow
Hold up girl, just wind it slow
Hold up girl 

Shes a twerkoholic, shes a twerkoholic 
Shes a twerkoholic, she needs me to get her started 
My love is gonna get her faded 
She said my love is so intoxicating 

Ride, ride, ride my lovin 
Baby ride my love and dont stop 
Baby ride, ride, ride my lovin 
Baby ride my love and dont stop 
(Baby!) 

If you stay with me Ill do this verse 
Ill be your designated driver, girl 
I wanna take you home 
Straight to the bed, lets skip the pillow talk 

I know that I deserve you 
Baby show me what that twerk do 
Baby show me what that twerk do 
Show me how you work you too 

Hold up girl, just wind it slow 
Imma take you where you tryna go 
She gon need rehab fo sure 
Cus everywhere that she go 

Hold up, let me clear my throat (uhhhm) 

Shes a twerkoholic, shes a twerkoholic

Baby ride, ride, ride my lovin 
Baby ride my love and dont stop

All I wanna do is throw stacks 
Baby go ahead and look back, go on and look back at it 
Girl you got, you got it 
Show them other girls that you know just what you are 

Hold up girl, just wind it slow 
Imma take you where you tryna go 
She gon need rehab fo sure 
Cus everywhere that she go 

Hold up, let me clear my throat (uhhhm)
