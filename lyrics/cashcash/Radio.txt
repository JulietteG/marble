Every year i feel the same
I hate the man and loose the game
Now i find myself on top
No where to start don't wanna stop

I love these, lovely nights i'm on the clock
Working late it never stops
I'll be your electric shock
And with a song i'll have your heart

[chorus]
If i'm on the radio radio
Would you still love me so
Or would you turn me off your stereo stereo
Will  you be at the show screaming one last song toningt 

Wake up kid let's look for gold
This year's the year i sold
I signed my name and sod my soul
I took the risk don't want to know 

[chorus X2]

I wish i could live like this forever
And sing my days and days away
There's always the choise beside me
Of leaving this underground
And if i pack up my bags around me 
Will you be filled with hate or stuck with love, love, love

[chorus]
Radio radio
One last song tonight 
Radio radio radio radio
One last song tonight

Every year i feel the same
I hate the man and loose the the game 
Now i find myself on top
No where to start don't wanna stop---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
