One two three

I been running from the pain
Trying not to feel the same
But it's a shame that we're sinking
See my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant
So you try to fill it in

You say "I can fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving darling"
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

But love, pray for me
I never had somebody
So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

I know it's been a while
Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

You say "I can fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving darling"
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

But love, pray for me
I never had somebody
So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love
How to love
How to love
So I can learn how to love
How to love
How to love
How to love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, oh
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love
(Need somebody now
How to love, love
How to love, love)---
