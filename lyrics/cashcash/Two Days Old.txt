Some one to blame
The reason why you left him a mess and
Without a sign
He was first
I was next
But enough to make you leave his side

But do you know?
Do you know what happens next?
As he's torn apart
Left thinking

She got on a plane 
And they're miles apart
Dug a little hole then she buried his heart
With the one she trusts
And they're on the run
Tears fall like the rain
I feel a little bad when I think of the pain
That you put him through
Am I such a fool?
Oh
Yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah

Yeah here we are
And every line I say seems to come out
Right on time
Its the first, nonetheless, just enough
To keep you where you, are

But will it change?
Will I be the one the next one hurt?
Or the next one to complain that 

She got on a plane
And theyre miles apart
Dug a little hole then she buried his heart
With the one she trusts
And theyre on the run
Tears fall like the rain
I feel a little bad when I think of the pain
That you put him through
Am I such a fool?
Such a fool
Oh

She'll move on
She'll move on
She'll move on (what you waiting for?)

She got on a plane
And theyre miles apart
She dug a big hole then buried my heart
With the one she trusts
And theyre on the run
Tears fall like the rain
I feel pretty bad when I think of the pain
That you put me through
Am I such a fool?
Oh
Yeah

So what am I waiting for?
Yeah, well she keeps running
She keeps running

She's moved on
She's moved on
She's moved on
She's moved on---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
