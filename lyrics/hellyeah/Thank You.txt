So many things i didn't say is it too late now that you've gone away
So many words so many ways if you can here me now there's something i got to say


                        Just one more talk 
Just one more touch 
If ones to much then

I just want to say Thank you for everything 
you've ever done for me    (done for me)
 I just want to say Thank you for all the things for saving me (saving me)

So many times
So many day's
you helped me threw 
walked me threw the rain 
So many tears have washed away
If you can hear my voice there's something i have to say  

Just one more talk 
Just one more touch
If ones to much then 

I just want to say Thank you for everything 
you've ever done for me (done for me )
I just want to say Thank you for all the things for saving me (saving me)

It's been so   long    they say time will heal everything could you
send me a sign to fill the hole in my life turn on a light 
to help me see threw it all  no one left to rescue me    save me 

Just one more talk 
Just one more touch 
If ones to much then 

I just want to say Thank you for everything
you've ever done for me (done for me)
I just want to say Thank you for all the things for saving me (saving me)

I just wanted to say Thank you mother, Thank you father,
Thank you sister for saving me 

I just wanted to say Thank you brother, Thank you daughter,
Thank you my best friends---Lyrics submitted by maggie.
