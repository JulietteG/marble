I love you
I love you honey I
Love you I do
More than you ever know
It's for sure you can always count on my love for ever more
I
Need you
I need you baby I
Need you right now
Say can you understand your my man
And my one desire is keeping you satisfied

[Bridge:]
Baby when we
When we're together say
I'm alright and your alright it's like paradise
I just want you to know how I feel
How I feel

Oh I want you
I want you sugar I
Want you so bad
I got a burning desire my soul's on fire
Can't you see you are my everything

Baby when we
When we're together say
I'm alright and your alright it's like paradise
I just want you to know how I feel
How I feel

Oh I love you
I love you honey I
Love you I do
More than you ever know
It's for sure
You can always count on my love for ever more

I love and need and want you baby
I love and need and want you baby
I love and need and want you baby
Love and need and want you baby
I love and need and want you baby
Love and need and want you baby

You can count on me for ever more
I love
And I need
And I want
You
I got this burning desire
My soul's on fire
You can't count on me for ever more
I love
Baby I need
Baby I want
Your love
Oh I Love you
I need you
You can always count on my love for ever more
