i got something to say,
I killed a baby today and it,
doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead!
I got something to say,
I raped your mother today and it,
doesn't matter much to me as long as she spread!

Sweet lovely death,
I am waiting for your breath
Oh sweet death, 
one last caress

Go!

sweet lovely death, 
I am waiting for your breath,
Oh sweet death,
one last caress

Well I got something to say,
I killed your baby today and it
doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead

sweet lovely death,
I am waiting for your breath
Oh sweet death, 
one last caress

One last caress, sweet death
One last caress, sweet death
oh oh oh! 
oh oh oh! oh oh oh oh!
oh oh!
oh oh oh!
oh!---Lyrics submitted by dman.
