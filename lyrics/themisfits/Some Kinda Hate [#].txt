There's some kinda love
And there's some kinda hate
The maggots in the eye of love
Won't copulate

And it's a woah oh oh oh oh
And it's a woah oh oh oh oh
And it's a woah oh oh oh oh
I said woah woah oh, oh oh oh

Hear the cats cry
Little tortured babies in pain
Cracked necks by settled limbs
They don't hesitate

And it's a woah oh oh oh oh
Baby woah oh oh oh oh
And it's a woah oh oh oh oh
I said woah, woah, oh

There's some kinda love
And there is some kinda hate
I'm gonna tell you all about it now
The maggots in the eye of love
Won't copulate

And it's a woah oh oh oh oh
Baby woah oh oh oh oh
Baby woah oh oh oh oh
I said woah woah oh, woah oh---Lyrics submitted by Nickenstein.
