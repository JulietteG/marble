If I cut off your arms
and cut off your legs
would you still love me
anyway?

If your bound and your gagged
draped and displayed
would you still love me
anyway?

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

If I cut off your arms
and cut off your legs
would you still love me
anyway?

If your bound and your gagged
draped and displayed
would you still love me
Love me anyway?

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

GO!!!

Cutting with the knife,
blood is spilling everywhere.
She will be my wife,
secondary spine.
Incisions must be accurate,
I don't know what to do.
My hands are trembling,
I cant spare
to slip up with this
KNIFE!!!

Her beauty is so illogical,
the beats come flying in.
Hideous chameleon,
just stripped down to her skin.

Dance to the burning flame,
dance till you soothe the pain,
run backwards into drain.
Dance Helena, Dance!

Whoa 

If I cut off your arms
and I cut off your legs
would you still love me
anyway?

There's a spot on the floor
where your limbs used to be
and I close the door
on my fantasies.        Why don't you love me anyway?
         fantasies.        Why don't you love me anyway?

         Helena!           Why don't you love me anyway?
         HELENA!          Why don't you love me 
 ANYWAY?---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
