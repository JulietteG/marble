Good Evening, ha ha ha

I was working in the lab, late one night
When my mind beheld an eery sight
My monster in this lab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

-He did the mash
He did the monster mash
=The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
=He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
-He did the mash
He did the monster mash

Well, from my laboratory, the castle's ease (unsure)
 To the master bedroom, where vampires feed
The ghouls all hang from the humble and bones
Get a jolt from my electrode!

-They did the mash
They did the monster mash
-The monster mash
It was a grave yard smash
-They did the mash
They caught on in a flash
-They did the mash
They did the monster mash

Zombies where - having fun
They party had just begun
The guest included Wolf Man, 
Drakula and his son.

The scene was working all the digging sound
Eager and chained but by his bank account
The carpet baggers were about to arrive
With their local group, the grip keep a fire

-They played the mash
They played the monster mash
-The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
-They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
-They played the mash
They played the monster mash

Out of his coffin *unsure*
Seems he was trouble by just one thing
Open the lid, shook his fist and said
"Whatever happened to my child victim again?"

-It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
-The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
-It's mow the mash
It caught on in a flash
-It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash

Now everything is cool that is apart of the band
My monster mash is a hit of the land
For you, the living is a document too (unsure)
Well you can kiss my door tell them all I sent you

-Now you can mash
Then you can monster mash
-The monster mash
And not a graveyard smash
-Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
-Then you can mash
Yeah! You can monster mash!

-The monster mash- aoooooh!
-The monster mash- haha ha haha
-The monster mash- monster mash!
Monster mash! -the monster mash-
Monster! -The monster mash!- Mash! *together*
You can mash
-The monster mash
Oooh, monster mash
-The monster mash
Monster -the monster mash- mash---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
