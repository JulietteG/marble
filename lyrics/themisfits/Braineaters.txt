Hey hey hey

 Brains for dinner, brains for lunch
 Brains for breakfast, brains for brunch
 Brains at every single meal
 Why can't we have some guts, hey hey hey

 Brains are all we ever get
 In this rotten fuckin' place, hey hey hey
 Brains are all we ever get
 Why can't we have a change of pace

 Brains for dinner, brains for lunch
 Brains for breakfast, brains for brunch
 Brains at every single meal
 Why can't we have some guts, hey hey hey
 Why can't we have some guts, hey hey
 Why can't we have some fuckin' rotten guts
 Hey hey hey---Lyrics submitted by Brian Peterson.
