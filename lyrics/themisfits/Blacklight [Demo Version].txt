A pounding pulse stirs anxious feelings inside, sick breaths of undead life.
"Help me angels of evil" cried the children of the night. 
Take this wasted mortal life, melt me into blacklight.
Lie on the floor and let the body die. Become the beast in which you fear.
"Help me angels of evil" cried the children of the night. 
Take this wasted mortal life, melt me into blacklight.
"Help me angels of evil" cried the children of the night. 
Take this wasted mortal life, melt me into blacklight.
Ooooohhhhh..GO!---Lyrics submitted by Siobhan.
