The corpses all hangin' headless and limp, 
Bodies with no surprises 
And the blood drains down like devil's rain 
We'll bathe tonight. 

I want your skull 
I need your skull 
I want your skull 
I need your skull 

Demon I am and face I peel, 
Seen skin turned inside out, 
'Cause I gotta have you on my wall, 
Gotta have you on my wall 'cause 

I want your skull 
I need your skull 
I want your skull 
I need your skull 

GO!

Collect the heads of little girls and put 'em on my wall,
Hack the heads off little girls and put 'em on my wall 

HO!

HOOOO!

I want your skull 
I need your skull 
I want your skull 
I need your skull 
I want your skull 
I need your skull 
I want your skull 
I need your skull 

GO-OH!---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
