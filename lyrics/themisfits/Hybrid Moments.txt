If your gonna scream, you scream with me.
Moments like this never last.

When new creatures rape your face,
Hybrids opened up the door.

Oooh Baby, when you cry,
Your face is momentary..
You hide your looks behind these scars...

In hybrid moments..
Give me a moment.
Give me a moment,
Give me your moment..

Oooh baby, when you cry,
Your face is momentary..
You hide your looks behind these scars...

In hybrid moments,
In hybrid moments.
In hybrid moments,
In hybrid moments.
Give me a moment,
Give me your moment.---Lyrics submitted by Nickenstein.
