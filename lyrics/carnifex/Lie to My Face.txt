The scars on my arms remind me 
How I got this way 
I can taste the stain of your sickness on my lips 
Of all the stupid things I did
I fell for this 

I'll ask again like you never knew
Lie to me
What the Fuck!
Just lie to me
"Were gonna make it through" 
I'm well past wanting the truth 

Just lie to me
"I'll always love you" 

Lie to my face

The scars on my arms remind me how I got this way 
I'll ask again like you never knew 
Just lie to me 
"I'll always love you"---Lyrics submitted by siena.
