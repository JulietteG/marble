This is hate and all the passion that goes with it.
this is love and all the sickness tha i feel because of you,
because of you
I crowned you during death; Adornment of my dying bride
In coalesce with filth and faith;
secrets of my heart pour black like decide.
Cracked mirrors look back and laugh.
Thoughts crush my mind
Secrets of my heart pour black like decide.
One of these nights I promise,
I'll watch you die.
When the tables were turned,
I'll watch you die.
Lifeless and empty, your absence is killing me.
Let the past die. You were always dead in my eyes.
Because of you,this is hate, this is hate.
Because of you, this is hate.---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
