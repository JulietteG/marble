Walking down the hall 
They said they heard you scream you'd miss me 
As you're choking in my arms 
All I want to hear is "I'm sorry" 

I want to drown myself in the stillness of your eyes 
I want to drown myself in the emptiness of my lies 

Faith can only take her so far 
Now these tears fall like embers 
Burning her skin pushing her further and further 

A tunnel so dark all I could focus on was you 
Broken I fell before your hanging body 
Desparate for life 
Desparate to hear you call me 

Walking down the hall 
They said they heard you scream you'd miss me 
As you're dead in my arms 
All I want to hear is "I'm sorry"---Lyrics submitted by cody.
