I aint heard from you baby so whats happenin
I know its been in a minute I been out here rappin and
But see your on my mind every time I see a dime
Cause your my girl, but in your, mind girl
I'm just a part time thing, convenient on the side piece
Meet up on the side streets, love will find ???
I guess it's all I'm given, you say I'm wild & crazy
But never woulda hesitate to make you my lady
And give you my baby
But see you're growin up still
And I don't wanna slow you down, your life is all uphill
Do your thang little mama, cause I will
Even though with you bangin on my mind, that kills
Yo, It's just another shot of vodka in the glass
Yeah, it's just another love story from the past
I guess I'm too blind to see, and that's so fine with me
Back in the day I heard about the fish in the sea
So I, delete your number, and go to the beach
Just want to let you know cutie, I'm never far to reach

I wish we coulda had a little bit more
But not in this lifetime, I say no more

See in the end we coulda been, much more than friends
But not in this lifetime, but not in this lifetime

Just to know that's something there, or that you cared
But not in this lifetime, but not in this lifetime

Man in the the end, we coulda been much more than friends
But not in this lifetime, but not in this lifetime

We used to write notes, 7th grade and first kisses
Stay up late on the phone against your parents wishes
And homeroom passing notes with quiet storm quotes long hopes
of immediate dreams it seems so long ago
But then we graduated went our seperate ways and drifted
You got played with self doubt and never admitted you're gifted
And I found music and all you found were fake friends
And we found we couldn't connect the phone call ends
But you would stick through it watch my fame from afar
In your passing car true lies aligned with different stars
Now you want to reconnect but to what at a rendezvous?
Not tellin your husband, Man? I think his friends are on to you
Your tangle wear woven out of satin is it not?
And I'm so tied up, no replyin to messages in the inbox
To the trash, before we crash, obsession with the past
That temptation overdose leads to shattered love glass

See in the end we coulda been, much more than friends
But not in this lifetime, but not in this lifetime

Just to know that's something there, or that you cared
But not in this lifetime, but not in this lifetime

Man in the the end, we coulda been much more than friends
But not in this lifetime, but not in this lifetime---Lyrics submitted by Alvin Kittiphan.
