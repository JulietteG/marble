Now that it's morning,
Where do you want to go from here?
Well now that we're sober,
Do you think of me more clear?
Woah now, now that your head is right,
Did you dig last night?
It keeps playin in my mind.

'Cause girl I gotta thing for you.
And I know it's kinda crazy,
'Cause I know that you have someone else,
Wonderin where you were last night.
But oh yeah now, don't think we're through,
I gotta thing for you...

Well now that you're home,
Will he be the first thing that you see?
I know you compare us,
How does he match up next to me?

No, now, now that your head is right,
Did you dig last night?
It keeps playin in my mind.

'Cause girl I gotta thing for you.
And I know it's kinda crazy.
Cause I know that you have someone else.
Wonderin where you were last night.

And I know the night was hazy,
But I still remember wakin up and kissin your head one more time...
But oh yeah now, don't think we're through,
I gotta thing for you...

Well I remember layin your head down,
I remember lovin our love sounds.

I gotta thing for you.
An I know the night is crazy,
But I still remember wakin up and kissin your head one more time...
I gotta thing for you.
An I know the night was hazy,
But I still remember wakin up,
An kissin your head one more time.
Ooh yeah now, don't think we're through,
I gotta thing for you...---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
