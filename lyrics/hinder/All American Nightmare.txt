(Lets go)
(Nightmare)
(Rock)

Dressed head to toe black on black,
three bunnies in the back of my Cadillac.
With me its gonna be a good story to tell;
cash, grass, and ass on the highway to hell.
Be careful what you wish for when you dream

I make the good girls bad, and bad girls worse;
nice guys are last 'cause Im always first.
Im a freak show sucker for how it feels;
turn the girl next door into hell on heels.
Im red white blue tattooed and just dont care;
Im the all-American nightmare.

If you wanna run away I can give you a ride,
Im a one way ticket to the darker side.
So come with me, baby lets lose some sleep.
But dont mistake me for a dream.

I make the good girls bad, and bad girls worse;
nice guys are last 'cause Im always first.
Im a freak show sucker for how it feels;
turn the girl next door into hell on heels.
Im red white blue tattooed and just dont care;
Im the all-American nightmare.

They try to lock me up and throw away the key,
but they're never gonna hold down a freak like me.
I'm an outcast, smoking grass living for free,
and I got everything you want,
but nothing that you need.

(stick to me baby)

(Oh)
I make the good girls bad, and bad girls worse;
nice guys are last 'cause Im always first.
Im a freak show sucker for how it feels;
turn the girl next door into hell on heels.
Im red white blue tattooed and just dont care;
Im the all-American nightmare.

Im the all-American nightmare
Im the all-American nightmare
And I've got nothing that you need---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
