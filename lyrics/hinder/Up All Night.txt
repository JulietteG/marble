Saw a waitress, couldn't waste it
Opportunity knoks and you take it
Went to my place, gotta get a taste
Couple shots hit the bong we were wasted
Now she's all in, the room is spinning
Probably shouldn't have shot that ofJamison
Here we go again, she's a naked 10
Just tell me how I was in the morning

The night's far from over
No need to be sober
Let's go for a ride

We're gonna be up all night
Gonna take you for a ride
We're gonna be up all night
gonna get you fuc*ing high
We're gonna be up all night
Never make it out alive
So far from sober that I'll have to slam
Trough my hang over

Got my attention, when she walked in
Turning heads with a tiny skirt and sassy grin
She's a blonde one, they say there're more fun
I'll let you know when the sexy dirty deed is done---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
