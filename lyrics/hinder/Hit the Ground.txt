When the smoke clears
And the flashing lights and neon signs all disappear
It's like closing time and the sound of silence is all you hear
Cause everyone's gone

Trying to make sense
Maybe I got a little lost and got a little wreckless
Trying to piece it all together while I'm standing in the middle of the wreckage
It's all I'm left with

Burning both ends of the night just trying to find it
Anything I could to get me higher
But when that high starts running out
What goes up must come down
Falling feels like flying til you hit the ground

Got a choice to choose
I should learn to win cause I sure as hell know how to lose
I spent most of my life caught inside a catch 22
Damned if I don't, damned if I do

Burning both ends of the night just trying to find it
Anything I could to get me higher
But when that high starts running out
What goes up must come down
Falling feels like flying til you hit the ground

Well I keep asking
Why I keep crashing

Burning both ends of the night just trying to find it
Anything I could to get me higher
But when that high starts running out
What goes up must come down
Falling feels like flying til you hit the ground
Falling feels like flying til you hit the ground
Falling feels like flying til you hit the ground---
