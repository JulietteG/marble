Sitting here wasted and wounded
at this old piano
Trying hard to capture 
the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka 
still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies 
they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and
french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
its own beat in my head
While we're talking 
about all of the things that  I long to believe
About love and  truth and 
what you mean to me 
and the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight I sleep on a bed of nails 
oh I want to be just as close as the holy ghost is
lay you down on a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away 
Each step that I take is on my way home
a kings ransom in dimes give each night
just to see through this payphone
still I run out of time
or it's hard to get through
till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I just close my eyes and whisper baby my love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight I sleep on a bed of nails 
oh I want to be just as close as the holy ghost is
lay you down on a bed of roses

Well this hotel bars hangover whiskey's gone dry
the barkeepers wig's crooked 
and she's giving me the eye
well I might have said yeah
but I laughed so hard I think I died 

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
while my mistress she calls me 
to stand in her spotlight again
tonight I won't be alone 
but you know that don't 
mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
for it's you I die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight I sleep on a bed of nails 
oh I want to be just as close as the holy ghost is
lay you down on a bed of roses---Lyrics submitted by Angie.
