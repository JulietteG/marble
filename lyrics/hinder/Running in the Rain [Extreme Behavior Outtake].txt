She cuts herself to forget him,
And every time the wounds get deeper.
Tonight's the night she's gunna shred her skin,
Because she's thinking that he doesn't need her.
She's wishing all this would end,
And she's gunna try to take her own life again.

CHORUS
Wait, I know your heart's been shattered,
But there's someone worth the wait,
There's so much more that matters,
And I know you will be alright,
Just try to love the little things in life-
Like running in the rain.

He drinks alone to forget her,
And every time the room starts spinning.
He starts to think about where they were, 
And when she told him that she doesn't need him.
He's wishing all this would end, 
And he's gunna try to take his own life again.

CHORUS
Wait, I know your heart's been shattered,
But there's someone worth the wait,
There's so much more that matters,
And I know you will be alright,
Just try to love the little things in life-
Like running in the rain.

And she's wishing all this would end,
And he's gunna try to take his own life again.

CHORUS
Wait, I know your heart's been shattered,
But there's someone worth the wait,
There's so much more that matters,
And I know you will be alright,
Just try to love the little things in life-
Like running in the rain.

Running in the rain,
I know you will be alright,
If you try to love the little things in life-
Like running in the rain.---Lyrics submitted by Sam.
