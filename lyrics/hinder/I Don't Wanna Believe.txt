Verse 1:
From everything I've seen, everything good just goes away,
I never had a taste of heaven without a little hell to pay,
All I ever needed was someone to give instead of take,
But, something about you makes it right to give it one more try.

Chorus:
And I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you,
But, I'm made a fool if the one that I want is you,
Yeah, tell me you're  the one 'cause I don't want to waste another day,
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe if I can't believe in you.

Verse 2:
I never been so scared I'm never goin' nowhere but now you're here,
Holding you too tight hoping you'll erase my darkest fears,
I don't want to break you; I don't want to make you disappear,
I pretend the kind of pain but you take it all away.

Chorus:
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you,
But I'm ready to fall i f you're the one I fall into, 
You tell me you're the one 'cause, baby, I don't want to waste another day,
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you.

Refrain:
I'm givin' you what's left of me so you can put me back together,
You've given me what I've neede all along.

Chorus:
(And) I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you,
But I'm ready to fall if you're the one I fall into,
You tell me you're the one ' cause , baby,  I don't wanna waste another day,
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you,
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in YOU-
But, I'm ready to fall if you're the one I fall INTO-
I don't wanna believe if I can't believe in you,
But, I'm ready to fall if you're the one I fall into...---Lyrics submitted by Lisa Gonzales.
