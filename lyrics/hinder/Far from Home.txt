Ah.....
You said I'm always saying sorry for the same old things,
I'm sorry for the drugs and how much I drink.
You said I say it so much, it doesn't mean anything.
I'm sorry my love, but I had to leave...

I hope most of you would never know what it's like to let a love go. (Oh... Whoah...)
Leaving everything at home, everything you've ever known!

Oh! I can't fix this from a phone! (Oh!)
I'm sorry you feel so alone! (Oh!)
It's like I told you,
You're better off without me.
I'm sick of saying sorry.
So... far from home...

You keep calling and complaining that I just don't care. (Ah...)
Would you say that if I was there...
It's that picture you keep taking that's causing you tears. (Ah...)
I could set you straight if you were here.

I hope most of you would never know what it's like to let a love go. (Oh... Whoah...)
Leaving everything at home, everything you've ever known!

Oh! I can't fix this from a phone! (Oh!)
I'm sorry you feel so alone! (Oh!)
It's like I told you,
You're better off without me.
I'm sick of saying sorry.

Oh! I don't want to string you along! (Oh!)
And that's why I'm letting you go! (Oh!)
It's like I told you,
You're better off without me.
I'm sick of saying sorry.
So... far from home...

And I don't know how many times I torture you!
And I can't count how many fights I fought with you!

Oh! I don't want to string you along...
And that's why I'm letting you go...
It's like I told you!
You're better off without me.
I'm sick of saying sorry.

Oh! I can't fix this from a phone! (Oh!)
I'm sorry you feel so alone! (Oh!)
It's like I told you,
You're better off without me.
I'm sick of saying sorry.

Oh! (Ohhhhh..) I don't want to string you along! (Ohhhhh..)
And that's why I'm letting you go! (Ohhhhh..)
It's like I told you!
You're better off without me.
I'm sick of saying sorry.
So... far from home...---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
