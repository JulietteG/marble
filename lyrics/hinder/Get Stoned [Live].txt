oh oh oh oh oh 
just hit me now if its not perfect im protective till my heart exsplodes i highly doubt i can make through another one of your epesodes lashing out when one other pantie moves before you lose yourself 
  you wear me out oh oh oh ohh  but its alright now 
  lets go home and get stoned we could end up making love instead of misory 
  go home and get stoned  cause its  safe and so better when you met me you ware me out 
we could end up making love instead of misery but its alright now 
    without a doubt all the pregnet worth what you get in me pasing out couse your b****in  and your yelling  dont mean anything dont count me out i can handel all the baggeg your careing 
    you wear me out oh oh oh ohhh but its alright now 
    lets go home and get stoned  we could end up making love instead of misery 
           go home and get stoned  cause its  safe and so much better when you met me you wear me out we could end up making love instead or misery but its alright now 
      lets go home and get stoned we could end up making love instead of misery 
             go home and get stoned cause its safe and so much better when you met me
          go home and get stoned we could end up making love instead of misery 
          go home and get stoned cause its safe and so much better when you met me 
           you wear me out we could end up making love instead of misery but its alright now 
           cause its so much better when you met me 
           go home and get stoned oh oh oh ohhhhhh 
          lets go home and get stoned oh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh 
         lets go home and get stoned oh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhhhh
