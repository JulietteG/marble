Deep in the dark outerspace
I had a dream - I walked on grace
Heading toward Sirius
Weightless, felt delirious
Searching for another place
I splash some water on my face
Im avoiding a black hole
It keeps on trying to steal my soul

Innerspace Astronaut, explorer of the mind
Innerspace Astronaut, give me a sign

Pioneer of self-reflection
I get close without detection
I begin to break the mold
And all my thoughts are bought and sold
I start to discover me
and find out what I really need
Courage bravery and wit
about it all I soon forget

Innerspace Astronaut, explorer of the mind
Ruler of my universe, all space and time
Innerspace Astronaut, give me a sign
Understander of my soul, leave it all behind

Im flyin, traveling to the stars
No inhibitions, traveling only here to Mars

Innerspace Astronaut, explorer of the mind
Ruler of my universe, all space and time
Innerspace Astronaut, give me a sign
Understander of my soul, leave it all behind---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
