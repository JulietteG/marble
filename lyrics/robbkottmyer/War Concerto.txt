In the pounding heat
Earth, sweat and sand
There is no chance
To get out of this land

Oh, this war
It rages on
The General says
We can go home
The Battles won

As we get on the plane - so excited
Your picture in my hand - on my way
Eleven hours in flight - hit the tarmac
I run into your arms - a great day

I'm Free
I'm Free
I'm Free---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
