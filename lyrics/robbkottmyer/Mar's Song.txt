I met a girl (with the) Cherry blossom stare
China doll skin(and the) Fire engine hair
She had a way(that made her) Oh so fair
She so beautiful(I could) Find her anywhere

You gave me two tiny dancers
I gave you a man who doesnt answer
Never knew it could be so good
Cant believe you said you would
On your finger, I slip the ring
In my heart, it means everything

Its a beautiful day
Dogs in the yard
Passing the time
Really aint that hard
We have a life
We love each other
Looking forward to
Growing old together

You gave me two tiny dancers
I gave you a man who doesnt answer
Never knew it could be so good
Cant believe you said you would
On your finger, I slip the ring
In my heart, it means everything

You gave me two tiny dancers
I gave you a man who doesnt answer
Never knew it could be so good
Cant believe you said you would
On your finger, I slip the ring
In my heart, it means everything

You gave me two tiny dancers---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
