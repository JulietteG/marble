Dusk is falling
I smell the ocean air
The nonstop hum
Of the people passing by

The clouds are moving in with the tide
The rain is shown, too cold tonight
The road is endless, travel is long
Im getting back, not to far gone

It matters not, cause all I have to do
Is follow the Cobblewood back to you
With each stride, I fell like I should
My destiny is beyond the Cobblewood

Colors clashing
Like a bomb in the sky
Feel the breeze
Blow in off the sea

The clouds are moving in with the tide
The rain is shown, too cold tonight
The road is endless, travel is long
Im getting back, not to far gone

It matters not, cause all I have to do
Is follow the Cobblewood back to you
With each stride, I fell like I should
My destiny is beyond the Cobblewood---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
