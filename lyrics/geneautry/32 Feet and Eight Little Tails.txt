Gallopin', Gallopin', Gallopin', Gallopin, Gallopin', Gallopin, Gallopin, Gallopin'.

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
Over The Moon So Bright.
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails of white,
Hurry, Hurry, Hurry through the night.

Old Saint Nick works so quickly
Leaving toys for girls and boys.
And over the roofs so high
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails they fly
Faster, faster, faster through the sky.

Oh, Look at them go
Santa's laughing, Ho, Ho, Ho,Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho.

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
Over the garden wall
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails in all.
See them canter, hear old Santa call,
Merry, Merry Christmas to you all.

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
Over The Moon So Bright.
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails of white,
Hurry, Hurry, Hurry through the night.
Gallopin', Gallopin, Gallopin, Gallopin'.

Old Saint Nick works so quickly
Leaving toys for girls and boys.
And over the roofs so high
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails they fly
Faster, faster, faster through the sky.
Sky, Sky, Sky.

Oh, Look at them go, go, go, go
Santa's laughing, Ho, Ho, Ho,Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho.

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
Over the garden wall
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails in all.
See them canter, hear old Santa call,
Merry, Merry Christmas to you all.---Lyrics submitted by nina.
