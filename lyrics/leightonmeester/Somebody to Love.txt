Paris, France to Michigan
London town and through Berlin
I cant believe this place Im in
Everywhere and back again
Porcelain and China dolls
Give me one and Ive seen them all
Got my back against the wall
Wonder where Ill be tomorrow?

But wait, now how long could this take?
Its hard to find a man,
When youre gone before he wakes.
They say its hard to achieve
But cant a girl believe?

(Chorus)
Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know youre out there
Theres got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I cant seem to find
Somebody to love

(Robin Thicke)
Baby girl, there you at
Looking at me like a putty cat
Wondering where that thing is at
Wondering where your ring is at
Nobody ever did it quite like this
Nobody ever did it quite like you
Do your hair, I bought you shoes
We can hit the town like superstars do
You fall in love? Then let me show you love
Give me the key to your heart
I can give you what you want
When youre waiting for love
And youre lookin for someone
Imma turn this gossip girl into a woman

[Chorus x2]

Je tadore, Je tadore (I love you, I love you)
Make a move, do the thing
Turn around, strike a pose
Je tadore, Je tadore (I love you, I love you)
Make a move, do the thing
Turn around, strike a pose
Ooh, I like it
Ooh, I need it
Ooh, I want it
Hey Hey

I know its hard to achieve
But cant a girl believe?

[Chorus x2]

(You say hello, I say goodbye) x2
Somebody to love---Lyrics submitted by Rocio.
