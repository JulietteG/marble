[Verse 1:]
We've been in love before
And I know it'll take a man to make it work
Now I'm ready to love you and only you trust me baby
I've made you hurt before
I'm ready to make right all the wrong I've done
Wanna love you, and only you
Why delay anything

[Chorus:]
I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be, I could be your lover, don't you want me (don't you want me), I can be your love isn't that what you need, why play games with one another, when I want you, you want me

[Verse 2:]
I know it's on your mind
My actions to blame for your insecurity
And I'm sorry baby please try to work with me (yeahh ohhh)
Let's try to build on us
I can't stand to be without you and I'd rather be alone, then to start it all over again (again) ooooooohhhhhhh

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
No matter, how long it takes
So much, more to do
All I want is you baby
Cause it's been awhile, and you're on my mind
Want you to love me like I love you
See me like I see you baby
Want you to love me like I love you baby
Love me like I love you OOHH---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
