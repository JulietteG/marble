capo 1st fret

(G)(Dm7) twice 

(G) You smile at (Dm7) me but your (E7) green eyes never (Am7) linger
You (D/F#) turn away 
(G) You talk to (Dm7) me and twirl your (E7) long hair with your (Am7) finger 
I'm (D/F#) blown away
(Em) And you don't real(A)ize (Em) when you walk a(Am7)way I die in(G)side

Now I'm missing (B7) out on all of your (C) love
I came close but (Cm) just not close e(G)nough
I knew going (B7) in there was no guaran(C)tee
Just my luck I'm (Cm) almost what you (G) need

(G)(Dm7) twice 

(G) When you feel (Dm7) down and all a(E7)lone you always (Am7) call me 
And I (D/F#) make you laugh
(G) You swear you (Dm7) love me heart and (E7) soul just like the (Am7) brother 
You (D/F#) never had
(Em) But whatever I (A) do (Em) I always end (Am7) up without you (G) girl

Now I'm missing (B7) out on all of your (C) love
I came close but (Cm) just not close e(G)nough
I knew going (B7) in there was no guaran(C)tee
Just my luck I'm (Cm) almost what you (G) need

(B7) (C) (Cm)

(G) Now I'm missing (B7) out on all of your (C) love
I came close but (Cm) just not close e(G)nough
I knew going (B7) in there was no guaran(C)tee
Just my luck I'm (Cm) almost what you (G) need
