I wish you lived on the corner where I lived
So i could look at you all the day long
Lickety lip got me flippin' my lid, yeah
Nibblin' my thumb 'cause I want me some

Ohh, just a little bit a, ohh
Am I making you uncomfortable?

And if you lived on the corner where I lived
I'd hang around like an apple in a tree
Borrow some bread, stick of butter, cup of milk
And some sugar for me, I'm cookin' something sweet

Ohh, just a little bit a, ohh

Lookin' once, lookin' twice
Better get me a bucket of ice
Go on do whatever you do
I'll just sit here enjoying the view
Whistlin' Dixie, 360 degrees of you


I picture me twisted up in your T-shirt
Pink lemonade and squeaky porch swing
Don't know your name yet, I guess it wouldn't hurt
If you gave me a ring, a big diamond ring

Ooh, well a girl can dream, ohh

Lookin' once, lookin' twice
Better get me a bucket of ice
Go on do whatever you do
I'll just sit here enjoying the view
Whistlin' Dixie, 360 degrees of you

Lookin' once, lookin' twice
Your a splash of Tabasco on hot apple pie
Baby girls like it too
Like to sit around enjoying the view
Whistlin' Dixie, 360, whistlin' Dixie, 360 degrees of you, ohh

Just a little bit of you
Gotsta, gotsta have you
Just a little bit of you
Oh, I'm gonna have you

You, you, you, you---Lyrics submitted by Erika.
