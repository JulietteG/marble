Would you look what the wind blew in today?
And you know if you could, you would.
Her smile's got you thinkin' it's your lucky day,
and trouble never looked so good.

Well you're free game to her territory,
but brother, she's been readin' your mail.
How she'd love to write you into her story,
but the ending's not worth the tale.

Her appearance is a powerful potion,
guaranteed to put your wheels in motion.
She's a high-heeled potential explosion,
just begging you to light the fuse.

She's bad news.
She's bad news.

Don't you sometimes have your suspicions
why she doesn't have a man of her own?
Did it ever cross your mind her ambitions
was to come between you and your home?

There's a certain kind of woman
that's attracted by the ring on your hand,
and inside, what's she's secretly wanting
is to steal another woman's man.

So if you look past the games and the laughter
you can see what this girl is after.
She's a walking domestic disaster.
You'd better think about what you've got to lose.

She's bad news.
Bad news for you.

So she's got you backed into a corner.
And she's burning with the heat of the night.
With a kiss and a smile, she puts your conscience on trial,
just daring you to hold her tight.

So don't think about the day you'll discover
she's gone and left you for another.
She's got no use for a permanent lover.
You'd better think about what you've got to lose.

She's bad news.
Bad news for you.
She's bad news.
Bad news.

Lose your wife.  
Lose your car.
Lose your job.
Lose your home.
Lose your kids, lose your health, lose your friends, lose your mind.

She's bad news for you.
She's bad news.---Lyrics submitted by Verna Avarell.
