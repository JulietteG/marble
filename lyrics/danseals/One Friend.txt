I always thought you were the best 
I guess I always will. 
I always thought that we were blessed 
And I feel that way still. 
Sometimes we took the hard road 
But we always saw it through. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you. 

Sometimes the world was on our side 
Sometimes it wasn't fair. 
Sometimes it gave a helping hand 
Sometimes we didn't care. 

'Cause when we were together 
It made the dream come true. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you. 

Someone who understands me 
And knows me inside out. 
Helps keep me together 
And believes without a doubt, 
That I could move a mountain 
Someone to tell it to. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you. 

Someone 
And knows me inside out. 
Helps keep me together 
And believes without a doubt, 
That I could move a mountain 
Someone to tell it to. 

If I had only one friend left 
I'd want it to be you.---Lyrics submitted by KURT.
