Yeah, when Saturday comes, I'm gonna lose myself 
Yeah, when Saturday comes alright, everybody left 
That might be a little crazy 
I'm gonna drink some whiskey, Jimmy Beam 

Yeah, when Saturday comes, I'm gonna lost my soul 
Yeah, when Saturday comes, I'm gonna lose control 
I might get a little crazy 
I'm gonna wake up Sunday on a DIV 

Yeah, when Saturday comes, I might feel no pain 
Yeah, when Saturday comes, not knowing my name 
I might get a little crazy 
Or got my baby, bring it on for me 

Yeah, when Saturday comes, I'm gonna heal myself 
Yeah, when Saturday comes with a plan of some sort 
I might get a little crazy 
Then comes Sunday waiting for me---
