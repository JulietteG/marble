Oh, hey there brother, dont you know the road?
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Oh, hey there brother, dont you know the road?
Yes, my brother, I know the road
There was no one good, and I was all alone
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Had a big black dog lay beside my door
Yes, my brother, I know the road

And a figure spoke in a mournful way
Yes, my brother, I know the way
So I hope that fiddle with my hands
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Then the fiddler said Hey now, hey now
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Though not all the tunes are played like that

And though the storms passed over
And the sun is in its place
Whoa, it took a long time
And the man, how I know him

The fiddler, fiddler take up your bow
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Play me a song that I dont know
Yes, my brother, I know the road
The winged daughter on my hand
Yes, my brother, I know the road
There aint nothin that I will hum in fear
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Came along some song, patient as life
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Like the gladness in my daddys eye
Yes, my brother, I know the road
Like when I was a child, just a little boy
Yes, my brother, I know the road
The one within his crook of arm---
