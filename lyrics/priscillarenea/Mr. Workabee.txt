Hey Mr. Worker bee I see you working 
But often forget that you got a queen at home. 
She sits on her throne but she feels so alone 
And the buzz around town is you creep 
Around so what are you working on?


There aint that many flowers in the garden, 
So what takes you from dusk till dawn? 
I hate to be all in your bees wax, 
But i'm only looking at the facts. 
And it wont be soon before long someone else is bringing honey home. 
I wanna believe im not that naive but damn dont reality sting.


Hey Mr. Worker bee I see you working 
But often forget that you got a queen at home. 
She sits on her throne but she feels so alone 
And the buzz around town is you creep 
Around so what are you working on?



You say you feel like I dont appreciate you but, 
I swear sweet darlin yes I do. 
I just wished that you aint work so late every single day,
Especially since worker bees dont pollinate till May. 
And it wont be soon before long someone else is bringing honey home. 
I wanna believe im not that naive but damn dont reality sting.


Hey Mr. Worker bee I see you working 
But often forget that you got a queen at home. 
She sits on her throne but she feels so alone 
And the buzz around town is you creep 
Around so what are you working on? X 3---Lyrics submitted by devin.
