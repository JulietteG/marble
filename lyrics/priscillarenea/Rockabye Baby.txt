Little Miss Mary Mac
Had buttons all down her back
She let Georgie loosen them up 
And now her belly fat

Now Marys little lamb
Follows her wherever she goes
No more hanging out at the bar
Cause baby aint old enough

And now its Georgie and Mary sitting in a tree
With a B-A-B-Y, baby
I bet they learned their lesson
About early sex n
Why it shouldnt be

*CHORUS*

Rockabye Baby
Said Georgie to Mary
(Its your turn)
Rockabye baby 
Said Mary to Georgie
Rock Rockabye, Rockabye tonight
Rock Rockabye, Rockabye tonight

Its been three years since they finished high school
Now babys growing up
Mary works selling hot cross buns
Since Georgies up and gone

All thanks to Peter Piper
Mary can pay the bill
She cant get a 9 to 5 Cause
She aint go to college

And now its Mary and baby
Sitting in a tree
No G-E-ORGE  I  E  Georgie
I bet she learned her lesson about having children
Before you are ready

Rockabye baby said Mary to Georgie
(Its your turn)
Rockabye baby said Georgie to Mary
Rock Rockabye, Rockabye tonight
Rock Rockabye, Rockabye tonight

*RAP*

I said Marys been working all the live long day
Ever since babys daddy went away
She gave up her sweet little pudding pie
And now she got little boy blue by her side
Screaming Georgie, Porgy let me in!
Saying Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin
She scribbled down I hate cha
On some pen and papers
This babys yours and I need support
Yup

*BRIDGE*

Mary used to be a pretty maid
Now shes hustling to get paid
Georgie promised her the finer things
Till baby blue was born
Now she sits up alone at night
Wiping tear drops from her eyes
Wishing Georgie did her right 
Since baby came along

Peter Peter Pumpkin eater
Had a wife and could not keep her
Liar Liar Pants on fire
Woooooo oooo
Uh  huh, uh  huh, uh-huh
Georgie to Mary
Rockabye, Rockabye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by caity.
