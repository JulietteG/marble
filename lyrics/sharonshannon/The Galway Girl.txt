Well I took a stroll on the old long walk
of the day i ay i ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
on a fine soft day i ay

And i ask you friend what's a fellah to do
cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And i knew right then i'd be taking a whirl
Down the Salthill prom with a Galway girl

(HO)

We're halfway there when the rain came down
On the day i ay i ay
She asked me up to her flat down town
On a fine soft day i ay

And i ask you friend what's a fellah to do 
cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And i took her hand and i gave her a twirl 
and i lost my heart to a Galway girl

(Ho)

(Ho) 

and when i woke up i was all alone 
with a broken heart and a ticket home
And i ask you now tell me what would you do
(Ha) if her hair was black and her eyes were blue

Cause i've travelled around 
I've been all over this world
boys, I've never seen nothing like a Galway girl

(Ho)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
