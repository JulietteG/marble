In the happyland
In the happyland
In the happyland

Poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland
Go on and poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland
Well your daddy left home
Mum is still on the phone
Lost belief in
Love's deceiving
Always going, went, gone
Poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland

Close the door and leave your key
You think you've got me but you'll see
When you're starting to lose me
I'm already gone

In the happyland
In the happyland

Night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland
As the night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland
Cause your daddy left home
Mum is still on the phone
Lost belief in
Love's deceiving
Always going, went, gone
Night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland

Close the door and leave your key
You think you've got me but you'll see
When you're starting to lose me
I'm already gone

In the happyland
In the happyland

They will hurt you
And desert you
That's what they do
Run

In the happyland
In the happyland---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
