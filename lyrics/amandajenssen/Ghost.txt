He's a drug, my reverend hard drug
All seven of my sins was for him
As we sprung on rivers black tongues
Forgive us, heaven's door was closing

Now it's too late, think the window passed me by
I sleep awake in my limbo state of mind

Watched it break, break, break
Overtake, take, take
All my holy washed away
Lay them low, low, low
They don't know, know, know
That you had me lose control
Almost had me, now you don't

Stir up storm and chaos, no norm
Can save us from ourself, hurting spells
I live under ladders
A-wells don't matter
We were born as we fell
Into the war between reason and belief
Of healing sores, I've got nothing left to bleed

Watched it break, break, break
Overtake, take, take
All my holy washed away
Lay them low, low, low
They don't know, know, know
No more mercy, fever flows
You can't hurt me, I'm a ghost

Now it's too late, think the window passed me by
I sleep awake in my limbo state of mind

Watched it break, break, break
Overtake, take, take
All my holy washed away
Lay them low, low, low
They don't know, know, know
No more mercy, fever flows
You can't hurt me, I'm a ghost
I'm a ghost
I'm a ghost---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
