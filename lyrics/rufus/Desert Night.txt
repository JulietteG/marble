Your touch is taking me away from here 
But I'm alright with no direction 
Too much, you're making me forget myself 
Let's take a ride across the desert night. 

And when the sun comes out, in the morning light 
It can feel you there 

Oh, look at me now, look at me now 
I'm right here 
And as the light spills out and the sleep is here 
You see me there, don't go anywhere 
Go anywhere, wait right here. 

I'm alright 
Oh, look at me now 
I'm alright 
Oh, look at me now 

You said I'm looking for my happiness 
I wanna try to feel connected, yeah 
My watch of falling into emptiness 
I wanna try, under the streetlight. 

Oh, look at me now, look at me now 
I'm right here 
And as the light spills out and the sleep is here 
You see me there, don't go anywhere 
Go anywhere, wait right here. 

I'm alright 
Oh, look at me now 
I'm alright 
Oh, look at me now. 

And when the sun comes out, in the morning light 
It can feel you there 
And when the sun comes out, in the morning light. 

I'm alright 
I'm alright.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
