Whatever will be, it will be
Won't let the weight of this world bury me
We all want our place in the sun
Come whatever what may, it is done

Will you walk out on water?
Will you you breathe on heaven's door?
Will you lead a path to follow?

A beautiful world
A beautiful world

Come suffer with me, I'm your friend
There's a river of love at your hands
Take your troubles and hurt to the sea
Shine your light in the world and be free

Will you walk out on water?
Will you you breathe on heaven's door?
Will you lead a path to follow?
Will you lead a path to war?
Only faith can ease your burden
Only love can heal the hurt
Let your peace fall on the earth

A beautiful world---
