Baby
You're the one I love
Yeah

The queen of my heart
Light of my soul
You're more precious
Than anything

I don't need diamonds
Nor the finest gold
Darlin'
I cherish you
And I confess
My gratitude
Bless the day
You came along
You've got a brotha singin'
A brand new song

When I wake up in the morning
And I'm tripping cause I'm diggin'
What the Lord has made
It's you

Never thought I'd be forever
Gettin' ready but I'm oh so glad you stayed
It's you

You make it better gotta get myself together
Cause I want you more and more
It's you
It's you

A new life
Has come to pass
I'm taking my baby
Home at last
I know I found
My destiny
Cause you're bringin'
The best in me
So whatever
The future may hold
I'll be lovin' you only
From head to toe
Undivided my love will stand
Cause you are my woman
And I'm proud to be your man
When I wake up in the morning
And I'm tripping cause I'm diggin'
What the Lord has made
It's you

Never thought I'd be forever
Gettin' ready but I'm oh so glad you stayed
It's you

You make it better gotta get myself together
Cause I want you more and more
It's you
It's you

Love of my life
To have and to hold
I will treasure you alway
Heart and soul
And our love will stand
Cause you are my woman
And I'm proud to be your man
It's you
It's you
It's you
It's you
It's you

You've been giving me the lovin' I've been missin'
Will you be my #1 fan
It's you

How could heaven never send me such a person mama
It's you

I'm living second like
I'm finger lickin' good all by myself
It's you

I keep pretending that
I'm lovin' every minute when
I want somebody else
It's you

A little sentimental
You know me well
It's you

Caught up in the middle
You're the only one I tell
It's you

I'm faithfully romantic
All my days
It's you

I just wanted to say
It's you---
