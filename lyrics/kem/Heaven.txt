i see the way you look at me
as if to say it's right 
i pray for you day in and day out

something's happenin' to me
the man i used to be,he's gone 
he gave up his life,so i could go on

and girl,holdin the heaven
where the love of a life time,resides in you

oh,girl and its so,meant to be
in this place where two souls collide 
there's no pain,no fear,only you and i,oh girl

somethin's hapenin' to me 
the man i used to be,he's gone
he gave up his life,so i could go on and on

and girl,im holdin the heaven 
where the love of a life time resides
somewhere in you,girl,yeah
