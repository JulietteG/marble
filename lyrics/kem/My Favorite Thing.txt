(feat. Ronald Isley)

My baby won't talk to me
She giving me the third degree
And my peace is shownuff disturbed,
I know I'm just getting on her nerves...
She's the only one I need
We were truly meant to be
Can't nobody keep it real like my girl
Nobody in the whole wide world.

Come home to me, girl
I need you
I know it's hard to see , no no no, yeah
Your love will always be my favorite thing.

So if you meet her on Facebook, tweet me
My baby is only one I freaks see,
She can give it up for so long
Got a brother waiting by the phone
And I love her like a sweet potatoe pie ..
Her forever put a twinkle in my eye,
Cold blooded but I can't get enough,
Uh I love that girl so much.

Come home to me, come on home girl
I need you, oh I need you I know it's hard to see,
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
Girl your love will always be, always baby

Lil mama is my favorite thing
She the kind of girl that makes your heart sing
Like a fountain of love that you can't understand
I know her body like the back of my hands
So know I'm her strength from way down inside,
Tenderoni takes the words out of your mouth
And her power of her love makes you feel so good.
That's why I love her like a grown man should

There goes my baby girl
She is my favorite thing
There goes my whole world
I love her always, my favorite thing.
My favorite thing, oh why
My favorite thing
She's my whole world
My favorite thing
My favorite thing yeah
My favorite thing girl.
Ra la ra ra ra, la ra ra ra
Ohh
My babe, you know she's my favorite thing
My favorite thing,
My favorite thing
My my my my my my my
Favourite thing.
My favourite thing.---
