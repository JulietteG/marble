Pray for me
So I can know why
I can't get over you
Oh baby
I lie to myself
But I can't deny the truth
Hey girl
I'm losing control
'Cause all I want is you baby
Girl
How does it feel
To be everything in my world

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Please wait and see
You might change your mind
And give love another chance
Hey girl
You might even find
That I'm the very best man
You can never have
Hey girl
So before you let go
Before the night is through
Hear me baby
Girl
You're my heart and soul
And I belong to you
Baby

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Nobody ever moved me
Nobody ever soothed me
Nobody ever will
I need you in my life
Girl
Nobody has amazed me
Nobody ever phased me
Nobody ever love me right
All my life
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
Nobody

Nobody
Nobody like you

Ain't never 'gon be
