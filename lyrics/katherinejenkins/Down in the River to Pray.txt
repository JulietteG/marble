As I went down in the river to pray
      studying about that good ol' way
      and who shell wear the staring crown
      good Lord show me the way.

      Ohhh sisters lets go down
       lets go down come on down
      oh sisters lets go down 
      down in the river to pray

      As I went down in the river to pray
      studying about that good ol' way
      and who shell wear the robe crown
      good Lord show me the way.

      Ohhh brothers lets go down
        lets go down come on down
       come one brothers lets go down 
       down in the river to pray

      As I went down in the river to pray
      studying about that good ol' way
      and who shell wear the staring crown
      good Lord show me the way.

      Ohhh fathers lets go down

       oh fathers lets go down 
       down in the river to pray      

      As I went down in the river to pray
      studying about that good ol' way
      and who shell wear the robe crown
      good Lord show me the way.

      studying about that good ol' way
      and who shell wear the robe crown
      good Lord show me the way.---Lyrics submitted by evelenerose.
