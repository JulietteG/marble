Love is a shield, 
to hide behind, 
love is a field 
to grow inside, 
and when I sometimes close my eyes 
my mind starts spinning round. 
Love is a baby 
in a mother's arms, 
love is your breath 
which takes me warm, 
and when I sometimes close my eyes, 
my mind starts spinning round. 
There is a feeling 
that flows through me, 
when you are near 
you make it real 
and we could live for this ideal. 
And all the pictures we run through, 
seem to be perfect, 
seem to be true. 
But nothing is quite forever, 
especially staying together. 

I don't care now 
what comes along, 
what counts is us, 
no matter what will be, 
just this naivety. 
The changing words we're taking in, 
seem to be perfect, 
seem to win. 
But nothing is quite forever, 
especially staying together.---Lyrics submitted by Miroslav.
