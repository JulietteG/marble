Some people supress you
They partch you and reap a disaster.
Reeducation For the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance.

The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrasing pavement.
Believe the scholars
Read the readings

Realize the man who says anything.

The great commandment -

The needies believe you
They treat you like survivor disaster.
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance.

The great commandment shows the contempt . . .
The great commandment shows the contempt . . .
The great commandment shows the contempt . . .---Lyrics submitted by Victor.
