The streets are on it people
The people who want to move, move, move
How could all these people have so much to prove, prove, prove
I can only ask myself
Oh where are you all going
And wont you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blaring

Its all the way downtown
Ill prove that's how the make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Its all the way downtown
Ill prove that's how the make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

The streets are on it people
With nothing else to lose, lose, lose
When did all these people decide to change their shoes, shoes, shoes
I can only ask myself
Oh where are you all going
And wont you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blaring

Its all the way downtown
Ill prove that's how the make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Its all the way downtown
Ill prove that's how the make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Its all the way downtown
Its all the way downtown
Its all the way downtown
Its all the way downtown

Why are we fighting
I dont understand
Oh the temperature is rising tonight ---
