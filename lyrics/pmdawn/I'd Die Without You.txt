Is it my turn to wish you were lying here 
I did not dream you in my sleep babe
Is it my turn to fictionize my world
Or even imagine your  emotions to tell my self anything (yeah)
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you and you not hear me (ahhh)
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing (whoa)

(chorus)

If I have to give away the feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice, Oh whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
There isn't anything that I would not do
Since I'd die without you, yeah baby
Since I'd die without you, Since I'd die without you

Oh I apologize for all the things I've done
But now I'm under water and I'm drowning (oh yeah)
Is it my turn to be the one the cry
isn't it amazing how some things just completely turn around (oh)

Take every little piece of my heart (piece of my heart)
Take every little piece of my soul (every piece of my soul)
Take every little bitty piece of my piece of my mind
Because if your gone, inside, I'd die without you

(Chorus)

(oh) If I have to give away the feeling that I feel (yeah)
If I have to sacrifice whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
There isn't  anything that I would not do
Since I'd die without you
Since I'd die without you
Since I'd die without you
Id die without you
Die without you
I'd die without you(repeat)
Die without you (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Kellie.
