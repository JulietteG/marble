Picture you, picture me, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll

Imagine yourself as a link on a chain
The chain is wrapped around someone's mind
If you break off, then things start to change
And then you realize that there's no time

No direction as you fly through the wind
You stop to ponder on a pink Chateaus
The theme from "Mahogany" still transcends
Quote Unquote, that's the way it goes

I'm looking at the picture again
I'm looking at the picture again
I spin the sun dial to expectation
Twenty years ago, I saw you yesterday

You're looking at the picture now
I see you looking at the picture now
And for the slightest moment I watched you think
About what it's like as a paper doll

One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, yeah
One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll
Oh, paper doll

Imagine yourself as a cloud in the sky
You pass me by and I blow you a kiss
A thinking cloud, so you're wondering why
Only to find out it doesn't exist

Life surrounds what's presumed as wise
It wouldn't be wise until the fist uncurls
No one I don't know ever stares in my eyes
Because of the Quote Unquote real world

I'm thinking about yesterday
I'm actually thinking about yesterday

A thousand words say it doesn't make sense
A thousand ideas tell me otherwise

You're thinking about yesterday
And now you're thinking about yesterday
But for the slightest moment I watched you think
About what would it be like as a paper doll

One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll yeah babe
One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll

Oh, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll

Regardless of how you think, regardless of how you feel
See yourself as more than a human being
It's recognizable, spiritually and mentally
Hold my hands forever, paper doll

One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll yeah babe
One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll

One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, yeah
One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll
Oh, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll

Yeah baby, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll yeah, yeah, paper doll
Paper doll baby, paper doll, paper doll, baby paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
