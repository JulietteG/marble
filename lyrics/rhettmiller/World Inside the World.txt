There is a world 
Inside the world
That you see

And it's okay to count the minutes, cause how many could there be
And if love is all around us, how could this have found us, 
The move you know is don't let go of me

There is a world
Inside the world
That you see

Let's call her Holocene and hope that she holds
Cause every shore she's gonna touch is gonna turn to solid gold
She and I've been wishing, for a change in our condition
It's not giving, but it's obvious to me 

There is a world
Inside the world
There is a world
Inside the world
There is a world
Inside the world
That you see

*MUSIC PLAYING*

There is a world 
Inside the world
That you see

I red it in dallilow, like they written into me
And if love is all we're made of, then what am I afraid of
Just cause freedom rings, it doesn't mean we're free

There is a world 
Inside the world
There is a world 
Inside the world
There is a world 
Inside the world
There is a world
Inside the world 
There is a world
Inside the world
That you see
