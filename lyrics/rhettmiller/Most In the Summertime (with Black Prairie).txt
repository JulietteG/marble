We drove a powder blue pickup truck to the edge of town 
We had a picnic on a blanket on a hill as the sun beat down 
I pulled you close, and took your little hand in mine 
I think I love you most in the summertime 

Don't give up on me, don't give up on me 
We were sleeping in the state park underneath the camper shell 
Barometric pressure goin' crazy, it was raining like hell 
My fingers found the notches on your spine 
I think I love you most in the summertime 

Don't give up on me, don't give up on me 
Yeah, I think I love you most in the summertime 
Got our clothes off, hangin' on the line 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I just might make it, as long as you're still mine

We drove a powder blue pickup truck to the Greyhound stop 
You bought a 12-dollar ticket and a 2-dollar bottle of pop 
I pulled you close and lied that I'd be fine 
I think I love you most in the summertime 

Don't give up on me, don't give up on me 
Yeah, I think I love you most in the summertime 
Got our clothes off, hangin' on the line 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I just might make it, as long as you're still mine 
I just might make it, as long as you're still mine

Yeah, I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime 
I think I love you most in the summertime---
