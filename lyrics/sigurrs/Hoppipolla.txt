Brosandi
Hendumst  hringi
Hldumst  hendur
Allur heimurinn skr
Nema  stendur

Rennblautur
Allur rennvotur
Engin gmmstgvl
Hlaupandi inn  okkur
Vill springa t r skel

Vindurinn
Og tilykt af hrinu nu
Eg lamdi eins fast og g get
Me nefinu mnu

Hopppolla
I engum stgvlum
Allur rennvotur (rennblautur)
I engum stgvlum

Og g f blnasir
En g stend alltaf upp
(Hopelandic)

Og g f blnasir
Og g stend alltaf upp
(Hopelandic)

ENGLISH TRANSLATION

Jumpin' Puddles

Smiling
Spinning 'round and 'round
Holding hands
The whole world a blur
But you are standing

Soaked
Completely drenched
No rubber boots
Running in us
Want to erupt from a shell

Wind in
Aand outdoor smell of your hair
I hit as fast as I could
With my nose

Hopping into puddles
Completely drenched
Soaked
With no boots on

And I get nosebleed
But I always get up
(Hopelandic)

And I get nosebleed
But I always get up
(Hopelandic)---Lyrics submitted by Cee Cee.
