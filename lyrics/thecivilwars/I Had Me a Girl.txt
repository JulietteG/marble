I had me a girl
Who taught me those things
A young man should know
Down, down on my knees
Id beg and Id plead
To learn a little bit more
Oh that woman taught me to pray
I saw Heaven every day
Lord, she could
Oooooooo
Ooooooohhhhohhhh
Ooooooo
Ooooohhhhhhhhhh

I had me a boy
Who buttoned me down
Drew me a line
He, he washed me as clean
As a sinner could be
Showed me the light
Oh that boy, he taught me to pray
But for all of his spit-shinin ways
Lord, he could
Oooooooo
Ooooooohhhhohhhh
Ooooooo
Ooooohhhhhhhhhh

I had me a girl
Like cigarette smoke
She came and she went
I slipped through his hands
To my back door man
Under his chin
Oh that woman taught me to pray
But for all her wandering ways
She could
Oooooooo
Ooooooohhhhohhhh
Ooooooo
Ooooohhhhhhhhhh ---
