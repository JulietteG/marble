I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for the long time now

I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for the long time now

I can hear the footsteps following behind me
Trying to find me but when I turn around
I can't see where the path goes
Into the shadows, into the shadows

I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for the long time now

I can hear you breathing
Whispering in my ear, "There is nothing to fear"
But when I turn around
As I see the trees bow, I only hear the wind blow

By mistake I felt alone, in my heart I've always known
You'd be there to bring me home

I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for a long, long time
I been waiting for the long time now
I been waiting for the long time now
I been waiting for the long time now---
