She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, don't mind
But what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance
On the floor in the round

She told me her name was billie jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me
Be careful what you do
And don't go around
Breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me
Be careful who you love
Be careful what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that
I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)
Do think twice
Hooo

She told my baby
We'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo
My baby cried
His eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
Coz we dance on the floor, in the round, baby

People always told me
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around
Breaking young girls' hearts
(Don't break no hearts)

She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that
I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that
I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No, no
She says I am the one
(Oh, babe)
But the kid is not my son

Hee, hee, hee!
Hoo!
Hoo!

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No, no, no
Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that
I am the one

(You know what you did to me, babe)
But the kid is not my son
No, no, no, no
No, no

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

No, no

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one

Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover ---
