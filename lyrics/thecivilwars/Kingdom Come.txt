Run, run, run away
Buy yourself another day
A cold wind's whispering
Secrets in your ear
So low only you can hear

Run, run, run and hide
Somewhere no one else can find
Tall trees bend their lean pointing where to go
Where you will still be all alone

Don't you fret my dear
It'll all be over soon
I'll be waiting here
For you

Run fast if you can
When no one has to understand
Fly high across the sky
From here to kingdom come
Fall back down to where you're from

Don't you fret my dear
It'll all be over soon
I'll be waiting here 
For you

For you (x2)

Don't you fret my dear (Don't you fret my dear)
It'll all be over soon (It'll all be over soon)
And I'll be waiting here
Don't you fret my dear
It'll all be over soon
And I'll be waiting here
For you (x3)


Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany Weber.
