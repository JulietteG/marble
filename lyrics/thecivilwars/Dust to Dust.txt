It's not your eyes
It's not what you say
It's not your laughter
That gives you away
You're just lonely
You've been lonley
Too long

All your acting
Your thin disguise
All your perfectly delivered lies
They don't fool me
You've been lonely
Too Long

Let me in the wall
You built around
We can light a match
and burn them down
Let me hold your hand
and dance round
and round the flame
in front of us

Dust to Dust

You've held your head up
You fought the fight
You've mended scars
You've done your time
Listen to me
You've been lonely
Too long

Let me in the walls
You built around
We can light a match
and burn them down
Let me hold your hand
and dance round
and round the flames
in front of us

Dust to Dust

You're like a mirror
Reflecting me
Takes one to know one
So take it from me
Youve been lonlely
Youve been lonlely
Too long
We've been lonely 
We've been lonely 
Too long---Lyrics submitted by Dorothy Morgan.
