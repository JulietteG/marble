You're a red string tied to my finger
A little love letter i carry with me.
You're sunlight smoke rings and cigarettes.
Outlines and kisses from silersceens.

Oh, dear, never saw you coming.
Oh, my, look what you have done.
You're my favorite song
Always on the tip of my tongue.

You own me with whispers like peotry.
Your mouth is a melody I memorize.
Mmm, so sweet
I hear it echo everywhere i go, day and night.

Oh, dear, never saw you coming.
Oh, my, look what you have done.
You're my favorite song
Always on the tip of my tongue.

The tip of my tongue

Oh oh oh oh oh , dear, never saw you coming.
Oh, my, look what you have done.
You're my favorite song
Always on--
Oh oh oh, dear, never saw you coming.
Oh, my, look what you have done
You're my favorite song
Always on the tip of my tongue

Hoo oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Hoo oh oh oh oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Michelle Holm.
