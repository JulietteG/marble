I dont want to talk right now
I just want your arms wrapped around
Me in this moment
Before it runs out

Oh dont say that its over
Oh no say it aint so
Lets let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I dont care
For all that weve got, dont let go
Just hold me

I cant pull you closer than this
Its just you and the moon on my skin
Oh who says it ever has to end
Oh dont say that its over
Oh no say it aint so

Lets let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I dont care
For all that weve got, dont let go
Just hold me

Lets let the stars watch
Let them stare
Let the wind eavesdrop
I dont care
For all that weve got, dont let go

Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me ---
