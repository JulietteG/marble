If I didn't know better,
I'd hang my head right there.
If I didn't know better, 
I'd follow you up the stairs.
Stop saying oh sweet things,
you know I like to hear. 
The horns are blowing louder,
and they're destroying me. 
Why do I keep drinking,
Wasting my time on you?
If I didn't know better,
well dammit I do!

There's a hole in what you're saying,
I can plainly see.
You have a lover that's waiting, 
but baby You're right here with me.

Ooh you might as well be the devil,
Oh keeping me out past three.
Well you're the one with that apple,
but baby you can't blame me.
Why don't you keep drinking,
Get me one night with you.

If I didn't know better,
Well dammit I do!
You know that I do. 
Oh baby you're right here with me,
Oh sweet baby you know that I do.---Lyrics submitted by Fawn.
