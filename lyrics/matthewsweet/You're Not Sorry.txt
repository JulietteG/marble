All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around,
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down,
And its taken me this long baby but i figured you out,
And your thinking we will be fine again but not this time around.

You dont have to call anymore,
I wont pick up the phone,
This is the last straw dont wanna hurt anymore,
And you can tell me that your sorry but i dont believe you baby like i did before,
Your not sorry no no no no.

Your lookin so innocent i might be believe you if i didn't know woah,
Could have loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waitin in the cold old,
And you've got your share of secrets and im tired of bein last to know woah,
And know your askin me to listen cause it's worked each time before,

But you don't have to call anymore, 
i wont pick up the phone,
This is the last straw don't wanna hurt anymore,
And you can tell me that your sorry but i don't believe you baby like i did before,
Your not sorry anymoooore oore,
Your not sorry no no whoaa.

Instrumental.

You had me goin for you honey, 
and it never would have gone away no,
You used to shine so bright,
But i watched all of it fade.

So you dont have to call anymore,
I wont pick up the phone,
This is the last straw there's nothin left to beg for,
And you can tell me that your sorry but i dont believe you baby like i did befooore,
Your not sorry no no nooooo,
Your not sorry no no noooo.

No, no, no, nooooo,
No, no, noo,
No, no, noo,
Woaah, woaah, woah
Oh, oh, noooo,
Oh, Oh, Oh nooo.
No.

No, no noooo.---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
