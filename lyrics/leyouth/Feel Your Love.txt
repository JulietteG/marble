(feat. Javeon)

I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I've realized that this is you
I've realized that this is you
I-I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I've realized that this is you!

Seem far the distance that I've jumped from your ship
Before I fall be forever till it's pleased to wise up
You know that if only ever if only ever
If you know, now you never want to, never have to
Think of me like the way I thought of you
Hold me like the way I trust I would hold you, yeaah yeee!

And I never thought you loved me
Looove

I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I've realized that this is you
I've realized that this is you
I-I-I-I just wanna feel your loving
I've realized that this is you!---
