Up on me
Holler at me

Up on me
Holler at me
Up on me
Holler at me

All I wanna do is make you dance with me
All I wanna do is make you dance with me
All I wanna do is make you dance with me

Up on me
Holler at me

All I wanna do is make you dance with me
All I wanna do is make you dance with me

You say you wanna kick it
Love the way you rock it, how you feel it
Take me to the dance floor, I get your head spinning
Went on good, now you talking about splitting
I be your number one, boy, I keep on winning
Im young, you need to forget the other women
You wanna dance with me, boy, you better bring it
Boy, you better bring it

All I wanna do is make you dance with me
All I wanna do is make you dance with me

Up on me
Holler at me
Up on me
Holler at me
Up on me
Holler at me

All I wanna do is make you dance with me---
