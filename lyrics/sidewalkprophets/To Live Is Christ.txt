If I rise, let me rise on you
Not on all of my successes, my sting or my pursuits
If I lose, let me lose my life
Cuz if I belong to Jesus, the flesh is crucified

For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain

If I grow, let me grow in You
whilt the seeds of wanting more
ripped and pried out by the roots
and if I'm still, let me hear You speak
Not the tone of my transgressions,
but the song of the Redeemed

For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain

For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain

My great desire is to be with You
But this is the place you chose for me
this is the place you chose for me
to lift my cross and give everything
this is the time you gave to me
this is the time you gave to me

For me to live is Christ, For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain
I'll never be the same, I'll never be the same
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain---
