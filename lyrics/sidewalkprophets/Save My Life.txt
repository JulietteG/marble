Weve met half a dozen times
I know your name I know you dont know mine
But I wont hold that against you

You come here every Friday night
I take your order and try to be polite
And hide what Ive been going through

If you looked me right in the eye
Would see the pain deep inside
Would you take the time to

Tell me what I need to hear
Tell me that Im not forgotten
Show me theres a God
Who can be more than all Ive ever wanted
Cause right now I need a little hope
I need to know that Im not alone
Maybe God is calling you tonight
To tell me something
That might save my life

Im the pastor at your church
For all these years youve listened to my words
You think I know all the answers

But Ive got doubts and questions too
Behind this smile Im really just like you
Afraid and tired and insecure

If you look me right in the eye
Would you see the real me inside
Would you take the time to

Save my life

I am just like everyone
Jesus I need You, I need Your Love
To save my life---
