We beat the odds together
Didnt care when they said wed never last
We kept our eyes on our own path
Time flies and we watch the others
Fall apart when they once were lovers
Who everyone said would make it through
How far weve come darling look at us...

If I could do it all again I would
Give me the bad days along with the good
My heart is even more in love
Then it was on day one...
Funny how it all falls into place
We grow even closer with every mistake
Its crazy how were still in love
The way we were on day one...

Who said the road was easy
Our hearts were put to the test believe me... yes
But still we found our happiness
No one knows what the future holds
But right here and right now I just want you to know
We got a bond unbreakable
Were so in love... darling look at us

If I could do it all again I would
Give me the bad days along with the good
My heart is even more in love
Then it was on day one...
Funny how it all falls into place
We grew even closer with every mistake
Its crazy how were still in love
The way we were on day one...

We havent been without our issues
But Im so blessed to do this with you
What a journey that weve been through
Look at us...

If I could do it all again I would
Give me the bad days along with the good
My heart is even more in love
Then it was on day one...
Funny how it all falls into place
We grew even closer with every mistake
Its crazy how were still in love
The way we were on day one...---
