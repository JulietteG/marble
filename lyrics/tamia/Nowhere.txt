You made me want it, want it, want it
Early in the mornin', mornin', mornin'
I could use another round, another round, oh,
Come take it, take it, take it, oh,
We pimpin', baby, baby,
Love how that sounds, how that sounds

Oh, I want it, I need it
Say you'll never let me go
We go over and over just thought I'd let you know
How I feel when you're not around
Falling for you more
My anything, my everything,
I'll never tell you no

And you ain't going nowhere, nowhere,
No how, no way, no bae, no bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
And this ain't going nowhere, nowhere,
No how, no way, oh bae, oh bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
Oh bae

Silly, silly, silly
Like really, really, all because I'm missing you
Look at what I do
Trippin', trippin', trippin'
I'm flippin', flippin', flippin' out on you
Look what your love's made me do
(Look what your love made me do)

Oh, I want it, I need it
Say you'll never let me go
We go over and over just thought I'd let you know
How I feel when you're not around
Falling for you more
My anything, my everything,
I'll never tell you no

And you ain't going nowhere, nowhere,
No how, no way, no bae, no bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
And this ain't going nowhere, nowhere,
No how, no way, oh bae, oh bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
Oh bae

And I'm all about you,
And I know you're all about me, too
And I buried your love in my heart
And no matter what they say,
Can't tell me nothin' 'bout my baby
When your love is side-by-side,
You can't tell it apart (you can't tell it apart)
And I'm all about you,
And I know you're all about me, too
And I buried your love in my heart
And no matter what they say,
Can't tell me nothin' 'bout my baby
When your love is side-by-side,
You can't tell it apart

Oh, I want it, I need it
Say you'll never let me go
We go over and over just thought I'd let you know
How I feel when you're not around
Falling for you more
My anything, my everything,
I'll never tell you no

And you ain't going nowhere, nowhere,
No how, no way, no bae, no bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
And this ain't going nowhere, nowhere,
No how, no way, oh bae, oh bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
Oh babe---
