For the first time in my life
I just might be tongue tied
For me to wake up with you kissing me
Saying youve been missing me
What a beautiful surprise

Cause I wasnt expecting you till late tonight
No, and I didnt hear you come inside
But theres nothing in this world that I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms

All I can say is
Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

I aint that easy to shock
But it looks like you hit the spot
For me to wake up with you holding me
And telling me youre loving me
Youve got my heart on love

Yeah
Cause I wasnt expecting you till late tonight
No, and I didnt hear you come inside
But theres nothing in this world that I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms

All I can say is
Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

I was needing you so bad
You know, it feels like Im dreaming
My mind explodes
For you to be the first thing that I see when I open my eyes
Such a beautiful, beautiful surprise

Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

A beautiful surprise, yeah...---
