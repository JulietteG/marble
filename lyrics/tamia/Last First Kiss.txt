Can I talk to you for a second
I just have a few things I wanna tell you
Don't be nervous

[Verse 1]
When it comes to you I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't even change the things I could change
Cause baby you're perfect, perfect to me
Simply means that you are perfect for me
You're the answer to a prayer I haven't prayed
Got me ready to settle down
I think I wanna say, I'm falling in love with you
I'm so feeling all of this
Baby I'm praying that you're.......

[Chorus]
My last first kiss
Baby won't you be my last time kissing somebody
For the very first time
All my ladies say la la la la la
Our first time making love
Baby I pray that this is the last time that I
Make love to for the very first time
My ladies say la la la la la

[Verse 2]
Feel what I'm saying I hope that you're the last
Somebody to take me home to meet his mom and dad
I hope that it's the last first 
Time I say I love you
Hope that it's the last first
Time you say you love me too
Don't wanna ever kiss and say goodbye
If you just wanna kick it
Then you're wasting my time
Cause my plan is to not just have a hit and quit
My plan is to make you........

[Chorus]
My last first kiss
Baby won't you be my last time kissing somebody
For the very first time
All my ladies say la la la la la
Our first time making love
Baby I pray that this is the last time that I
Make love to for the very first time
All my ladies say la la la la la

[Bridge]
The first time I kissed you 
I just knew it felt right
Then when I'm with you, I'm walking cloud nine
Just being with you makes my whole life shine
Whenever I'm with you, whenever I kiss you
The first time I kissed you 
I just knew it felt right
Then when I'm with you, I'm walking cloud nine
Just being with you makes my whole life shine
Whenever I'm with you........
