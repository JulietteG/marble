[Verse 1]
He met her in his hometown a couple of years ago
She was beautiful inside and out
How could he just let her go
He had girls on the side and he tried to hide
But somehow she knew
Still she stayed, she stayed
But she would always cry every night
But then he noticed a change
She no longer had tears on her face

[Chorus]
When a woman stops cryin,
You best believe she has a new plan
She's preparing for something new
Something that doesn't include you
When a woman cease to cry 
She bout ready to say good-bye
Good-bye...

[Verse 2]
When you stay out late she don't call
To ask where you are n where you at
She just gives you this look when you 
Come home that says betta watch your back
Fellas listen to ya girl when she tells 
You that she's all cried out
You betta pray that she stays
If she no longer cries every night
If she doesn't complain anymore
She's makin her way to that front door

[Chorus]
When a woman stops cryin,
You best believe she has a new plan
She's preparing for something new
Something that doesn't include you
When a woman cease to cry 
She bout ready to say...

Just as long as she is arguing
Fussin and complainin as long
As she will cry sometimes
Everything (everything) is alright
But as soon as she is quiet
When you mess up she's silent
And has this certain smile upon her face

When a woman stops cryin,
You best believe she has a new plan
She's preparing for something new
Something that doesn't include you 
(Baby it don't include you)
When a woman cease to cry 
When a woman stops cryin [2X]
When a woman stops cryin over you---Lyrics submitted by Carter.
