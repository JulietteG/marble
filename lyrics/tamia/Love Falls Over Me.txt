Oh, When the days fly by, when I lost another one
Oh, I'ma give you my time, baby you compare to none
Oh, and a two and three, won't find another one, another one

Keeping you close, loving you most
I've been alive, I can say I was
You fill in my blanks, you do what I can't
If love were a game, I could say I were

When my heart beats harder and my thoughts get louder
And my tongue gets tied up
That's when your love falls over me
Making me hot much summer
Nothing without, don't wanna
I don't know what I'm under
When your love falls over me

Oh, with your lips on mine you can feel my body blow
Oh, we'll be speeding no brakes, gotta love, unstoppable
Oh, what we got, they don't get it, it's just different, nobody knows

Keeping you close, loving you most
I've been alive, I can say I was
You fill in my blanks, you do what I can't
If love were a game, I could say I were

When my heart beats harder and my thoughts get louder
And my tongue gets tied up
That's when your love falls over me
Making me hot much summer
Nothing without, don't wanna
I don't know what I'm under
When your love falls over me

I feel my mind going, I hear my voice shaking
Ooh boy, when your love falls over
Babe, you don't even know that you are taking me over the edge

When my heart beats harder and my thoughts get louder
And my tongue gets tied up
That's when your love falls over me
Making me hot much summer
Nothing without, don't wanna
I don't know what I'm under
When your love falls over me
When my heart beats harder and my thoughts get louder
And my tongue gets tied up
That's when your love falls over me
Making me hot much summer
Nothing without, don't wanna
I don't know what I'm under
When your love falls over me---
