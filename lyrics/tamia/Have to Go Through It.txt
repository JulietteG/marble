[Tamia] (Eric Benet)
(There aint no joy without pain)
[And there aint no sunshine without rain]
(And there are no couples who are problem free)
[no and there aint no body who can make me happy]

Both:
I have to go through it with somebody
And baby that somebody is you
I have to go through it with somebody
And i want that someone to be u


(what would we do) [what would we do]
(Where would we go)[(where we go]
(what would tell me that i do not know)
[i know that ur mine
i know that ur fine
So ur are not perfect i really don't mind]
(no were gonna argue and were gonna fuss
That's gonna happen that is called love)
[and were gonna break up were gonna make up
Lets stay together ur love will take us]

Both:
I have to go through it with somebody
And baby that somebody is you
I have to go through it with somebody
And i want that someone to be you

Both:
All the time spent tryin to find whose right or wrong
Tryna tell u urs when i have some of my own
Lets agree to duisagree on certainthings
Cause we could break up and move on
But it would be the same old thing with somebody else

Both:
I have to go through it with somebody
And baby that somebody is you
I have to go through it with somebody
And i want that someone to be you

Both:
I have to go through it with somebody
And baby that somebody is you
I have to go through it with somebody
And i want that someone to be you

Both:
I have to go through it with somebody
And baby that somebody is you
I have to go through it with somebody
And i want that someone to be you---Lyrics submitted by Fiefa.
