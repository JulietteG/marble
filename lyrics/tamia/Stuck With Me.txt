If I was to fall apart
Please don't leave me in the dark
Baby, ooh baby
When you cry
Shed your tears
I will catch all your fears
Baby, ooh baby

Don't you ever worry
Cause I'm here for you
I'm always by your side
Always near
When I'm not with you
I feel lost without you
I'm telling the truth
I'm so lost without you

If all you gave was a smile
I don't mind boy stay a while
Baby, ooh baby
If I could choose your every thought
You'd love me more maybe not
Baby, ooh baby

When I'm not with you
I feel lost without you
I'm telling the truth
I'm so lost without you

Baby you're stuck with me
Baby you're stuck with me
Baby you're stuck with me
Baby you're stuck with me

When I'm not with you
I feel lost without you
I'm telling the truth
I'm so lost without you

Baby I'm so lost without you
I'm so lost without you
And I'm so lost without you
I'm so lost without you---
