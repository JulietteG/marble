Yea, yea
Usually when two people are together
For a long time things seem to change
It's been said that nothing good lasts forever
But this love gets better every day
We get all excited inside every time that we get alone
He still got love in his eyes and I still got love in my soul

Still and still feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers even though
We're grown and married with kids
And we still talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still

Now I still smile in the morning
When I realize I'm still in his arms
We know everything about each other
But we still keep holding on, yea
We never gonna break up
We'll be always there to make up
As long as we stick together we'll climb higher
I'm gonna ride with him to the wire
Our love is never gonna end, we're on fire

Still and still feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers even though
We're grown and married with kids
And we still talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still

We go through problems just like everybody else
But I really don't mind because it makes us keep it fresh
Now what's sadder than an argument
Is the thought we may have never been
He is my lover, my baby's father, my lifetime partner and my friend

Still the man of my dreams he's still
Still the man for me and I'm still in love with him
So deeply, I think I'll sing it again, he's still
Still the man of my dreams, he's still, still the man for me
And I'm still in love with him, deep, deeply

Still and still feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers even though
We're grown and married with kids
And we still talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still

Still and still feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers even though
We're grown and married with kids
And we still talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still---Lyrics submitted by evelyn esguerra.
