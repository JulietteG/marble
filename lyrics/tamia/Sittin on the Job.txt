Sitting here on the job and hoping that you will call me
(My eyes) My eyes are tired from us sitting up and  just talking, all night
My supervisor noticed I'm kinda slow for today my girlfriends also noticed, 
I'm joyful what can i say? I'ts only been two months but, I'm praying that your'e the one.
Please baby be the one, please baby be...

Keep replaying your kisses cant get them out of my mind
I try, my work is piling up and who guessed that i'd get behind?
But thats fine
It's only 12:07, I take my first break at 2, it seems I have a message
I hope to God that it's you, it's only been two months but, 
 I'm praying that your the one, please baby be the one, please baby be...
Na na na na na na na na na na na na nana 

It's 2:13 I'm smiling I hear your voice on the phone (oh my)
Tell me you wana see me can't wait until I am home tonight
My mind says slow it down girl, this thing right here is so new
but my heart says keep it moving, two thoughts but I'm not confused
I'ts only been two months but I'm praying that you're the one please baby be the one please baby be...---Lyrics submitted by Tish.
