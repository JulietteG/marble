With every passing moment 
Thoughts of you run through my head 
Everytime that I'm near you 
I realize that your heaven sent 

I think your truly something special 
Just what my dreams are really made of 
Let's stay together you and me boy 
There's no one like you around 
Oh Baby 

I really like what you've done to me 
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you 

It could be the way that you hold me 
It could be the things that you say 
Oh I'm not too sure what it is boy 
But I know I like feeling this way 

I think your truly something special 
Just what my dreams are really made of 
Let's stay together you and me boy 
There's no one like you around 
Oh Baby 

I really like what you've done to me 
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you 

Oh I really like 
What I feel when I'm with you 
Your a dream come true 
Don't you ever leave my side 
Cuz it feels so right 

I really like what you've done to me 
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you---
