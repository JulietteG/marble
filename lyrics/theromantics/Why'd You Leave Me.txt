Why did you leave/ I thought we were tight 
Where do you go in the dark of the night 
Who are you seeing / can't you explain
What's the reason? Tell me his name

I can't believe it's true; didn't even say goodbye
I'm so in love with you; tell me why
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me

Is it over / girl, are we through
Does he love you / say it's not true.
Where'd you meet him / Is he your type 
Won't you tell me what is he like?

I can't believe it's true; didn't even say goodbye
I'm so in love with you; tell me why
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me

Do you let him take you to bed 
Does her want you, or only your head 
Do you make him get out in time
Don't you want him coming inside

I can't believe it's true; didn't even say goodbye
I'm so in love with you; tell me why
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me
why'd you leave me---Lyrics submitted by felicia kovacs.
