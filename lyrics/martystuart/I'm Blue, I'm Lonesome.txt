The lonesome sound of a train going by
Makes me wanna stop and cry
I recall the day it took you away
I'm blue, I'm lonesome too

Well, when I hear that whistle blow
I want to pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry

In the still of night, in the pale moonlight
The wind it moans and sighs
These aw-felt blues, I just can't lose
I'm blue, I'm lonesome too

Well, when I hear that lonesome whistle blow
I want to pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry

I'm blue, I'm lonesome too---
