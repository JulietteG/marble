Everybody on the count of three
Accept crime 1-2-3
Bethlehem to Galilee
Accept crime 1-2-3

Between the sheets, the voyeur watches you
And each careless takes us one step furthur from his tired truth
Say, we will be free to use our bodies as we please
We will be free to use our bodies as we please

Hey!
There's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts

Let the clegry damn our evey emotion
Until the impluse is a revolution
What we know to be good will lead and carry us through
It's your choice to use your disobediant free will
Say, we will be free to use our bodies as we please
We will be free to use our bodies as we please

Hey!
There's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts

I'll feel no guilt
I won't repent
Day to day I accept crime
And that's for me to confess

Hey!
There's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts

Between two beating hearts
I know---Lyrics submitted by John.
