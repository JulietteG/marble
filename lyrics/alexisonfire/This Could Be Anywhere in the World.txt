[George:] 
This town has its claws buried in my neck
This town, it takes lives, without mercy, without hate

[Dallas:] 
The streets are in distress
The sun suffocates behind darkened skies

[George:] 
The grass is growing on top of my feet
I'm sinking, won't be long, before I'm too deep to run

[Dallas:] 
The line up seems endless
Underneath the salvation signs.

[George:] 
We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause
We are the bend before the break. Our steps seal our fate.

[Chorus:] 
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls).

[George:] 
Every step I take I leave a small piece 
Of myself behind. Soon there will be nothing left.

[Dallas:] 
The cracks in the pavement,
Match the cracks in their weathered skin

[George:] 
The sky's a brick wall
The ground's a juggernaut
Each day they get a bit closer
Between them, I am caught.

[Dallas:] 
I stare in amazement, 
I can't believe this is where I live.

[George:] 
Every breath I take I feel my lungs seal
This breeze feels more like shards of glass I'm more scars than skin

[Chorus:]
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls).

[George:] 
Our steps seal fate, our steps seal fate.

This is our celebration
Come join the lost souls
[x2]

[Dallas:] 
This city, this city is haunted.

[George:] 
Oh! Walk with us. Oh! Down. Walk with us.

[Chorus:] 
This city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls).---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
