It is like im always thinking to myself
id like to meet someone else
it is like im always thinking to myself
id like to meet someone else

[Chorus]
darling dont give me shit 
cause i know that you are full of it
(youre full of shit, youre full of shit)
darling dont give me shit
cause i know that you are full of it
(youre full of it, youre full of it)

im sittin with my friends getting drunk again
on wine and i think about you
im sittin with my friends getting drunk again
on wine and i think about you

you dont have to think about yourself all the time
youre full of shit
you know you dont,
no you dont have to be so up yourself all the time
you could come round to mine
we could drink some wine
in the summertime
it could be quite nice
you could come round to mine
we could drink some wine
in the summertime
it could be quite nice

actually, i think i might just have the bottle, to myself

[Chorus]

darling dont give me shit
cause i know that youre full of it
yeah i know that youre full of it

you could come round to mine
we could drink some wine
in the summertime
it could be quite nice
you could come round to mine
we could drink some wine
in the summertime
it could be quite nice---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
