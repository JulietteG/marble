All I know is that you're so nice,
You're the nicest thing I've seen.
I wish that we could give it a go,
See if we could be something.

I wish I was your favorite girl,
I wish you thought I was the reason you were in the world.
I wish my smile was your favorite kind of smile,
I wish the way that I dressed was your favorite kind of style.

I wish you couldn't figure me out,
But you don't always want to know what I was about.
I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset,
I wish you'd never forget the look on my face when we first met.

I wish you had a favorite beauty spot that you loved secretley,
'Cause it was on a hidden bit that nobody else could see.
Basically, I wish that you loved me,
I wish that you neede me,
I wish that you knew when we said two sugars actually I meant three.

I wish that without me your heart would break,
I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake.
I wish that without me you couldn't eat,
Yeah I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep.

Look, all i know is that you're the nicest thing I've ever seen,
And I wish we could see if we could be something,
Yeah I wish we could see if we could be something.---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
