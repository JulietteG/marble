Simply knowing you exist ain't good enough for me
But askin for your telephone number
Seems highly inappropriate

Seeing as I can't
Even say hi
When you walk by

And that time you shook my hand it felt so nice
I swear I've never felt this way about any other guy
And I don't usually notice peoples eyes but...

I conducted a plan to bump into you most accidentally
But I was walking along and I bumped into you
Much more heavinly than I'd originally planned
It was well embarrassing and I think you thought that I was a bit of a twat...

I just think that we'd get on
Oh, I wish I could tell you face to face
Instead of singing this stupid song
But yeah I just think that we might get on

So I went to that party, everyone
They were kind of arty
And I was wearing this dress
'Cause I wanted to impress
But I wasn't sure if I looked my best
'Cause I was so nervouse
But I carried on regardless
Strutting through each room trying to find you

And when I saw you kissing that girl
My heart it shattered
And my eyes they watered
And when I tried to speak I stu...uttered
And my friends were like whatever
You'll find somone better
His eyes were way to close together
And we never even liked him from the start
And now he's with that tart
And I heard she done some really nasty stuff
Down at the park with Michael
He said she's easy
And if your guy's with someone that's sleazy
Then he aint worth your time 'cause you deserve a real nice guy

So I proceeded to get drunk and cry
And lock myself in the toilet for the entire night

Saturday night I watched channel five
I particularly liked CSI
I don't ever dream about you and me
I don't ever make up stuff about us that would be classed as insanity
I don't ever drive by your house to see if you're in
I don't even have an opinion on that tramp that you are still seeing
I don't know your timetable
I don't know your face off by heart
But I must admitt that there is still a part of me
That thinks we might get on
That we could get on
That we should get on---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
