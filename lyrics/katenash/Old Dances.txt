Your lips are darker than before
and the bags under your eyes are blacker than they were
and there's something different about your skin
and nobody knows how you got home last night

Your lips are darker than before
and the bags under your eyes are blacker than they were
and there's something different about your skin
and nobody knows how you got home last night

Your bones are making me feel weary and when you speak
I can't hear a word that you say

Your bones are making me feel weary and when you speak
I can't hear a word that you say
and nobody knows how you got home last night

And still no one knows how you got home last night

If there were three old dances we could dance maybe
Three old songs that we could sing maybe
everything could be alright

But i keep trippin' up the steps and there are just some words I forget
and the tunes are fuzzy in my mind

And nobody knows how you got home last night
still nobody knows how you got home

And my brain hurts and my soul is aching
and i'm not sure if my heart can take it
And my brain hurts and my soul does ache and I
I have never felt this much pain
And my brain hurts and my sould does ache and I think my heart's about to break

And nobody knows how you got home last night
Still, no one knows how you got home last night---Lyrics submitted by Brandy.
