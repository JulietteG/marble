Everybody thinks that girl's so fine, 
Everybody's like "I'll make her mine!" 
Everyone thinks she's a bit of all right but I think
that she's not so nice! 
Every guy's looking in her eyes, 
Every guy's checking out her thigh 
Everyone thinks that girls a lady - but I don't. 
I think that girl's shady. 

I'll just read a book instead. 
I don't care if we're just friends. 
I can hang out with myself 
I'm old enough now to pretend. 
I'll just read a book instead. 
I know that you think she's best 
I don't even think she cares, 
I don't know what you see... 
There's nothing there.

But I think she's a bitch. 

I'll just read a book instead. 
I don't care if we're just friends. 
I can hang out with myself 
I'm old enough now to pretend. 
I'll just read a book instead. 
I know that you think she's best 
I don't even think she cares, 
I don't know what you see... 
There's nothing there.
