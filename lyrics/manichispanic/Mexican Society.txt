Don't wanna drown - I wanna be down
In a pool of Budweiser - rale!
A lime green metal plate '63 Chevrolet
I don't wanna watch I Love Lucy
I don't wanna listen to the oldies

I don't wanna drown in a Mexican society
Don't wanna drown in a Mexican society
Don't wanna drown in a Mexican society

I wanna be rich
Can't you see the way I dress?
All greased out with our head nets
There's too many ratas in my casa
I don't wanna listen to my old lady

I don't wanna drown in a Mexican society
Don't wanna drown in a Mexican society
Don't wanna drown in a Mexican society

(guitar solo)

Don't wanna drown
I wanna be down
In a pool of Budweiser, rale!
A lime green metal plate '63 Chevrolet
I don't wanna watch I Love Lucy
I don't wanna listen to the oldies

I don't wanna drown in a Mexican society
Don't wanna drown in a Mexican society
Don't wanna drown in a Mexican society---Lyrics submitted by hector zeroni.
