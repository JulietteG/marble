This is the hope
The hope is still real
A Jewish home
In Israel
This our time
We stand as one
If not now when
We must be strong
Our hearts turn to the East

Chorus:
This is the hope that holds us together
Hatikvah, the hope that will last forever
This is the hope that holds us together
Hatikvah, the hope is still real

This is the hope
2000 years
We pray for freedom
Through pain and tears
This is our faith
This is our voice
This is our promise
This is our voice
Our hearts turn to the East

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Hatikvah, the hope is real
Hatikvah, our hope, Israel
