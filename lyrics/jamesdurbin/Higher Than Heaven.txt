What was love?
Something that I just dreamed of
Somewhere in the corner of my heart
Rippin' and tearin' me apart
Oh, I was numb and had my demons
I lost hope, you gave me reason

Angels save me
God forgave me
But you alone take me higher than heaven
I don't need mercy, nothing can hurt me
As long as you're with me, I'm higher than heaven

Goin' insane
I was on a one-way train
Surrounded by my so-called friends
But this ain't where the story ends
Or where it begins
I was numb and had my demons
I gave up, but you believed

Angels save me
God forgave me
But you alone take me higher than heaven
I don't need mercy, nothing can hurt me
As long as you're with me, I'm higher than heaven
