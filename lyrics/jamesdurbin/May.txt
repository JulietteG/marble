Now, May and I were two children just swimming in a pool
We'd ride on rockets, swingsets and we tried to touch the moon
And I will never forget the first time she touched my hand
I knew this could be the one who would make me an honest man

She was like the way she was
She was like the way she was

Now, we got older faster than we ever could have seen
Lights went down on graduation then on a wedding ring
We bought our first house and had a baby on the way
But during birth, I got my daughter
Jesus took away my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
When you looked into her eyes you'd come undone
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

Now, baby girls love daddy most
But they need a mother's care
I tried my best to raise her right
I just couldn't braid her hair
One day she got old enough to have her wedding day
But as I walked her down the aisle
All I could see was my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
When you looked into her eyes you'd see the sun
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

I hope you can see what I see
'Cause when they talk about our baby girl they think of you
And they say to me

She's just like she was
When I looked into her eyes I'd see the sun
She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And doesn't care about the mistakes
She was like she was

She was just like she was
When I looked into her eyes I'd come undone
She was just like she was
And I cannot feel my heart beat
Without the thought of her inside me
She was like she was---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey.
