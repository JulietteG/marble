King of the Mountain

Bullet fast, tear down Bray, The twisting serpent waits
Spittin victory or cruel defeat, she deals the cards of fate

Rolling thunder, I hear them roar, Heroes never age,
Still they ride, Snow mountain high, spirits of the brave

King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain ,King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain,

Quarterbridge, all shiftin gears, nail it on to Ballacrye
Screamin  thru  the mountain gate and climbing to the sky

Rolling thunder, I hear them roar, Heroes never age,
Still they ride, Snow mountain high, spirits of the brave

King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain,

Rolling thunder, I hear them roar, Heroes never age,
Still they ride- Snow mountain high, spirits of the brave

King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain, King of the Mountain,
