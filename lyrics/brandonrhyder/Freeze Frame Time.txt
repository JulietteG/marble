It's a beautiful morning, to see the sun rise
It's moments like this that make me wish I could freeze frame time
I got a hot cup of coffee, gonna watch the world come alive
Surrounded by nature likens the innocence of a new born child

[Chorus]
Sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we cry
Some days it's hard to figure out our way in this life
But it's moments like this that make me wish
I could feeze fame time.
[End Chorus]

I got a picture in my pockets, of my baby boy
He's growing up so fast I swear he thinks he can conquer the world
Just yesterday evening, he come running up to me
He said he made his momma mad and that she said he was just like me

[Chorus 2]
And I laughed until I cried, all swallowed up with pride
You should have seent he concern  in that little boys' eyes
Yes it's moments like this that make me wish
I could freeze frame time.
[End Chorus 2]

You are an angel, you taught me how to fly
You picked me up when I was down turned me around and you made me fly high
We're a little bit older now, together we've seen some change
But I love you more now then I did on that very first day

[Chorus]
Sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we cry
Some days it's hard to figure out our way in this life
But it's moments like this that make me wish
Yes it's moments like this that make me wish
Yes it's moments like this that make me wish 
I could freeze frame time.
