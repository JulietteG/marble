There's something about the heart of this man
It pushes him harder than anyone can
He may be tired and saddle worn
But a cowboy's work is never done

He needs to be freeeeeeee like the wind
He needs to wildddddd like the man that he is
Through the darkness of summer
Or hartd winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done

To bed with the chickens
And up before dawn
He'll say his prayers beneath a mountain of stars
And there's cows to feed and wire to be strung
Cause a cowboy's work is never done

He needs to be freeeeee like the wind
He needs to be wildddddd like the man he is
Through the darkness of summer
Or a hard winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done

Tonight when he lies down
He'll fall fast asleep
You see this cowboy's the last of a dying breed
And when he lies down he'll leave his boots on
Cause a cowboy's work is never done

He needs to be freeeeee like the wind
He needs to be wilddddd like the man he is
Through the darkness of summer
Or a hard winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done

Through the long days of summer
Or a hard winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done

No a cowboys work is never done---Lyrics submitted by Jessa.
