On a warm summer night down in Austin,
I got down on one knee and asked for you hand
You said you're moving too fast, I'm not ready
Lets take it slow
And I said alright baby, baby we'll take it slow

And then I drove you home
You invited me in
I came to bed with you
And we made love

*Chorus*
Like it was our first time
Like it was the last time 
Like it was something brand spanking new
Like somthing we had never knew

Like it was the first time that I'd ever seen your face
Like it was the first night we made love
And you wore lace
I kissed you goodnight and I pulled out of the drive
Like it was the last time

On a cold rainy night down in Austin
I covered you up and I kissed you goodnight
I got in the car and pulled out of the drive and drove down the street
I put 'er in park at the stop sign

And then I put 'er in reverse
I backed 'er into the drive
I came to bed with you
And we made love

*Chorus*

Some things never give, but if it's the last thing I do
I promise you, I promise you
I'm gonna leave you

Like I did the last time
Like it was our first time
Like it was something brand spanking new
Like it was something we had never knew

Like it was the last time that I'd ever see your face
Like it was the first night we made love
And you wore lace
I kissed you goodnight
And i pulled out of the drive
Like it was the last time

Like it was the last time
Like it was the last time---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
