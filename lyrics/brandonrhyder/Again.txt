The first night that we met I must confess
You drove me crazy with your innocence
You knew, I was breaking all the rules

I took you in my arms and then we kissed
Beauty in your touch I can't resist
You knew, that I would fall for you

Like an eagle, moving in for the kill
I laid down for you time and time again

Any time, and place. You could call me and I'd come running
I'd crawl a mile down in your shoes
To have the change to lay with you
And do the things we shouldn't do again

It's crazy how I let you jerk my chain
I'm nothing but your puppet on a string
You knew, you had me where you wanted me
I cannot defend a thing you say
Promises you bend and then you break
You knew, I was the weaker of the two

Like an eagle, moving in for the kill
I lay down for you time and time again

Any place, any time. You could call me and I'd come running
I'd crawl a mile down in your shoes
To have the chance to lay with you 
And do the things we shouldn't do again

Any place, any time. You could call me and I'd come running
I'd crawl a mile down in your shoes
To have the chance to lay with you
And do the things we shouldn't do again

The first night that we met I must confess
You drove me crazy with your innocence.---Lyrics submitted by Jessa.
