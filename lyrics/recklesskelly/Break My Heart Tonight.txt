Well I got empty bottles and legal papers wrinkled up all over the floor
My pen won't write and my guitar doesn't have a song in it anymore
Well I can write another love song, yeah, but first you got to find someone to love
I could write another fight song, yeah, but there's got to be something to be proud of and they say

Misery loves company, but it damn sure ain't lookin' for me
I'll be all right, I just gotta find someone to break my heart tonight

Going out walkin' on Avenue B and I ain't comin' back until dawn
And find some stranger in a Greenwich bar to shower my affection upon
Well maybe she'll stay 'till one fateful day when we realize we've got nothin' left
And maybe I'll find she's messed up my mind and I can get back to doing what I do best and
they say

Misery loves company, but it damn sure ain't lookin' for me
I'll be all right, I just gotta find someone to break my heart tonight

Well all these A&R; guys keep knockin' on my door
I guess the last batch wasn't good enough cause they keep on wanting more and more and they say

Write what you know and it just goes to show, you gotta write your own destiny
I'll be all right, I just gotta find someone to break my heart tonight, they say
Misery loves company, but it damn sure ain't lookin' for me
I'll ber all right, I just gotta find someone to break my heart tonight.---Lyrics submitted by Jessa.
