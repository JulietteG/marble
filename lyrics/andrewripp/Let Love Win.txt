We take our corners
We don't back down
It's getting colder
With every round

When did we start fighting each other
Instead of fighting for the thing we had
Getting tired of the war now
I don't want to live like that

I want to hold on to you again
Come out of my corner and let love win
Send up a white flag and take your hand
I know we can make it
If we let love win

I miss that feeling
Of a good long kiss
I know we never
Meant to end up like this

But I'm not giving up here honey
No I'm not gonna walk away
Cuz without you is lonely
I don't want to live that way

I want to hold on to you again
Come out of my corner and let love win
Send up a white flag and take your hand
I know we can make it
If we let love win

No I'm not giving up here honey
No I'm not gonna walk away
I meant it when I said forever
And that ain't gonna change---
