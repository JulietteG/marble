(Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle,)

[Chorus]
Same old shit, just a different day
out here tryna get it, each and every way
momma need a house
baby need some shoes
times are getting hard
guess what Imma do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths dont get fed on this boulevard

[Ace Hood - Verse 1]
Okay, Im booked out until August
Show money deposits
See the shit then I cop it
got but a house note in my pocket
Im on south beach with the top off
Bad bitch and her ass soft
Something outta that catalogue
She introduced to that lock jaw
and I think her name was Lisa
Or maybe it was Sheila
My chevy sittin too high
I call that Wiz Khalifa
And Im all about the new Franklins
Aint talkin Aretha
Bitch my league too major
Im hiphop Derek Jeter
And Im still feeling my pockets
Big bass and its knocking
Yeah this be the remix
But still ride around with that rocket
Ill go walking back to my household
We The best be the logo
Hundred grand for that neck glow
All about the dinero
N-gga flow so retarded

Oh Kimosabe, it be me, Ross, Weezy party cause its the

Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way

Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what Imma do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths dont get fed on this boulevard

[Lil Wayne]
Ok, now, black card in my pocket
Riding round in that gotti
Pistol off my boxers
I aint got time to be boxing
Got a red bone she look tropic
If she f-ck me right then she shopping
Young money we poppin

See that V-neck, thats Polo
Grilled up like Ocho

N-gga Liv in Sundays, King of Diamonds Monday
Swagger just dumb, call it Kelly Bundy
Got a big house with a back yard, fish tank with sharks in it
Real n-gga Im authentic
Ill f-ck the bitches til she short winded
Got a bad bitch who be bartending
Couple homies that gang bang
I get on anybody track and hit that bitch with that Wayne train
Free my n-gga T.I

You p-ssy n-ggas you feline
Dont stop the party, we be getting gnarley
Oh kimosabe, Im with Mack, Fucus and Marley

Cause its the same old sh-t, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house, baby need some shoes
For that Carter IV, bitch, its coming soon

[Ace Hood]
Same old sh-t, just a different day
out here tryna get it, each and every way
momma need a house
baby need some shoes
times are getting hard
guess what Imma do---Lyrics submitted by Jacquez.
