Im addicted to money, Im addicted to cream
Im addicted to her, for that love Im a fiend 
Just imagine your touches, I can picture your rubbin
But I smile when I see ya, girl Im high of your lovin
Live my life like a dream, every king needs a queen
Girl my life is a movie, sipping Goose in Jacuzzi
Picture staring this movie, picture dripping in Luis 
See us cruising on yachts, while we feasting on sushi 
Used to mingle with groupies, they be begging to do me
But my mind on my misses, never mind all dem women
Feel me tasting your kisses, and its you what Im missing
Girl Ill trade in this living, I just want you to listen

Got the money and cars, biggest houses and yards
Had the baddest of broads, but Ive trade in it all
Hang up my player card, present the ace of heart
You can keep the fame, the game, the name and all the fancy cars
