Walking down city street
Damp boots kicking dirty snow
Rough shoulder and people he nears
Bad mouthing what it ain't known

Does hustles for a living
It's unforgiving in the promised land
Rock and roll on late and rythm
Must have run with twenty different bands

Soul kissing, head on fire
Soul kissing on love's dreams
Soul kissing could we take this thing higher
On Love Street

The way you walk
And to listen to the way you talk
For all the things we can not say
I'm happy we were made that way
When you answer with that silly smile
I'll come head up on the miracle mile
Pushing now to make that move
And no one's gonna rush us now we found that groove

Soul kissing, head on fire
Soul kissing on love's dreams
Soul kissing let me take this thing higher
On Love Street
On Love's dream

It's raining over New York
Wet kissing in the dirty snow
Overlooking Central Park
They listen to the Late Show
Soul Kissing in the early hour
Soul Kissing with your soul flame
Where stars go out
Welcome to the bars on Broadway

What can you say
Walking away
What can you say at all
He's finding it hard to make his ways

Coming home now
And it's hard to believe
A heart could be so free now
So free now
So free now
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?---Lyrics submitted by Hercule Poirot.
