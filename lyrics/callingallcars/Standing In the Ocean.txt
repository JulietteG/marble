The mind is made up of lies
A little tale's been compromised
It's never gonna me set in stone
For those with words may break their bones

There couldn't be another one like this
Another story that just don't exist
We're second guessing and for what, a twist
In time or space, our minds erased?

You're the one that told me to take chances
You're the one that led me to believe
Now here we are just standing in the ocean
And before too long we're dancing in the deep

Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Go on and take a long deep breath
It's about time you had some rest
Running around on red hot coals
Is burning up your worn out soul

I know that you don't need this
Far from the space you live in
Close your eyes and make a wish
Your time and space will never be the same again
Never be the same again...

You're the one that told me to take chances
You're the one that led me to believe
Now here we are just standing in the ocean
And before too long we're dancing in the deep

Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Ooowwww...

You're the one that told me to take chances
You're the one that led me to believe
Now here we are just standing in the ocean
And before too long we're dancing in the deep

Ooh, ooh, ooh...---
