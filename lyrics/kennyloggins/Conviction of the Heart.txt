Where are the dreams that we once had
This is the time to bring them back
What were the promises
caught on the tips of our tongues?

Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole lot of life
Waiting to live

One day we'll braven up
to talk with conviction of the heart

Down your streets I've walked alone
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I've chose
Doors I have opened and closed

I'm tired of living this life
Fooling myself
Believing that I

I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart

One with the Earth
With the sky
One with every thing in life
I believe we'll survive
if we only try

How long must we all wait to change
this world bound in chains that we live in
To know what it is to forgive
and be forgiven

Too many years of taking now
Isn't it time to stop somehow
Air that's too angry to breathe
Water our children can't drink

You've heard it hundreds of times
You say you're aware
You live and you care

But do you care enough
Where's your conviction of...
the heart?

One with the Earth
With the sky
One with every thing in life

I believe it will start
with Conviction of the Heart

One with the Earth
With the sky
One with everything in life

I believe it will start
with Conviction of the Heart

One Earth, one sky
Only one world

Only one chance
for one life
When will we live

One child
One dream
Only one life

Given one chance 
for one life
When will we live?

Only one Earth
Only one sky
Only one world
We've only got one chance to live in one life

I believe
It's only gonna start 
When we begin with some conviction of the Heart---Lyrics submitted by Bernard.
