Put away the pictures
Put away the memories
Ive poured over and over
Through my tears 
Ive held them till Im blind
They kept my hope alive
As if somehow that might keep you here
Once you believed in a love forever more
How do you leave it in a drawer 

Now here it comes
The hardest part of all
Unchain my heart thats holding on
How do I start to live my life alone
Guess Im just learning
Learning the art of letting go

Try to say its over
Say the word goodbye
But each time it catches in my throat
Your still here in me
And I cant set you free
So I hold on to what I wanted most
Maybe someday well be friends forever more
Wish I could open up that door

Now here it comes
The hardest part of all
Unchain my heart that holding on
How do I start to live my life alone
Guess Im just learning
Learning the art of letting go

Watching us fade
What can I do
But try to make it through the pain
Now one more day without you

Where do I start to live my life alone
I guess Im learning
Only learning
Learning the art of letting go---Lyrics submitted by hya.
