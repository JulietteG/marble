I want to break apart my heart
Glue the peices to my car
Crash into a wall, I want to feel it all, I want to break apart my heart

Doused in gasoline
'Til the fire burns clean
Flick a cigarette, like that movie Con Air, doused in gasoline

And if you think you are better than me, you're right
There's no one to love, there's no one to trust, in my life

I want to pick up the peices
Plant them in the ground
When a tree grows there, I want to chop that tree down
Turn it into a boat
Float it into a lake
With dynamite, I'll make it explode, if it makes me make mistakes

And if you think you are better than me, you're right
There's no one to love, there's no one to trust, in my life

Sometimes I get so lonesome I can't breathe
Sometimes I get so scared that I can't speak
Sometimes I get so worried I can't hear my heart beat
Anyway, anyway

I want to tear out my heart
And give it away
To a person more deserving one day

If all I see
Is the worse in everything
It's all I'm gonna get, it's all I'm gonna get, that's all I'm gonna get

And if you think you are better than me, you're right
There's no one to love, there's no one to trust, in my life
There's no one to love, there's no one to trust, in my life
No one to love, there's no one to trust, in my life---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
