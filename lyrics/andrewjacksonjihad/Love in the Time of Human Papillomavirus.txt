You would cough up crows
That would peck my eye
And I will do nothing
But go blind

But my heart
It has eyes
And my love
It has sight

Even though, it may be, a little cloudy

And you will break my back
For all the burdons I lay upon it
But I would never blame you
For those bees inside that spawn it

And my lungs, would grow cancers
And my back it would grow achey
I will buy, us an acre of some land in the city
We could live, there together
Or I'll live alone but happy
But I'll live,
Unfortunately---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
