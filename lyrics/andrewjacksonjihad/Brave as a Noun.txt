I could go off the deep end
I could kill all my best friends
I can follow those stylish trends
And god knows I can make a mend

But I've got an angry heart
Filled with cancers and puppy tarts
If this is how you folks make art
It's fucking depressing

And it's sad to know
That we are not alone
And it's sad to know
There's no honest way out

I'm afraid to leave the house
I'm as timid as a mouse
I'm afraid if I go out
I'll outwear my welcome

I am not a courageous man
I don't have any big lasting plans
Too cowardly to take a stand
I want to keep my nose clean

And it's sad to know
That we are not alone
And it's sad to know 
There's no honest way out

In this life we lead
We conquer everything
If we could just be brave
To get out of bed in the morning---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
