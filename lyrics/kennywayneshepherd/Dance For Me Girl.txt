Dance for me girl
Like you used to do
Dance for me girl
Let me see you move
I can't sleep at night
Couldn't work all day

Dance for me girl
'til the moring comes

Talk to me girl
Call my name out loud
Talk to me girl
Tell me how it feels

I can't sleep at night
Couldn't work all day
Dance for me girl
Dance for me girl

I can't sleep at night
Couldn't work all day
Dance for me girl
Dance for me girl---Lyrics submitted by Roger.
