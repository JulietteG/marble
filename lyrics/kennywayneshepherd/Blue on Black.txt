Night, falls, and I'm alone
Skin, yeah, chilled me to the bone
You, turned and you ran,
Oh yeah
Oh slipped, right from my hand

Hey
Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
A dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh yeah, blue on black

Blind, oh, now i see
Truth, lies, and in between
Wrong, cant be undone
Oh slipped, from the tip of
Your tongue

Hey
Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
A dead mans touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Doesn't bring you back, yeah
Blue on black
Oh, blue on black
Oh, yeah

Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
Is a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh yeah, blue on black

Hey
Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
Is a dead mans touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh, blue on black
Oh wha oh, blue on black
Oh, blue on black---
