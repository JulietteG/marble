(feat. Warren Haynes)

Laying round all alone on a rainy night
Like this
Starving for your love, hungry for just one kiss
Heavy rain is up on hill
On my window paint, be so liud and clear, words just speal your name
I got no where to turn
Tired of been alone, feel like breaking somebodys home
I know what you should listen
Hanging on my new belong and get someone else
Can't fight the feeling, after all I didn't make myself
Last night I cry so hard I believe I called you
Cant control the vibrations
Ooh my heart just wont stand still
Got nowhere to turn, I wont be alone
Feel like breaking up somebodys house
I know is useless hanging on a new belong
Is someone else,
Can't find the feeling, after all I didn't make myself
I got nowhere to turn you, time will be alone
Feel like breaking up somebodys house
I got no one in town, its time to be alone,
Feel like braking up somebodys home
Here I come baby,
Come on,
Ooh we love is somebodys house ---
