I'm gonna do all the things for you, 
A girl wants a man to do. 
Oh, baby (oh, baby). 
I'll sacrifice for you, 
I'll even do wrong for you. 
Oh, baby (oh, baby). 
Every minute, every hour I'm gonna shower, 
You with love and affection, 
Look out, it's comin' in a-your direction. 

And I'm, I'm gonna make you love me. 
Oh-woh, yes I will, yes I will. 
I'm gonna make you love me. 
Woh-oh, yes I will, yes I will. 

Lookee here, my love is strong, you see. 
I know you'll never get tired of me. 
Oh, baby (sho-oh,) ((oh, baby)). 
And I'm gonna use every trick in the book, 
I'll try my best to get you hooked. 
Hey, baby (take me, I'm yours). 
(Oh, baby.) 

And every night, every day, I'm gonna say, 
"I'm gonna get'cha, I'm gonna get'cha, 
Look out boy, 'cause I'm gonna get'cha." 
I'm gonna make you love me. 
Ooo, yes I will, yes I will. 
And I'm gonna make you love me. 
Ooo, yes I will, you know I will. 
(Yes I will.) 

Every breath I take, 
And each and every step I make, 
Brings me closer, baby, closer to you. 

And with each beat of my heart, 
For every day we're apart, 
I'll hunger for every wasted hour. 

And I, every night, and every day, 
I'm gonna get'cha, I'm gonna get'cha, 
Look out, 'cause I'm gonna get'cha. 
And I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make you love me. 
Oh-oh. (Yes I will, I will.) 
Ho, ho-oh. (Yes I will.) 

I'm gonna make you love me, oo-oh. 
Yes I will, yes I will. 
|Come on and love me.| 
I'm gonna make you love me. 
|Who-oo-ooo.| 
Yes I will, (you know I will, Yes I will.) 
|Ooo, come on and love me.| 
[Fade.] 
I'm gonna make you love me, take it, baby. 
Yes I will (you know I will). 
Yes I will... ---Lyrics submitted by P.
