Some of us live in big white houses
Some of us live in small
Some of our names are written on blackboards
Some are written on walls
Some of our daddies work in factories 
Some of them stand in line
Some of our daddies buy us marbles
Some of them just buy wine
But at night you can't tell Sunday suits from tattered overalls
But then we're only children
Children one and all

Some of us take our lunch in boxes
Some in paper sacks
Some of us kids join in the laughter
And some hear it at our backs
Some of our mothers sew fine linen
Some can't sew a stitch
Some of our mothers dress up poorly
Some of them dress up rich
But at night you can't tell party dresses from hand me downs too small
But then we're only children
Children one and all

Some of us learn our lessons poorly
Some of us learn them well
Some of us find an earthly Heaven
Some of us just find hell
Some of us go right on a preachin
Without making too much sense
Some of us hide behind a wall 
And some behind a fence
But at night you can't tell picket fences from bricks a tower tall
But then we're only children
Children one and all

Some of us grow up tall and handsome
Some of us grow up plain
Some of us own the world in ransom 
And some of us just our name
Some our people die in misery
Some of them die in peace
Some of our people die for nothing
But dying doesn't cease
And at night you can't tell fancy coffins from boxes in the hall
But then we're only children
Children one and all---Lyrics submitted by Gayeleen.
