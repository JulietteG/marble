They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near.
So i remember every face
Of every man who put me here.

I see my light come shinin'
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet i swear i see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

I see my light come shinin'
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long i hear his voice shouting so loud
Crying out that he was framed.

I see my light come shinin'
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Any day now, any day now i shall be released---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
