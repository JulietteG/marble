Some think that they deserve more
Give a little like it's become a chore
Don't demand things
Walk yourself out the door

I fell flat on my face too many times
left with nothing but some cheap perfume
Now you cry, Now you need me
Now that perfume's not cheap

Bridge:
But I told you...

Chorus:
If you wanted to be my only one
If you wanted to see this happen
Maybe you, You should have tried harder

If you thought I would leap into your arms
Everytime I would see your face
Then maybe you,You should have tried harder


Go on prove it, I love to see you try
convince me that you gave me the world
I tried and tried but you never opened your eyes

You stand tall like you've one some kind of award
But really I've never seen someone soo short or taller
If you gave me some more

Bridge:
But I told you...


Chorus:
If you wanted to be my only one
If you wanted to see this happen
Maybe you, You should have tried harder

If you thought I would leap into your arms 
everytime that I would see your face
Then maybe you, you should have tried harder


Some think that they deserve more
Give a little bit....

Chorus:
If you wanted to be my only one
If you wanted to see this happen
Maybe you, You should have tried harder

If you thought that I would leap into your arms 
everytime I would see your face
Then maybe you, you should have tried harder---Lyrics submitted by Lizzy.
