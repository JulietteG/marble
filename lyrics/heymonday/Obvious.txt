Lets make a mess 
Steal a kiss in the moment 
You and me everything that could be 
Touch, dont go 
Stay as long as you like 

Lets get reckless 
Dance with our hands to the beat 
Dont let this slip throw our fingers 
It feels insane 
Dont you put up a fight 
Lets rough it up till they shut it down 

Its o-o-o-obvious 
Right here is where the party starts with you and me 
All alone, no one has to know 
Its o-o-o-obvious to me 
How its gonna be 
O-o-o-obvious, when you come close to me 

Lets make a scene like movies in our dreams 
Make me scream 
Take me down, no ones watching 
Close your eyes, 
Play it back in rewind 

So serial as the story unfolds on the screen 
Stop stalling the credits are rolling 
Hold me now before we run out of time 
Lets rough it up till the end of the night 

Its o-o-o-obvious 
Right here is where the party starts with you and me 
All alone, no one has to know 
Its o-o-o-obvious to me 
How its gonna be 
O-o-o-obvious when you come close to me 

Its o-o-o-obvious 
One kiss 
Its easy to see you and me 

Its o-o-o-obvious 
Right here is where the party starts with you and me 
All alone, no one has to know 
Its o-o-o-obvious to me 
How its gonna be 
O-o-o-obvious when you come close to me 

Its o-o-o-obvious 
Right here is where the party starts with you and me 
All alone, no one has to know 
Its o-o-o-obvious to me 
How its gonna be 
O-o-o-obvious when you come close to me---Lyrics submitted by caliegh.
