Hit me out of nowhere like a car crash on the street,
Suddenly colliding into me,
Now I'm broken, bruised and beat up
Tangled in my sheets,
How can this feel so bad when you seemed so good for me?

Oh my god, what's wrong with my head?
Sweating with the chills, still in my bed,
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
It's the short hellos and the long goodbyes,
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die,
I've got the worst hangover from you

Swimming in the deep and trying to keep from turning blue,
Danger, danger, hoping not to drown
(Somebody get me out of here)
Sinking in the quicksand just to walk right up to you
You're so easy to pick up and so hard to put down

Oh my god, what's wrong with my head?
Sweating with the chills, still in my bed,
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
It's the short hellos and the long goodbyes,
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die,
I've got the worst hangover from you

All that I really wanted was a habit I could drop anytime that I wanted to,
And what I really got was you

( And no medicine, is gonna kill it)

Tell me how I'll ever make it through
It's the short hellos and the long goodbyes,
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me wanna die,
