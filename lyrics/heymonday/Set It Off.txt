In the dark it's getting hard to breathe
Suffocating, something's wrong
I feel so incomplete
They stop and stare
And try to drag us down
Light the fuse
Flip the switch
Baby, hold your ground

You and me
They wanna break us
Let's shake it up
Cause they will never take us

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
Cause they don't who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they got
You're all I want

All their fears
Watch 'em all come true
All their words
Wrote ever and tell us what to do

Hit and run
There's nothing left to lose
Break their hole, slip away
Forever me and you

You and me
They wanna break us
Let's shake it up
Cause they will never take us

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
Cause they don't who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they got
You're all I want

Let's blind their eyes
And wave goodbye
We start the fire

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
Cause they don't who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
I don't care what they say
Cause they don't who we are

Set off all the fires
Set off your alarms
They can give us all they got
You're all I want

You're all I want---Lyrics submitted by Holly.
