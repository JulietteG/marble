(Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-oh)
Take me home

You, ya hit me with a break
And now you're back for more
You're song's the same
Leave, me with all the blame
I don't have time for another game

I don't wanna dance
So don't you ask me, babe
I don't wanna dance
You blew your chance
To rock my night away
I want, some fun
But you're so not the one
I don't wanna dance
So let it go
You'll never take me home
Take me home
Take me home 

Talk to me without a sound
Cuz you were such a fool
You're sorry now
You, you're shakin' on the floor
Watch me walkin' out the door

I don't wanna dance
So don't you ask me, babe
I don't wanna dance
You blew your chance
To rock my night away
I want, some fun
But you're so not the one
I don't wanna dance
So let it go
You'll never take me home
Take me home
Take me home 

Don't tell the DJ to hit rewind tonight
There's no you and me
Don't play that record
Don't waste your time

You, you threw it all away

I don't wanna dance
So don't you ask me, babe
I don't wanna dance
You blew your chance
To rock my night away
I want, some fun
But you're so not the one
I don't wanna dance
So let it go
You'll never take me home
Take me home
Take me home 
Take me home
Take me home---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
