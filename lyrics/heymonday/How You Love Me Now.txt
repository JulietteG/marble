Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

You were talking to her, but messing with me
It's finally clear your blurring the lines
Are you disturbed?
Oh now you care
Why do you race threw my red light?

Can't understand?
I'll slow it down for you

Tell me how can u sleep
How can u breath?
Baby tell me how, how you love me now
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breath?
I hate when you say how you love me now

Save, save it for her
I'm not gonna hear, your reasons
And "please-just-take-me-backs"
We never were right
Don't waist you breath
Your crashing, your on your own tonight

can't understand?
I'll slow it down for you

Tell me how can you sleep
How can u breathe?
Baby tell me how, how you love me now
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe?
I hate when you say how you love me now

Lights out I found out my fallen star
Good-bye the sun rises here 
Teres no more you and I

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe?
Baby tell me how, how you love me now
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
Tell me how can you sleep
How can you breathe?
I hate when you say how you love me now

How you love me now
How you love me now---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
