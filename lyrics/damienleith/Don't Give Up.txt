I know what you want
I know what you need
I feel I'm fighting just to show you sometimes
With words you cannot hear
there's times you cannot see
I feel I'm lost without you

And I won't let you down
I won't let you down
If you won't give it up,
Let it go
Find another place where you can let it out
Let it in
Don't hold back another day is happening

No matter what they say
or how it's gonna be
These constant cravings lead to nothing
When everyone is wrong
Nothing makes much sense
All that's left are hopes and promises and
I won't let you down
I won't let you down 

And I won't let you down
I won't let you down
If you won't give it up,
Let it go
Find another place where you can let it out
Let it in
Don't hold back another day is happening

When all the lights go out
don't give up
When everything collides
don't give up
the sun gets in your eyes
don't give up
Don't let it fall.

And I won't let you down
I won't let you down
If you won't give it up,
Let it go
Find another place where you can let it out
Let it in
Don't hold back another day is happening---Lyrics submitted by Meg Leigh.
