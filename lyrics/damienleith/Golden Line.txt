I'm loving
I'm Living
I'm fighting
And I'm Believing
I'm walking
And I'm Falling
I've seen this place before
when I was dreaming.

[bridge]
Slowly does it, every time

Slowly does it, every time

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your faith
I don't want to your heart
I don't want to be the man who wanted everything
And I don't want to give this up
I don't want to forget
Happiness is not a state of mind
that I've been feeling.
yeah yeah oh

Giving, my sweat my blood my tears
Walking to a place I always feared
I'm closing the doors to yesterday
when I was losing my direction and my way

[bridge]
Slowly does it, every time

Slowly does it, every time

[Chorus]

I don't want to lose your faith
I don't want to your heart
I don't want to be the man who wanted everything
And I don't want to give this up
I don't want to forget
Happiness is not a state of mind
that I've been feeling.

All this world is golden line
All this world is golden line

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your faith
I don't want to your heart
I don't want to be the man who wanted everything
And I don't want to give this up
I don't want to forget
Happiness is not a state of mind
that I've been feeling.---Lyrics submitted by Meg Leigh.
