Hard to clench my fist well with all of the things I should tell
Tension and an ill will towards you and I
Its not the same as you feel, it used to be a light teal
But that shade was never real for you and I

Cant ignore, wont ignore
That I just dont know you anymore
Cant ignore, wont ignore
That which you played me for

You know how hard that I fell
Hazy, every detail about who cared the most
When it came to you and I
I never thought that youd bail
I guess I let it go stale
My blood is always hot when it comes to you and I

You want him like you wanted me
But I know that its not the same thing
Covet what you cannot bring
I wont calm down
Ill never let it be

Cant ignore, wont ignore
That I just dont know you anymore
Cant ignore, wont ignore
That which you played me for---
