I bet it hurts to read permanence.
I used to think on all of this and how you don't.
Damn it's hard to find sustenance when all I had was love for this and now you don't.
Now I just abuse substances to drown out your accomplishments, however few.

All of this frustrates me bad cause I can't stay mad at you or change anything that I had.
She told me don't think like that, it's really not that bad.
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad.

If it's something serious then hit me up but until then the door is shut, forget my room.
And if I had a match for every lie and every attempt to deny, I'd strike a few.
I am the walls, the silent halls. My jacket at your sisters wedding, navy blue.

All of this frustrates me bad cause I can't stay mad at you or change anything that I had.
She told me don't think like that, it's really not that bad.
I hope this makes you sad
I hope this makes you sad.---
