And welcome to my heart and soul
Miserable excuse
But tell the world of all the pain Ive caused
I hope you dont forget these songs

And though Im young lifes been short
Im only twenty-one
I feel as if we can relate on some
Of these words Ive written down

So turn off, turn off this song
Find someone to love
Turn off this song
You can listen to it later
And go outside

And guys in bands
With vintage shirts and hundred dollar pants
Often think we do what no one can
We see ourselves above the rest

When faced with truth
I realize there is nothing I can do
Amount of talent or gift to bring
That is greater than the orphan song she sings yeah

Turn off, turn off this song
Find someone to love
Turn off this song
You can listen to it later
And go outside

Yeah you turn off, turn off this song
Find someone to love
Turn off this song
You can listen to it later
And go outside
And go outside
And go outside
And go outside---Lyrics submitted by Hans TUznik.
