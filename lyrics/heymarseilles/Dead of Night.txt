I've been walking in the dead of night
Looking down, looking right
The morning's rays and I'll be all right
I've been sailing on a dozen seas
Searching for that elusive breeze
If my raft won't sink
I'll have some time to think

I am sailing in winter
We are slowing down
We are going down
Ocean waves are to die for
Endless blue and grey
Endless

Lines we trace
A thousand days
We'll count the waves
We can't begin
To stain our homes
Remain on our own
The lie everyone says
You should believe
The map you draw
Shows the life you lead
Sustain a chorus
The world will be yours

I will climb to a new ridge
Where the light is low
and the lake below
Calls my name to jump off it
Into blue and grey
Endless

I've been walking in the dead of night
Looking down, looking right
The morning's rays and I'll be all right
I've been sailing on a dozen seas
Searching for that elusive breeze
If my raft does sink
I'll have some time to think---Lyrics submitted by WyattCounterman.
