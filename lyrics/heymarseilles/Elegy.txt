We would like to resign 
Somewhere along a wide mountainside
Sleep the street and sound of marching feet away 
Or hide

Well give up on this town
the people who fill the air with their sound
Hear the noise of girls and boys abound
Rejoice

I love you for your wit, 
not for the shit 
you spout in your dreams. 
Brace the ground and love you finally found in me 
Or leave

The wind wont wait to blow you down. 
And leaves can change only so slow 
So keep your legs on the concrete ground. 
The truth to find is in what we dont know---Lyrics submitted by WyattCounterman.
