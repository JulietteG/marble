Cold war - and I'm cold too
I know karate and I know kung-fu
No time to fall in love
Another mission behind the wall
Checkpoint Charlie's there
Say hi to Commieland
Bring Kaos in the red square

I'm all right, all right, all right
Pills in my blood
I'm all right, all right, all right
I sold my soul

Cold war - and I'm cold too 
I know karate and I know kung-fu
No time to fall in love
Another mission behind the wall
Checkpoint Charlie's there
Say hi to Commieland
Bring Kaos in the red square

I'm all right, all right, all right
Pills in my blood
I'm all right, all right, all right
I sold my soul...---Lyrics submitted by Tony Bown.
