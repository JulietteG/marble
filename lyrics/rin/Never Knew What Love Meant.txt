I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew

Every time I look in your eyes
I see something I cant deny is new
They take me someplace words just cant describe
They bring me close to the truth
That Im telling you

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
Till there was you

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
Till there was you

Let me take you somewhere I know
Above the earth and beyond the air
Ive touched something Ive never felt before
Its something Ive got to share
And you take me there

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
Till there was you

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
Till there was you

Let me show you how I feel
Youre everything that I hold as dear
You give me something that I know is real
Whether youre far or near
But I want you here

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
Till there was you

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
Till there was you

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
(I never knew)
I never knew

I never knew what love meant
(I never never knew)
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
(I never knew)
Till there was you
Till there was you

I never knew what love meant
(Loving you)
I never knew what love meant
(Never never knew)
I never knew
Till there was you

I never knew what love meant
I never knew what love meant
I never knew
(I never knew)
Till there was you

I never knew
I never knew---Lyrics submitted by Katherine C.
