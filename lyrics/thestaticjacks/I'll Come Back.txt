I'LL COME BACK

You can speak
Speak for me
If you don't 
Ignore me
You can't hide
You know I
Think I'll come back for you 
Hey you know what, I 'll come back for you

You can push and I will pull
We'll get farther up this hill
Waiting for the a pleasant age
Happiness is all the age
You can work in hospitals
I'll come back when autumn's through
I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this!

You cannot understand that
Each day alone is standby
Them I find, looking way, I've gone blind
we'll take off for Nagano
Everything else has go to go

You can push and I will pull
We'll get farther up this hill
Waiting for the a pleasant age
Happiness is all the age
You can work in hospitals
I'll come back when autumn's through
I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this!

You can push and I will pull
We'll get farther up this hill
Waiting for the a pleasant age
Happiness is all the age
You can work in hospitals
I'll come back when autumn's through
I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this!---Lyrics submitted by Astro Li.
