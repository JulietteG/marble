You were all I had, and now you're gone
You've gone away from me
Honey, darling, sweetheart, time me down

Before I drift away
I never believed you could be wrong
I never believe anything at all
But one day, you and I will go to sleep
And not wake up
How is everyone so kind
if all they have is noting much at all?

You were all I knew , so now I dream
Of you from far away
Babe, honey, darling, sweetheart,
forget my name
My heart's dead, anyway
I've built wall up deep inside my mind
I'll keep the world out as long as I'm alive
But one day, you and I will go to sleep
And not wake up

Where can we go from here
And how am I supposed to give a fuck?---Lyrics submitted by Astro Li.
