Home Again
                                             Word by HK

 Home 
I know you come to me in dreams
And if you're going to be there
Don't let me leave before you go
So I wait and I wait for you
But you hands go soft and you heart's still blue
So won't you let me stay
And be here all the time with you

Home again 
I know you come to me in dreams
I want to spend the rest of my life
Looking sour but being with you
So I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait
But the bed's still cold and you heart's still fake


You want to let me down
It's best we're just pretend

So then I wait for you 
But you 're not there
Still I came for you
(But) you're not there. you're not (there) nothing

Oh my god, I can't believe it
All my friends are gone and they're leaving home
Oh my god, life's never-ending
All my friends are gone and they're leaving home
And  I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait---Lyrics submitted by Astro Li.
