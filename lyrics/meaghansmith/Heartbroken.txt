This Stupid Heart
This Foolish Thing 
Failed Me From The Start 
Keeps Malfunctioning 
Always Dropping Beats 
And Falling Fast 
Until it Bleeds Me Dry at Last. 

Tell Me You Kings Horses
And All You Kings Men
What's the Use of Fixing What Will Only Break Again. 

Heartbroken
Heartbroken

What's the Use In Fixing,
What Will Kill Me In The End?
Put Me Back Together 
Im Still Heartbroken.

Well I Fixed It Up 
With Safety Pins 
But You Stole The Key
And Broke Right In
You Cut My Strings
And You Hung Me High
When I Crossed This Heart
And Hoped To Die
Tell Me If You Love Me
Tell Me If You Can

Whats The Use In Fixing, 
What Will Only Break Again?

Heartbroken
Heartbroken

Oh- Whats The Use Of Fixing, 
What Will Kill Me In The End?
Put Me Back Together, 
Im Still Heartbroken.

Heartbroken
What A Bitter End
I Was On The Mend

But I Here I Am Again.

Heartbroken
Heartbroken

Whats The Use In Fixing, 
What Will Kill Me In The End?
Put Me Back Together 
Im Still Heart Broke-

Heartbroken!
((Heart Broken, Heart Broken))
Heartbroken!


Oh- Whats The Use Of Fixing, 
What Will Kill Me In The End?
Put Me Back Together,
Im Still Heartbroken.---Lyrics submitted by Namon.
