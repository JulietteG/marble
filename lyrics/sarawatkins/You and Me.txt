I remember the night
I remember the sound
I remember the light
When the moon came 'round
The night flowers bloomed
The air so sweet
I remember you
I remember me

Central Valley sunshine
Run out of town
Make your head all funny
So you stick around
Dusty roads
Make dirty feet
I remember you
I remember me

I remember the night
I remember the sound
I remember the light
When the moon came 'round
The night flowers bloomed
The air so sweet
I remember you
I remember me

Wish I knew you now
Like I knew you then
For hours I just sit at your feet
And listen
When I want
To feel free
I remember you
I remember me

I remember the night
I remember the sound
I remember the light
When the moon came 'round
The night flowers bloomed
The air so sweet
I remember you
I remember me

Found myself at your place
When I was out walking
I could hear your piano
And I swear I could hear you sing
And the joy we shared as we tarry there
I remember you
I remember me

I remember the night
I remember the sound
I remember the light
When the moon came 'round
The night flowers bloomed
The air so sweet
I remember you
I remember me
I remember you
I remember me
I remember you---
