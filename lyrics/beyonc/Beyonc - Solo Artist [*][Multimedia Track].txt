beyonce-rock

ohhh,ohhhhhh,ohhhhh,ohhhhhhhh

vesr 1
if i wrote a book about where we stand
then the title of my book would be life
with superman.that's how you make me feel
icount you as a priviledge.your love is so ideal
im honored to be in it i know you feel the same
i see it every day in all the things you,in all the things you say

chorus
you are my rock.baby im the truth
you are my rock i love to rock with
you,you are my rock,youre everything i need
you are my rock,so baby rock with me
i want to kiss ya,please ya,feel ya just fine
iwant to touch ya,love ya ,baby all night
reward you for all the things you do.you are my rock
i love to rock with you,i love to rock with you
ohhhh,ohhhhh,ohhhh

verse 2
if were to try and count the ways you make me smile
i'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless things to
talk about.sugar you keeps it goin on make me wanna keep my
lovin strong.make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
and what you need givin you my whole heart n ot just a little piece
more than a minimum.im talking everything.more than a single wish.
im talking every dream

sing the chorus over again

verse 3(last verse people)
if theres options i dont want them there not worth my
time,cause if its nots you oh no and thank you i like us just fine
youre a rock in the sand,youre a smile in a crowd,youre my joy through my
pain youre the truth and the lies no matter what i do i know that i can count
on you.

then you sing the chorus part again---Lyrics submitted by monet.
