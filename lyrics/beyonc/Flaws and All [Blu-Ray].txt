Verse 1:
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever-complex in every waaay
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

Chorus:
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I looove you
And that's why I looooooove (hmm)

Verse 2:
I neglect you when I'm working (ha ha ha uhn)
When I need a attention
I tend to nag (oh oh ha uhn)
I'm a host of imperfection (ha ha ha uhn)
And you see past all that (hm hm uhn uhhhh uhn)
I'm a peasant by some standards (ha ha ha ha uhn)
But in your eyes I'm a queen (oh oh ha uhn)

You see potential in all my flaws (ha ha ha uh uh)
And that's exactly what I need

Chorus:
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I looove you
And that's why I loooooove you
And that's why I looooooooooove you (ah)

[BEAT SWIRLS DOWN - like techno]

Ha ha haa ha ha uhn! ha ha haa ha ha uhn
Ha ha haa ha ha uhn! ha ha haa ha ha uhn

Don't know why you loooove me (ha ha haa ha ha uhn!)
(ha ha haa ha ha uhn) And that's why I looove you
(ha ha haa ha ha uhn ha uhn! ha ha ha ha uhn) You catch me when I fall
(ha ha haa ha ha uhn!) Accept me flaws and all (ha ha haa ha ha uhn)
And that's why I looove you (ha ha haa ha ha uhn, ha ha haa ha ha uhn)
And that's why I looove you (ha ha haa ha ha uhn! ha ha haa ha ha uhn)
And that's why I looove you (ha ha haa ha ha uhn! ha ha haa ha ha uhn) You
You, you, oh, you, you (ha ha haa ha ha uhn) You, you, you (ha haa ha ha uhn)
You, no, you (haa ha ha uhn) You, you (haa ha ha uhn) You, you.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
