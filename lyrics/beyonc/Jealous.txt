[Verse 1:]
I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Hook:]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

[Post-Hook:]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this

[Verse 2:]
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
'Yonce fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out at tonight
I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]

[Bridge:]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

[Hook]---
