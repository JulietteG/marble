If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something I don't give a damn, cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know one plus one equals two
And it's me and you, that's all we'll have when the world is through

'Cause baby we ain't got nothing without love
Darling you got enough for the both of us
So come on baby, make love to me

When my days look low, pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me, so when the worlds at war, that our love heal us all
Right now baby make love to me me me me me
Oh oh make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns but I, I've been shot by you
Hey, and I don't know when I'm gon die, but I hope that I'm gon die by you
Hey, and I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you
Hey, just when I ball up my fist I realize I'm laying right next to you

Baby we ain't nothing but love
And darling you got enough for the both of us
Make love to me when my days look low,
Pull me in close and don't let me go

Make love to me so that when the worlds at war,
That our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard, make love to me me me me me
Oh oh make love to me me me me me---
