Ms. Third Ward, your first question 
What is your aspiration in life? 
Oh, my aspiration in life 
Would be to be happy 

(Uh huh huh) 
(Uh huh huh) 
(Uh huh huh) 

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl. 
What's in your head, it doesn't matter 
Brush your hair, fix your teeth 
What you wear is all that matters." 

Just another stage, pageant the pain away 
This time I'm gonna take the crown 
Without falling down, down, down 

Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Tryna fix something but you can't fix what you can't see 
It's the soul that needs the surgery 

(Uh huh huh) 

Blonder hair, flat chest 
TV says, "Bigger is better." 
South beach, sugar free 
Vogue says, "Thinner is better." 

Just another stage, pageant the pain away 
This time I'm gonna take the crown 
Without falling down, down, down 

Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts) 
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), shine the light on whatever's worse 
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see 
It's the soul that needs the surgery 

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away 
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body 
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery 
It's my soul that needs surgery 

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far 
And you break when the paper sign leaves you in the dark 
You left a shattered mirror and the shards of a beautiful girl 

Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse (pretty hurts) 
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see 
It's the soul that needs the surgery 

When you're alone all by yourself 
Pretty hurts Pretty hurts 
And you're lying in your bed 
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts) 

Reflection stares right into you 
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts) 

Are you happy with yourself? 
(Pretty hurts Pretty hurts) 

It's just a way to masquerade 
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts) 

The illusion has been shed 
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts) 

Are you happy with yourself? 
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts) 

Are you happy with yourself? 
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts) 
Uh huh huh 
Yes ---
