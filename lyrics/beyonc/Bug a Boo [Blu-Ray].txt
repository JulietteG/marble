(Chorus)
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone calls
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You buggin what? You buggin who? You buggin me!
And don't you see it ain't cool

It's not hot that you be callin' me
Stressin' me, pagin' my beeper
You're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages
Every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game, you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

(Bridge)
So what, you bought a pair of shoes
What now? I guess you think I owe you
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what, my momma likes you
What now? I guess you think I will too
Even if the Pope said he likes you too
I don't really care 'cause you're a bug a boo

(Chorus w/ad-libs)

It's not hot that when in blockin' your phone number
You call me from over your best friends house
And it's not hot that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you trackin' me down
You need to chill out with that mess
'Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed
'Cause everytime my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm prayin' that it is someone else

(Bridge)
So what, you bought a pair of shoes
What now? i guess you think i owe you
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give em' back to be through wit' you
And so what my momma likes you
What now? i guess you think i will too
Even if the pope says he like you too
I don't give a damn coz' your a bug a boo

(Chorus)

When you call me on the phone you're buggin' me
When you follow me around you're buggin' me
Everything you do be buggin' me
You buggin' me, you buggin' me
When you show up at my door you buggin' me
When you open up your mouth you buggin' me
Everytime I see your face you're buggin' me
You're buggin' me, you're buggin' me
