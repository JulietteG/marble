Satellites
Flashing by
Its a beautiful state were in
But how can we love in isolation
Think how happy we can be
When we just try

When nothing like we seem
Passion in words are never spoken
You dont know how i bleed
When i leave your side

In your eyes
Loves alive
Youve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we dont change
Were always on display
Lets run and hide

In our eyes
Loves alive
Weve come untied
Cause were flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Satellites
If we dont communicate
Well exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While were apart i cannot breathe

Satellites
Flashing by
