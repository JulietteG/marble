Ay! Ay!
(Nobody likes being played)
Ay!

Oh, Beyonc, Beyonc
Oh, Shakira, Shakira
(Hey!)

He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about him that you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, he's a one and only beautiful liar
(Yes!)
Tell me how you tolerate the things I just found out about

We'll never know, why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

Ay! Let's not kill the karma
Ay! Let's not start a fight
Ay! It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Oh! Can't we laugh about it?
(Ha ha ha)
Oh! It's not worth our time
Oh! We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

I trusted him but when I followed you I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him when, yeah
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong?

We'll never know when the pain and heartbreak?s over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone!

Ay! Let's not kill the karma
Ay! Let's not start a fight
Ay! It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Oh! Can't we laugh about it?
(Ha ha ha)
Oh! It's not worth our time
Oh! We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

Tell me how to forgive you when it's me who's ashamed
And I wish I could free you of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple, he's the one to blame!
Hey!

Ay! Beyonc, Beyonc
Ay! Shakira, Shakira
Oh! Beyonc, Beyonc
Oh! Shakira, Shakira
(Hey!)

Ay! Let's not kill the karma
Ay! Let's not start a fight
Ay! It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Oh! Can't we laugh about it?
(Ha ha ha)
Oh! It's not worth our time
Oh! We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar---Lyrics submitted by Crystal.
