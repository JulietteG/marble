[Jay-Z Rap]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass high hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B ([Beyonce:] (Boy your hurtin' now)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with the curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

[Verse 1]
Baby seems like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes, your smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh!

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Verse 2]
Seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walking past me, I almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja vu

[Jay-Z]
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro 'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tippin like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh

[Bridge]
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Deja Vu

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
