You  be saying no no no no... when it's really yes yes yes yes yes 

Boy i know you want me i can see it in your eyes but you keep on frontin'
won't you say what on your mind cause each and every time when you give me signs
but when i ask you what's the deal you hold it all inside if you wanna be with me gotta 
keep it real tell me what's going on tell me how you feel boy i know you want me just as 
much as i want you so come get my love it's all for you 

Chours( Repeat4x

If you keep acting this way gonna lose my love i ain't got no time to play better hurry up
cause every time i come around and cruise around your way see you on the corner but
you don't know what to say when i walk up to you baby you seem so shy what's the problem 
baby never had a girl like i..hee i can see right through when you know you wanna be mine
so get your act togehter cause your running out time...

Chours( Repeat4x

Everytime i see you with your boys you pretend if is you don't want.. me when you get home 
you call me on the phone and tell me how much you care..
