Say my name, say my name 
If no one is around you, say "baby I love you" 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin me baby 
Why the sudden change? 
Say my name, say my name 
If no one is around you, say "baby I love you" 
If you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin me baby 
Better say my name 

Any other day I would call, you would say 
"Baby how's your day?" 
But today it ain't the same 
Every other word is uh huh, yea okay 
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? 
If you took it there, first of all, let me say 
I am not the one to sit around and be played 
So prove yourself to me 
i'm the girl that you claim 
Why don't you say the thangs 
That you said to me yesterday? 

(Chorus B) 
I know you say that I am assuming things 
Something's going down that's the way it seems 
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange 
If nobody's holding you back from me 
Cause I know how you usually do 
When you say everything to me times two 
Why can't you just tell the truth? 
If somebody's there then tell me who 

(Chorus A) 

What's up with this? 
Tell the truth, who you with 
How would you like it if I came over with my clique 
Don't try to change it now 
Sayin' you gotta bounce 
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house 
It's hard to believe that you 
are at home, by yourself 
When I just heard the voice 
Heard the voice of someone else 
Just this question 
Why do you feel you gotta lie? 
Gettin' caught up in your game 
When you can not say my name 

(Chorus B) 
(Chorus A) 

(Where my ladies at) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yea-yeah 
(Can you say that? C'mon) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
(All the girls say) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
(I can't hear ya) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
(All the ladies say) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah..yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
(All the girls say) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 

(Break it down) Ohh ooohh oh ooh ohhhh 
(D.C., take it to the bridge c'mon)
