Remember those walls I built
Well baby they tumbling down
And they didnt even put up a fight
They didnt even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

Bridge:
Its like Ive been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
Its the risk that Im taking
I aint never gonna shut you out
Everywhere Im looking now
Im surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know youre my saving grace
Youre everything I need and more
Its written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it wont fade away

Chorus:
I cant feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
Youre the only one that I want
Think Im addicted to your light
I swore Id never fall again
But this dont even feel like falling
Gravity cant forget
So pull me to the ground again

Bridge:
Feels like Ive been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that Im taking
Im never gonna shut you out
Everywhere Im looking now
Im surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know youre my saving grace
Youre everything I need and more
Its written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it wont fade away

Chorus:
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Halooooo ouuuu
Halooooo ouuuu
Ouuuuu ouuuuu ouuuuu

Bridge:
Everywhere Im looking now
Im surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know youre my saving grace
Youre everything I need and more
Its written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it wont fade away

Chorus:
I can feel your halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
