listen to sound here in my heart a melody i start but can't complet 
listen( mmm) to the sound from deep within it's only begining to find release oooh the time has come for my dream's to be heard they will not be pushed aside aside and turned into your own all coz you won't listen, 

chours 
listen i am alone at a cross road i'm not alone at my own home and i tried and tried to say what's on my mind you should have known ooooooh know i'm do beleving you, you dont know what i'm feeling i'm more than what you made i followed the voice you gave to me and know i've gotta find my own 

you should have listen oooh there is some one her in side, someone i thought had died so long ago 

chours
ooooh i 'm screaming out for my dream's to be heard they will not be pused aside or turend into your own al coz you won't listen, LISTEN i am alone at a cross road i'm not alne in my own home and i tried and tried to say what's on my mined you should have known oooh know i'm done beleving you, you don't know what i'm feeling i'm more than what you made of me i followed the voice you gave to me and know i've gotta fined my own 

i don't know were i belong but i'll be moveing on if you don't if you won't 


ooooohhh 
listen to a song her in my heart and i have complet oooh know i don't belive in you you don't know what i'm felling i'm more than what you made of me i followed the vocie you think you gave to me but know i've gotta find my own
