Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight I'll bloom and grow so beautifly
Baby I'm so proud, so proud to be your girl
You make this confusion go on away from this cold and mixed-up world

-Hook-
(I'm) I'm in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me cause I'm
Dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin me
(Repeat)

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
Cause years before I became who I am, baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy lovin me
But I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
Cause I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

-Hook-
(I'm) I'm in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me cause I'm
Dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin me
(Repeat)

-Bridge-
Everytime I see your face
My heart responds
Everytime it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breath, 
To leave you Dangerously in love... 

Hook
(I'm) I'm in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me cause I'm
Dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin me
