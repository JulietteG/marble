{Female Solo}
Out across the Golden Sea, 
love, my love, he waits for me. 
From this life hes been set free, 
yet I know he waits for me, for me.

When my time has come to die, 
please dont grieve, for me dont cry. 
Be with him on Distant Shore, 
Ill be in his arms once more, once more.

Be with him on Distant Shore, 
in his arms once more, once more. 
That is where I long to be, 
with my love for all eternity.

{Chorus}
Sail away, across the sea, 
to my love who waits for me. 
When I land on Distant Shore, 
together again once more, once more.

{Bridge-instrumental only}

{Male Solo}
Looking out on Golden Sea, 
for my love, I wait for thee. 
When at last you are set free, 
then sail my love, to me, to me.

When its time for you to die,
dont be fearful, dont you cry.
Here I wait on Distant Shore,
Ill hold you forever more, once more.

{Chorus}
Sail away, across the sea, 
come my love, I wait for thee. 
When you land on Distant Shore, 
together again forever more.
