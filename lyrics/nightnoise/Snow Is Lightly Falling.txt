Snow is lightly falling
In the forest after dark
Wishing it would cover up
The deep well of my heart
As I wait alone for you

Above the dewy mountain
Where the air is clean and pure
The snow is lightly falling
And my heart cannot endure:
The quiet lonesome calling
Of the Season's hungry birds
As I wait alone for you my love,
In silence without words.

I keep forever looking back
On Seasons that have passed
In the very depths of winter
Love had come to me at last
I have not forgotten yet
That hushed October wind
That sang of love forever
Through the spirit and the mind.

I have not forgotten yet
That little Christmas yet,
When hushed October winds
They sang of heaven on this earth.

And way beyond the snowtrees,
Rising softly like a fire,
Sparks the pining for a loved on
And the kindling of desire.

The wind sings of love forever,
Through the spirit and the mind,
And I keep you in my heart,
With the truest and the kind.---Lyrics submitted by Erin Cahill.
