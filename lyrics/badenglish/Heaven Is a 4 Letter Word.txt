Take me down the highway
In the heat of the summer night
Give me the wheel
I got it real bad for you
Pull over and turn out the light

We don't need a fancy motel
Or a beach house at Malibu
If we're talking about paradise
Don't say a prayer
I'll take you there

Hey girl haven't you heard
Heaven is a 4 letter word
One touch is never too much
Baby I can tell you for sure
Heaven is a 4 letter word

It's not about a fantasy
It's how you make it good to be bad
Just when you think it's strictly tabu
You're gettin' what you never had

You don't see it out in Hollywood
Or in Penthouse magazine
It's just looking at you tonight
I wanna do what you want me to 

Hey girl haven't you heard
Heaven is a 4 letter word
One touch is never too much
Baby I can tell you for sure
Heaven is a 4 letter word

Like, love and kiss
It feels like this
Don't wait too long
Heaven is where we belong

Hey girl haven't you heard
Heaven is a 4 letter word
One touch is never too much
Baby I can tell you for sure
Heaven is a 4 letter word---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
