Sometimes I feel
Like I wanna leave this place for good
Under the ground
Ill live down there without a sound
And never hear
These hissing voices all the same
Ill disappear
Cause living makes me feel ashamed

I must believe 
There's more above us and below
I must believe
Stranded with this bitch called hope
It keeps me here
When all I wanna do is go
It keeps me here
When all wanna do is disappear

If this is it
All we have and ever will
If this is it
Time is running out and standing still
Ill leave today
Cause theres nothing left to keep me here
Ill fade away
Ill turn my back and disappear

The city moans 
Lunges up right from the ground
The seething earth
It opens up and spits us out
This vicious child
Nature never wanted us
This vicious child
A cancer burning black into its heart

If this is it
All we have and ever will
If this is it
Time is running out and standing still
Ill leave today
Cause theres nothing left to keep me here
Ill fade away
Ill turn my back and disappear

Sometimes I feel
Like I want to leave this place for good
Under the ground
Ill live down there without a sound
And never hear
These hissing voices all the same
Ill disappear
Cause living makes me feel ashamed

If this is it
All we have and ever will
If this is it
Time is running out and standing still
Ill leave today
Cause theres nothing left to keep me here
Ill fade away
Ill turn my back and disappear
Ill turn my back and disappear---Lyrics submitted by Agustin.
