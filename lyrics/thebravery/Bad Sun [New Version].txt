[Verse 1]
We are lies like the summertime,
Like the spring we are such fools,
Like fall we are false prophets,
Like winter we are cruel.

I don't know what's wrong with us,
They just made us this way,
There's a hole in you and me,
That pulls us together.

[Chorus]
And I don't know where we belong,
I think we grew under a bad sun,
I know we're not like everyone,
You and me we grew, under a bad sun.

[Verse 2]
Every day you bring me pain,
And we savor it like rain,
We hold it on our tongues,
Just like wine.

Someday back when we were young,
I guess something just went wrong,
The two of us are hung,
From the same twisted rope.

[Chorus]
And I don't know where we belong,
I think we grew under a bad sun,
I know we're not like everyone,
You and me we grew under a bad sun [2x]

You and me we grew under a bad sun.---Lyrics submitted by Stellar.
