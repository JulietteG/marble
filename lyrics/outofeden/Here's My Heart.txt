Dear Lord!
Are you there?
Listening to my little prayer
I dont know, exactly what to say.
I've been told that you love me
Hear me when I call, would help me if I fall
I should let you have your way
What I guess I'm trying to say
Is I need you in my life.
Cause I know I'm tired of living in the past
I would like to take a chance
On a change down deep inside
I believe that this is one that's gonna last
So here is.

Here's my heart
It's been broken, it's been wounded
But I'll give it all to you 
If you will love me, love me
Here's my mind If you want it, you can have it
I will give it all to you
Because you love me
Your love is everything I need

Come child
I'm right here
Through your worries, through your tears
I've been waiting
For you to call my name
All you know, that I hear you
If you turn to me and trust my word 
It's true, you will never be the same
Well I'm standing here to say
That you need me in your life
Cause i know that you cant make it
On your own, on your own
If you will take a chance
Let me change you deep inside
I promise you will never be alone
So here

You can talk to me and know that am
I'm always standing by
I gave it all for you so you could have
This gentle peace inside
I will follow you cause I believe
In everything you are
I am you Father, you are my saviour
And in the matters of the heart
I am taking yours and you are taking mine

Here's my heart
It's been broken, it's been wounded
But I'll give it all to you
If you will love me, love me
Here's my mind
If you want it, you can have it
I will give it all to you
Because you love me
Your love is everthing I need---Lyrics submitted by Wobil.
