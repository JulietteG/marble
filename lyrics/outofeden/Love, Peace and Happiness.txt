Don't want to think about just where I would be
Had You not had the heart to come rescue me
Gave me a new start on this life, had mercy
With You I fell in love, no I can see that I'm free

Your love is deep as the ocean
Wide as the sea
Your love has my devotion
You get every part of me
There's so much that I can say but words don't really show
So I let my life speak so the world will know

You've given me love, peace and happiness
You've given me life and I know I'm blessed
You've given me all that I need and yes 
Lord with everything You've done for me
Most thankful cause You've given me you

It's so amazing You were able to find
Something worth saving and with Your love divine
You reached into this life and You gave me a chance
Set my feet on a rock and now I can dance

Your love is deep as the ocean
Wide as the sea
Your love has my devotion
You get every part of me
There's so much I can say but words don't really show
So I let my life speak so the world will know

You've given me love, peace and happiness
You've given me life and I know I'm blessed
You've given me all that I need and yes, Lord, with everything You've done for me
Most thankful cause you've given me You

There's so much that I can say like
So great and so powerful yes you are Lord
There's so much that I can say like
Amazing incredible yes you are, Lord
There's so much that I can say but words 
Don't really show
So I let my life speak so the world will know

You've given me love, peace and happiness
You've given me life and I know I'm blessed
You've given me all that I need and yes, Lord, with everything you've done for me
Most thankful cause You've given me You (3x)---Lyrics submitted by Donna.
