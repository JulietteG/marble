(Could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use...)

Short days, long nights tangled up with you
I don't wanna move
Your eyes don't lie
And if I needed proof, that body tell the truth

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Your body is a blessing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't know if I deserve it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round two, I've got a question for you babe

If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?

If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?

(Could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use a little love)
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use...)

On the tip of my tongue
The flavor of your skin lingers on my lips
Each time we dine
We do it again, again and again, ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Your body is a blessing, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
What'd I do to deserve it?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round three, I've got a question for you baby

If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? (So good)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
Tell me what it is

If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh, babe
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Then what is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why does it feel so good?

(Could use a little love) Aw, yeah
(Why can't you get enough?)
(Could use, could use--)

You know soon that you walk in, it goin' up, goin' up
Slow it down for me, girl, we ain't gotta rush it, we ain't gotta rush it
Always a movie, we ain't sayin' much
Baby, I'm just your type; I know what bad girls like
But I'll confess tonight
Your body is a blessing, oh yeah
What'd I do to deserve it?
(Short days, long nights)
Short days and long nights, yeah

If it ain't love
(Why) Why does it feel so good?
(Does it feel) Why does it feel so good?
(So good?) Tell me what it is
If it ain't love
(Why) Why does it feel so good?
(Does it feel) Why does it feel so good?
So good? Yeah, yeah

If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Why) What is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Does it feel) What is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (So good?)
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Why) Then what is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Does it feel) What is it?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (So good?)
Why does it feel so good?---
