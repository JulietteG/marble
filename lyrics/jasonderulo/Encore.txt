Would ya mind girl if I told you
Last night really blew my mind
Would ya mind girl no disrespect
But can we do it one more time
Should I hit you up, should I just give up
Tell me should I just walk away
Would ya let me in, should I just give in
I need to get you back on the stage

You're so amazing remember the time
Just thinking about ya gives me butterflies
So open the curtains and let me inside for more
You can save the bell cuz I want you now
Baby hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, so hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, so hit me with an encore

An encore (ohh)
An encore (ohh)

Would ya like girl for me to touch you I can come and press rewind
Take it right back up on your back chase your body every night
Should I lay you down should we do this now
Tell me or just give me a sign
Are you in or out cuz there aint no doubt
Make this night the night of your life

You're so amazing remember the time
