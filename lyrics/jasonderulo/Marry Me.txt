105 is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
Thats precisely what I plan to do

And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there aint no need to rush
But one day, I wont be able to ask you loud enough

Ill say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
Ill say will you marry me

How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?
Baby I dont ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
Youre the love of my life

You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love, so there aint no need to rush
But one day, I wont be able to ask you loud enough

Ill say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
Ill say will you marry me

And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
Cause I have you, girl I have you
So get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be
Better, better
The day when I say

Ill say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
Ill say will you marry me

Ill say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
Ill say will you marry me

Ooh whoa ooh oh
Ooh whoa ooh oh
Ooh whoa ooh oh

105 is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
Thats precisely what I plan to do---Lyrics submitted by Victoria Healey.
