Yeeeeeyeeeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine, I'm loving cloud nine, my head's in the sky,
I'm solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm ridin solo, sooloooo.

Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight, finally doing me and it feels so alright, oh,
Time to do the things I like, going to the club everything's alright, oh,

Noo to answer to, Noo is? like u, no,
And since I got the hold of me, I'm living life now that I'm free, yeah,

Telling me to get my shit together now I got my shit together, yeah,
Now I made it through the weather better days Can't get no better
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out I'm moving on,
I'm so sorry but it's over now, the pain is goooone,

I'm putting on my Shade to cover up my eyes,
I'm Top UP/ON in my ride, I'm heading out tonight,
I'm solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, sooloooo.
I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine, I'm loving cloud nine, my head's in the sky.
I'm solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, sooloooo.

Now I'm feeling how I should, never knew single could feel this good, oh,
Stop playing miss understood, back in the game, who knew I would, oh,
So flex how I spread my wings, loving myself makes me wanna sing, oh,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Telling me to get my shit together now I got my shit together, yeah,
Now I made it through the weather better days are Can't get no better
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out, I'm moving on,
I'm so sorry but it's over now the pain is goooone,

I'm putting On my Shade to cover up my eyes,
I'm top UP/ON in my ride, I'm heading out tonight,
I'm solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, sooloooo.

I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine, I'm loving cloud nine, my head's in the sky.
I'm solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, sooloooo.
