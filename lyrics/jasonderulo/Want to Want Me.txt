It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
Cause I gotta leave
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high

Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no nothing I wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you

You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby I'm yours"
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high

Just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high
Just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high---
