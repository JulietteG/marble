Yeah

[Hook]
We could call it Kama Sutra
You trying tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future
I'm just trynna pour up
Come out of those jeans
And make me a believvvvver (woop woop)
Put it on me

Kama Kama Sutra
Kama Kama Sutraaa babe (yeah)

Trying tie me up
Tie me up (trynna tie me up)

[Jason Derulo]
In the bathroom
Taking pictures
Paparazzi she a A list though
And her girlfriend, that came with her
And my bet is yes, she came with her
Call 911 on me if I don't put a ring on this girl
Call 911 cause when she do me like this

[Hook]
We could call it Kama Sutra
You trying tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future

[Jason Derulo]
Fur handcuffs
Got the zip up
That's that freaky shit that I'm in to
Black tripod, pink blind ?
I ain't even know she was so ?
Call 911 on me if I don't put a ring on this girl
Call 911 cause when she do me like this

[Hook]
We could call it Kama Sutra
You trying tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future

[Kid Ink]
I said call it kama sutra
You look so beauti-ful
Hitting on the hookah
I could tell you a freak though
Shots ain't nothing but a free throw
Ducking round here like you the hot shit
Trying tie me up, I'm a hot stitch
But I never call 911
Hands everywhere like I got 6 on
Like she fly, but I'm feeling on your ?
Uh, shawty think about the future
Found me when ever you around me

We could call it Kama Sutra
You trying tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future
I'm just trynna pour up (yeah)
Come out of those jeans
And make me a believvvvver (woop woop)
Put it on me
I ain't never gone leave ya
Kama Kama Sutra ((kama kama sutra)
Kama Kama Sutraaa babe
Kama Kama Sutra (kama kama sutra)
Trying tie me up
Tie me up

Shawty I don't mind
You can go ahead and tie
Tie me up, tie me up---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
