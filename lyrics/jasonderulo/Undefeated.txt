Undefeated

Wish I knew then what I know now
But I, I, can't change the past
No matter how, I try I
So I'mma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance
Like there's nobody around, even gravity can't keep me down

Everybody, get it started
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling
I'm undefeated, undefeated, yeah
No one told me what I can't be
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling
I'm undefeated, undefeated, tonight
Undefeated

No looking back, can't live that way, right now, oww
Yesterday's gone, I've found my way, somehow, oww
So, so, so I'mma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance
Like there's nobody around, even gravity can't keep me down

Everybody, get it started
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling
I'm undefeated, undefeated, yeah
No one told me what I can't be
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling
I'm undefeated, undefeated, tonight

So I'll live today like it's my last one
There's no time for fear, you only live once

Everybody, get it started
I'm on top of the world, what a feeling
I'm undefeated, undefeated, yeah
No one told me what I can't be
Now I'm walking on air, what a feeling
I'm undefeated, undefeated, tonight

What a feeling, to be a undefeated
Undefeated, tonight

Undefeated---
