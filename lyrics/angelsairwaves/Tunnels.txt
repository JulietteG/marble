I am still without devotion
Cause we're all asleep at the wheel
Asleep and so surrounded by what we feel
A bad dream

On a rope and pulled through the ocean
With my heart, I'm lost out at sea
And every kind of thought screams misery
So lonely

I'm a Johnny-come-lately
But I will not give up
And the words they escape me
But I'm full of dumb luck
And the world is an oyster with a poisonous shell
And the look in my eye is a look that can kill

I am not without emotion
I have ran from the pain of my world
From the mess that I hunt
The catch and the thrill
And I know

I am not (dream of it) in the circles of envy
I'd thank God, but then what is He for?
Cause I left a few white calls at his front door
I'll leave more (dream of it)

I'm a Johnny-come-lately
But I will not give up (dream of it)
Find the words, they escape me
But I'm full of dumb luck (dream of it)
And the world is an oyster with a poisonous shell
And the look in my eye is a look that can kill

Don't you go, come a little bit closer now
If you like, when you die
March your soul to a little fire now
If you like, when you die
Speak to me, cry a river and make believe
If you like, when you die
Clap your hands, do whatever your heart commands
You will find, when you die, you are mine

Dream of it
Dream of it

Don't you go, come a little bit closer now
If you like, when you die
March your soul to a little fire now
If you like, when you die
Speak to me, cry a river and make believe
If you like, when you die
Clap your hands, do whatever your heart commands
You will find, when you die, you are mine---
