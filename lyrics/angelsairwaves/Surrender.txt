There is a crowd in here
That fooled themselves
They brought their friends and they made their hell
They fake their grin in a lonely cell
To the bitter end, but what do I know?

There are a few in here that hurt themselves
They kick and bend in a dried up well
They call for help and you know them well
Are you aware of what do I know?

I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn
To the middle east
And all around
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet
Or all around
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

There is a place to hide,
It's in our minds, it's in the dark

It's well known that we have a fragile heart that's deep inside
It has a sound that you can follow
You feel like you hit a wall, but you survived
And it was hard for you to swallow
I've been to that place before
In spite of luck, and you awake a new tomorrow

I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn
To the middle east
And all around
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet
Or all around
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn
To the middle east
And all around
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet
Or all around
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now
I feel it now
This time I feel it now
I feel it now
This time I feel it now

This time I feel it now---Lyrics submitted by Jak Ganas.
