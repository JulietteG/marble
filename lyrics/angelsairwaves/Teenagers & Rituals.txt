Lightning cross the way 
No, I can't rest, been up for weeks 
The words they come in close 
They got a nerve, it never sleeps for me 

I say I rake in ruins of gold 
And I crawl down to my knees 
A mile deep in the coward and crime 
I left my head, came off with the sign 

Ba ba ba da da, ba ba ba da da 
Ba ba ba da da, ba ba ba da da 
Burning close, jump into the fire 
And light this shit up like the Fourth of July 

Lonely cat-like master 
Jump in, take me faster 
I've been sidetracked doubt me 
Under the score, joining the war without me 

I can't recite the names 
Or events that come to me 
A blur of times and dates 
That a drink or two or three will mean 

I walk these streets of gold 
And the smoke goes on my feet 
Cross defy the land and mines 
I awake the gad and skin to breathe 

Ba ba ba da da, ba ba ba da da 
Ba ba ba da da, ba ba ba da da 
Burning close, jump into the fire 
And light this shit up like the Fourth of July 

Lonely cat-like master 
Jump in, take me faster 
I've been sidetracked doubt me 
Under the score, joining the war without me 

Lightning cross the way 
No, I can't rest, been up for weeks 
The words they come in close 
They've got a nerve, it never sleeps for me 

Lonely cat-like master 
Jump in, take me faster 
I've been sidetracked doubt me 
Under the score, joining the war without me---
