Know that I can't tell you this light has slowly faded.
Like mail that's never dated from towns still burned and raided.
And lost without a soul, with you forever more.
I'm sorry but I can't tell you I feel like a pattern
Of shapes that will never matter, a color that will never flatter.
It's all gonna' come around. It's all gonna' make your eyes burn.
I really wanna' tell you that love is like a furnace,
It burns in and out of purpose, so hot that it makes me nervous.
So large that it won't cool out. So big that it can't burn out.

I wait sixteen, a Saturday, love.
My heart beats fast and faraway, love.
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up.
You stay with me, we'll never grow up, my love.

I know that I can't tell you my mind is running circles.
My eyes have begun to swirl, like death, but it's not as sterile.
I ain't gonna' let you down. I ain't gonna' let you leave me.
I'm sorry but I can't tell you about life, but it makes me crazy,
So I just like to daydream, 'cause dreams only make me happy.
Will you come along my love? Will you come along here with me?

I wait, sixteen, a Saturday, love.
My heart beats fast and faraway, love.
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up.
You stay with me, we'll never grow up.

I wait, sixteen, a Saturday, love.
My heart beats fast and faraway, love.
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up.
You stay with me, we'll never grow up, my love.

I wait, sixteen, a Saturday, love.
My heart beats fast and faraway, love.
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up.
You stay with me, we'll never grow up.

I wait, sixteen, a Saturday, love.
My heart beats fast and faraway, love.
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up.
You stay with me, we'll never grow up, my love. ---Lyrics submitted by ayuqgandi.
