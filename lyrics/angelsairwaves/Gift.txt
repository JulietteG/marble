Theres a strangest excitement today
If youre awake then youre welcome to hear
Ive got a gift and it blew me a way
From the far eastern sea straight to here
Oh God I feel like Im in for it now
Its like the rush has gone straight to my brain
But my voice is as lonely as loud
As I whisper a joy of this pain

And suddenly
Youve done it all
You won me over
In no time at all

And now Ill stop the storm if it rains
Ill light a path far from here
Ill make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

If you ask I will do what you say
All we have is this night to get through
With the cheeks to the smile youre only
You left me all up in arms and confused
Oh God I feel like Im in for it now
And how this kiss will be one roughly vague
I swear Ill melt if you touch me at all
But then Ill ask you to do it again, and again

And suddenly
Youve done it all
You won me over
In no time at all

And now Ill stop the storm if it rains
Ill light a path far from here
Ill make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear
Ill stop the storm if it rains
Ill light a path far from here
Ill make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now

And now, Ill stop the storm if it rains
Ill light a path far from here
Ill make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear
Ill stop the storm if it rains
Ill light a path far from here
Ill make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear.

Make the world we know disappear.
Make the world we know disappear.

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, now---Lyrics submitted by Audrei.
