No bother, climb to it, and call out canary
Don't worry, just grab it, it's something, abuse it
My vision, a forest, a lot here to carry
Slide over and bite it, the apple and berry
The volume and the riot, the smell of the lions
The sunsets behind me, the bullets start flying

Finding a light in a world of ruin
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in
We're ready to begin

It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the right but that girl bites like a wolf

Inertia, take cover, a cannon, you ready?
The image, the session, a poet is sleeping
The courier, the pilot, antennas, and sirens
That college, like thieves that can eat with the wolfpack

Finding a light in a world of ruin
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in
Setting a sun and the hearts are burning
Leaving the nest to the back of a thousand winds
We're ready to begin

It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the right but that girl bites like

It's on me, it's only a small heart on one sleeve
Academy killer
Off with his head in the make believe game of fools
That girl bites like a wolf

Are you, you ready? I'm waiting to begin
Are you, you ready? I'm waiting to begin

It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the right but that girl bites like a wolf

It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the right but that girl bites like a wolf---
