Do up got yourself
Watch you slowly cemetery
Find a little fight in those eyes
You awaken to light across the sky
Dream a little harder this time
I'll wait you to make the journey
Let it go, let love realize
This is not your the end as is your eye

And I'll await you again
And I can feel your touch
I call your name to the wind
And into the nightfall my love

Carry up the worst of yourself
To make something mine marry
Give a little taste of it all
And awaken your friends a child
Give a little stay through the night
It's just some old stories
Feels like the night has alight
A reason to bring out the smiles

And I'll await you again
And I can feel your touch
I call your name to the wind
And into the nightfall my love

I'll keep your heart next to mine
And when the night's give off
I reach for you deep inside
I reach for you there my love---
