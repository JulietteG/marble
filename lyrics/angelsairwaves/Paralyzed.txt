I awake to a fire in the night
And you're lying safe and sound
It's a wild life, so wild, crazy
Cannot tame the crowd
Like beast in the hole, you're MIA
A little hell, you're gonna pay
You're a whore at home, the telephone
The king that's here to say

Sleep and awaken to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaken to life, with your hands at your side
Paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed

Out cold in the gentle rain, it's dark
A little lying sets your fire
Push away and go, in stereo
A tear ruled death, depart
Nineteen with the wicked MRE
What a waste of memory
You've got a steady heart, you played the part
And now you get down to the sea

Sleep and awaken to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaken to life, with your hands at your side

It's more of the same, a silly old shame
A dimly lit road, it will wither and go
I climb the light post, illuminate the road
For miles away, so safely on your way

Sleep and awaken to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaken to life, with your hands at your side

Sleep and awaken to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaken to life, with your hands at your side
Paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed---
