Theres something you said,
                             A whirl wind, a voice
                             Together you said
                             But I have no choice

           Oh please, stay a while, God, I love your smile

                               I never felt alone
                             It sure feels like hell
                            When Im on my own 
                               And your all I feel

            Oh please, stay a while God, I love your smile

                                A rat in a cage 
                             A stone in a stream
                                I float far away
                               I live in a dream

            Oh please, stay a while, God, I love your smile

         And how bout that thing you do when your awake?
                             A laugh with a stick
                             A bite from a snake

            Oh please, stay a while - God, I love your smile

                   God I love, God I love, God I love---Lyrics submitted by Rocco.
