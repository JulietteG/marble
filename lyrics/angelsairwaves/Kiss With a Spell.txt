If I end up alone
Across the baron
I've seen my true self
I am burning inside, for you

Living a curse
Lost in desire, of your touch
I cannot hurt
I cannot cry
I cannot die alone

Don't say it,
Don't, don't say loud

Oh, I know I can  hear myself
To hear it ever after all
Send me a kiss with a spell
Like beauty ever after all

A sting to the eyes
A trace here of you
It's still as
It's deep in the legs
Buckle of noise
