The ice is really cold, the street lights really old
 Her child's all alone, as she melts into her own
 And slowly fades away, into a river full of shame
 But at least numb to the pain, can you see it?

Can you feel the shallow wave, from a needle to the grave
 From our hell too far away, you're my only
 You're so sad my valentine, on your journey to the light
 But first straight to the fire

And we are
 All that we are
 Holding on until we fall apart
 And we are
 All that we are
 Holding on until we fall apart
 And we are
 All that we are
 Holding on until we fall apart
 And we are
 All that we are
 Holding on until we fall apart
 And we are

All that we are, All that we are
 All that we are, All That we are
 All That we are, All That we are
 All that we are, All that we are
