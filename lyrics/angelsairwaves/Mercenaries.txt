Can it come on out of the cold?
I'm gonna make it out alive 
Lock the door, stay away, stay alive 
'Cause all I knew 
As you fall in, stand try 

Go in deep, falling asleep, no door 
The battle is drop, pulling me, cut the cord
Give me a rope, come in the lake, sign of God 
Full of smoke, gather the snake and cut it off

Go in front lines, and the lonely go 
And you left behind, a bit of sorrow 

You didn't need to count me out 
In a final push is a little wait, some extra time 
You didn't need to count me out 
When you feel alone, here's a little hand 
And a thought 'cause you're on my mind 

Got it, got it, burn the reach 
burning down 
Let em feed and then gone 
Fall in the street and carry one 

Go in front lines, and the lonely go 
And you left behind, a bit of sorrow 

Go in front lines, and the lonely go 
And you left behind, a bit of sorrow 

You didn't need to count me out 
In a final push is a little wait, some extra time 
You didn't need to count me out 
When you feel alone, here's a little hand 
And a thought 'cause you're on my mind---
