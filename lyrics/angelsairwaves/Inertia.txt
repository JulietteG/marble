Youre a liar. 
You wear a gun, makes you look bigger. 
You scare the crowd, dont you feel smarter? 
Like a little kid, you play with fire. 
You do your part, you do it all. 

But those words from your mouth they are scary, 
and the hate that you have, that you carry, 
it will grow, it will grow, till were buried. 

You're so clever.
 If this is war, it's like no other.
 If there is blame it's on each other.
 I hear the cries, they last forever.
 We did our part, we came along. 

But those words from your mouth they are scary,
 and the hate that you have, that you carry,
 it will grow, it will grow, till we're buried. 
And there will be nothing left except sadness,
 and a scar without words, without anything
 cus we've done this before, this is madness. 

I am sorry, but those words from your mouth they are scary,
 and the hate that you have, that you carry,
 it will grow, it will grow till we're buried. 
And there will be nothing left except sadness, 
and a scar without words, without anything,
cus we've done this before, this is madness, this is wrong, this is us, this is happening, but we've done this before, but we're standing, we're still standing, and we've done this before, but we're standing, we're still standing, and we've done this before, but we're standing.

[speaking]
 You got to remember the good things, and cherish the memories and go on with life cus it don't stop. You only have to remember that what you've done in your life may change what someone else is doing in their life. And it changes everything. It's so amazing, love!---Lyrics submitted by Rocco.
