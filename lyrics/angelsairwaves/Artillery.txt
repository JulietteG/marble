Halloween, the fallen angel to bury the symphony
Bright lights and broken stables
Odd hours at the factory
They never even knew my name
Waiting for that victory

Follow on
The stars are blurry
They move throughout the sky
Machinery and crooked crosses
The children believe the lie
I never even caught your name
You never even had the time

Anyone, why cant you hear it
A voice thats out of range
Messengers and lost magicians
Engage the tidal waves
You never even knew my name
Crying up the rivalry
Waiting for a bit of shame
And blood us from the battery

Artillery
Their words are like a death tonight
Theyll serve you well---
