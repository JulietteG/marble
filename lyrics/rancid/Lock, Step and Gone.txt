The ending isn't here (there's somethin' wrong)
but it's comin'real soon (i lock step I'm gone)
i said the feeling isn't fear (there's something wrong)
it's just telling you to move (i lock step I'm gone)

there's a fire on the corner and it's never gonna stop
killer in the neighborhood never got caught
I lock up my door step out and I'm gone
waitin' for the buses but the buses won't come

all the docks are quiet (there's somethin' wrong)
and there's no ships comin' in (i lock step I'm gone)
where there once was a riot (there's somethin' wrong)
there's a whole lot of nothin' (lock step i'm gone)

the stop signs broken and the meters goin' down
wild dogs are runnin' themselves into the ground
everything was clear for that moment in time
if I don't come back well throw me a line

well the docks are quiet (there's somethin' wrong)
and there's no ships comin' in (i lock step i'm gone)
where there once was a riot (there's somethin' wrong)
there's a whole lot of nothin'...---Lyrics submitted by logan.
