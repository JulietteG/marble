Let the song begin, singin

Were on a mission
Got no remorse
One hundred miles an hour
Collision course

Well the glow on my line from my radio dial
For better beats from the record file
I drop the needle watch the cretins hop
While Im playing Pac-man at the the record shop
Deep in the night and the chaos comes
My rhythm gets driven by the beat of the drums
Forty-five, thirty-three RPM
Hey mister DJ, let us in

Were on a mission
Got no remorse
One hundred miles an hour
Collision course

Were on a mission
Got no remorse
One hundred miles an hour

Were on a mission
Got no remorse
One hundred miles an hour
Collision course---
