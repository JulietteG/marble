I'm money broke and it's no joke
Can't cope with the rope this time
Knuckle up, buckle up, the ride's getting rough
And I will not lose my mind
I asked her if I could come in
And the first thing she said was no
I can't come in, that means I can't come back
I got nowhere to go

Hyena fight for the lion share
Right
Sometimes the lion share ain't there
Hyena fight for the lion share
Hear me out
Sometimes the lion share ain't there

Absent from political authority
An animal I've become
Total disorder and confusion 
Is the lifestyle that I run
Permit me to do what I want and I will 
I'm a nomad to travel
Concrete, glass, stone, and gravel

Hyena fight for the lion share
Right
Sometimes the lion share ain't there
Hyena fight for the lion share
Hear me out
Sometimes the lion share ain't there
It ain't there!

Every time I turn around same sad story
Getting ganked I wish it would end
In life's comisary I'm a bad missionary 
With a wicked message I send
If I don't care to use that shit 
Is that the way I wanna live
Who could I trust in a world of greed?
What I'm taught to take and not give
Who could I trust when I'm taught to take and not give?

I'm money broke and it's no joke
Can't cope with the rope this time
Knuckle up, buckle up, the ride's getting rough
But I will not lose my mind
Permit me to do what I want and I will 
'Cause I'm a nomad to travel
Concrete, glass, stone, and gravel

You see there's nothing you can say
It's going to change my mind... Fuck you!

Hyena fight for the lion share
Sometimes the lion share ain't there
Sometimes the lion share ain't there---Lyrics submitted by Troy.
