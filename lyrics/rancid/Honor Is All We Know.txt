Dont change a goddamn thing
Hold your head up high
When the hard times come
We have the strength to defy
Believe in yourself
Let the arrow leave the bow

Honor is among us
Honor is all we know

The night has come
And we no longer see
Better days around the corner for you and me
Receive the horizon
Dawns golden glow

Honor is among us
Honor is all we know

It takes courage to make it in this land
So dont forget, but forgive every man
And prosperitys river it will forever flow

Honor is among us
Honor is all we know

Honor is among us
Honor is all we know---
