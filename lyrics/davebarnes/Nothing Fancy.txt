There's nothing fancy bout the way I love you
there's nothing you could not find in any other man
there's nothing fancy bout the way I love you
but I love you as hard as I can

There's no good reason for the way you love me
but you're my walking dream come true
there's no good reason for the way you love me
but I thank God that you do

I don't know the perfect conversation
I don't know the way to turn a head
I don't know the perfect way to prove my love
but I know I'll love you till I'm dead

There's nothing fancy bout the way I love you
it's as simple as the starts in the sky or the blue in the sea
there's nothing fancy bout the way I love you
bu it sure is fancy how you love me---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
