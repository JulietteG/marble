They tell me there's songs reserved for angels
would you sing me one, a stranger
just to prove your love?

They tell me you've given poor men kingdoms
and handed guilty freedom
and taken on their strains
and your love will never change
your love will never change

They tell me that you dwell with good and evil
in alleys and cathedrals
shadows and the light

They tell me that you hold the world together
not from guilt, but pleasure
and you somehow know my name
and your love will never change
your love will never change

Tell me there's nothing that you can't do
and you'll love me though I've hurt you
and that you'll take my blame
and your love will never change
your love will never change---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
