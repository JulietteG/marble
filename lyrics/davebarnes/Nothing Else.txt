Oh, baby
Love
Isnt just quite what I thought it was
And Im laughing now
Just because 
I cant get enough
Oh love

And you 
Im taking back all that I thought I knew
That dreams are only dreams
Never true
I was a fool

Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Baby, baby
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Than be with you

Me
Its not that I was lonely as can be
See love was hidden far out of reach
I could not see
Silly me

You and I
Are best because we know we got to try
Sorry is always said not goodbye
Thats why
You and I

Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Baby, Baby
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Than be with you

Looking back now I see
How love weve got history (got history)
Now theres nothing
I would rather
I would rather
Do

Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Baby, Baby
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Than be with you baby
Than be with you baby

Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Baby, Baby
Id rather do
Theres nothing else
Id rather do
Than be with you baby, baby
You baby, baby
You baby, baby---Lyrics submitted by Moriah.
