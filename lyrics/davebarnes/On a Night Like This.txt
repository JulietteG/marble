On a night like this I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
In this dark so dense, we talk so soft
The way young lovers do

The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
Ive hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the Judas kiss

On a night like when the moon sits still
And the stars are watching too
The way you move is a lullaby
I could fall in love with you

The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
Ive hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the Judas kiss

On a night like this I could fall in love
I could in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
