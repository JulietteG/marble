Then the time has come to pass
Every day is like one before
How I wanted it to last
There's nothing inthis world I wanted more
Should we carry on
Maybe the thrill is gone
I'd like to know for sure
Why should we carry on
Could both of us be wrong
We're standing much too close inside each other's lives to see
...that love has passed us by
Let me ease down from your dream
Dreaming now's the easy thing to do
Left me somewhere in between
Living with and living without you

Should we carry on
Maybe the thrill is gone
I'd like to know for sure
Why should we carry on
Could both of us be wrong
We're standing much too close inside each other's lives to see
...that love has passed us by (repeat fadeout)---Lyrics submitted by kazz.
