Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stipes and bright stars, thro' the perious fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
and the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangle banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?---Lyrics submitted by Avery Nance.
