There I was, back in the wild again
And I felt right at home where I belong
I had that feelin' comin' over me again
Just like it happened so many times before (yeah)

The spirit of the woods is like an old good friend
It makes me feel warm and good inside
I knew his name and it was good to see him again
'Cause in the wind he's still alive

Oh, Fred Bear, walk with me down the trails again
Take me back, back where I belong 
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side, my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
Before too long

It was kinda dark, another misty dusk
And it came from a tangle down below
I tried to remember everything he taught me so well
I had to decide which way to go

Was I alone or in a hunter's dream?
'Cause the moment of truth was here and now
I felt his touch, I felt his guiding hand
The buck was mine, forevermore

Because of Fred Bear
I'll walk down these trails again
Take me back where I belong
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long
We're not alone when we're in the great outdoors
We got his spirit, we've got his soul
He will guide our steps, he'll guide our arrows home
The restless spirit forever roams

Fred Bear, walk with me down the trails again
Take me back, back where I belong 
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side, my friend
And I'll join you on the big hunt before too long

Oh, Fred Bear, walk with me down the trails again
Take me back, back where I belong 
Oh, Fred Bear, I'm glad to have you at my side, my friend
And I'll join you in the big hunt before too long

In the wind he's still alive
In the wind he's still alive
In the wind he's still alive
In the wind he's still alive
In the wind, I hear, I hear Fred Bear

(I hear ya Fred, 
Talk to me, 
Yea, 
It's all right
Lets go hunting baby
Say Fred, you go up that ridge
And I'll go down in the swamp
We'll get that buck)
(Fred)
(If some of our teenage thrill seeker really want to go out and get a thrill. 
Let them go up into the north west and let them tangle with a Grizzly bear 
Or Polar bear or brown bear and get that effect that will cleanse the soul---Lyrics submitted by matt.
