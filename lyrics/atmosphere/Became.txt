It's no surprise I overslept.
Put my boots on and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you
Assumed you were sleeping
immediately start a fire 'cause it's freezing

I cant believe we went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
a late start but we can still catch up
you need to wake up
we should eat and then pack up

that's when I noticed your footprints
the snow's fresh and those have been put since
what you already up making the rounds?
so where you at now? you laid back down

the breeze came and it stalled out the flame
while I went to your tent and called out your name
you didn't answer so i opened up the flap
it's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack

I'm looking at your tracks and you
took a couple laps round the campground and hoofed down the path
I figure you'll return no concern
I'ma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn

The wind is blowing strong
minutes rolling on
It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone
it ain't right, start the paranoia
I left the campsite to go and search for ya

I read the trail your feet made
each step was deliberately placed
it looks like you know where it leads
but i see nothing but leaf-less, frozen trees.

About a 1/4 mile into the course
and another set of tracks appeared next to yours
from the North it came outta the thick woods
and those footprints belonged to a big wolf.

Trying to find service on my cellphone
I felt aight with my knife on my belt though
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew it was behind you

Stalking ya, maybe watching ya
waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
salivating wanna take you to the stomach
in the cartoons you woulda turned into a drumstick

And it gets about as bad as it goes
'cause I noticed there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood
it doesn't look good
your fan club doubled now you've got another wolf

And the odds are in favour of the home team
why'd you walk off all alone? where you going?
it ain't the right time to complain but
it feels like I'm trying to find your remains

Your footprints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
It means you started to run so i did the same
now my breath's looking like a steam engine train

and suddenly your tracks dip off of the path
and so did theirs
so my knife I grabbed
In to the forest expect the worst
adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves

50 yards into the woods and brush
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood serene, sober
seemed like a good 15 degrees colder

and I'll admit hell yeah I felt fear
the sound of my heartbeat was all I could hear
looking at the snow it was plain and clear
there was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared

I cant process I don't follow
It'd be easier to believe that you were swallowed
but no sign of death, no sign of struggle
no signs of blood no signs of trouble

and the wolves never stopped
the tracks kept going and I took off
so I don't know how your story ends
but I know I'll never go into those woods again

It's not that tragic its not a shame
You're not the hunted you're not the aim
You're just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not hunted you're not the aim
You're just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

It's not that tragic it's not a shame
You're not the hunted you're not the aim
You're just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

I forgot to worry about what you became---Lyrics submitted by Travis Cuiriz.
