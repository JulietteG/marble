I know a guy with a rock star life, but he still don't fly so he's mad at the sky 
Sits me down and kicks his wisdom he's been around I give him a listen 
Seems like he got a lot of complaints about how nowadays things ain't the same na 
Used to place some faith in the basement a toast for this guy and those kids that he came with 
Cause they all on the same shit based on, cut down placement, up town, stay strong 
Don't ever do a dance with the devil now, that smile is a sign that you're sellin' out 
Judgement, gossip, ethics, let's just exploit all this excess 
You can feel how we feels to walk around town to lookin down from them tall heels 
And who needs fame or fortune when you get the same love that the fame is snortin 
Future so afraid of yours that you strayed from the course and you came up short 
Believe he would have more credibility if he wasn't just another drunk pill junky 
It's obvious to me that he's still hungry for the superstars a little bad lucky 
Go ahead and get mad at God point your fingers at your dad and at Santa Claus 
Listen all yall it's a sabotage wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off 

It goes one for the bar tap two for the shine 
Go to your car and do another line 
Barely trust them their all puppets love is nothing scared of success 
One for the bass two for the drums 
Last call gonna take whatever comes 
Barely trust them their all puppets love is nothing scared of success 

I think it's great how you used to be great 
I can't hate how you choose to relate 
But I know you had the potential 
I understand why you wanted to let go 
A lot of pressure in the middle of those shoulders 
And we ain't gettin nothing but older 
Ain't nothing change but the day we run from 
But nobody knows that better than you---Lyrics submitted by Justina.
