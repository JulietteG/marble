[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop cuz you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you I don't know what I would say
We could sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives 
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you can show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen sean and all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doin alright

[Chorus]
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cuz I miss you? (x2)

[Verse 2]
I'm shook, I know, I pushed when I should've pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top-notch good listener
If you could block off a little time just to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm havin a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sittin here wishin we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I joking with?
There's no way you and I will ever reopen it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you on the corner of

[Chorus]
And when you left, I didn't see it comin
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was runnin
You krept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I've kept
You disappeared but the history is still here
It's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leavin me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fist-full, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred, now it brings me shame 
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you cause you passed away, dad

Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cuz I miss you?---Lyrics submitted by Bryce Stafford.
