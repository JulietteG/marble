[Chorus x2:]
Freefallin' when you shook from the pack
Keep walkin', let the foot leave a track
We often gotta look for the path
These problems, are the good ones to have

[Slug: Verse 1]
Nobody wanna struggle at home
Bass in his voice, trouble in her tone
What kinda couple makes a puzzle out of stone?
Choppin' and poppin' all of the bubbles that are blown
Nobody wanna be wrong
And once the line gets drawn across what we disagree upon
It could be the timebomb that we sleep on
It's just a little one
Back and forth like a ping pong
Nobody wants an argument
You try to bargain as a friend
But it's hard to with a star offense against a smart defense
And the history you share is full of scars and dents
Nobody likes breakin' up
When you hate the situation, but you crave the touch
You might stay in the relationship for the simple sake of it
Because you know it's based in love

[Chorus x2:]
Freefallin' when you shook from the pack
Keep walkin', let the foot leave a track
We often gotta look for the path
These problems, are the good ones to have

[Slug: Verse 2]
Nobody wanna go to work
For some older jerk that doesn't know the dirt
That's embedded in the hearts of those that hurt
Monday through Friday and Saturday's for bonus perks
Nobody befriends the beast
Just to make ends meat and try to pay rent and eat
Spreadsheets by the end of the week
You'd rather spread them sheets and try to get some sleep
Nobody wanna lift a crate
That ain't living great
You wanna kid and play
You should dip, escape
No two week notification
Show up late and quit today
Nobody wants an awful boss
That got you poppin' out the top of your mouth as if it's common talk
You ought to wait until you off the clock
And appreciate the fact that you got a job

[Chorus x2:]
Freefallin' when you shook from the pack
Keep walkin', let the foot leave a track
We often gotta look for the path
These problems, are the good ones to have

[Slug: Verse 3]
But somebody want that life you got
They think your boyfriend's nice or your wife is hot
They on your block lookin' at that home you bought
They'd move in today if that door wasn't locked
Nowadays you ought to watch your spot
Even with all the flaws of that boss you mock
You could still close your eyes and toss a rock 
I bet you'd hit someone that'd love to cop your job
That's what I thought
Of course you don't stop
You won't take the shot
You can't afford the loss
If you don't wanna taste the sauce
Then put the plate down and take a walk
Drop or move away from the pot
Cause every time you talk
Complain a lot
Don't forget to count the balls y'all caught
Enjoy what you got before it all falls off

[Chorus x2:]
Freefallin' when you shook from the pack
Keep walkin', let the foot leave a track
We often gotta look for the path
These problems, are the good ones to have---Lyrics submitted by Tim Ehrenberg.
