She's makin'magic oh that's what she does
Don't come from below must come from above
And I know she's cast a spell on me cuz when she squeezes my hand
It makes me weak in the knee

Ooh when she stares with those big green eyes
That's when she's about to excercise
The beauty within and all that surrounds
She stops without fear oh she don't make a sound

She's makin' magic oh I'm in a spin
I don't know where  I'm goin' can't tell where I've been 
Don't you know I'm walking through a purple haze
She lenghtened the night she shortens the days

Oh when she flashes those big green eyes
That's when she' s about to sensatize
The beauty within the body without
She touches ya there and ya just wanna shout
