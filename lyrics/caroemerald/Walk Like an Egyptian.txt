All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance don't you know
If they move too quick
(Oh whey oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles
(Oh whey oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

The blond waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves
(Oh whey oh)
You drop your drink then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings
(Oh whey oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the market place say
(Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street bend your back
Shift your arm then you pull it back
Life's hard you know
(Oh whey oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance
(Oh whey oh)
They spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their Yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know
(Oh whey oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh)
Walk like an Egyptian---
