[Verse 1:]
I live on the edge,
And something has me really turning red,
I toss and then I turn inside this bed, oh yeah,
Yeah, I said it.
I'm unsatisfied,
With all the Romeos and their goodbyes,
Their 'See ya later's incomplete the lies,
That's why I sigh.

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's not just me I talk about,
Our age is on the way,
All the money in the women's world will never make him change.

[Chorus:]
Gonna grab the yellow pages,
Find a Davinci of the threads,
To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead.
It's time for my rehearsal, the ultimate reversal,
You see, I've got a plan,
I'm coming back as a man.

[Verse 2:]
I'm gonna wear blue,
And find a pair of flat black leather shoes,
That shine more than a diamond mine could do,
And add something new,

Like wear a cologne,
That says you are the man I'm gonna own,
And whispers 'baby, will you take me home? '
Va va va va va vum

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
I drop a hint and then my keys,
And then I'll cast a net,
To catch someone who's in for such a night he won't forget.

[Chorus:]
Gonna grab the yellow pages,
Find a Davinci of the threads,
To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead.
It's time for my rehearsal, the ultimate reversal,
You see, I've got a plan,
I'm coming back as a man.

[Bridge:]
I'll hide behind the Errol Flynn moustache,
Remove the false impression to make sure the feeling lasts.
Call me the equalizer for the girls,
And tell me baby, tell me where it hurts.

[Chorus:]
Gonna grab the yellow pages,
Find a Davinci of the threads,
To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead.
It's time for my rehearsal, the ultimate reversal,
You see, I've got a plan,
I'm coming back as a man.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
