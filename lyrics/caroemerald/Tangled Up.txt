Verse 1:
I took the perfect avenue, down the road to both of you
Did I go dutch?
This is too much!
With all the money in the world
You could never buy this girl
Quite enough, it will be tough
If romancing me with neons is something you should do
May the letters write in luminous, in-lou

Chorus:
And get me wicked up
Shake it up
Tangled up
You could be breaking up, making up
Tangled up
You cant be faking it,
Making it from my love
With all this tragedy, dont get me tangled up

Verse 2:
I cant separate your sins,
To me youre acting like youre twins
This is a mess,
Is this a test?
How many guesses do I get?
Till only one of you is left
Youre quite the same,
If loves the gain
I want to see emotions coloring the sky
To the point it will make me wanna cry

Chorus:
And get me wicked up
Shake it up
Tangled up
You could be breaking up, making up
Tangled up
You cant be faking it,
Making it from my love
With all this tragedy, dont get me tangled up
Tangled up

Treating girls like a yo-yo is a no no of monumental kind
If playing with your string had lanced to be your thing
Its easy to say to both, oh nevermind

Chorus:
And get me wicked up
Shake it up
Tangled up
You could be breaking up, making up
Tangled 
You cant be faking it,
Making it from my love
With all this tragedy, dont get me tangled up
Tangled up
Tangled up
Tangled up---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
