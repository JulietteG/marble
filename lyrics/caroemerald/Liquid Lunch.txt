(Verse)
Lady pass the aspirin, somethings gotta work
I know I did it to myself but man oh man it hurts
That second lost Martini, the one that went down real smooth
Set me on the bender with nothing left to lose

(Pre-Chorus)
I just cant apologize 
For what I did to myself
My beds an ocean lighter
And I cant call for help

(Chorus x2)
Yea baby, it hurts a bunch
Your girls got going and were having lunch
I promise Imma dine, admit its the last time
Ill never have a liquid lunch

(Verse)
I think Ive got to seem the tends and many of them will leave
They think that its a party to laugh at all my greed
It mustve been a doozy, I had 200 dreams
At least I found my pillow cause I cant find my keys

(Pre-Chorus 2)
Its hard to remember
All of the events
But I mustve faded out
Cause all thats left is 50 cents

(Chorus x2)
Yea baby, it hurts a bunch
Your girls got going and were having lunch
I promise Imma dine, admit its the last time
Ill never have a liquid lunch

(Bridge)
Baby, I can call the pharmacy
Theyll bring something up, something up too sweet
Some exotic medicine to cure my every ill
With some kind of magic pill

(Pre-Chorus)
I just cant apologize 
For what I did to myself
My beds an ocean lighter
And I cant call for help

(Chorus x4)
Yea baby, it hurts a bunch
Your girls got going and were having lunch
I promise Imma dine, admit its the last time
Ill never have a liquid lunch---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
