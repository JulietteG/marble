You know I'd like to meet you there
And you know I won't be late
That's 	   where she wants to go

And I've been wait-ing all this while
To see to my ba-by smile
a-long some o-pen road

And there's noth-ing I can say
to make this feel-ing change
and that's where she'll lay

And you know I'm at the tow
of the whip-ping post
and that's where she's gon-na lay me


'Cause she's a mean bitch baby
got my big fix baby
now take it off baby
now take it off

'Yeah she's a mean bitch baby
got my big fix baby
now take it off baby
now take it off


And I'm not feel-ing that I'm wrong
now ma-ny sing my song
I got noth-in' to lose

And I've seen so man-y eyes
just an-oth-er greed-y dis-guise
babe it's time for me to choose

And there's noth-ing I can say
to make this feel-ing change
and that's where she'll lay

And you know I'm at the tow
of the whip-ping post
and that's where she's gon-na lay me


'Cause she's a mean bitch baby
got my big fix baby
now take it off baby
now take it off

'Yeah she's a mean bitch baby
got my big fix baby
now take it off baby
now take it off

'Cause she's a mean bitch baby
got my big fix baby
now take it off baby
now take it off

'Yeah she's a mean bitch baby
got my big fix baby
now take it off baby
now take it off---Lyrics submitted by BFORD.
