Now you can say,
Say I treated you badly
Either way, said you loved me madly
Love is sweet like honey baby 
When it's on your side
Let me tell you, what is on my mind:

It's you and me back in the day
When we were young, high just doing our thing
I don't know what I did to make you believe
But baby that don't matter to me

I know I'm on your mind
Let me talk one more time oh
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back yeah
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back yeah
I can tell your ready for it
So get back, get back to my love
I'm through running baby
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back oh
I bet you don't even see me coming!

Don't hold out
Oh, wait for someone better
I'll change your mind
Change it like the weather
Cause I got what you need
Your nothing is something and something is nothing
I just wanna know if your coming with me!

I know I'm on your mind
Let me talk one more time
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back yeah
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back yeah oh
So get back, get back to my love
I'm through running baby
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back, oh
I bet you don't see me coming!

Oh yeah, oh
Come on

It's you and me back in the day
And we were young, high just doing our thing
I don't know what I did to make you believe
But honestly, oh it don't matter to me

Gotta get you back, gotta get you back yeah
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back
I can tell your ready for it
So get back, get back to my love
and yeah yeah yeah
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back oh
I bet you don't even see me coming!

You want a guy like that
I know a guy
Oo
Alright
It's time to go---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
