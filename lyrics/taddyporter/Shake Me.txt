Now you say that you've met my kind before
Now excuse me if I'm dying for a little more
Now baby what you do, what you do to me
I know that you will, an girl

Sh-sh shake me you know she can shake it
Ba-ba break me you know she can take it
I know, yeah I like the way she moves
When she shakes me, when she shakes me
Slow slow down
Slow slow, down

Now who do you think your talking to
Baby now your saying you want me to
First you gotta show me what you can do
And I know, that you will
Alright

Sh-sh shake me you know she can shake it
Ba-ba break me you know she can take it
I know, yeah I like the way she moves
When she shakes me, when she shakes me
Slow slow down
Slow slow

I know it's alright
It's all alright
You can say that it's all
I know it's alright 
It's all alright, yeah!

...

I need to see her move again
So tell me what to do
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
It's all alright
Yeah, yeah
She's alright
She's all alright, yeah

Sh-sh shake me you know she can shake it
Ba-ba break me you know she can take it
I know, yeah I like the way she moves
When she shakes me, yeah!
Oh, shake me I know she can shake it
Ba ba break me you know she can take it
I know, I like the way she moves 
When she shakes me, when she shakes me
Slow slow, down 
Slow slow, down
