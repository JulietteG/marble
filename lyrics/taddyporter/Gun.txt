Met a man outside, said he knew ya
Said you did him wrong outside Missoula
Was a kid what you done, what you sayin
Either way Im getting paid, my moneys made
Cuz Im a gun thats come to shoot you down

Rumor has it that lust has led to liars
Theres a green eyed man who wants your fire
If you can give me one reason to hold this kill
I find Im just as inclined to make a deal
Cuz Im a gun thats come to shoot you down

Im gonna sing my favorite song
And the devils gonna sing along
Under the peppermint sky youre still gonna die
Let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

Theres a man outside, he said he knew ya
Reeked of whiskey and water, hallelujah 
If you can give me one reason to hold this kill
I find Im just as inclined to make a deal
Cuz Im a gun thats come to shoot you down
But when you havent sung, you better not hold your tongue 

Im gonna sing my favorite song
And the devils gonna sing along
Under the peppermint sky youre still gonna die
Let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

Rumor has it that lust has led to liars
And theres a green eyed man who wants your fire
Im the gun thats come to shoot you down

Im gonna sing my favorite song
And the devils gonna sing along
Under the peppermint sky youre still gonna die
Let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

Im gonna sing my favorite song
And the devils gonna sing along
Under the peppermint sky youre still gonna die
Let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
This is the end---Lyrics submitted by Meagan Morrow.
