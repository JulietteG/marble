Gonna be some changes
Made around here
Theres gonna be some changes
Made around here

Theres gonna be some changes
Theres gonna be some changes
Made around here
Thats clear

Im comin from a hard life
Lookin for the spotlight
Make you feel alright 
You know its that baby

Theres gonna be some changes
Theres gonna be some changes
Made around here

Comin at you like a freight train
And Im on you like a hurricane
Thats why I do what I do like I want you to do baby

Gonna  be some changes
Theres gonna be some changes
Made around here

Gonna be some changes
Made around here
Theres gonna be some changes
Made around here

Changes, Changes made around here---Lyrics submitted by Meagan Morrow.
