My love was as young as it ever was
When your knife felt so sweet beneath my skin

That girl is evil
That girl is evil
That girl is evil

Your kiss was as sharp as it ever was
Want to see when it drips from my lip

That girl is evil
That girl is evil
That girl is evil

My time is as young as it ever was

That girl is evil
That girl is evil
That girl is evil

That girl is evil
That girl is evil
That girl is evil---Lyrics submitted by Meagan Morrow.
