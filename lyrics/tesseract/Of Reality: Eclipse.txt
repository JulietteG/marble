I won't deny
 My mind has wandered to the other side
 Follow the light
 The beauty of explosions in the sky

 I've breached the silence
 I reek of sin
 A rift in the forked road I grow to dread
 Don't cry to me
 I'm not a friend
 To those who dwell on the dead

 Detox sunrise

 There's a crevice in my hope
 The scale
 The means
 The end won't stop overwhelming me
 No light at the end of the tunnel
 The fear
 The doubt
 The dark won't cast shadow over me

 I'm broken
 You're broken

 As the crescent grows
 As the light returns
 Can we face a new beginning?
 Such a retrospective obsession---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
