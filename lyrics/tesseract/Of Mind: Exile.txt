Turn your back on everything
 Banging heads with prophecy
 Lavish in uncertainty

 Who will I be?
 How will i live to tell
 What I have seen?
 Must I endure the hell
 That comes with the peace
 An equilibrium
 Of gods own release

 What does it all mean?
 How can he jusitify
 How can we breathe
 When the stagnancy's choking me?
 How can we dream?
 The nightmare - The reality
 How do you sleep at night?

 Take this doubt and fear to your grave

 This life of stone
 The hand of god
 I'm too tempted to bribe
 I'm getting old
 And I'm growing paralyzed
 We're all alone
 Until we let our minds
 Take to the skies
 Our blood runs cold
 Yet we remain alive

 What's the confliction
 Between heart and mind?
 How to bridge the void?
 Fuse the two in kinship
 To understand your prospects and vistas
 And yet to see the love here too
 It's more than I can do
 Vows and pursuits which at best
 Hollow I remain
 Torn in two

 Just seize the moment
 Sabotage the Lines
 Life turns on a dime
 Please cease the torment
 It's weighing on my mind
 The pressue you apply won't hold

 This life of stone
 The hand of god
 I'm too tempted to bribe
 I'm getting old
 And I'm growing paralyzed
 We're all alone
 Until we let our minds
 Take to the skies
 Our blood runs cold
 Yet we remain alive

 Lavish in uncertainty
 Turn your back on everything---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
