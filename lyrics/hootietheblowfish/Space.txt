I see it inside your eyes,
feel it in your soul.
A part of you is moving on,
the other half is gone.
I don't know what you want from me,
no, you lock it all inside.
I try to give you everything,
but there's nothing else that I can hide.
We've been trying so long.
You've been pushing too hard.
You should say what's wrong and echo what's right.
You need a little space and I need mine.
When you and I all alone, it feels so damn crowded.
The house we share is not a home when you're inside it.
So, now, I go and pack my things, girl,
I must be moving on.
I couldn't stand to face you,
so I, I guess that's why I wrote this song.
You've been trying so long.
We've been pushing too hard.
You should say what's wrong and echo what's right.
You need a little space and I need mine.
Oh, oh, oh, we've been trying so long.
You've been pushing too hard.
You should say what's wrong and echo what's right.
You need a little space and I need mine.
You need a little space and I need mine.---
