Staring back at you
Did you see my lips
Or were you smiling right in front of me

Your father called my name
Then he smiled with great relief
'Cause it wasn't me that you were clinging to

He made you turn around
You do that thing you do
And then you laughed with me

I don't know
What I can't see
I don't know but I'm makin' time to call
I don't know
What I can't see
I don't know but she's watching me leave

Just wish they'd turn around
Just wish they'd try to see
But they don't understand and that's alright with me I'm leaving now

Going down to Tucker's Town
Where I can lie for free
Nobody stares at me and I'd love to hurt the population

She called last night
I said I'm about to leave
Then I heard him scream, "I'll pack your bags"

I don't know
What I can't see
I don't know but I'm makin' time to call
I don't know
What I can't see
I don't know but I'm leaving here

To see the world through your Rosy glasses
I'll teach you to fly but they teach greed
We live the belt but I can bleed

I don't know....
What I can't see....
I don't know
What I can't see---
