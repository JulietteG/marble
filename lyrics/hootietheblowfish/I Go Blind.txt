Every time I look at you, I go blind.
Every time I look at you, I go blind.
In the mornin' I get up, and I try to
Feel alive, but I can't.
Every time I look at you, I go blind.
I don't know what it is.
Something in me just won't give me a chance.
I think it's that I feel more confused
By the deal love has shown me.
Little child, did you know that there's a light,
And it's gonna shine right through your eyes.
What do you think that life is like?
Every time I look at you, I go blind.
I go blind
Well some where over there there's a purpose,
There's a care for free
In me there's no body, no one plan,
No one stand to be free.
I think it's that because I have seen all the fuss
And it's no big deal. No big deal.
Hold me, hold me 'cause I want to get higher and higher,
Higher than life.---
