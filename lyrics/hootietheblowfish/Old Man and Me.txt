Well an old man said to me
In a voice filled with pain
Where you going young man
Said I'm going to fight a war
Gonna fight for my country
In some foreign land
He said "The sun will never hurt you
Never harmed anyone
But you must realize"
If you try to stare her down
She will win in the end
She will burn your eyes
She will burn them

Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven

He said "Boy I was young once
Yeah I was tough
Sailing on Uncle Sam's boat
Hey I could kill the enemy
I could die on foreign streets
But I could not vote
But now you walk by me
You won't talk to me
Say this is my fate
But every time you walk the streets boy
Most of them you meet
You see it's you they hate
It's you...

Seen a million faces
Seen a million places die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven
I hope I get there

Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get there

See this woman sitting next to me
She's been there for a long, long time
And when I fell, she picked me up
When I cried, she wiped my tears
I thank god she's mine
And when I leave this world
She won't have anything
But her love for me
'Cause the man took everything else
Made me hate myself
So just let her be boy
Won't you let her be---
