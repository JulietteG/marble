Hello again
Your words they make me smile
As I drift away
In my little room upstairs

Oh I spend my nights
Imagining your face your touch
Then I realize
How I don't even know your name

If we could share our time
Would I disappoint your fantasies
I believe that you could be the one I'm needing
'cause I'm

only lonely on the inside
didn't mean to take away your dreams
only lonely on the inside
when you close your eyes to your deepest thoughts

I could start to give apologies
For all the stupid things That I will say and I will do
If we should ever cross the same place at the same time
Would your world skip a beat 'cause it was me

If we could share our life
Would I disappoint your memories
I believe that I could be the one your needing
And I'm

If I could give back your hopes your joys your treasures
Don't you think that I would change my world
But there's so many things trying to pull us together
Even though we're far apart I can still watch you walk away

Only lonely on the inside
Didn't mean to take away your dreams
Only lonely on the inside
When you close your eyes do you see me

(in your deepest thoughts do you see me)
(when you close your eyes, in your deepest thoughts do you see me)---
