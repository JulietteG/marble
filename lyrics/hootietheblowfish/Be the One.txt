I wonder
Why are we involved
With the seasons
And the living of our own
Let me see if nothing's wrong
I just want to be the one

(She) wanted
You still give her all our lives
Let her be son
Who is she buying
See her crawl
I'll just make it out

(We don't see it bleeding)
I want to die with you
(Something no ones needing)

I left the other day
But you're never here
You only listen to things you want to save
But the power it's ok with you
You knew I'd find something else to do

Let me be the one
(we don't see it bleeding)
I wanna fly, I wanna die with you
Something no ones

See it's not like they
Are gonna take my faith away
Let me in it's ok now
Close the door

Is it really needing
When you find a place
That's only yours

Just go he beams
Well I've died for good now
Let me feel it
Let her come---let her run---let her run

(Now)
Let me be the one
(We don't see it bleeding)
I can't feel it, I can't see it
(Something no ones needing)
I feel dumb---
