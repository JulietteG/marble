If you ever change your mind
About leavin', leavin' me behind
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

You know I cried when you left
But I only, I only hurt myself, I'll forgive you
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

I'll give you jewelry, some of that money too
But that ain't all, all I'd do for you, I said I forgive you, girl
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

You know I cried when you left
I said I only, I only hurt myself, I'll forgive you
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

I need your love, baby, I know
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me---
