There's somethin' in the water that's callin' my name. If I work another hour I'mma go insane. 
Driftin' to the places I would rather be... 
In my boat under a cypress tree.

There's some good Cajun music on the radio. 
Every Sunday mornin' it's a Fais do-do.
The birds in the trees seem to know this song. 
I pop a crop to the beat while they're singin' along.

Hey, they're gonna see me comin' before the sun dries the mornin' dew. 
Hey, you know I can't wait to go Sac-au-lait fishin' down on whiskey bayou.

Hey...

One more cast before the sun goes down.
That's just about the time the alligator come 'round. My baby, she's a'waitin' and she's all alone. 
But if I keep gettin' nibbles, I may never go home.

Hey, they're gonna see me comin' before the sun dries the mornin' dew. 
Hey, you know I can't wait to go Sac-au-lait fishin' down on whiskey bayou.

Hey, they're gonna see me comin' before the sun dries the mornin' dew. 
Hey, you know I can't wait to go Sac-au-lait fishin' down on whiskey bayou.

Hey, they're gonna see me comin' before the sun dries the mornin' dew. 
Hey, you know I can't wait to go Sac-au-lait fishin' down on whiskey bayou.---
