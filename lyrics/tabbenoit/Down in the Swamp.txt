I got to go i got to go
Got to go away for a little while
I got to go i got to go
Got to go away for a little while
Well back to Louisiana where i spent my time as a child

Well you you can come you can come
Come on down and look for me
You can come down come on down
Come on down and look for me
Well down in the swamp baby you know that's where I'll be

Solo
When you walk around walk around
Black water will suck you down
When you walk around walk around
Black water will suck you down
Lord you can try try to look for me you know i cant cant be found
No no baby
