You can travel over ocean, and around the world
You can follow every notion, that you can afford
And some day when you're feeling all alone
And your thoughts turn back to home, let them stray back my way

I hope you know your home, is right here next to me
Just as long, as you want it to be
I said your home is right here next to me, next to me

And some night, lord you might hear me scream
As I'm caught in the arms of a fitful dream
But when you stand guilty of the crowns of love and I'm losin' you
That's one dream that I never want to come true

Hey, your home is right here next to me
Just as long as you want it to be
Your home is right here darlin', next to me, oh next to me

Your home is right here next to me
Just as long as you want it to be
I said your home is right here next to me, next to me ---
