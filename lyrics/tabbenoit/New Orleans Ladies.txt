A sassy style that will drive you crazy
And they hold you like the light
Hugs the wick when this candle's burning.
Them Creole babies
Thin and brown and downright lazy
And they roll just like the river
A little wave will last forever

Chorus

All the way
From Bourbon Street to Esplanade
They sashay by...
They sashay by...

New Orleans Ladies
A flair for life, love and laugher
And they hold you like the night
Holds a chill when this cold wind's blowing
Them Creole babies
They strut and sway from dusk till dawning
And they roll like the river
A little wave will last forever

Chorus

All the way
From Bourbon Street to Esplanade
They sashay by...
They sashay by....---
