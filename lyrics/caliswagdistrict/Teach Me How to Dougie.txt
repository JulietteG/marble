Aye! aye!
Teach me how to dougie(aye!)

[Verse 1:]
They be like smooth(what?)
Can u teach me how to dougie?
You know why?
Cause all da bitches love me(aye)
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dunk it!
Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gon' be on you when they see you hit dat dougie right?
Aint nobody fuckin wit my bro from morningside
He go by bubba and he hit dat dance like thunder
I aint from dallas but I d-town boogie
I show my moves off and everybody tryna do me
I leave da function and all da ladies tryna screw me
You just do you and ima do me(all day)
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me I think they tryna glue me
I make the party shine bright when it start to boomin
Dis beat was bubblegum so I had to chew it

[Chorus]
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie

The name is young!
For da dudes who don't know me

I Step up in da club and all these bitches bug me
On a nigga dancin and none of them know me
I hear da crowd screamin like aye! get it brody!
So I'm on my shoulders and I take it real low

And when dat nigga stop they like dougie somemore!

[Verse 3]
Back of the party i don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone
(Mmm) she do her dougie and da bitches hatin but I'm bout
To excape with a bitch and head home(fuck it)
She got her friends so its a two man And I run a runner even if her legs long
She like you hubby and I think she love me but,
I change da subject and I do my dougie
Cause, i don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money, me
Leave smooth heff in the back with sum playboy bunnies
we gon make em do da dougie in da middle of da bed
And when I asked for some head da bitch looked at me funny
Baahahaa! bitch you can't tell me nothin starr made da beat
I just took it out the oven, I just hit the dougie when everybody
Clubbin and I hate skinny jeans cuz da burner keep rubbin! (oh! )

[Chorus]
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You aint fuckin wit my dougie!---Lyrics submitted by syria.
