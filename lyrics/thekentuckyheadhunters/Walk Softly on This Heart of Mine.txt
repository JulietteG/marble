(Verse 1)

You say your sorry once again,
You want me to take you back once more,
You say you need a helpin' hand,
But that's what you told me once before,

(Chorus)

Walk softly on this heart of mine love,
Don't treat it mean and so unkind,
Let it rest in peace in quiet love,
Walk softly on this heart of mine,
WALK ON!

(Verse 2)

I know some day you'll find a new love,
I feel your heart  it turned to stone,
But please let me down real easy,
Cause loneliness moves in as you move on,

(Chorus)

Walk softly on this heart of mine love,
Don't treat it mean and so unkind,
Let it rest in peace in quiet love,
Walk softly on this heart of mine,
Walk softly on this heart of mine,
Walk softly on this heart of, 
Mi-i-i-i-ine---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
