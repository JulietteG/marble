Well let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
We'll get a slawburger, fries, and a bottle of Ski
bring it on out to my baby and me

Yeah, we're headed to the drive-in on a saturday night
Just me and my baby and a six-pack of lite
Got a pocketful of money and i'm rarin' to go 
Down to Dumas Walker right after the show
They'll be shootin' marbles in the back of the store
And laying money down on the floor

Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
We'll get a slawburger, fries, and a bottle of Ski

He takes all his orders down one at a time
Don't need a pad he's got a photogenic mind
He don't like the young folks hanging around
He's here to let you know we got a law in this town
You ought to see him reelin' when he walks through the door
The marble king is ready for more

Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
We'll get a slawburger, fries, and a bottle of Ski
Bring it on out to my baby and me
Here it comes---Lyrics submitted by Thomas Hesson.
