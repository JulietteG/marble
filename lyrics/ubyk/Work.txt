Wake up 
There is much to do.
Dishwasher is getting full
Feed the kitty and the pooch
And run, run, run.

Shine your hair and 
Shine your shoes
Happy face, dont get the blues
It will all be over soon
Dont run, run, run

Working, working, work all day
Working, working, no time to play
Working all my days away
Working is the only way ---

Days go quick but never end
I liked it more as just pretend
Will I ever see my friends?
Theyre gone, gone, gone.

Pennies pinched but nothing saved
Will I ever make the grain?
Eight more days til I get paid
Why run, run, run?

Working, working, work all day
Working, working, no time to play
Working all my days away
Working is the only way ---

Trinkets gone, faces change
Shops are closed, replacements made
Some things still remain the same
We run, run, run

Wake one day, not much to do
The kids are grown, no one but you
No one cares how much youve earned
Youre done, done, done.

Working, working, work all day
Working, working, no time to play
Working all my days away
Working is the only way ------Lyrics submitted by Nina.
