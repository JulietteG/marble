He's not mad at you 
He's not disappointed
His grace is greater still
then all of your wrong choices
He is full of mercy, He is ever-kind
hear His invitation 
His arms are open wide

You can come as you are
with all your broken pieces
all your shameful scars
the pain you hold in your heart
bring it all to Jesus
You can come as you are

Louder than the voice 
that whispers "you're unworthy"
hear the sound of love
that tells a different story 
shattering your darkness
pushing through the lies
how tenderly He calls you 
His arms are open wide

You can come as you are
with all your broken pieces 
all your shameful scars 
the pain you hold in your heart
bring it all to Jesus
You can come as you are
You can come as you are....---Lyrics submitted by Brenna.
