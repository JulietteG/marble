I tried to hide from you
But i failed
I tried to lie to you
About how i felt
And even in my darkest time
You gave me light
I never knew this kinda love could feel so right
When i'm in your arms
I find myself believe it
We could be anywhere
So i can keep on dreaming

Chorus
Whenever your close to me, you`re like the sun
You feel like the sun
And everyday you telling me
I am the one
I am the one who makes you shine

And i know
Whenever you want me to, i'll go
And even when your not with me
I feel you there
I only have to look and see
And i'll know where
When i'm holding you
The world can stop it's turning
You`re always gonna pull me through
And i won't be returning

Chorus
Whenever your close to me, your like the sun
You feel like the sun
And everyday you`re telling me
I am the one
I am the one who makes you shine

You`re like the sun
You keep me warm
You`re telling me

When i'm in your arms
We can be anywhere (2x)

Chorus
Whenever your close to me, you`re like the sun
You feel like the sun
And everyday you`re telling me
I am the one
I am the one who makes you shine (2x)

Your like the sun (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Hanna.
