I know that things are getting tougher 
When you can't get the top off the bottom of the barrel 
Wide open road of my future now 
It's looking fucking narrow 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 

We get told to decide 
Just like as if I'm not gonna change my mind 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 

Whatcha gonna do with yourself 
Boy better make up your mind 
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy 
You're running out of time 

This time I got it all figured out 

All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 
All I know is that I don't know 
All I know is that I don't know nothin 

And that's fine---Lyrics submitted by cid.
