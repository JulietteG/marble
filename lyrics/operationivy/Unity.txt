There's a war goin' down between my brothers tonight,
I don't want no war goin' down, goin' down tonight.

Stop this war!
Stop this war!

Civilization? Ha! I call it as I see it.
I call it bullshit! You know, I still cannot believe it
Our evolution now has gone the way of hate
A world evolved resolved into its stupid fate.

Stop this war!
Stop this war!

All so different yeah, I say we're all the same
All caught, you know, in the division game.
Self destruction fast impending like a bullet.
No one can stop it, once it's fired, no one can control it.

Stop this war!
Stop this war!

A final word, wait it's not a call to action
We ain't no sect, we ain't no fucking faction.
Unity, Unity, you've heard it all before,
This time it's not exclusive we want to stop a war.

Stop this war!
Stop this war!

Ain't nothin' wrong, with another unity song
Ain't nothin' wrong, with another unity song
Ain't nothin' wrong with a unity song!
Ain't nothin' wrong with a unity song!
Ain't nothin' wrong with a unity song!
Ain't nothin' wrong with a unity song!

Stop this war!
Stop this war!

Unity as one, stand together,
Unity, evolution's gonna come!
Unity as one, stand together,
Unity, evolution's gonna come!
Unity as one, stand together,
Unity, evolution's gonna come!
Unity as one, stand together,
Unity, evolution's gonna come!
Unity as one, stand together,
Unity, evolution's gonna come!---Lyrics submitted by russ.
