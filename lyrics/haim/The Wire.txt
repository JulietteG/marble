You know I'm bad at communication, it's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said, it's the most important part that relationships will go through
And I'd give it all away just so I could say that
I know I know I know I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

You know there's no rhyme or reason for the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind. not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say it but I can't bear to stay and
I just know I know I know I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled him when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled him when I came down to the wire

Does your imagination try to make you what you wanted to be
Because I'm sorry I do what I did, but it came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
Well I know I know I know I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Well I try to keep myself together, after all the opportunities
I try to stay true to you and try to do what you wanted for me
And I'd give it all away just to hear you say that
Well I know I know I know I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
Ooh yeah

Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire
Always keep your heart locked tight, don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
But I just couldn't take it, I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt great, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah
No no no no
It felt right
It felt right
It felt right
No no no no
But I fumbled and when I came down to the wire ---
