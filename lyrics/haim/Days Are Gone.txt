And I got back up
When I lost control over it all, over it all
And I knew that I couldn't take no more
'Cause I want it all, I want it all
All the times I've said it
All the times I've said it before
Those days are gone
'Cause you didn't know how
And I know that now
I want it all, I want it all

Felt like I was walking on a tight rope
Those days are gone, those days are gone
Sometimes I wish I didn't miss you at all
Those days are gone
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Those days are gone
And now I'm waiting for the day to dawn
Those days are gone

I remember when you found it hard to give
But I gave it all, I gave you my all
You only took one side
When all my hopes ran dry
Those dreams are gone, gone all along
All the times I said it
All the times I've said it before
I'm moving on
You can have my past, I'll never get that back
I'm moving on, 'cause those days are gone

Felt like I was walking on a tight rope
Those days are gone, those days are gone
Sometimes I wish I didn't miss you at all
Those days are gone
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Those days are gone
And now I'm waiting for the day to dawn
Those days are gone

Days are gone, days are gone, ha
Days are gone, days are gone, ha
All my love that I can't hide
All my love now you can't find it

Days are gone, days are gone, ha
Days are gone, days are gone, ha
All my love that I can't hide
All my love now you can't find it

Days are gone, days are gone, ha
Days are gone, days are gone, ha
All my love that I can't hide
All my love now you can't find it

Days are gone, days are gone, ha
Days are gone, days are gone, ha
All my love that I can't hide
All my love now you can't find it

Those days are gone, those days are gone
Those days are gone, holding on,
Holding on, holding on
Those days are gone
Those days are gone---
