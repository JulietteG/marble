Hey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all.
You tried to see.
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me.
It isn't fair, to have your way,
To try and get up and go and na na na na now can't you see,
It isn't fair to have your way,
But I'm trying to get your attention and I need you to know that.

Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game.
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way.
If you go, now I know, I know know know.

Forever we tried to make it right,
Together we saw the end in sight,
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.

Forever I see you and me,
Forever I'll try for you and I,
No I never believed in their insight,
Just another good reason to get it right.

I don't want to turn around,
So come on baby,
Come on and try to let it out,
Let go.
We're still the same,
So come on baby,
Trigger the sound, lets figure it out,
Let's get back to where we started out.

Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game.
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way.
If you go, now I know, I know know know.

Forever we tried to make it right,
Together we saw the end in sight,
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.

Forever I see you and me,
Forever I'll try for you and I,
No I never believed in the reason,
Just another good reason to get a ride.

Go go go go get out, get out of my memory,
No no no not tonight, I don't have the energy.

Go go go go get out, get out of my memory,
No no no not tonight, oh not tonight, oh not tonight.

Forever we tried to make it right,
Together we saw the end in sight,
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.

Forever I see you and me,
Forever I'll try for you and I,
No I never believed in their insight,
Just another good reason to get it right.

Forever we tried to make it right,
Together we saw the end in sight,
I'm tired of fighting the good fight,
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye.

Forever I see you and me,
Forever I'll try for you and I,
No I never believed in their insight,
Just another good reason to get it right.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
