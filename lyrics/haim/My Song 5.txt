I found it hard, tried to reserve 
I'll get it right when I am heard 
(Hot for me) 
The man's his own 
(Hot for me) 
To her he'll go 
(Hot for me) 
But I'll be fine 
(Hot for me) 
'Cause I know 

He's in her heart, on the floor thinkin than I'll never know 
I'll be up going through crazy shit I did for you 
In my mind, in my head seeing all the words unsaid 
Honey honey I am never coming home again 

I've been lied to 
So what's the truth? 
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in all from you 
I've been dying to know what you tried 
You've been lying so 
Honey I'm not your honey pie 

He's in her heart, on the floor thinkin that I'll never know 
I'll be up going through crazy shit I did for you 
In my mind, in my head seeing all the words unsaid 
Honey honey I am never coming home again 

If you want to see me baby please 
Been holding on for eternity 
Say you only want me 
Missing you never led to much of anything 

If you wanna know, if you wanna show 
How it means, what it seems, seems to be, 
Held by a thread, tried to forget 
But I'll never let it go 
Honey I'm not your honey pie 

Tried to lie, dying to hear all lies 
Trying to 
Tried to lie, dying to hear all lies 
Trying 

He's in her heart, on the floor thinkin than I'll never know 
I'll be up going through crazy shit I did for you 
In my mind, in my head seeing all the words unsaid 
Honey honey I am never coming home again 

I've been lied to 
So what's the truth? 
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in all from you 
I've been dying to know what you tried 
You've been lying so 
Honey I'm not your honey pie---
