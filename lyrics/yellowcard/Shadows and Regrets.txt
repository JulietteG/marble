*I'm back, back in town, and everything has changed
I feel, feel let down, the faces stayed the same
I see, see shadows, of who we used to be
When I drive, drive so slow, Through this memory.

When we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest

I heard, heard myself, say things I take back
If I could, could retell, and make these stories last
I see, see shadows, of who we'll always be
When I drive, drive these roads, they made our memories

When we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest

The shadows and regrets
And let go of the rest

Everything has changed (everything has changed)
Faces stayed the same (faces stayed the same)
Everything has changed (everything has changed)
Faces stayed the same

When we were only kids
And our time couldn't end
And how tall did we stand
With the world in our hands

And we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest

The shadows and regrets
And let go of the rest
The shadows and regrets
And let go of the rest*---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
