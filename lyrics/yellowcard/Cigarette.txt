Watching the days burning out like a cigarette, just a few drags to go.
Built me up and broke me down somehow.
Everything just seemed so clear to me, nothing left to know
I'll love you right and I'll love you pure, right now

How can you say, that it's too late
To save us now

And I would wait for you, if you would wait for me
And I will wait for you, if you will wait for me

Intoxicated the edge is serrated, so easily torn from the core
I blushed the first time, but you blushed the last time my eyes in your mind
regenerated these feelings of hatred, I long for your love evermore
You built me up and you broke me down this time.---Lyrics submitted by David.
