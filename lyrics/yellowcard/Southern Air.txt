I've watched the world go by outside a window
I still can't believe where I am now

It's been forever long
Adventures come and gone and I'm left alone
When I'm let down

'Cause I have found a gravity, a voice that pulls me to my knees
Telling me "Remember where you're from"

[Chorus]
This southern air is all I need
Breathe it in and I can see
Canvases behind my eyes 
All the colors of my life
This southern air is in my lungs
It's in every word I've sung
Seems the only truth I know
This will always be home

I've thought about the day 
When I could truly say I'm better now
Well here I am

'Cause I have let this gravity grab a hold and carry me
And I will not forget where I am from
Forget where I am from

[Chorus]

Always be home, always be home

The sun lays down inside the ocean
I'm right where I belong
Feel the air, the salt on my skin
The future comin' on

And after living through these wild years
And coming out alive
I just wanna lay my hand here
Stop running for awhile

[Chorus]

Always be home, always be home
(This will always be home)

This southern air is in my lungs
It's in every word I've sung
Seems the only truth I know
This will always be home---
