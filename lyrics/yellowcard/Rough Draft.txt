Like a Saturday Night I'll Be Gone
Like a Saturday Night I'll be gone before you knew that I was there

So you wrote it down 
I'm supposed to care
Even though it's never there
Sorry if I'm not prepared

Is it hard to see the things you substitute?
For me and all my thoughts of you
It's eating me alive to leave you

Maybe it's childish 
And maybe it's wrong
But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song
Maybe it's childish 
And maybe it's wrong

Don't wanna be don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me 
in lieu of this song
Don't wanna be don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me 
in lieu of this, lieu of this song

I'm breathing in your skin tonight
Quiet is my loudest cry
Wouldn't wanna wake the eyes
that make me melt inside

And if it's healthier to leave you be
May your sickness come and set me free
Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me

(Humming Part)

I'm Finding my own words my own little stage
My own epic drama my own scripted page
Send you the rough draft Ill seal it with tears
Maybe youll read it and Ill reappear

From the start it was shaky
And the characters rash
A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last
All I have deep inside to overcome this desire
Are friendly intentions and fair-weather smiles

And I dont wanna be, dont wanna be wrong
Youre leaving me, youre leaving me 
in lieu of this song
Dont wanna be dont wanna be wrong
Youre leaving me youre leaving me
in lieu of this, lieu of this song

Like Saturday night Ill be gone
Like Saturday night Ill be gone
Like Saturday night Ill be gone
Like Saturday night Ill be gone
before you knew that I was there---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
