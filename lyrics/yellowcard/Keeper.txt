I wanna love, I wanna leave.
I want you to love me, I want you to leave me.
I wanna stand where I can see.
I'm watching you love me, I'm watching you leaving me now...

I wish I could be somebody else,
I wish I could see,
You and myself.
I wish there was something inside me,
To keep you beside me and say
What you really feel, 
You know I need something that's real,
I wish there was something inside me,
To keep you beside me.

I wanna know if I could be,
Someone to turn to that could never hurt you.
But I know what you think of me,
Yeah you had a break through,
And now I'm just bad news for you.

I wish I could be somebody else,
I wish I could see,
You and myself.
I wish there was something inside me,
To keep you beside me and say
What you really feel, 
You  know I need something that's real,
I wish there was something inside me,
To keep you beside me.

I should've told you everything,
I never gave you anything,
I should've told you everything
If I could give you anything
Than I would tell you everything

I wish I could be somebody else,
I wish I could see,
You and myself.
I wish there was something inside me,
To keep you beside me and say
What you really feel,
You know I need somehting that's real,
I wish there was something insie me,
to keep you beside me.

I should've told you everything, 
I should've told you everything,
I should've told you everything...---Lyrics submitted by Gregory.
