You sat me down beside myself
To show me all the reasons I was wrong for you
Was this for real
It's hard to tell
Cause it was such a beautiful mess
We had got into.

I'm gonna overcome this
Paper hearts can't win this time.
And all along I should have known this
Wasn't your dream 
It was mine

I know you wanted me
To give up this life to be
Everything I was back when you 
Had the hands my heart was in

I was never good at goodbye

Can I swallow this bottlehole
So this brain in my head
Can forget your face

When we were starting out
You beleived in me without a doubt
You were the finest thing
To happen to a boy like me

It's so much harder now
I wanna try and tell you how
There is so much love in me
Even though it's hard to see

and I was never good at goodbye

Can I swallow this bottlehole
So this brain in my head 
Can forget your face
Can I swallow this bottlehole
Cause I'd rather be dead
Than make more mistakes

Today I couldn't stay awake
Feels like I'm drowning in this 
Firewater Lake
I won't be sleepin' much tonight
It's not the same without you
Lying by my side

Right beside me

Can I swallow this bottlehole
So this brain in my head 
Can forget your face
Can I swallow this bottlehole
Cause I'd rather be dead 
Than make more mistakes

Can I swallow this bottlehole
Can I swallow this bottlehole
Can I swallow this botllehole
So this brain in my head 
Can forget your face

You left me here beside myself
Left me with all the reasons I was wrong for you.---Lyrics submitted by Molly.
