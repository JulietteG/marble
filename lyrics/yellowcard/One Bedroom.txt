Stay the night
Touch the sky with me
We can live like we have forever
Spend your days
Watch the waves with me
We can love like we are forever

You're the light from the Moon tonight
You're the one for the rest of time

What good could I do
In a life without you?
What more could I lose
Than what I found in you?
In you...
In you...

When you're gone
You belong with me
'cause you know that we are forever
Take your time
To realize, you'll see
We will always be here forever

You're the light from the Moon tonight
You're the history I will write
You're the last stop and I arrive
You're the one for the rest of time

What good could I do
In a life without you?
What more could I lose
Than what I found in you?
What words could I use
To tell all this to you?
What verse could I choose
To give myself to you?
To you...
To you...

I wanna love with you
And live
Yeah
Live like here forever
