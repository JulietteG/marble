If I could write to the kid I was before
I'd tell him you'll get everything you ever wanted
But still want more

Someone's gonna tell you who you should want to be
So you'll forget division that they didn't wanna see
And when they give up, 'cause they will give up
Say "Here I am alive"

[Chorus]

They say you don't grow up, you just grow old
It's safe to say I haven't done both
I made mistakes I know, I know
But here I am alive
So many people close to me cut me down
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped I fell I hit the ground
But here I am alive

If I could write to myself when I was on top of it all
I'd say you're going overboard and when you're falling
You're gonna feel so small

Someone's gonna tell you that you deserve the worst
They say you're never coming back and tell you that you're cursed
But when they give up 'cause they always give up
Say "Here I am alive"

[Chorus]

And when they give up 'cause they will give up
Say "Here I am alive"
And when they give up 'cause they always give up
Say "Here I am alive"

[Chorus]

Here I am alive [x8]

If I could write to the kid I was before...---
