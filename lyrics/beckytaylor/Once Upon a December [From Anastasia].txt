Dancing bears, Painted wings
Things i almost remember
And a song someone sings
Once upon a December

Someone holds me safe and warm
Horses prance through a silver storm
Figures dancing gracefully
Across my memory

(aaaaaa with melody)

Someone holds me safe and warm
Horses prance through a silver storm
Figures dancing gracefully
Across my memory

Far away, Long ago
Glowing dim as an ember
Things my heart  used to know
Things it yearns to remember
And a song someone sings
Once upon a december---Lyrics submitted by jaqueline.
