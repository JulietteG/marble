Ask me do I want this
I say do birds fly
Ask me do I feel it
I feel it tonight
If you ask me where the past is
I left it behind
And I'll just try to show you every side

When you're a star
And you looking up at the stars
It just looks like Venus or Mars
Let's make this universe ours
Gravity is holding us down
So let's turn this planet around
Oh, don't you worry about how
Can't nothing stop us now

If birds fly, so can I
I got a heartbreak dawn rising in my sky
And it's so beautiful
I just might cry watching birds fly

Go on ask me
Do I love you?
I'll say the sunshine
Ask me, and I'll tell you
You know I can't lie

Fly, fly
Fly, fly
Just might cry watching them fly
Fly, fly
Fly, fly
While I touch the sky
Fly, fly
Fly, fly
While I touch the sky
Fly, fly
Fly, fly---
