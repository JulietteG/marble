(feat. Joey Dale & Luciana)

Falling like dominoes
Reaching for the stars, one by one
Hands illuminate the sky
Goes on, and on, and on

Let me take you, all the away
I'll guide you trough the night
Come shine your light, a little brighter
Set your fire, afraid inside

Are your ready? Await it
Come in way, enjoy the ride
I'll take you, all the away
Find the answer, in Arcadia
Arcadia in Arcadia, Arcadia ---
