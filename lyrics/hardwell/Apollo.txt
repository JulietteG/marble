(feat. Amba Shepherd) 

Just one day in the life
So I can understand
Fighting just to survive
But you taught me I can

We are the lucky ones
We are, we are
Oh we are the lucky ones
We are, we are

Just one day in the life
So I can understand
Fighting just to survive
But you taught me I can

We are the lucky ones
We are, we are
Oh we are the lucky ones
We are, we are

We are the lucky ones
We are, we are
Oh we are the lucky ones
We are, we are---
