Trough the milky way
In my spaceship
At the speed of light
I' m gonna make it
I know you' ve been expecting me
Turn on the camera' s take another scene
We go like hands up people get with the show
We' re taking over people lose control
And that' s my DJ reaching my soul
And for the stars my people we never fall

Yes i' m an alien
When i' m touching the earth
Call me a spaceman
When i travel universe
Yes i' m an alien
When i' m touching the earth
Call me a spaceman
When i travel universe
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
