Trough the milky way 
In my spaceship 
At the speed of light 
I'm gonna make it 
I know you've been expecting me 
Turn on the camera' s take another scene 
We go like hands up people get with the show 
We' re taking over people lose control 
And that' s my DJ reaching my soul 
And for the stars my people we never fall 

Yes I'm an alien 
When I'm touching the earth 
Call me a spaceman 
When I travel universe 
Yes I'm an alien 
When I'm touching the earth 
Call me a spaceman 
When I travel universe 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 

Trough the milky way 
In my spaceship 
At the speed of light 
I'm gonna make it 
I know you've been expecting me 
Turn on the camera's take another scene 
We go like hands up people get with the show 
We' re taking over people lose control 
And that' s my DJ reaching my soul 
And for the stars my people we never fall 

Yes I'm an alien 
When I'm touching the earth 
Call me a spaceman 
When I travel universe 
Yes I'm an alien 
When I'm touching the earth 
Call me a spaceman 
When I travel universe 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman 
Call me a spaceman---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
