Drag my hand behind you like a chain behind a truck
Sparks over your carpet while I chase you through the darkness
Somebody's supposed to fall in love
But nobody even calls

Somebody's supposed to tear this place apart
Until you find me hiding
Silently I wait
You'll be excited just to see me someday 
Everything's okay

Summer and gold throw their colors at the dark
A mother tell her son, darling look at the sparks
You hold my attention without even trying
A beautiful reflection from firework eyes
But never mean forever
Desperation, and hanging in the backyard at night

Somebody's supposed to fall in love
Tear this place apart until you find me hiding
Silently I wait
You'll be excited just to see me someday
Everything's okay

Don't forget to bleed so slowly
Haunted hearts we melt over the fabric of your floor
I'm holding her just likes shes gold
But I've been running from the sun 
Oh no no
And if I ever catch the ones who hurt you
I, I'm hoping that god looks away this time
So, why would I let you go

Tear this place apart until you find me hiding
Silently I wait
You'll be excited just to see me someday
Everything's okay! ---Lyrics submitted by Lexi.
