If you wanted to set me free
Why the fuck wouldn't you say something?
See I was just over 17.
Made of poison,
Cave in free. 
Oh no please don't abandon me.
Mother,
Father I love you so,
But this is just me disguised as me.
I'm the killer who burned your home.
This is the Street Youth rising up!---Lyrics submitted by Alea Martin.
