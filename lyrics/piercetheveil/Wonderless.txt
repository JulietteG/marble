i don't care 
if your beautiful lips exist out there
cause i'm wonderless
why the best can't make it in hollywood no more

it's like a long darg taken
before the smake hits the white sky
like the birds at night 
and it's fake jsut like the movies, oh, yeah

and i can't wait just to see you again
and your two faces are locked on mine
had the worst time chasing the thought away
oh hope
(oh. no home)

cause maybe im fake 
mayber you're to blame, maybe i'm a star
(stumbling drunk light}
my mistakes i've made won't leave me alone' oh no

and if you don't find me on the frount page
find a way to say that you saw me 
and if you don't find me in a movie
find a way to say that you knew me 

and if you don't find me on the frount page
(you an di got lost on the way)
find a way to say that you saw me
(but this will end someday, some way)
and if you don't  find me at all
then i won't care

oh, yea

if i could find a place for the holiday
maybe i would call, you're a pay phone away
from this mess that i've become
i'm destroying
what i love---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
