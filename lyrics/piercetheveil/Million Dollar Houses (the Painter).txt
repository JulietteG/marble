So what if I was just a painter
painting houses on the rich blue coast?
Would you ever try to leave me
for somebody who deserves you most?
'Cause darling I am just a painter.
I'm painting houses for the rich old folks.
I'm gonna make a million dollars,
'cause nobody's gonna steal you, no,
For diamonds and gold.
For diamonds and gold.

'Cause I've broken bones for you, and for you only.
I make money but we just can't keep this home.
Give me your heart and your hand and we can run!
We can run, we can run baby, run now.
We can run baby, run.

She's like a bullet through an ocean,
I still remember how you moved so slow.
You tried to kill me with a shotgun.
Bang! Now we're even
We don't stop till someone's bleeding.
(We don't stop till someone's bleeding)

'Cause I've broken bones for you, and for you only.
I make money but we just can't keep this home.
Give me your heart and your hand and we can run!
We can run, we can run baby, run now.
We can run baby, run baby, you're my hope.

Permanently yours.
Sometimes the moon looks brighter than the sun.
As times like this run up my wrist,
she hates all of the guts and blood.
Splash around with me while we move like flames on burning sheets.
And your doctor won't stop calling me her medication.

But baby no, sometimes things don't work out the way we planned.
To live is just to fall asleep,
to die is to awaken.
Maybe we're meant to lose the ones we love,
but I'll fight for you till then.
And if they stole you from me,
on my arm there's a tattoo of your name.

I've broken bones for you, and for you only.
I make money, but fuck money we want love.
Give me your heart and your hand and we can run!---Lyrics submitted by ANA.
