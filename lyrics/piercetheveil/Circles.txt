Listen, do you hear my heart beat thump over the monitors?
You pretend to close your eyes
Don't breathe in
Pieces of candy and leaks of light (leaks of light)
Paint the floor 'round me
Then without hesitating (hesitating)

You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running
There's no place to go
Another bullet and we both started running
Both started running too
Save yourself, don't ever look back
Nowhere to go and so we both spin around in circles

Creeping through these labyrinths I find
Another dead end to the weekend
But is this real life?
Paper hearts turned ash begin to fly
Over our heads I begin
Screaming while the exit signs read "Heaven's waiting"

You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running
There's no place to go
And now they're pulling and we both started running
Both started running too
Save yourself don't ever look back
Nowhere to go so we both spin around in circles

And I said, "Hey, what's on your mind?"
I think about my life without you and I start to cry
And I said, "Hey, it's alright"
We'll make it
I love you and I'll never leave your side

You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running
There's no place to go
And now they're pulling and we both started running
Both started running too
Save yourself don't ever look back
Nowhere to go and so we both spin around in circles, circles
Ohhh lets go!

Circles---
