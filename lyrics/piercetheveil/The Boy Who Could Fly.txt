Freeze
It's time to take you home
It feels so early
But i promised that i would bring you to your door
Now your lips are numb
As we walk sharing warm alchol
That kiss taste like summer
I hope you like the stars
I stole for you
One hundred twinkle lights
In neon blue

I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest
You'll see

Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing
A perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon
Dreams of sun

Now as the rain falls
Like shattered pieces of glass from the sky
We bleed like water colors
And drunken pastels down the stair ways
And i asked myself
"Why do i still pray"
(when will it end)
And who fucking cares

And i swear to god
I did what I could
I practically begged you
I pretended 
Everything was fine
A soul sacrafice
An American nightmare
I'd rather be dead

Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing
A perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon
Hears a nightmare
In his head

I'll bet you money
As you're running to the bathroom
You barely started drinking
But your beauty never stopped you
You died in California
By the sulfur and the sea
I guess i never should've loved you
But i do forever
Because you loved me
And i'll break my glasses
As i fall in the street
If you're gonna leave this would
How could it be without me
Now it's all over my tounge
And still it has no taste
Because without you
There is no me
There's no me
At all
Sometimes love
Love dies
Dies like a
Love dies like a DOG
So why don't we just let this one take care of itself

Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing
A perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon
Dreams 
Don't rain on my parade
Woah -oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-no-oh-oh-oh
I'm losing a perfect thing
A perfect thing
A perfect thing---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
