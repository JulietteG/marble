oh no, here we go again
i like to recieve
what the earth and sea had thought
it'd be best not to even give me, even give me 

now you say, that i never bother you the way he did
(now open your eyes)
now i saw the moon divorce the sky
it that what it's like
(dont run)

spell out, spell out spell out to me babe

so every week we'll meet
a bed for a backseat
a love drunk memory
(but such a beautiful routine)

now you say, that i never bother you the way he did 
(now open eyes)
now i jsut saw the moon divorce the sky, tonight

this remendy is wose then the disease
and slowly killing me 

we like the run our blood thin 
and laugh at the things we never did
we like to run out blood thin
and laugh at things

we say, say, hello
we say, say, hello
we say, say, hello
we say, say

now you say were better off that way
now i saw the moon divorce the sky
is this what it's like?---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
