well, you know that i'm cold
black on constellations gold
and you know that your soul's
black top under-lacing won't let it go 

it was all for you, all for you and more
she wont chace him anymore

to the end, never leave
fall asleep on the first i face, oh
and they say, play the game, oh
you and me found love
lost under the shade

well you know i'm a ghost
pull the note out of ym throat
and leave me alone

but it was all for you, all for you an more
he won't take her anymore

to the end, never leave
fall asleep on the first i face, oh
and they say, play the game, oh
you and me found love
lost under the shade

come back to my heart
come back to my heart
come back to my heart tonight

come back to my heart
(i don't care)
come back to my heart
(i don't care)
come back to my heart, tonight---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
