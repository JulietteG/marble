I cannot spend another night in this home
I close my eyes and take a breath real slow
The consequence is if I leave Im alone
But whats the difference when you beg for love

As I run through the glass in the street
Kerosene hearts carry the name that my father gave me
And take the face of the wolf

Cause this is a wasteland my only retreat
With heaven above you theres hell over me

I met a girl who never looked so alone
Like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm
She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue
We fell in love and now we're both alone

Cause I dont need anymore friends
Another kiss just like a fire on pavement
We'll burn it down to the end 

This is a wasteland my only retreat
With heaven above you theres hell over me
The water is rusted the air is unclean
And then for a second I feel fine
But this is a wasteland my only retreat

Ive waited all this night to honor you and say
I know its hard but who are you to fall apart on me
On me

This is a wasteland my only retreat
With heaven above you theres hell over me
This is a wasteland my only retreat
With heaven above you theres hell over me

Said what about us well what about me
Hang from the gallows asleep in the rain
This is a wasteland my only retreat
Paralyze me dont let me jump dont let me fall---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
