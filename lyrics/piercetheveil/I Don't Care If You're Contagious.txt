Bury me in the bedroom where I,
I can sing you to sleep all night.
Put me next to the open window,
promise me a second time.
'Cause I don't want to leave without you buried by my side.
I'd rather kill the one responsible for falling stars at night,
'cause they fall all around me.
The night can be deadly.

And they'll never take us alive.
(Can you chase away the darkness?)
To live in love and die.
Last night she recited every reason she's fine.
So if we're heading there together at the same time,
you sing while I drive.

Move like a fugitive tonight.
Dance on the ambulance,
'cause I would rather spend my life
vacations in bed with you like drunken summer kites.
And this is only a test,
sober and scaring me to death.

They'll never take us alive.
(Can you chase away the darkness?)
To live in love and die.

And I don't care if you're sick,
I don't care if you're contagious.
I would kiss you even if you were dead.
Would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life?
'Cause I'd do anything to hold your hand.
And I don't care if you're sick,
I don't care if you're contagious.
Oh, no.
Would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life?
'Cause I'd do anything, anything, anything.

They'll never take us alive,
'cause I'll chase away the darkness.
I'll live in love and die.
I joined the party for the recently blind.
So if we're heading there together you can sing all night.

I'm gonna tear out the thread one by one from your skin
'till your bones feel embarrassed by all the attention.
Kiss me while I drive.---Lyrics submitted by Bianca.
