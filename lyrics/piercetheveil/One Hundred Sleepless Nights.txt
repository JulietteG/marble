I can't wait to see your brilliant face
Light up the room around the pillowcase
She said, can you come over to my LA place
I got something to tell you and it just can't wait
You showed up, You held the door in tears,
Sat on the couch under the chandelier.
You said you're having a baby and before I could cry
You're leaving me just when I thought you were mine.

But I don't see your face, taken by the one hearted race
Oh no, don't tell your other man
I got a hell of a plan

Failing lights
Amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there is a beast in my heart and it won't let you leave alive

Nightmares
No longer wait for sleep
Crawl on the ground on both your hands and knees
Just like a, lion and you're the queen of the pride
And we will feast together till the bones are dry.

But I don't see your face, taken by the one hearted race
Oh now, don't tell your other man.
I got a hell of a plan

Failing lights
Amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there is a beast in the heart and it won't let you leave alive

Do you still love me? I am dying to know.
Or did you forget what we shared.
Out of sight out of mind I was never even there

Failing lights
Amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there is a beast in the heart and it won't let you leave Alive

This is the price you'll pay
Thoughts in your head that will never die.

Don't you forget what we had
It's like I was never even there.
