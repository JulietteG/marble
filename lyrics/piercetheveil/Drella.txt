you're busy drawing hearts
you run your fingers down the glass, an open mirror
now you're sleeping in the frount seat
like a crushed leaf on the consrete night

mudering
what are you talking about?
murdering
and how did you get into my house?

i think that you buried me too deep
you had your way
you almost seem alive

but i've been thinking driving through you around
i didn't think it could have lasted
now we broke another bracelet
tore it off your wrist tonight

tonight the center of the sun
will separate into saparks 
they're climbing up the sky
down the dark

do you think you'd better love me back?
you said, you want what i want because nobody's around when i talk
it feels better to fall asleep alone

because that's the only way i know
but i've been driving through you around
i didn't you could have lasted
now we broke another bracelet
tore it off your wrist tonight

and now that cinderella'a gone
she swollowed up the sun
a midle class explosing could be nice
it we're the dynamite

don't you miss me or the night
we snuck out your window
oh, because baby, baby, you're so crazy now
looks like i'm not the only one now

i can finally see that light 
oh, there'a a million stars tonight

a single one could save my life
red water leaves us as we collide
Drella, Drella
red water leaves us, i just drive---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
