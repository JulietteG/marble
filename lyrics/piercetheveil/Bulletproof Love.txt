I'll breathe you in with smoke in the backyard light.
We used to laugh until we choked, into the wasted nights
It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone.
So don't, don't, don't wake me up, 'cause my thrill is gone.
Say I'm wrong in the sunset turning red behind the smoke.
Forever and alone.
Yeah.

You've gone and sewn me to this bed.
The taste of you and me will never leave my lips again,
Under the blinding rain.
I wanna hold your hand so tight, I'm gonna break my wrists.
And when the vultures sing tonight, I'm gonna join right in.

I'll sing along, oh.
Because I don't know any other song.
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on.
No, I'm barely hanging on.
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone.
And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon.

This isn't fair, no, don't you try to blame this on me.
My love for you was bulletproof, but your the one who shot me.
And god dammit, I can barely say your name.
So, I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink.
Woah. Oh.
But, don't just say it, you should sing my name.
Pretend that it's a song because forever, it's yours.
And we can sing this on the way home.

I'll sing along, oh.
'Cause I don't know any other song.
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on.
No, I'm barely hanging on.
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone.
But, there's nothing to do, but tear my voice apart.
There's nothing to do, but scream at the drunken moon---Lyrics submitted by ANA.
