Choke try to wash it down with something strong
Try but the taste of blood remains
Cold empty mattresses and falling stars
My how they start to look the same

So keep in happiness ad torture me 
While I tell you lets go in style
A million hooks around a million ways to die
Darling its cold outside

No no more eyes to see the sun
You slide into bed while I get drunk
Slow conversations with a gun
Mean more than Ive ever said to anyone

So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you lets go in style
A million hooks around a million ways to die
Darling lets go inside it'll be alright

But last night 
You said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
Almost fought some bitch at the club
Got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes well
Fuck what am I supposed to be impressed
You're just another set of bones to lay to rest
Its time to say goodnight hope you had a really good time
Good time

I will soon forget the color of your eyes
And youll forget mine

So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you lets go in style
A million hooks around a million ways to die
Lets go outside it'll be alright

But last night
You said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
