wake up
a voice hits the air on a lonely coast
and ill sing along like a prayer for you
i can dream up the words

i'll never see your face again

if we wake at 
if we wake at all 
she sings to me 

if we wake at
if we wake at all
if we wake at all
try

we'll try to change
they say love will never mean a thing
still out hearts beat, so come on

so stuck on the thing that we know
what we know starts to waste

if we wake at 
if we wake at all 
she sings to me 
(can we be sure)

if we wake 
if we wake at all 
oh, my god---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
