Well, don't you say that I had a part of it
I guess we'll never know
Or would you say that I had a part of it?
Well, I guess we'll never know

Constant recovery
I see you choke and it takes my breath away

But all is good, we close our eyes
They all accept the lie

So bury what you are outside
Brother, promise you won't leave me

I know you're tortured within
And your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander, my friend

Will somebody believe this is suicide?
Am I the only one that thinks that you should stay alive?
Oh, I became the shame that you backed up on the ropes to arm yourself and hide.

And so I scream, "Mayday, I'm in trouble, send somebody on the double."

Scratching at the floor inside my mind.
They all accept the lie.

So bury what you are outside
Brother, please don't be afraid of me.

I know you're tortured within
And your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander, my friend

I let you down
And I started to run
Never meant to be your pain.
Oh my god, what have I become?

Show me and show me the way back
Show me the way back home

I know you're tortured within
And your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander, my friend
No, I'll never wander again

This is not what I want,
But now it's what I need

Can I just have one more taste
Just to make it through the day?
You're tangled in
You're tangled in the great escape

(Can I just have one more taste?)
Great escape, oh

I never meant to hurt nobody, no, no, yeah
I never meant to hurt you, no, no, no, no
I only meant to do this to myself, to myself, to myself

Escape
Great escape
Great escape
Oh, great escape

Let me out of this, yeah
Let me out of this, yeah ---
