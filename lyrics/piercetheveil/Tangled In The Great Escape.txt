Dont you say that had a part of it
Guess we'll never know
Would you say that had a part of it
Guess we'll never know

Constant recovery
I see you choke and it takes my breath away
All is good we close our eyes
They all accept the lie
So bury what you are outside
Brother promise you wont leave me

I know you're tortured within
Your eyes look hungry again
I'll never wander my friend

Well somebody believed in this suicide
Am I the only one that thinks that you should stay alive
I became the shame that you backed up on the ropes
To arm yourself and hide

So I scream mayday Im in trouble
Send somebody on the double
Scratching at the floor inside my mind
They all accept the lie
So bury what you are outside
Brother please dont be afraid of me

I know you're tortured within
Your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander my friend

I let you down and I started to run
Never meant to be your pain what have I become
Show me the way back
Show me the way back home

I know you're tortured within
Your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander my friend
I'll never wander again

This is not what I want
Its not what I need
Not what I want
Not what I want

Can I just have one more day
Just to make it through the day
I cant go back you're tangled in the great escape

Escape oh 
I never meant to hurt nobody no no yeah
I never meant to hurt you no no no oh
I only meant to do this to myself to myself to myself
Great escape great escape great escape
Great escape---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
