Sometimes we fight
Sometimes I cry
Why don't I just tell him goodbye
Sometimes I should
But sometimes I don't
Build up the strength to say that it's wrong
Sometimes I hate 
Sometimes I love
Sometimes I hurt
Sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I wait for him to change
But it's okay I disguise the pain (yeah)
And I don't want to leave him alone
They say i'm brainwashed but i'm in love with this man (yeahhh)

Keep tellin my self that it's worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare

So when will i wake up and scream 
No way No way No way No way No way No way No way

But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)

Sometimes I keep it cool
Sometimes I Let em know
Sometimes I even pack my bags to walk out the door
Sometimes I feel safe
Sometimes I really don't
Sometimes I promise that i'm ready to let em go but
I don't ever wanna leave em alone
They say i'm brainwashed but i'm in love with this man (ooooh)

Keep tellin my self that it's worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare

So when will i wake up and scream 
No way No way No way No way No way No way No way

But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)

Hoping he's changing 
But i'm scared he's not
Can't see a way to leave him
He opened my eye

Keep tellin my self that it's worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect)

Keep tellin my self that it's worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect)

So when will i wake up and scream 
No way No way No way No way No way No way No way

But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)
No way No way No way No way No way No way No way

But if it's from you I don't mind hurtin
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare, perfect nightmare)---Lyrics submitted by Linia Jackson.
