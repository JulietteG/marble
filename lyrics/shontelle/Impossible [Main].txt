(1st verse) 
I remember, years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

(chorus)
Tell them all I know now, Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the sky line, All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy, And my heart is broken
All my scars are open, Tell them what I hoped would be 
Impossible (4x)

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
And if youre done with embarrassing me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

(chorus)

Impossible (8x)       ooh, Impossible (yea yea)
