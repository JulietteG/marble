you can, think you can get free
you think you won't need me
that you're gonna somethin better   but u know that we're in this forever
and u can, think you can walk out even with your doubts
but u know we're in this together 
you can try to push me from you nothing you do can pull us apart

cause it's too late there's no escape
might as well face it, baby we're stuck with each other stuck with each other
ain't nothin you can do bout it 
it's been too long, this is too strong
cause we belong here
baby we're stuck with each other, stuck with each other
stuck in love with each other
(stuck in love with each other)

yeah
now i can say  i would not care if u were not there
tell myself that i'll be fine without ya
but I'd die if i was not around ya
and i can try to convince u 
i don't need to be with u
but my only thoughts are thoughts about u
what can i do, love is like glue
there's no way to tear our hearts apart

cause it's too late 
(too late, too late)
There's no escape, might as well face it
baby we're stuck with each other stuck with each other
ain't nothin u can do about it

(chorus)
it's been to long, this is too strong
yes we belong here
baby we're stuck with each other
stuck with eachother
stuck in love with eachother
 (stuck in love with each other)
