How did I guess you heard the rumor
From your girlfriend sister that you knew me
Heard you end up dancing closer to me
But I know I broke the rule already
She asked me if I'm single, going steady
I just turned my head, and took a step off into the dark
Standing on the block of top
Don't dance on the lights goes up there
Eats the pretty ones
We are like the art of instant fighting

Don't do the beat of the party light
Don't do the beat of the party light
There is nobody here, but your body, dear
Don't do the beat of the party light

Say you stay

I am on this morning quite destructed
The talk before it begins and all in emotion
I am leaving many people feeling worse than before
People like to drive their cars and smoke up
People like to sit inside and toka
People like to shoot up things up with fire guns and knives
I am happy to come on
Where were you when I was king in this part of town?
Now the days of glory are gone

Don't do the beat of the party light
Don't do the beat of the party light
There is nobody here, but your body, dear
Don't do the beat of the party light

Don't do the beat of the party light
Don't do the beat of the party light
There is nobody here, but your body, dear
Nobody here, but your body dear

Don't do the beat of the party light
Don't do the beat of the party light
There is nobody here, but your body, dear
Don't do the beat of the party light

Don't do the beat of the party light
Don't do the beat of the party light
There is nobody here, but your body, dear
Nobody here, but your body, dear---
