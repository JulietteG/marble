[Chorus]
Sexy Eyes, theyre so lovely, 
Sexy Eyes, make me wanna love ya
Sexy Eyes,
Girl youre lookin way cool tonight Oohh
Da da da da da, 
Ya know I got the cognac,
Da da da da da, 
And the phat bomb sack
Da da da da da, 
Your sexy eyes got me hypnotized,
Lady come and take a ride wit me

Shorty do you know the time
All I wanna do is vibe
Put you on the suga rise
Smilin wit yo pearly whites
Sexy eyes
Sexy waist 
Sexy each and every day
When I put this thang up on ya 
Sexy mama wanna marry me
But hold up now, we just met
Let me see how long you keep it wet
Hold it steady, already,
Baby girl we done did dat
Its like a stairway to paradise
When I look into your eyes, 
Mama very nice
And we can do all type of thangs
Rollin wit da whips and I like to swang
You know its nothing to a trilla though
Your sexy eyes are so spiritual

[Chorus x1]

The steelo so kamikaze
Shrinin like Liberachy
Smellin' like Burberry
Me Issey Miyake
Its goin down like gravity
Yo baby daddy mad at me
And I throw these things so handley
Cop me an assault and battery
She still wanna love me like a playboy bunny
Lookin like warm hunny
So classy and stunning
Faithfully, she waits for me
Like the real ones really do
So gracefully shes made for me 
And you know thats on the cool
Girl get your shine on like candle in the wind
Gotta keep my mind strong
When Im hammerin' within
And one look is all it took
Incredible thighs
And one look is all it took
Incredible eyes

[Chorus x1]

[x2]
Time dont wait for love
And life dont wait for a break in the weather
Its time for me and you to hook up
Lets get this thing together
