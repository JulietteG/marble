I don't need no love all I need is the DJ [2X]

[Baby Bash]
It was midnight, I got the bootie call,
She said I'm at the club,
So I threw on my draws

I'm lookin' throwed in my 'fit,
Candy coat on my whip,
The Popo's all on my tip,
But man I don't even trip

Sent me a dirty text,
So I text her back,
Scooped up the Stuey
Boy cuz he had them purple sacks

Now we gone with the wind,
Its on and poppin' again,
We rebel rockin and rollin,
This club is outta c-, outta
c-, ou-ou-ou-outta control!

She got me outta control,
She make me go crazy when she
out on the on floor
She know the DJ,
he's on Serato,
He date them models,
He crack them bottles!

[Chorus - Pitbull]
Everybody say fellas what do ladies
like money money money!
Ladies what do fellas like that
monkey monkey monkey!
Money, money,
Its outta control
She showed that monkey,
Whooo its outta control

[Baby Bash]
I'm double fistin' now, under a strobe light,
Its lookin like a movie but

its feelin so tight,
Now I got one in the cage and I
got two on the stage,
I got a waitress on the under
tryna' give me some face

They play some Lil Wayne
mixed with some T-Pain,
They matched the Journey record,
Now the dropped some Cold Play

And now they playin' my song,
The girls they showin' their thongs,
We rebel rockin and rollin,
This club is outta c-, outta
c-, ou-ou-ou-outta control!

She got me outta control,
She make me go crazy when she
out on the on floor
She know the DJ,
he's on Serato,
He date them models,
He crack them bottles!

[Chorus - Pitbull]
Everybody say fellas what do ladies
like money money money!
Ladies what do fellas like that
monkey monkey monkey!
Money, money,
Its outta control
She showed that monkey,
Whooo its outta control

I don't need no love all I need is the DJ [4x]

Outta control she he got me outta control,
She make me go crazy when she
out on the on floor
She know the DJ,
he's on Serato,
He date them models,
He crack them bottles!

[Chorus - Pitbull]
Everybody say fellas what do ladies
like money money money!
Ladies what do fellas like that
monkey monkey monkey!
Money, money,
Its outta control
She showed that monkey,
Whooo its outta control---Lyrics submitted by Raquel.
