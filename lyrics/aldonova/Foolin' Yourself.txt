I saw you walk down the street with somebody new
It's funny, people I meet they talk about me and you
But who's to blame for our being apart,  is it me or is it you
And whoever say that you're still in my heart
'Cause now really the best I can do, is say
Chorus:
So Long, it's sad to say but you're only foolin' yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only foolin' yourself
you're foolin' yourself
It's funny I couldn't see, the change you went through
All the new friends that you'd meet
And the places they took you to
And all you could say, you would say,
"They're just friends"
And you'd laugh in my face 'cause you knew
And I'd never know where you'd been late at night
So now really the best I can do, is say
Chorus:
So now you walk down the street with somebody new
It's funny, people I meet, they don't talk about me and you no more
But who was to blame for our being' apart
Was it me or was it you
And who would've said, that you were in my heart
'Cause now really the best I can do is say
