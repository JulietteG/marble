If I seem distant
Baby I am
Words are like scissors in your hands
And theres no script to follow
So I just close my eyes
That way it wont hurt so much
When we say goodbye

I feel just like an actress
Up on the stage
I cant believe
What Im hearing myself say
And the porch light is my spotlight
So I play along with this life
That way it wont hurt so much
When we say goodbye

Did you ever love me?
Does it even matter?
Did you even notice the whole world shatter?
I just want to hold you til you know Im sorry
But I just keep it all inside
That way it wont hurt so much
When we say goodbye

My heart feels like a circus
Its to much to take in
Its hard to lose love
But you were my best friend

So I walk this high wire
Alone.tonight
That way it wont hurt so much
When we say goodbye

That way it wont hurt so much
When we say goodbye ---Lyrics submitted by Irene Sapanta.
