I lay beside you; I can't sleep
And you don't even know about me
My back is turned a world away
And you don't even know 

These tears are falling
And all my life, and all this time
My love for you has added up to this
It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken


I've lost your thousand silent screams
I'm coming down this brutal mountain
I'm ready here to try again
Standing in the light from the darkness
And all my life and all my time
And all the hurting and all the working


It somehow made me stronger in the end
It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken
It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken


And all my life and all this time
And all the prayin' and all the meeting
And all the beating, it somehow makes us better in the end


It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken
It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken
It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken
It's unbroken, unbroken, unbroken---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
