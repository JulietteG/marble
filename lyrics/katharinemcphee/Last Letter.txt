I have a few words in defense of my youth
My guts are feeling an ocean or two
I was young, I didn't know what I would stumble into


I've had a lot on my mind and there were so many rules
Makes a girl crazy, makes her break a few
And there I go again acting like it's my fault
When you're to blame


It makes me happy to use you a little
Just to use you a little to write this song
It's the very last letter to an old lover
To say I'm glad you're gone


I've got snapshots of things on my mind
Though I love the past, we don't leave it behind
But I learned and now I know
And I don't need you coming around


One thing I should probably say
I got over it all and I surrendered the pain
That's the thing about mistakes
You never see 'em coming until it's too late


It makes me happy to use you a little
Just to use you a little to write this song
It's the very last letter to an old lover
To say I'm glad


Sacrifice my happiness
It's not enough to know
I'm better off the way it is


It makes me happy to use you a little
Just to use you a little to write this song
It's the very last letter to an old lover
To say I'm glad


It makes me happy to use you a little
Just to use you a little to write this song
It's the very last letter to an old lover
To say I'm glad you're gone---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
