I kind of like this game
'Cause I always played it safe
Let a bird out of its cage
It's gonna fly away


But the feel of the unknown
Has led me far away from home
I don't think I wanna go


Back to where I used to be
Like it was before
Every time you look at me
I want something more


I'm starting to shake
This perfect mistake
Could kill me any moment
But that's a chance I got to take


I'm ready to fall
Break and lose it all
We're dancing on a faultline
And that's about to give away
But I think I'm gonna stay


I just want to lie
Under burning skies
I have wished this moment
About a million times


Though it's dangerous I know
Why should I say no
I don't wanna have to go
Back to where I used to be
Like it was before
Every time you look at me


I want something more
I'm starting to shake
This perfect mistake
Could kill me any moment
But that's a chance I got to take


I'm ready to fall
Break and lose it all
We're dancing on a faultline


And that's about to give away
But I think I'm gonna stay
And every breath
Is just a breath away from heartache


And maybe I can't wait
But I still wanna breath you in
Like a summer wind


I'm starting to shake
This perfect mistake
Could kill me any moment
But that's a chance I got to take


I'm ready to fall
Break and lose it all
We're dancing on a faultline
And that's about to give away


I'm starting to shake
This perfect mistake
Could kill me any moment
But that's a chance I got to take


I'm ready to fall
Break and lose it all
We're dancing on a faultline
And that's about to give away
But I think I'm gonna stay---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
