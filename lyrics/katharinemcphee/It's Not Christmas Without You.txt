Years almost over 
Sure looks like December 
The snow and ice on the ground 
I hadnt sent a single Christmas card 
The 31st is coming around 
It makes me remember our last December 
How the city looks so beautiful in white 
As we walked the street that day you kept me warm 
We couldnt wait to get inside 

Now its Christmas and youre so far away 
On this Christmas I just wish you had stayed 
And I wonder if youre thinking of me today 
I dont know what Ill do its not Christmas without you 

I hear carols in the distance 
Dont want to listen because every sound says your not here 
Just in case you change your mind Ill leave a light over the door 
And hope you suddenly appear 

Cuz its Christmas and youre so far away 
On this Christmas I just wish you had stayed 
And I wonder if youre thinking of me today 
I dont know what Ill do its not Christmas without you 

Im to old too old to believe in Santa Claus 
What are these gifts under the tree 
But I did this once 
Or many its a dream, has he really brought you back to me 
its Christmas all I wanted is here 
On this Christmas was for you to be near 
And I wonder if youre thinking of me cuz youre here 
My one wish has come true, its not Christmas without you---Lyrics submitted by Chanteil Barnes.
