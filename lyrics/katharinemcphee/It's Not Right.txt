Did I jump into love? Didn't know how to land
Now I'm deep into water, unable to stand
Can I silence the dangers, be blind to the signs?
I see hearts breaking around me, what will happen to mine?


Every now and then I feel these questions creeping in
But if you leave me in the middle of nowhere
And I can't get back again


Every now and then all these fears I have squeak in
Well, if you leave me in the middle of winter
Never to see the sun again


Now that I am in silent suffering
It's not right, it's not right


Does it feel good to let you closer to me?
Did I get what I wanted but not what I need?
Can I carry the weight of these secrets and doubts?
I know their never spoken but inside they calling out


Every now and then I feel these questions creeping in
But if you leave me in the middle of nowhere
And I can't get back again


Every now and then all these fears I have squeak in
Well, if you leave me in the middle of winter


Never to see the sun again
Now that I am in silent suffering
It's not right, it's not right


In the voices hard to fight
I'm scared, my heart is saying
It is not right, it's not right
I'm not made to be afraid, oh


Every now and then I feel these questions creeping in
But if you leave me in the middle of nowhere


And I can't get back again
Every now and then all these fears I have squeak in
Well, if you leave me in the middle of winter
Never to see the sun again


Every now and then I feel these questions creeping in
Stuck in the middle of nowhere and I can't get back again
Now that I am in silent suffering, oh no
It's not right, oh no, it's not right, oh no, it's not right
I know my heart knows, it's not right---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
