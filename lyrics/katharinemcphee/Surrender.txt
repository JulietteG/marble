My pose goes to a moon
When I know you're here
My heart runs to another room
When I know you're near


And they say that you don't know
What you got 'til it's gone
So I'm holding onto you


How many lives till I get this one right
Till I give up the fight and just surrender, surrender
How many days till I love me the way
That you loved me, you love me


You say I'm beautiful
But I just don't see
You say one day I'll learn
When will that day be?


And they say that you don't know
What you got 'til it's gone
So I'm holding onto you


How many lives till I get this one right
Till I give up the fight and just surrender, surrender
How many days till I love me the way
That you loved me, you love me


Love this life that I see that I laid out for me
Well, it seems incomplete


Will I ever see me the way I see me
Out to be your eyes, out to be your eyes?
And how many lives till I get this one right
Till I give up the fight and just surrender, surrender


How many lives till I get this one right
Till I give up the fight and just surrender, surrender
How many days till I love me the way


That you loved me, you love me
You love me, you love me---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
