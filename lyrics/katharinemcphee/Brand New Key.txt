I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you've got something I need


Well, I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them on to see


I've been lookin' around awhile
You've got something for me
Well, I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key


I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car
Don't go so fast but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive, I've been all around the world
Some people say I've done alright for a girl


I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes but that you weren't alone
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you've got something I need


Well, I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them on to see


Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
