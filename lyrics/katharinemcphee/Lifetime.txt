Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah


Breathe, breathe, breathe before you get old
Sing, sing, sing a song that you know
Sleep, sleep, sleep with someone you love
Let them know you do, that you really do


Hold them tight and don't forget differences are differences
All the dreams of life that you've been letting go
Blink and then you'll miss it and you'll never know
This could be the moment that turns into a lifetime


Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah , ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah , ah, ah


Give, give, give of yourself
Never leave, leave, leave better than well
No, do, do, do all you can do
Love them like you want someone to love you


Highs and lows will come your way, there's no need to be afraid
All the dreams of life that you've been letting go
Blink and then you'll miss it and you'll never know
This could be the moment that turns into a lifetime


Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah , ah, ah
And always remember that your brighter days are up ahead
(No regrets)


Squeeze them tight and don't forget differences are differences
All the dreams of life that you've been letting go
Blink and then you'll miss it and you'll never know
This could be the moment
This could be the moment that turns into a lifetime


Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
