Ge-ge-e jo jo ooh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo

I'll get you out of here
There is too much talking in this atmosphere
Cause I just wanna get you out of here
My baby gonna get a lot of me

She goes:
Ge-ge-e jo jo uh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo
Se-say so-so uh lala hmm let's go Geronimo
Ge-ge-e jojo uh lala hmm let's go

[Chorus:]
And I'm breaking, I'm breaking away
I'm aiming power power shots
I'm giving all I got and
I'm fearless, I'm fearless today
I paint my face with teardrop-drops
And I'm kissing underdogs

[Hook:]
Aaaahhh, aaaahhhh
Ge-ge-e jo jo uh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo
Aaaahhh, aaaahhhh
Ge-ge-e jo jo uh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo

Wanna get you outta here
There is too much smoking in this athmosphere
I just wanna see you bright and clear
My baby gonna get a lot of me

She goes:
Ge-ge-e jo jo uh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo
Se-say so-so uh lala hmm let's go Geronimo
Ge-ge-e jojo uh lala hmm let's go

[Chorus]

[Hook:]
Aaaahhh, aaaahhhh
Ge-ge-e jo jo uh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo
Aaaahhh, aaaahhhh
Ge-ge-e jo jo uh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo

[Bridge:]
Do it all for love,
Let's do it all for love
It all comes down
To you and me
To me and you
You and me

[Chorus]

[Hook:]
Aaaahhh, aaaahhhh
Ge-ge-e jo jo oh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo
Aaaahhh, aaaahhhh
Ge-ge-e jo jo oh lala hmm let's go, Geronimo

Do it of a love
Let's do it of a love
