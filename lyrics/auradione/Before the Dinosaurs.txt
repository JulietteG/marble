Long time ago so far away from here
 There was a time we couldnt disappear
 Before the birds have learnt how to fly

 There is ma-magic in this moment
 There is no dark side to the sunset
 Youre with me and I am yours forever

 We were here before the dinosaurs
 We were hiding in the mountains
 We were here before the dinosaurs
 I was just practicing my guitar

 My heart is small, a democracy
 I hang your picture in my inner gallery
 You and me looking out from the mountain top

 There is ma-magic in this moment
 There is no dark side to the sunset
 Youre with me and I am yours forever

 We were here before the dinosaurs
 We were hiding in the mountains
 We were here before the dinosaurs
 I was just practicing my guitar

 Come with me into the deep
 Till you can touch the ground with your feet
 Come with me well swim in the sky
 Thats how the birds learn how to fly

 We were here before the dinosaurs
 We were hiding in the mountains
 We were here before the dinosaurs
 I was just practicing my guitar

 And one day they say well go away
 But I want to stay forever
 Cause I was here before the dinosaurs
 Always practicing my guitar

 We were here before the dinosaurs [x3]---Lyrics submitted by alexyalta.
