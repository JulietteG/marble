The Lord Thy God, 

(He's in the midst of Thee), 
He's in the midst of Thee, 

(He's mighty), He's mighty, 
(So mighty), so mighty.


(The Lord Thy God), 
The Lord Thy God, 

(He's in the midst of Thee), 
He's in the midst of Thee, 

(He's mighty), He's mighty, 
(So mighty), so mighty.

And I saw Him high and lifted up, 
With power and grace, and authority.

And He shall reign, 
In the midst of Thee, 
Forever and ever, Amen.

The Lord Thy God, 

(He's in the midst of us), 
He's in the midst of us, 

(He's mighty), He's mighty,

(The Lord our God), 
The Lord our God, 

(He's in the midst of us), 
He's in the midst of us, 

(You're mighty), You're mighty, 
(So mighty), so mighty.

And I've seen Him high and lifted up, 
With power and grace, and authority.

And He shall reign, 
In the midst of Thee, 
Forever and ever, Amen.
