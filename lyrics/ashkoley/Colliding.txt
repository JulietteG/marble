I know you remind me, of who I was
I know you, who you've been, who you've become.
you grown your hair longer, now it hides your eyes
perfect smiles I kind of hiding
I've seen you much stronger, much stronger than I
Remember when we were, colliding

I know you got lots on your mind
I just need a little more time
oh remember when, how have you been
and what has come and gone

I know you, been through a lot
I can see it in your eyes
I understand, when it comes apart 
you choose the safer side
you grown your hair longer, now it hides your eyes
perfect smile is kind of hiding
I've seen you much stronger, much stronger than I
Remember when we were, colliding

I know you got lots on your mind
I just need a little more time
oh remember when, how have you been
and what has come and gone

Oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh

(oh oh, oh oh) I know you remind me (oh oh, oh oh) of who I was
I know you got lots on your mind
I just need a little more time
oh remember when, how have you been
and what has come and 

I know you got lots on your mind
I just need a little more time
oh remember when, how have you been
and what has come and gone---Lyrics submitted by Hsain.
