[Intro - Vocalizing]

Sometimes we do things
Others don't understand
If they ask why
Just tell them that

Tellem that I love you, babe
Tellem that I love you, baby (x3)

Tellem that I love you, baby

Gonna tellem that I love you babe
(Tellem that I love you babe)
Tell em that i love you babe (x3)
Tell em that i love you, baby
Love you babe
(Love you babe)
I'm always gonna love you baby
(Always gonna love you baby) (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Based Goddess.
