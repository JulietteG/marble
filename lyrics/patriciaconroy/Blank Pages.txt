Blank pages starin' at me
I don't know what to say
But I've got to tell you something
Before I leave today
I ain't the kind for writing letters
I'd rather show my love
But baby, you ain't around here 'near enough

Chorus
No, I can't say that I'm sorry
For giving love a chance
I can't tell you how it breaks my heart to break up this romance
Oh, the words won't help me to explain just how this hurts me so
Just read between the tears on these blank pages and then maybe then you'll know

My bags are packed and ready
They're sittin' by the door
It seems as though they're askin'
What are we waitin' for
I can't be your silent partner,
That's not enough for me
This isn't the way our love should be

Chorus
