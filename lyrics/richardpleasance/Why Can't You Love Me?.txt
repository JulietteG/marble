We are gathered here today
To talk about
Whether we will
Or whether
Whether we won't

Whether we will
Or whether
Whether we won't

We can slip 
We can slide
We can always come inside
We can warm our bones out by the fire

We could ask
We could could pry
We could love
Or we could cry
I'd love to know what you desire

Oh just at the point of release
Up jumps love
Holding its head up high
Why can't you see me?
Why can't you feel me?
Why can't you love me?

Oh why can't you love me?

We could burn
Or we could glow
We could shrink
Or we could grow
We could still be alone when we're together

We could stroke each other's skin
Until our bodies have given in
And hang on to this moment forever

Well, I'm not a traditional man I suppose
And I love the sensation of 
Taking your clothes off
And touching
Touching your body

Oooo 
And just at the point where you cry out Jehova
A sticky sensation called love knocks me over
And over
Why
Why can't you love me

Oh why can't you love me?
Why 

Did I hear correctly or was it a rumour 
A man in another place
Has just become another love
I can't speak right now 
Cause I'm strangling the phone
You've broken my heart and I'm not coming home

Maybe the sounds in our head are confusing us
Let's not rely on dear god to deliver us from evil
I don't think that he will

Oooo
So come on, let's drink 
We can all have a toast
To the father, the son and your holy old ghost

Goodbye to my love
Thanks a lot for the warning
I never did like the smell of your breath in the morning
Goodbye to your love
Goodbye to your faith

I hate what you wear
I never did like your taste
I'm soaked in this muck and my pride's been removed
If i never see you again it'll be much too soon

And I ask you why
Yes I ask you why

Oh why
Why
Why
Can't you love me?

Oh why 
Can't you love me?

Oh why
Can't you love me?

Why
Can't you love me?

Oh why
Can't yo love me?

Can't you love me?

Why
Can't you love me ...---Lyrics submitted by Carerra.
