I got a feeling about you, love who's fooling who
Crazy eyes I been a foolin' you
You sing songs about brass buttons and shiny silver shoes
Crazy eyes what had you to lose

Down among the South Caroline pines
You spent most of your lifetime in deep thought
Then changes come about and you find the time you spent
Wasn't quite reason for being bought

So now to be or not to be is the question...now
Crazy eyes don't you forget how
I'm used to seeing your face in the crowd and you thought you
Saw me
Crazy eyes blind as you can be---Lyrics submitted by ken Fidler.
