If ya did and if ya didnt, even if ya did
Be where you shouldnt a been
See what you shouldnt of seen
Dream what you shouldnt of dreamed
That doesnt mean you have to be payin the price forever
Im gonna set you free

If ya did and if ya didnt, even if ya did
Done what you shouldnt of done
Run when you shouldnt of run
Lost when you should of won
That doesnt mean you have to payin the price forever
Im gonna set you free

If ya did and if ya didnt, even if ya did
Went off the beaten track
Maybe ya never came back
Or ya wented off the black
That doesnt mean you have to payin the price forever
Im gonna set you free

If ya did and if ya didnt, even if ya did
Suffered from a broken heart
Got off to a poor start
Maybe ya fell apart
That doesnt mean you have to payin the price forever
Im gonna set you free

If ya did and if ya didnt, even if ya did
Shown what ya shouldnt of show
Thrown what you shouldnt of thrown
Known what you shouldnt of known
That doesnt mean you have to be locked up here forever
Im gonna set you free

If ya did and if ya didnt, even if ya did
Be where you shouldnt a been
See what you shouldnt of seen
Dream what you shouldntve dreamed
That doesnt mean you have to be payin the price forever
Im gonna set you free

Im gonna set you free---Lyrics submitted by Duke.
