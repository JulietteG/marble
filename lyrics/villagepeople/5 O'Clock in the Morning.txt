Its 5 o clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said youd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought Id just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping and I was hoping

[T Pain]
Its 5 oclock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, dont ya?
I can see it
Cause youve been waiting on me since
I said that I was hittin the club
Something coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me texts
Like boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love
(Its 5 oclock in the morning)
You aint got to remind me
She already said if I dont come home on time
She might go crazy
And shell be waiting on me naked
With one of my chains on
She might come and find me
And then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Hook - Lily Allen]
Its 5 o clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said youd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought Id just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were creeping

Its 5 o clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said youd go into bed soon
So I snuck up to your bedroom
And I thought Id just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in
[T-Pain]
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
What is he doing? oh what is he doing?
Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
You texting me like Imma kill yall
If you dont get your ass up out of that club
And you do know what time it is
(Its 5 oclock in the morning)
On my bed, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin
And I know that you mad, girl
But you aint got to worry about nothing
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy
We do this every night and then
We always wake up singing the same song

You aint got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to
Leave here with one of them
Thats why I call her
And youll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah so by the time Im at your crib..
(Its 5o Clock in the morning)
And you yawning, but Ive been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom
Flooring to the dresser
Dont want nothing less cause Im sure youre the best
Youre the one, So I let you
Thats how you show me love
And when we finish you like damn, babe you woke me up
I like you way you put it down likes its for both of us
The sun aint the only thing thats coming up

[Hook]
Its 5 o clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said youd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought Id just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were creeping---Lyrics submitted by thaohien.
