Billy's called, he's got the van
And Dean's got a set of drums
And I borrowed this old guitar
We're hoping some day we'll all go far
And maybe we'll write a tune
And drive in a limousine
See our picture in a magazine
So wont you be there?

Cum hear the band on friday night,  whoa whoa yeah
Cum hear the band it'll be alright,  whoa  whoa oh yeah
And baby its you that's got me burnin' inside
So cum hear the band it'll be alright
It'll be alright

'Cause baby its you, that keeps me so turned on
Baby it's you, seein' me right when I'm wrong
And I cant keep it inside, cause I wont know 'til I've tried
So baby, whatcha want me to do?

We practiced hard to get it on
Working to get it strong
Now I just want you to hear
But it wont work if you're not there
So please dont take too long
I'm waiting with a song
So wont you please be there?
Wont you be there?

Cum hear the band on friday night, whoa whoa yeah
Cum hear the band it'll be alright, whoa whoa yeah
And baby it's you that's got me burnin' inside
So cum hear the band itll be alright, it'll be alright

It'll be alright
it'll be alright
It'll be alright---Lyrics submitted by Wayne.
