I dont wanna go downtown
I dont wanna move
Dont wanna stay this way
Missing you the way I do
(Missing you the way I do)
Wishing you were here 
Wish I could be with you
Maybe I should call you
I dont know
There's something you should see
That doesn't show

I dont wanna start again
(I dont wanna start again)
But,  I cant forget the way things
Might have been, ooh ooh
I'd like to see you once more
If I could
But,  chances are my chances arent too good

The wings of love have carried her away
The door of fate is closed
The Angels say
Maybe I should go outside
(Maybe I should go outside)
I hear the world is warm 
no need to stay inside
And maybe I'll forget this mornings news
It means as much to me as it does 
To you

The wings of love have carried you away
The door of fate is closed the Angels say

I know if things wont change
You've said goodbye
But,  I could lose this feeling
If I tried
The wings of love have carried you away
The door of fate is closed 
The Angels say---Lyrics submitted by Wayne.
