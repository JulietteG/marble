On assignment to the new world
They said there'd be no chance for war
Missed the shuttle to the Main Star
They promised they'd be back for more, oh yeah
Then the warships came without a sound
There were at least a hundred of them bearin down

CHORUS
Caught in the crossfire
Caught in a world insane
Lord war of the empire
No one will bethe same
We were caught in the crossfire
Caught in a new age war, we were

I heard somebody say we'd be wasted
Under fire we were without defense
My buddy said he had a space van
A long-range cruiser, it was our only chance, oh yeah
We could see no way out but one
We had no choice but to try and run

CHORUS

Odessey, laser fight. one shot, last plight
Steered the warships through the nuetral zone
Our engines sheared the night as we raced for home

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Stacy.
