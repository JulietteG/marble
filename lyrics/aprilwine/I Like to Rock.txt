Well alright, somethin's got you goin' tonight 
Doin' all she can, it's alright 
Come on can't you see 
That when we all let go 
We get high on rock 'n' roll 

Journey to the stars, rock 'n' roll guitars, yeah 
I like to rock, some like it hot, baby 
I like it, you like it 
I like to rock, I like to rock 

I can sing, that's the kind of life for me 
Want it loose and fancy free 
Come on then let's go 
And it'll be alright 
We can rock 'n' roll all night 

Journey to the stars, rock 'n' roll guitars, yeah 
I like to rock, some like it hot, baby 
I like it, you like it 
I like to rock, I like to rock 

Ooh, I like to rock 
Some like it hot, baby 
I like it, you like it 
I like to rock, I like to rock---Lyrics submitted by Bill.
