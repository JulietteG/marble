Look at all the places we been, and look where we are 
Something is amiss here cause we never seem to get very far 
Now I got a feeling, a plan, some music to sing 
And I'm looking for the right words to convey the message we bring 

If you can hear it, mmm, I'm gettin' near it, if I can say it 
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air 
You're the one that started all the trouble out there 

Grease me, I'm near you, blast me, I'm in your way 
You're the thing in a song, that really ought to be put away 
Now I got a feeling, a plan, some music to sing 
And I'm looking for the right words to convey the message we bring 

If you can hear it, I'm gettin' near it, if I can say it 
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air 

Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air 
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air 
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air 
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air---Lyrics submitted by Bill.
