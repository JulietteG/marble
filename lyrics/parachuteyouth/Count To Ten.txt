I close my eyes again
I count to 10 again
But there is no sign of my friends
My friends

I cant see any form
Because this game it has no toys
And I keep playing again
And I keep playing, playing again

Stop now, dont turn around
I keep saying, Ill keep playing
Stop now, dont turn make a sound
Keep playing, the children saying

Close your eyes, count to 10
If you turn around lets start again
Close your eyes, count to 10
If you turn around lets start again

Im counting the days when I was young
Where nothing else mattered
When we had fun
I go back to that place
Now Im down
Where we would have hours
While we counted the time
Counted the time

Stop now, dont turn around
I keep saying, Ill keep playing
Stop now, dont turn make a sound
Keep playing, the children saying

Close your eyes, count to 10
If you turn around lets start again
Close your eyes, count to 10
If you turn around lets start again.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
