Leave for the country let the day begin
I carry my share of original sin
I'm writing you a letter from a telephone
Sign it messenger man in the great unknown

And I wanna be like Mercury
With the wind blowin' through my hair

Swim up the river to the cedar trees
Follow the sun and catch a nice cool breeze
Bicycle trail only runs so far
This is a place you can't get by car

And I wanna be like Mercury
With the wind blowin' through my hair

Walk through the woods on a moonlit night
I carry a compass and a small flashlight
Deliver my message in a mason jar
Planting my seeds they're growing star to star

And I wanna be like Mercury
With the wind blowin' through my hair 
And I wanna be like Mercury
And I wanna be like Mercury
like Mercury
like Mercury
like Mercury
like Mercury
like Mercury
like Mercury
Mercury
like Mercury
like Mercury---Lyrics submitted by lynn.
