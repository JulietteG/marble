I've been down this road ten times
I would run, I would hide
From the fears that ruled my mind
And so I asked this guy
We'll call him Oz, call him wise
He laughed and offered his advice

Get out of your black hole
Join life's circus sideshow

Got to shimmy, shimmy low, Got to free my soul
Wanna walk on water, Gonna lose control
Shimmy, shimmy low, Got to free my soul
Wanna walk on water, Gonna lose control

I'd practice to believe
Fear is real, a disease
And hold myself against my knees
And if you lose your mind
Call the sun, then unwind
There's too much to leave behind

He said you ought to know
Life's on remote control

Got to shimmy, shimmy low, Got to free my soul
Wanna walk on water, Gonna lose control
Shimmy, shimmy low, Got to free my soul
Wanna walk on water, Gonna lose control

Much to my surprise, I've been so high
I'll kiss the sky from this broken dream I'll rise

Shimmy, shimmy low, Got to free my soul
Wanna walk on water, Gonna lose control

Shimmy, shimmy low, Got to free my soul
Wanna walk on water, Gonna lose control
Shimmy, shimmy low, free my soul
Shimmy, shimmy low, free my soul---Lyrics submitted by lynn.
