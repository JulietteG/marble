So why the sudden change
and whats this all about? 
I know they speak your name, 
but wheres the sound right now? 
I cant stop praying youll hear me play. 
I know that Ill be with you there someday. 

So where the hells my hope, 
and why cant I just try? 
You know Ive lost a lot, 
but I wont let this die. 
I know Ive got a friend up in the atmosphere, 
and another reason not to fear the sky; 
no, not tonight. 

Can I pull out all the stops, 
and get out of this town? 
I want to make you proud, 
but I really dont know how. 
I know its not helping to hear me say, 
I wish it was me in the car that day.
Though something made me stop and think of what you said. 
You know it meant a lot, 
but I was just a kid, 
one with all these dreams of growing up and playing music on the road. 
Ive been screaming all these years and thinking of you both.

So wheres my hope, 
and why cant I just try? 
You know Ive lost a lot, 
but I wont let this die. 
I know Ive this friend up in the atmosphere, 
and another reason not to fear the sky; 
no, not tonight. 

I wrote this note, 
because I never even told you. 
You know Ive got some things to sing about, 
like we were young and holding true 
to all these songs that always made us pull through, 
and now Ive got some words that Ill write down. 
Im sending this shit out. 

So wheres my hope, 
and why cant I just try? 
You know Ive lost a lot, 
but I wont let this die. 
I know Ive this friend up in the atmosphere, 
and another reason not to fear the sky; 
no, not tonight. 

So wheres my hope, 
and why cant I just try? 
You know Ive lost a lot, 
but I wont let this die. 
I know Ive got a friend up in the atmosphere, 
and another reason not to fear the sky; 
no, not tonight. 

So where the hells my hope, 
and why cant I just try? 
You know Ive lost a lot, 
but I wont let this die. 
I know Ive got a friend up in the atmosphere, 
and another reason not to fear the sky; 
no, not tonight. no, not tonight---Lyrics submitted by Brodie.
