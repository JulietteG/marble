You got me feeling like a Saturday night
You got me buzzing like a ... sign
There's no last call inside, it's gonna be a wild ride
You don't know what you're doing when you do
That lipstick that's on the cigarette
And that moonlight and moonshine
I just want to cross the line with you

You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
Little bit of a dream, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like...
You get dancing like you're doing
I love the way the night is going
Little bit of a dream, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you

Well all them dudes
Looking at me wondering what I have to do
To wind up on this bar stool next to you
Shooting kilo with a hottie
They just over there shooting pool
Well I'm, yeah well I'm a damn lucky guy
Must have done something along the way that's right
Good Lord blessed me with a hell of an angel tonight

You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
Little bit of a dream, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like...
You get dancing like you're doing
I love the way the night is going
Little bit of a dream, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you

I said a party like you
I said a party like you, girl
Ooh a party like..

You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
You get dancing like you're doing
I love the way the night is going
Little bit of a dream, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you
