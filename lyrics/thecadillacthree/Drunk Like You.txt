Sitting at the bar with a shot and a cold beer, neither one's doing the job 
In through the swinging door, straight to the dance floor, intoxicating, there you are
Addiction is a crazy thing, oh, what you do to me

Nothing gets me drunk like you, even whiskey can't do 
What you do when you kiss me that way, 
That black label lipstick, 90 proof hits quick, 
Top shelf tangled in my veins 
It's dangerous, I want to drink you on up, 
Can't get enough, keep filling up my cup 
Nothing gets me drunk like you, 
Nothing gets me drunk like you

Girl, you make a fellow want to tie one on, I'm talking dizzy, tangled up in the sheets 
Sip, sip, sip you, baby, til you're gone, and then hang over all over me, 
Hang over all over me

Nothing gets me drunk like you, even whiskey can't do What you do when you kiss me that way, 
That black label lipstick, 90 proof hits quick Top shelf tangled in my veins

Nothing gets me drunk like you, even whiskey can't do 
What you do when you kiss me that way, 
That black label lipstick, 90 proof hits quick, 
Top shelf tangled in my veins 
It's dangerous 
I wanna drink you on up, can't get enough
Keep filling up on my cup 
Nothing gets me drunk like you, 
Nothing gets me drunk like you

Nothing gets me drunk like you, even whiskey can't do 
What you do when you kiss me that way, 
That black label lipstick, 90 proof hits quick, 
Top shelf tangled in my veins

Nothing gets me drunk like you, even whiskey can't do 
What you do when you kiss me that way, 
That black label lipstick, 90 proof hits quick, 
Top shelf tangled in my veins 
It's dangerous, I want to drink you on up, 
Can't get enough, keep filling up my cup 
Nothing gets me drunk like you, 
Nothing gets me drunk like you 
It's dangerous 
Nothing gets me drunk like you, 
Nothing gets me drunk like you---
