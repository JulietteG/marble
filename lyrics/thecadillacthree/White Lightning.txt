She stole my heart, I say well, she stole my heart
Faster than a heat-seekin' missile on a mission
Faster than a bass to the hook when daddy's fishin'
Faster than a walnut rolls off a hen house
Faster than a whiskey shot goes down-down south

Oh, I saw white lightnin'
Oh, I saw white lightnin'

Faster than McQueen runnin' them red lights
Faster than the duke boys jumpin' that hillside
Faster than Elvis could shake rattle roll
Faster than the skirt flyin' up on Monroe, I said

Oh, I saw white lightnin'
Oh, I saw white lightnin'

Faster than number three breakin' every record
Faster than a tree dies in the desert
Faster than a bug splattered on my wind shield
Faster than you die when you take 2 many pills

Oh, I saw white lightnin'
Oh, I saw white lightnin'

White lightnin', strikin' in the heart of me, yeah
White lightnin', oh, ohh
White lightning strikin in the heart of me, yeah
White lightning, ohoh

Oh, I saw white lightnin' I said
Oh, I saw white lightnin'
Oh, I saw white lightnin' I said
Oh, I saw white lightnin'---
