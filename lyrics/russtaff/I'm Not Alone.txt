Sometimes it feels like im out there pushing
Banging my head against the wall
And i wonder where you are
Im so alone
It all seems so ordinary
Just marking time without reason
Its so hard to be here feeling all alone

[Chorus]
But when i close my eyes
I know you are here, near me again
And when i close my eyes
You feel the prayer i breathe
I hear you say my name
Im not alone

I see the problem very clearly
Its a tug of war in my soul
Between choosing to believe
Or feeling alone
My heart is telling me not to worry
But my head isnt yielding
It insists on feeling left alone

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Rob.
