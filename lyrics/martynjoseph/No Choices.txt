No Choices

Lay down my head tonight with a stranger,
lay down with whoever wants me.
Close my eyes, think of family.
Try to remember what love meant to me.

No choices, silent voices, cry out to me.
No choices, these voices, won't let me be.

See this bowl in front of me.
I didn't make this society.
Made in the image of another one.
It's all I can do now for this little one.
For I have,

No choices, silent voices cry out to me.
No choices, these voices won't let me be.

If life could be chosen who would stand here.
Not you or I.
We're called by another to extend a hand.
Not to point now, but to understand.

Refugee, leprosy.
Walk the path that's in front of me.
Live for the hope now of a better day.
Just a chance to walk away.
For I have,

No choices, silent voices cry out to me.
No choices, these voices won't let me be.

Cry out to me.---Lyrics submitted by James Sloots.
