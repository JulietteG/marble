Oh, never mind, we tried
We loved
We conquered, I won't forget
The taste
Oh, no

I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again

The music brings me right back
And you know that
And you know that
I got the answers in me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Like a vision of love
You came, you stood
You blew right through me
I have no regrets
The tears, the hopes

I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again
I'll never say never
I'll never say never again

The music brings me right back
And you know that
And you know that
I got the answers in me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Oh, sing my love
Oh, sing my love
Oh, sweet my love
Oh, sweet my love

We've all just gotta be
'Cause answers rarely come easily
We've all just gotta be
Then finally, finally we're free

I'll never say never
I'll never say never again

Oh, sing my love

The music brings me right back
And you know that
And you know that
I got the answers in me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

It's like I hear an angel calling
The music---
