Look for me right when the lights go down
My own little natural hide
I should be floating on top of the world
But I just keep wondering why

I feel more alone in this wonderful crowd
And I ever do on my own
I know that this is a place I'm along
But I'd rather be coming back home

Oooh, I want you to know I'm okay
I just need to know that you're waiting
you're waiting
for me

Someone keep saying I could be a star
Never quite sure what that means
Sounds like there's something I'm missing right now
But who they think I could be

All that I'm missing is you my love
Come find me whenever you can
I'll be the one looking up at the sun
with a picture of you in my hand

Oooh, I want you to know I'm okay
I just need to know that you're waiting
you're waiting
for me

Oooh, I want you to know I'm okay
I just need to know that you're waiting
you're waiting
for me, oohho---Lyrics submitted by andhrea vhi.
