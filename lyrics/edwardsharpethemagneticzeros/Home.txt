Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Not the way that I do love you

Holy, moley, me, oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl I've never loved one like you

Man oh man you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need

Well, hot and heavy, pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Ahh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ahh home. Let me go ho-oh-ome
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la, take me home
Mother, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle through the dark
Girl I never loved one like you

Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alley-ways and pay phone calls
I've been everywhere with you

We laugh until we think we'll die
Barefoot on a summer night
Nothin' new is sweeter than with you

And in the streets you run afree
Like it's only you and me
Geeze, you're something to see

Ahh home, let me go home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ahh home. Let me go ho-oh-ome
Home is wherever I'm with you

La, la, la, la, take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home

Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
I sure do, you came jumping out after me
Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
Yes I do
Well there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you til just now

Ahh home, let me go home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ahh home, let me go ho-oh-ome
Home is where I'm alone with you

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

Ahh home, yes I am ho-oh-ome
Home is when I'm alone with you

Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alley-ways and pay phone calls

Ahh home, let me go home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ahh home, let me go ho-oh-ome
Home is where I'm alone with you---
