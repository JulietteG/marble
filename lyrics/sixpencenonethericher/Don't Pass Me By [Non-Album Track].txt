I am a fruit that you squeeze
hoping the nectar is sweet
I am a lump on your wheel
whose shape you still conceal
I want to be something to you
but I feel like nothing
and I'm desperate to feel you hands
shaping me constantly

Chorus
just don't pass me by
please don't pass me by
or else I else I die
just please don't pass me by
don't pass me by
or else I else I'd die

you put a clench off my fist
cleaning the mill of the grids
you run a hand on my back
that makes my tension slack
ill always be something to you
though I feel like nothing
and I'm desperate to feel you hands
shaping me constantly

Chorus
just don't pass me by
please don't pass me by
or else I else I die
just please don't pass me by
don't pass me by
or else I else I'd die

(Instrumental)

you flow a knife sharp fast and clean
cutting the cancer clean
you killed the ghost of ugliness
floating inside of me

Chorus
just don't pass me by
please don't pass me by
or else I else I die
just please don't pass me by---Lyrics submitted by Hitsuji.
