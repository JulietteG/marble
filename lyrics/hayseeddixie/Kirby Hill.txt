If you want to get your eyes knocked out,
You want to get your fill,
You want to get your head shot off,
Just climb up Kirby Hill.

My daddy made corn whiskey,
Up on Kirby Hill,
Just like his dad before him,
In an old pot-belly still.
He never took to strangers
Heading up that way.
And when hed hear em talk about it
This is what hed say:

If you want to get your eyes knocked out,
You want to get your fill,
You want to get your head shot off,
Just climb up Kirby Hill.

One night some Revenuers
Thought theyd take the old man down,
And they asked about the way up
Kirby Hill all over town.
They headed up the mountain
Round about half-past ten.
Reckon now its safe to say
We aint never seein them again.

If you want to get your eyes knocked out,
You want to get your fill,
You want to get your head shot off,
Just climb up Kirby Hill.

My great granddaddy used to talk
Bout the war tween the governments,
Back when old Jeff Davis
And Abe Lincoln were the Presidents.
He watched the armies marching up,
He watched them both march by.
No army ever took his hill,
No army dared to try.

If you want to get your eyes knocked out,
You want to get your fill,
You want to get your head shot off,
Just climb up Kirby Hill.

Lately up on Kirby Hill
Ive been planting seeds of my own,
And Lord they fetch a pretty price,
When theyre good and grown.
Ive seen the helicopters,
Sent by the D.E.A.
If they value their lives like I do my buds
Theyll stay the hell away.

If you want to get your eyes knocked out,
You want to get your fill,
You want to get your head shot off,
Just climb up Kirby Hill.---Lyrics submitted by Borislav.
