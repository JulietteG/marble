Sometimes I think Im not that strong
But theres a force that carries me on
Sick of my small heart, made of steel
Sick of those wounds that never heal

Cause I have lived my life in debt
Ive spent my days in deep regret
Yeah I been living in the red
Oh, cause I cant forgive and I cant forget
Forget

Forget, forget, forget
Aint no time to regret
Yeah, its time to forget

Ever since I can remember
Life was like a tipping scale
Like an abacus I played with
Counting every win and fail

To be letting go
Oh baby you know
What Im talking about
Got nothing to lose and nothing to prove
Oh baby, Im bowing out
Out, Im bowing out

Yeah, Ive been dancing with the devil
I love that he pretends to care
If Ill ever get to heaven
When a million dollars gets you there

Oh, all the time that I have wasted
Chasing rabbits down a hole
When I was born to be the tortoise
I was born to walk alone

Forget about it
Forget about it
Forget about it

Forget, forget, forget
Aint no time to regret

Im gonna leave the past behind
Ive had enough, Im breaking free
No pressing stop, erase, rewind
That chain of thought that followed me

Ive put my money where my mouth is
For the first time in my life
Ive made mistakes but I believe that
Everything was worth the fight

Cause in the end, the road is long
But only cause it makes you strong
Its filled with peaks & twists & turns
Sometimes you have to learn forget about it---
