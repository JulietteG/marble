Cuckoo (cuckoo)
Cuckoo (cuckoo)
Cuckoo (cuckoo)
Cuckoo (cuckoo)

Ten silver spoons coming after me
One life with one dream on repeat
I'll escape if I try hard enough
Til king of the jungle calls my bluff

(Oh Lord) oh Lord
I have been told (I have been told)
That I must take the unforsaken road (unforsaken road)
There's a fork in the road
I do as I am told
And I don't know don't know don't know don't know
Who ooh ooh-ooh ooh I wanna be

Cuckoo (cuckoo)
Cuckoo (cuckoo)
Cuckoo (cuckoo cuckoo)

You say Y E S to everything
Will that guarantee you a win?
Do you think you will be good enough
To love others and to be loved?

(Oh Lord) oh Lord
Now I can see (now I can see)
The cutlery will keep on chasing me (unforsaken road)
There's a fork in the road
I do as I am told
And I don't know don't know don't know don't know
Who ooh ooh-ooh ooh I wanna be

We are the spoon metally mean
We scooped our way into your dreams
To knock the knives out bloody cold
And lead you down the unforsaken road

(unforsaken road)
There's a fork in the road
I do as I am told
And I don't know don't know don't know don't know
Who ooh ooh-ooh ooh I wanna be---Lyrics submitted by Kaila Bauer.
