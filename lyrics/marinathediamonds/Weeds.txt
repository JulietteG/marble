Could have filled a garden
With all the flowers that you gave me, baby
But none of them were ours
You know the problem with history
It keeps coming back like a weed
And when nothing feels enough
At least you taught me how to love
But he keeps growing back

Like weeds
Baby, just open your eyes to see
Hes growing from inside me
And I just dont know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds
Like weeds

I miss all of my exes
Theyre the only ones that know me
And God knows that sex is
A way to feel a bit, a little bit less lonely
Yeah, I tried to keep it covered up
Yeah, I thought I cut him at the root
But now I think my time is up
'Cause he keeps growing back

Like weeds
Baby, just open your eyes to see
Hes growing from inside me
And I just dont know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds
Like weeds
Like weeds
Yeah
Baby

Like weeds
Like weeds
Like weeds
Yeah, yeah

Baby, just open your eyes to see
Hes growing from inside me
And I just dont know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds
Like weeds---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
