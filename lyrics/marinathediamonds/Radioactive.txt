Lying on a fake beach
You'll never get a tan
Baby I'm gonna leave you drowning
Until you reach for my hand

In the night your heart is full & by the morning empty
But baby I'm the one who left you, you're not the one who left me

In the night your heart is full & by the morning empty
But baby I'm the one who left you, you're not the one who left me

[Chorus]
When you're around me, I'm Radioactive
My blood is burning, Radioactive
I'm turning Radioactive
My blood is Radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I feel
Ready to be let down
Now I'm heading for a meltdown

[Bridge]
Tonight I feel like neon gold
I take one look at you & I grow cold
And I grow cold
And I grow cold

[Chorus]
When you're around me, I'm Radioactive
My blood is burning, Radioactive
I'm turning Radioactive
My blood is Radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I feel
Ready to be let down
Now I'm heading for a meltdown---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
