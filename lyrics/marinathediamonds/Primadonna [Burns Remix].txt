CHORUS
Primadonna girl, yeah,
All I ever wanted was the world,
I kinda feel I need it all,
The primadonna life, the rise and fall,
You say that i'm kinda difficult,
But its always someone else's fault,
Got you rapped around my finger babe,
You can count on me to miss behave,
Primadonna girl

VERSE
Would you do anything for me,
Buy a big diamond ring for me,
Would you get down on your knees for me,
Pop that pretty question right now baby,

Beauty queen on a silver screen,
Livin life like I'm in a dream,
I know i've got a big ego,
I really don't know my its such a big deal though,

I am sad to the core, core, core,
Everyday is a chore, chore, chore
When you give i want more, more, more
I wanna be adored,
Cause I'm a...

CHORUS
Primadonna girl, yeah,
All i ever wanted was the world,
I kinda feel i need it all,
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult,
But its always someone else's fault,
Got you rapped around my finger babe,
You can count on me to miss behave,
Primadonna Girl

VERSE
Fill the void up with the colloid,
Take a picture I'm with the boys,
Get what you want cause i ask for it,
Not because I'm really that deserving of it,

Livin life like I'm in a play,
An alarm light I want to stay,
I know i've got a big ego,
I really don't know why its such a big deal though,

Going up, going down, down, down,
Everything for the crown, crown, crown,
When the lights dimming down, down, down,
I spin around, Cause I am...

CHORUS
Primadonna girl, yeah,
All I ever wanted was the world,
I kind of feel I need it all,
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kind of difficult,
But its always someone else's fault,
Got you rapped around my finger babe,
You can count on me to miss behave x2---Lyrics submitted by Jannine.
