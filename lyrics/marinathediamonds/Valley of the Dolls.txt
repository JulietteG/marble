In the valley of the dolls we sleep, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me, of me

Born with a void, hard to destroy with love or hope
Built with a heart, broken from the start
And now I die slow

In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Living with identities
That do not belong to me
In my life, I got this far
Now Im ready for the last hoorah
Dying like a shooting star
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley

Pick a personality for free
When you feel like nobody, body

Born with a void, hard to destroy with love or hope
Built with a heart, broken from the start
And now I die slow

In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Living with identities
That do not belong to me
In my life, I got this far
Now Im ready for the last hoorah
Dying like a shooting star
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley

Back to zero, here we go again, again
Racing down into oblivion
Back to zero, here we go
I can feel it coming to the end
The end

In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Living with identities
That do not belong to me
In my life, I got this far
Now Im ready for the last hoorah
Dying like a shooting star
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley---
