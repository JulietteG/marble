American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream

She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned hot blonde girl called Ania
I asked her why would you wanna be a Hollywood wife?
Because I dont wanna end up living without the fun
Ill do anything for a dime
Looking for the golden lie

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanna kiss it in the rain oh oh
Ive been living in a movie scene thinking American dreams oh oh
Im obsessed with the mess thats America
Im obsessed with the mess thats America

I found security make a place for me
Soon as I touch down in oh L.A. said
Oh my god you look just like Shakira
No no youre Catherine Zeta
Actually my names Marina

Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign
Youre looking for the golden lie

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanna kiss it in the rain oh oh
Ive been living in a movie scene thinking American dreams oh oh
Im obsessed with the mess thats America
Im obsessed with the mess thats America

American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream is the American dream

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanna kiss it in the rain oh oh
Im living in a movie scene thinking American dreams
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanna kiss it in the rain oh oh
Im living in a movie scene thinking American dreams oh oh
Im obsessed with the mess thats America
Im obsessed with the mess thats America ---Lyrics submitted by Carira.
