Millions of girls float on their one quote
Living on their last hope, on their last hope
I live my life inside a dream
Only waking when I sleep
I would sell my sorry soul, if I could have it all

My life is a play, is a play, is a play
My life is a play, is a play, is a play
Yeah Ive been living in the state of dreaming
living in a make-believe land
living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

All I really want is to be wonderful
People in this town they, they can be so cruel
I live my life inside a dream,
only waking when I sleep
If I could sell my sorry soul, I would have it all

My life is a play, is a play, is a play
My life is a play, is a play, is a play
Yeah Ive been living in the state of dreaming
living in a make-believe land
living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

If only you knew my dear,
How I live my life in fear
If only you knew my dear,
How I know my time is near

Yeah Ive been living in the state of dreaming
living in a make-believe land
living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming
living in the state of dreaming
living in a make-believe land
living in the state of dreaming, of dreaming, of dreaming

My life is a play, is a play, is a play---
