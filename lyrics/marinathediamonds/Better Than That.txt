Youre just another in a long line of men she screwed
Just another in a long line of men she knew
And yeah she did, yeah she did what she wanted to do
Like all the boys before
Another dream come true

Its a power, its a power, its a power move
And while Im not quite sure what shes trying to prove
They all say shes got low self-esteem
So, why is she looking like a cat who got the cream?

But you, you can do better than
You can do better than that

I know youve been feeling sad
Ive got no right to be mad
But you can do better than that
And I know that youre not to blame
You just got caught in a game
But you can do better than that
Better than that
Better than that

Shes the apple of everybodys eye
With an angel voice
Devil in disguise
Got a sour face like a poisoned fruit
That the boys can taste til theyre out of use

And shell network til her dreams come true
Even if it means getting into bed with you
Everybodys friend, does it ring a bell?
I know a little too much but Ill never tell

But you, you can do better than
You can do better than that

I know youve been feeling sad
Ive got no right to be mad
But you can do better than that
And I know youve been feeling down
Youre always out on the town
But you can do better than that
Better than that
Better than that

Well, I guess its just what humans do
Hook up with other people until it all falls through
And when its over they go out and try and heal their pain
Hook up with another lover, do it all again
Im not passing judgment on her sexual life
Im passing judgement on the way she always stuck her knife
In my back ever since we were starting out
Suspicious from the start, I always had my doubts about you
But you can do better than
You can do better than that

I know youve been feeling sad
Ive got no right to be mad
But you can do better than that
And I know that youre not to blame
You just got caught in a game
But you can do better than that
Better than that
Better than that---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
