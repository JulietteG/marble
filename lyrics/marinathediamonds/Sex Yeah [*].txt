Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Yeah
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
(La la la)

Nothing is provocative anymore
Even for kids
No room for imagining
'Cause everyone's seen everything
Question what the TV tells you
Question what a pop star sells you
Question mom and question dad
Question good and question bad

If history could set you free (from who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (didn't tell a girl who she would be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me

Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Yeah
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
(La la la)

If women were religiously
Recognized sexually
We wouldn't have to feel the need to show our ass,
It's to feel free
Been there, done that
Got the t-shirt
Sold my soul
And yeah the truth hurts
Tired image of a star
Acting naughtier than we really are

If history could set you free (from who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (didn't tell a guy who he should be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me

Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Yeah
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
(La la la)

All my life I've felt it deep inside of me
All this time was fighting for what I believe
All my life I've tried to hide what history has given me

If history could set you free (from who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (didn't tell a guy who he should be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me

Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Yeah
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
(La la la)---
