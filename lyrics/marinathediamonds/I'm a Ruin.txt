I know that I cant have it all
But without you I am afraid Ill fall
I know Im playing with your heart
And I could treat you better but Im not that smart

When it comes to love, youre an easy fight
A flower in a gun, a bird in flight
It isnt fair and it isnt right
To lead you on like its all alright

I played with your heart
And I could treat you better but Im not that smart
You still mean everything to me
But I want to be free

Ill ruin, yeah Ill ruin you
Ive been doing things I shouldnt do
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, Im a ruin
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, Im a ruin

Its difficult to move on when nothing was right and nothings wrong
You still cant look me in the eye
Cause youve been bitten once and now youre twice as shy

Ive had my share of beautiful men
But Im still young and I want to love again
Its difficult to say goodbye
And easier to live a lovers lie

And Ive tried to say
Babe, Im gonna ruin you if you let me stay
You still mean everything to me, to me
But I wanna be free

Ill ruin, yeah Ill ruin you
Ive been doing things I shouldnt do
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, Im a ruin
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, Im a ruin

It doesnt feel right and it doesnt feel fair
When Im planning to move on and youre still standing there
Dont wanna keep a secret but I dont know how to keep it fair, yeah

Ill ruin, yeah Ill ruin you
Ive been doing things I shouldnt do
But I dont wanna say goodbye
But baby I dont wanna lie
To lie, to lie to you
Im a ruin

Yeah, uh huh, ooh, Im a ruin
Yeah, uh huh, ooh, Im a ruin---
