I wanna be immortal
Like a god in the sky
I wanna be a silk flower
Like I'm never gonna die
I wanna live forever
Forever in your heart
And well always be together
From the end to the start

Thats what we do it for
To reserve a place
Its just another part of the human race
Thats what we do it for
To reserve a space
In history its just
Part of the human race
Race, race, race, race

Im forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
Therell be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours and you were mine
Everybody dies
Chasing after time

When you love somebody
Theyll always leave too soon
But a memory, a memory
Can make a flower bloom
We wanna be remembered
Dont wanna live in vein
But nothing lasts forever
This world is in a losing game

I wanna mean something to somebody else
Feel a significance in the real world
Its not enough to live out a lucky life

Im forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If i could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
Therell be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours and you were mine
Everybody dies
Chasing after time

No, I don't wanna be afraid, afraid to die
I just wanna be able to say that I have lived my life
Oh, all these things that humans do
To leave behind a little proof
But the only thing that doesn't die is love

Im forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
Therell be just one survivor
The memories of our life time
Everybody dies
Chasing after time
So keep me alive
So keep me alive
So keep me alive---
