You're hard to hug, tough to talk to
And I never fall asleep, when you're in my bed
All you give me is a heartbeat
I've turned into a statue
And it makes me feel depressed
Cause the only time you open up is when we get undressed

You don't love me, big fucking deal
I'll never tell, you how I feel
You don't love me, not a big deal
I'll never tell you how I feel

It almost feels like a joke to play out the part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather work alone, than play a supporting role
If I can't get the starring role.

Sometimes I ignore you so I feel in control
Cause really, I adore you, and I can't leave you alone
Fed up with the fantasies, they cover what is wrong
Come on, baby, let's just, get drunk, forget we don't get on

You're like my dad, You'd get on well
I send my best, regards from hell

I never sent for love, I never had a heart to mend
Because before the start began, I always saw the end

Yeah, I wait for you to open up, to give yourself to me
But nothing's ever gonna give, I'll never set you free
Yeah I'll never set you free

The starring role ---
