Power and control.
Give a little, get a lot,
Thats just how you are with love.
Give a little, get a lot,
Yeah, you may be good looking,
But youre not a piece of art.

Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.
Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.

Women and men we are the same,
But love will always be a game,
We give and take a little more,
Eternal game of tug and war.

Think youre funny, think youre smart,
Think youre gonna break my heart.
Think youre funny, think youre smart,
Yeah, you may be good looking,
But youre not a piece of art.

Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.
Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.

Women and men we are the same,
But love will always be a game,
A human vulnerability
Doesn't mean that I am weak

That I am weak, I am weak,
I am weak, I am weak, weak,
(Ah-ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah), weak,
(Ah-ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah), weak,
(Ah-ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah), weak,
(Ah-ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah), weak,

Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.
Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.

Women and men we are the same,
But love will always be a game.
We give and take a little more,
Eternal game of tug and war.

Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.
Power and control,
Im gonna make you fall.
Im gonna make you fall,

We give and take a little more,
Cause all my life Ive been controlled,
You cant have peace without a war,
Without a war, without a war. ---
