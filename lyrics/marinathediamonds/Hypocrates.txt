Youre the lonely one and only body in the world
Who can make me, who can break me down into a young girl

You say that love is not that easy
And thats the lesson that you teach me
So hypocritical, overly cynical
Im sick and tired of all your preaching

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?

Youre my last bone of contention
That could break at any mention
Youre the last wall that will stand tall
Til the end of the world

I know you only want to own me
And thats the kind of love you show me
You tell me one thing and do another
Keep all your secrets undercover

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go of me

Yeah you played the martyr for so long
That you cant do anything wrong

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go of me

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?---
