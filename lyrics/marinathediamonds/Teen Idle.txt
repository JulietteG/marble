I wanna be a bottle blonde
I dont know why but I feel conned
I wanna be an idle teen
I wish I hadnt been so clean

I wanna stay inside all day
I want the world to go away
I want blood, guts and chocolate cake
I wanna be a real fake

Yeah I wish Id been a, wish Id been a teen, teen idle
Wish Id been a prom queen fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find Ive come alive

I wanna be a virgin pure
A 21st century whore
I want back my virginity
So I can feel infinity
I wanna drink until I ache
I wanna make a big mistake
I want blood, guts and angel cake
Im gonna puke it anyway

Yeah I wish Id been a, wish Id been a teen, teen idle
Wish Id been a prom queen fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find Ive come alive
Come alive, Ive come alive

I wish I wasnt such a narcissist
I wish I didnt really kiss the mirror when Im on my own
Oh God! Im gonna die alone
Adolescence didnt make sense
A little loss of innocence
The ugly years of being a fool
Aint youth meant to be beautiful?

Yeah I wish Id been a, wish Id been a teen, teen idle
Wish Id been a prom queen fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find Ive come alive
Only to find Ive come alive
Only to find Ive come alive
Come alive

Feeling super, super, super!
Feeling super, super, super!
Feeling super, super, super!
Come alive---
