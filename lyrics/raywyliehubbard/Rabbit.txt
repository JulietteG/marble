I saw this old dog who was chasin this rabbit
I saw a dog he was chasin this rabbit
I saw a dog was chasin this rabbit
It was on a sunday 'bout noon

I said to the rabbit you're gonna make it
I said to the rabbit you're gonna make it
I said to the rabbit you're gonna make it
The rabbit said, well I got to.

Well a womans heart's a sacred thing
a womans heart's a sacred thing
a womans heart's a sacred thing
What's a man to do?

Well Try a little tenderness is what he said
Try a little tenderness is what he said
Try a little tenderness is what he said
Well then he said I got to got to.

Now there's two kind of people in the world
Two kind of people in the world
There's two kind of people in the world
The day people and the night people.

And it's the night peoples job
It's the night peoples job
It's the night peoples job
To get the day peoples money.

Well between the devil and the deep blue sea
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
That's where I am and I'll always be.

Maybe it means I'm funky and cool
Maybe it means I'm funky and cool
Maybe it means I'm funky and cool
I doubt id that's what it means, really.

If it's in the groove everybody loves it
If it's in the groove everybody loves it
If it's in the groove everybody loves it
Great Harlow Woods said that.

We have a short time to be here
We have a short time to be here
We have a short time to be here
So get out of your rut and get inot the groove.

Get out of your rut and into the groove
Get out of your rut and into the groove 
Get out of your rut and into the groove
Get in the groove.---Lyrics submitted by Sydney.
