He seems heaven sent
He's so affluent
He picks you up at home
Then leaves you off at dawn.
Dont you know yet, 
Lovers words are worthless.
It's so hopeless, 
They fade just like roses.
One day you will find
That people change their minds
So if you must give all
Dont cry when you fall.
Dont you know yet, 
Lovers words are worthless.
It's so hopeless, 
They fade just like roses.
There is no hope to know what's real
You must control 
The way that you feel
Dont you know yet, 
Lovers words are worthless.
It's so hopeless, 
They fade just like roses.---Lyrics submitted by Todd McDaniel.
