Youre listening to close
With a knife in your back
Youre on the attack
Did I hurt you that bad?
Youre sweating me girl
And its not even subtle
Oh I am in trouble
What to do now in my world

And oh my dear Allison
Youre running in platform shoes
And you love me when I wear my
Evening blues
And its love dear Allison
Youre kissing with such great ease
And my lips arent hard to please

Hey now Allison you are the one
Who makes boys hold their breath
As you walk on
Hey now Allison you are the one
Who changed my life before it had begun

So by the phone is where Ill wait
Waiting for callswaiting for anything
Youre hypnotizing me
With those eyes and that smile
I think ill be here
I think ill be here for a while

Goodnight dear Allison
Dont try to make me cry
Just let me walk away and heal in time
Goodbye dear Allison
Well meat again someday
And well be happier this way

All my life Ive run away from you---Lyrics submitted by Allison.
