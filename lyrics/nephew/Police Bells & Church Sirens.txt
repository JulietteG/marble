Well I'm a fan of days in bars and nights in school
And of geniuses in jail and Nobel fools
And I'm a fan of yellow noise and silent shouts
And of nurses that are boys and women scouts

Why don't they make it police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh
Talking about police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh

Well I'm a fan of bands on ground and dirt on stage
And of tigers on a leash and dogs in cage
And I'm a fan of holding hands and lettin' go
And of being so in love but not lettin' it show

Why don't they make it police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh
Talking about police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh

Kirkesirener hyl mig ud af min blanke dr
Hvor jeg bor
Kirketrn kom og brug dit horn, hyl mig ud af min blanke dr
Fr jeg dr

Politiklokker kom ring for mine rer
Mine dve rer
Politiklokker kom og ring
For mine dve rer, fr jeg dr

Why don't they make it police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh
Talking about police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh

Why don't they make it police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooh
Talking about police bells and church sirens
Police ding dong, church wee ooooooooh---Lyrics submitted by Jonas.
