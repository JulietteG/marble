Girl I must say to you
Tonight you're looking so good
And I see no more time for wasting no time debating
I think you feel the same way too
Look at the time it's getting late but make no mistake
I'm not ready to let you go away from me
So I got to say 

I want to get you, I want to get you
Out of your dress
Your little black dress
I said I want to get you, I want to get you
Out of your dress
Your little black dress

Sorry if you think its wrong
But I just can't help myself
For feeling the way I do
When I'm around you

When on the dance floor
Is when I start to lose control
With my hands upon your hips 
And I'm kissing on your lips
While I'm staring at your..
So I got to say---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
