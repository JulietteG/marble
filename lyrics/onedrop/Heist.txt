Pull the car around 
Lets stick to the plan
We'll get this money 
We'll get this money on our demand
Keep that motor running
With your opened eyes
My black ski mask is my only disguise
See something strange 
Your better give me a signal
As I go in this bank 
With a loaded pistol
Keep this hands up cause we're robbing the place

Inside the bank
You know that I'm in charge
Destroy all the cameras
After I tie up the guards
No one moves or makes a sound
This is a stick up
I want everyone on the ground
Don't make a move and you wont get hurt
Don't play hero cause it just wont work
Keep this hands up cause we're robbing the place

Stick em up, please listen to me
We mean no harm but we need to eat
Stick em up, please listen to me
We mean no harm but we need to eat

The manger shouts
He says "now take it and leave"
Behind the counter 
Where he's waiting for me
Show me the vault, I said now empty that safe
I want this money inside this pillowcase
But not that stash, don't want a silent alarm
Don't make me use this firearm
With the money in the bag
I make my escape
Through the alley down the fire-escape---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
