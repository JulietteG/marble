She lost her soul
In a bar lounge
She shared her love
Through out the town
The whiskey was warm
Like the sheets on her bed
But her heart was broken 
When he got up and left

With too much pride
To shed a tear
She finds her courage
In a pint of beer
So she loved
But loved for fun
Forgot to love
The important one

Oh Girl
You've got to love yourself
Oh Girl
You can't trust no one else
Oh Girl
You've got to love yourself
Oh Girl
You can't trust no one else

Now she's a victim
And wants revenge
Switched from courage to hate
Now a bottle of gin
Can't find herself
In life with him
So she hides
Behind religion

Stand up on your own
Dry your tears---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
