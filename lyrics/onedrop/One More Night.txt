If this is the last time I see your face
I've got one request to make
Spend one more night with me
And I'll be on my way
I won't look back
Ill just leave my foot steps behind
They're there to follow
If you should ever change your mind
But if your mind is made up
I'll see my way
I'll drag my heart this lonely lonley day
But if leaving me makes you feel so right
Promise me girl promise me one more night
Just one more night

One more night one more dance
One more night one more chance
One more night to think of, for the love
One more night reminisce one more night
One more kiss one more night make you sweat
One more night leave you wet

Under the moon under the stars
I will take you so far
Make you remember my heart that's tender 
By an arrow scar
Cupid once struck with his bow
That made me want you girl from head down to your toes

One more night one more dance
One more night one more chance
One more night to think of, for the love
One more night reminisce one more night
One more kiss one more night make you sweat
One more night leave you wet

Lets share a dance under the window
I won't close my eyes until I go
And then the Angels will sing another love song for you
But when the carousel stops, ill be gone

For the years we shared, one more night
And all the tears we beared, one more night
And all the bars we closed, one more night
And all the joints we smoked, one more night
Just one more night---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
