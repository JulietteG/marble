You were my friend till the end
So long ago
Tears and our fears held within
So no one would know
Time on the streets trying to eat
In a world that's cold
No one got hurt at first 
Till something went wrong

To fit in with the boys
With the big bank funds
Girls, the money and the toys
On top of the world
Grams turned to pounds and then came the guns
You said you would never would use
Did you ever stop to think some day 
Someone would ever point one at you?

I wish I wouldn't see you this way
In a garden of daisies
My tear-drops fall like rain
On a garden of daisies
I wish I wouldn't see you this way
In a garden of daisies
My tear-drops fall like rain
On a garden of daisies

Now my hearts filled with sorrow
Since you've been taken away
No one's promised tomorrow
So on my knees I pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
