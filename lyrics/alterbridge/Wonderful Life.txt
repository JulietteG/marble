Close your eyes
And just hear me sing
One last long goodbye
One last song before you spread your wings
There's so much left to say
And before this moment slips away

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I loved you so

The cold night calls
And the tears fall like rain
It's so hard letting go
Of the one thing I'll never replace
And soon you will be gone
But these words they will live on...oh

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I'll miss you so
And though our days come to an end
No I'll never love like this again
What a wonderful life my friend

All that I am
You let me be
I will remember you
For all that you've done
And given to me...oh

Love will remain
This I can see
Now and forever more
Because of you
Now I believe
I believe

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I loved you so

What a wonderful life
For as long as you've been at my side
And I want you to know
I'll miss you so
And though our days come to an end
No I'll never love like this again
What a wonderful life
A wonderful life
What a wonderful life
A wonderful life...oh yeah

And with one last embrace
As the tears fall like rain you're gone
And with one last goodbye
As you fade out tonight you're gone---Lyrics submitted by Craig.
