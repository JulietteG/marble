Drank so much last night
I think that I drowned
But now my cup is empty
No one has seen my will around
Now my heart is aching
Sometimes I fall asleep for days
But my bed is empty
I know I am too set in my ways
Tell all I am ok

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on

Flew so high last night
I think that I fell to the ground so heavy
Woke up to find this living hell
It used to be so easy
Hard to tell my nights now from my days
The curtains hide my feelings
Don't feel I have any right to pray
And they will find me someday, Someday

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on

And whatever takes us away
Will be the same to drive us on (x2)

Remember to find a new way
A way to see it all
You'll find us living away
And soon it will be gone
Remember to find a new day
Remember to carry on

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on---Lyrics submitted by jacinta.
