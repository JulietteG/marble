And as your will is bent and broken
And every vision has been cast into the wind
As your courage crashes down before your eyes
Don't lay down and die

Cause I see in you 
More than you'll ever know
And I ask you why
You question the strength inside
And you need to know 
How it feels to be alive

When every wound has been reopened 
And in this world of give and take you must have faith 
And the distance to your dreams stretch beyond reach 
Don't lay down and die

Cause I see in you
More than you'll ever know 
And I ask you why
You question the strength inside
And you need to know
How it feels to be alive

How it feels
How it feels to be alive
How it feels 
How it feels to be alive
How it feels 
How it feels to be alive

Oh

Cause I see in you
More than you'll ever know
And I ask you why
You question the strength inside
And you need to know 
How it feels to be alive

How it feels to be alive
How it feels to be alive---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
