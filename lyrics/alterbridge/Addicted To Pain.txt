Tell me how it feels to live a lie 
Tell me do you know that it won't ever be the same 
You can't deny, the house of cards just hit the floor 
Don't tell me you can save it in the end 
There's nothing you can do 
'cause when it's gone, you know it won't come back again 
But you don't listen anymore 

You're addicted to pain 
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows 
Too addicted to face 
In time you're gonna lose it all 

If only I had said this long ago 
If only I had found a way to tell you all the things you should've known 
But you were lost right from the start 
How the hell are you the one to blame 
You've done no wrong, you gave it all 
So why the hell did you have to change 
You broke your back, she broke your heart 

You're addicted to pain 
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows 
Too addicted to face 
In time you're gonna lose it all 

Cry out! 
You're nowhere now! 
She sold you out! 
You're gonna lose it all! 

Cry out! 
You're nowhere now! 
Just tear it down! 
You're gonna lose it all! 

[Solo] 

You're addicted to pain 
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows 
Too addicted to face 
In time you're gonna lose it all 

You're addicted to pain 
Sometimes it seems like nothing else matters 
You're too addicted to face 
In time you're gonna lose it all 

Cry out! 
You're nowhere now! 
In time you're gonna lose it all 
Cry out! 
You're nowhere now! 
You don't live it anymore
