Endless days
We search for one we hold inside
So hard to find
Luck turns
Will the fallen ever reach within
And rise again

[CHORUS]

For the rest of my life
I will find the answers
That were always here
I will find the meaning this time
I will fight the end
Till the end is here

Wasted time
With words that seem to break our will
They blind us still
Without a care
They tarnish what we hold so dear
What was once so clear

[CHORUS]X2---Lyrics submitted by jacinta.
