I should know by now,
I should see some how
How to bring her 'round,
How to breathe.

I dont make a sound,
Splinters hit the ground,
Silence screams so loud
As see leaves.

As the torch light shines
Through the heavy skies
Autumn waves her hand
Straight at me.

See her world fall down
As the trees turn brown
As she drifts away
And leaves.

As the lights go down
She won't leave this town with me.

There's more endless days,
Heaven slips away
And I still see her face
In broken dreams.

Words are left too late
In our last embrace, 
Pushed until she breaks
(Just like me).

As the lights go down
She won't leave this town.
As the lights go down
She won't leave this town with me.

Things I'd wish she'd say
Just to hear something
Left alone to a fate
That we don't yet see.

Then the moment fades,
The sun turns to slate,
Nothing stays the same,
She will leave.

As the lights go down
She won't leave this town.
As the lights go down
She won't leave this town.
As the lights go down
She won't leave this town with me.---
