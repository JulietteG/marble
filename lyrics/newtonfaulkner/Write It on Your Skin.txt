Take everything you know and write it on your skin
And you can carry on and forget everything
Take everything you own and put it in your car
You can drive away, drive away so far,
And drive into a lake and take off all your clothes,
Set your clothes on fire, now you are alone
But you've got all you know written on your skin,
So you can carry on and forget everything

All the things I'd rather be,
All the things I'd rather be

I can't, I can't, I can't stay around here
I can only leave

Take everything you know and write it on your skin
And you can carry on and forget everything
Take everything you own and put it in your car
You can drive away, drive away so far,
Then drive into a lake and take off all your clothes,
Set your clothes on fire, now you are alone
But you've got all you know written on your skin,
So you can carry on and forget everything

All the things I'd rather be,
All the things I'd rather be

I can't, I can't, I can't stay around here
I can only leave
I can't, I can't, I can't stay around here
I can only leave

Life feels like a music box, I'm spinning round slowly and I can't get off
And life feels like a music box, I'm spinning round slowly and I can't get off
(Let's start again)
And life feels like a music box (start again) I'm spinning round slowly and I can't get off (let's start again)
And life feels like a music box (start again) I'm spinning round slowly and I can't get off

I can't, I can't, I can't stay around here
I can only leave
I can't, I can't, I can't stay around here
I can only leave

I can't, I can't, I can't stay around here.---Lyrics submitted by martine.
