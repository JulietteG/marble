Off to the land of sleepy time I go.
i'm gonna take my shoes off at the door.
I'm gonna go where dreams like rivers flow.
When the alarm goes off I just won't know.
Wont you, come with me?
Wont you, before they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I feel alone when they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I'm gonna master all kinds of kung-foo.
I'm gonna live inside a tiny zoo.
I'm gonna grow my self a giant afro. (incredible)
When the alarm goes off i just won't know
Wont you, come with me?
Wont you, before they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I feel alone when they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I don't mind what's in store.
I'll make it in your own sweet time.
When i'm go, oh i don't wanna go.
Wont you, come with me?
Wont you, before they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I feel alone when they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.
I feel alone when they're gone in the morning.
I wanna know why they're gone in the morning.---Lyrics submitted by jessey.
