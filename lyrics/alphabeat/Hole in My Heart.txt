Youve made a hole in my heart
Youve made a hole in my heart
Youve made a hole in my heart
Youve made a hole in my heart

And they can say what they want
But it doesnt mean a thing
Even if they went inside me 
And changed everything
This hole s nothing that a doctor can cure
Its not a disease no, thats for sure

I was looking for a way to get close to you 
But I got inside, I got inside
Nothing in the world could pull me back again
Now Im inside, now Im inside

You, you turn me upside down
Whenever youre around
You turn me upside down

Youve made a hole in my heart
Youve made a hole in my heart

And the gap that you have made
Goes deep inside of me
Its all used to invate girl
Youve got my garanty
What this is you do to me its not been done before
I dont want to stop no, thats for sure

I was looking for a way to get close to you 
But I got inside, I got inside
Nothing in the world could pull me back again
Now Im inside, now Im inside

You, you turn me upside down
Whenever youre around
You turn me upside down (2x)


All I want to do is to do something with you
All I want to do is to do something with you


All I want to do is to do something with you

All I want to do is to do something with you

All I want to do is to do something with you

All I want to do is to do something with you


You, you turn me upside down
Whenever youre around
You turn me upside down (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Diana.
