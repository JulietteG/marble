Oh yeah you look at me
When my baby
Is taking my hand
And we're walking and talking
And my parents
They don't wanna see me
My friends say I'm uncool
But I let love rule

Oh yeah it's just because 
i'm crazy in love
crazy in love
Oh yeah it's just because 
i'm crazy in love
crazy in love

Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine

Oh Yeah we run away from private eyes,
to privacy,
my boy and me.

Oh yeah you look at me
When my baby
Is taking my hand
And we're walking and talking

Oh yeah it's just because 
i'm crazy in love
crazy in love

Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine

This boy really drives you mad 
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
You'll love him till you die

This boy really drives you mad 
And you know that ain't bad, 
oh yeah oh yeah

Oh yeah, It's just because 
I'm crazy in love
crazy in love
Oh yeah
It's just because 
I'm crazy in love
crazy in love

Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
