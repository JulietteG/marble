I am coming down, I was in the dark til the summer
Together we have a chance to start out the dance I'm falling, 
And in the burning sun to show everyone, head out the storm.
I was coming down, I was in the dark til the summer

One two three, you're in love with me, 
Oh oh
It's imagination three four five, way we dive.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Come on closer, uh uh uuuh
Come on close to me, jump up on me
Jump in the sea, jump up in
Jump with me, jump up in
The love sea will be.

We be hanging out somehwere in the clubs forever
Play my favorite shoes, just set by the Moon together
As good as it feels, can't be real
Too good to be true, 
I was coming down, I was in the dark til the summer

Hook:
One two three, you're in love with me, 
Oh oh
It's imagination three four five, way we dive... 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Come on closer, uh uh uuuh
Come on close to me, jump up on me
Jump in the sea, jump up in
Jump with me, jump up in
The love sea will be.

In the tropical paradise, 
Love can be as cold as ice, oh oh
In the acres of long ago, stays the feeling I wanna know oh oh.

(Beat break)

Jump up in, jump in the sea
Jump up in, uh oh oh.
Come on closer, uh uh uuuh
Come on close to me, jump up on me
Jump in the sea, jump up in
Jump with me, jump up in
The love sea will be.

Woooh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
