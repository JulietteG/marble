I Was Not Looking For Arty Farty Love,
I Wanted Someone To Love Completely,
Someone More Than Weekly,

I Was Looking For A Decent Boy,
For A Tender Glance,
Or A Safety Dance.

The Wuthering Heights,
And The Stormy Nights,
You Give Me Ten Thousand Nights Of Thunder And I Will Give Them All Back To You,
Your So Ohh ( Du Du ) 
So Ahh ( Du Du )
So Cool. 

You Came Like A Theif In The Night And Stole My Heart,
Like A Solitude Erasure,
Like An Elevator.

And I Know We'de Do Anything For Love ( Oh Yeah )
If Its You And Me. ( UhOh Oh Oh )
For All Eternity. ( UhOh Oh Oh )

The Wuthering Heights,
And The Stormy Nights,
You Give Me Ten Thousand Nights Of Thunder And I Will Give Them All Back To You,
Your So Ohh ( Du Du ) 
So Ahh ( Du Du )
So Cool. 

It Feels Like Ten Thousand Night Of Thunder When I Spend The Night With You,
Cause Your So Oooh. ( Du Du )
Your So Ahh.  ( Du Du )
So Cool.

And Baby Baby Your Irresistable,
And Im Insatiable, ( Ooh Ooh Ooh Oh Oh )
Yeaahh..
Life Is An Ocean, Sweet Emocion.  ( Sweet Emocion )

You Give Me Ten Thousand Night Of Thunder But I Will Give Them All Back To You,
Cause Your So Oooh  ( Du Du )
So Ahh. ( Du Du )
So Coool .

You Give Me Ten Thousand Night Of Thunder But I Spend The Night With You,
Cause Your So Oooh  ( Du Du )
So Ahh. ( Du Du )
So Coool .

Du Du Du 
Du Du Du
Du Du Du Duuu..---Lyrics submitted by Abee.
