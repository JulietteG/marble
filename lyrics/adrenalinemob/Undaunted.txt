You're all up in my face
You think this is your place
You wannabe!

You're running your big mouth
You're gonna get knocked out
You wannabe!

You step into my life
And I rock it big time
You wannabe!

Don't think you can beat me
You'll never defeat me
You're pushing me!

You Wannabe!
I stand undaunted!
You're gonna see
I an undaunted!

Don't think you can shake me
'Cause you'll never break me
You Wannabe!

You only get one round
It's time for the take-down
You wannabe

You're talking the big talk 
But I walk the big walk
You Wannabe!

You'll never forget me
You'll live to regret me
You're pushing me

You wannabe
I stand undaunted
Your gonna see
I am undaunted

Cant you walk away
Don't look at me
Listen what I say
You're just a wannabe

Cant you walk away
Don't look at me
Listen what I say
The fear inside of me

[Mike Orlando Solo :D]

I stand undaunted
You gonna see
I am undaunted
Don't look back, just walk away

I stand undaunted
You wannabe
I am undaunted---Lyrics submitted by Colin Wrightson.
