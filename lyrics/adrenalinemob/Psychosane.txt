Open wide and welcome in the storm
We've arrived to lay it down in stone
Here we stand, our blood's on fire

Let the river flow out of control
into a twisted state of mind
Put you six feet down and watch you drown
As we bury you alive

Heavy thunder blows my mind
Knocks me senseless all the time
The sound of lightning screams
I hear them melt my brain
Lord I'm going psychosane

Open wide and let the thunder roll
The familiar feeling in your soul
And soldiers we stand
We'll walk the wire

Let the river flow out of control
into a twisted state of mind
Put you six feet down and watch you drown
As we bury you alive

Heavy thunder blows my mind
Knocks me senseless all the time
The sound of lightning screams
I hear them melt my brain
Lord I'm going psychosane

Going psychosane
Motherfucking psychosane

Let the river flow out of control
into a twisted state of mind
Put you six feet down and watch you drown
As we bury you alive

Heavy thunder blows my mind
Knocks me senseless all the time
The sound of lightning screams
I hear them melt my brain
Lord I'm going psychosane

Psychosane
Lord I'm going psychosane ---Lyrics submitted by Colin Wrightson.
