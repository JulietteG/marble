I'm so tired of learning to talk
Building fences on the wall
In this state, I shall not remain

I don't want to go, but if I die young
Fill my empty room with the sun
Fill my empty room with the sun

This Don't matter like it did before
This don't matter much anymore

Change my mind or help me to try
Im afraid and I'm not satisfied
In this state I shall not remain

I don't want to go, but if I die young
Fill my empty room with the sun
Fill my empty room with the sun

This don't matter like it did before
This don't matter much anymore
This don't matter like it did before
This don't matter much anymore

Daylight is not the same
When your stabbing at the stars
In your eyes, and bleeding
Is what you see

This don't matter like it did before
This don't matter much anymore
This don't matter like it did before
This don't matter much anymore

This don't matter much anymore---Lyrics submitted by andrea.
