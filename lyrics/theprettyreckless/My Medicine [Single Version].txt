Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine 

Where you hurt where you sleep
And you sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and 
now you're gonna cry
You got a woman to the left
and a boy to the right
Start to sweat so hold me tight

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again

I'll drink what you leak
And I'll smoke what you sigh
Straight across the room with a look in your eye
I got a man to his left and a girl to his right
Start to sweat so hold me tight

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine

Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again

There's a tiger in the room
and a baby in the closet
Pour another drink mom
I don't even want it
Then I turn around and think I see 
someone that looks like you

You hurt where you sleep
You sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and 
now you're gonna cry
You got a woman to the left
and a boy to the right
Start to sweat so hold me tight

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine 
again (x8)

Somebody mixed my medicine (x3)
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine 
again (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Stormie.
