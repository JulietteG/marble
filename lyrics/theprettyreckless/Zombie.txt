I'm not listening to you
I am wondering right through
Existence

With no purpose and no drive
'Cause in the end we're all a lie
A lie

Two thousand years I've been awake
Waiting for the day to say

To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am, a zombie
Again, again, you want me
To fall on my head

I am, I am, I am, a zombie
How low, how low, how low, will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I
Lie down dead

Blow the smoke right off the tubes
Kiss my gentle burning bruise
I'm lost in time

And to all the people left behind
You're all walking dumb and blind
Blind

For two thousand years I've been awake
Waiting for the day to say

To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am, a zombie
Again, again, you want me
To fall on my head

I am, I am, I am, a zombie
How low, how low, how low, will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I
Lie down dead

To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am, a zombie
Again, again, you want me
To fall on my head

I am, I am, I am, a zombie
How low, how low, how low, will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I
Lie down dead

I'm dead, I'm dead
Dead

To all of you who've wronged me
I am, I am, a zombie
Again, again, you want me
To fall on my head

I am, I am, I am, a zombie
How low, how low, how low, will you push me
To go, to go, to go, before I
Lie down dead---Lyrics submitted by jackie.
