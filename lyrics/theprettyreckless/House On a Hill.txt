Somewhere in the end of all this hate
There's a light ahead
That shines into this grave that's in the end of all this pain

In the night ahead there's a light upon this
House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink their wine and they will, they will, they will

Somewhere in the end we're all insane
To think that light ahead can save us from this
Grave that's in the end of all this pain

In the night ahead there's a light upon this
House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink their wine and they will, they will, they will

I am not afraid
I won't burn out in this place
My intention is to fade and I will, I will

In this house on a hill
The dead are living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
Keep your children safe inside
Out of pocket, out of mind
Until they drink their wine and they will, they will, they will ---
