I was only 19, you were 29
Its just 10 years, but its such a long time
In a heartbeat, I would do it all again

Late night sex, smokin cigarettes
I try real hard but I cant forget
Now in a heartbeat, I would do it all again
Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now Im lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide

Ever since the day we died, well
Ive got nothing left to lose

After Jesus and Rock N Roll
Couldnt save my immoral soul, well
Ive got nothing left
Ive got nothing left to lose

Callin out sins just to pass the time
My life goes by in the blink of an eye
I know you want me
I was only lookin for a friend

And everything I was
And everything that Ive become
Just falls into the end and

Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now Im lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide

Ever since the day we died, well
Ive got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N Roll
Couldnt save my immoral soul, well
Ive got nothing left
Ive got nothing left to lose

Now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now Im lost somewhere
Lost between Elvis and suicide

Ever since the day we died, well
Ive got nothing left to lose
After Jesus and Rock N Roll
Couldnt save my immoral soul, well
Ive got nothing left
Ive got nothing left to lose---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
