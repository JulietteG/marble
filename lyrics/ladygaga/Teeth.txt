Dont be scared
Ive done this before
Show me your teeth
Dont want no money (want your money)

That shits is ugly
Just want your sex (want your sex)
Take a bit of my bad girl meat (bad girl meat)
Take a bite my me
Show me your teeth
Let me see your mean

Got no direction (no direction)
I need direction
Just got my vamp (got my vamp)

Take a bite of my bad girl meat (bad girl meat)
Take a bit of me boy
Show me your teeth
The truth is sexy

Tell me something thatll save me
I need a man who makes me alright (man who makes me alright)
Just tell me when its alright
Tell me something thatll change me

Im gonna love you with my hands tied
Show me your teeth
Just tell me when
Show me your teeth
Open your mouth boy
Show me your teeth
Show me whatcha got
Show me your teeth teeth teeth teeth

Got no salvation (no salvation)
Got no salvation
Got nor religion (no religion)
My religion is you
Take a bite of my bad girl meat (bad girl meat)
Take a bit of me boy
Show me your teeth
Im a tough bitch

Got my addictions (my addictions)
And I love to fix em (and I love to fix em)
No ones perfect
Take a bite of my bad girl meat (bad girl meat)
Take a bit of me boy
Show me your teeth
