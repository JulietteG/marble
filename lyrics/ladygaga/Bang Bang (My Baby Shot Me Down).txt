I was 5 and he was 6
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play?

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played, and people sang
Just for me, the church bells rang

Now hes gone, I dont know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
He didnt even say goodbye
He didnt take the time to lie

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, he hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down---
