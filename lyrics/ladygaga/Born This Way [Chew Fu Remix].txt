It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up 'cuz you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
we are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
in the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
she said 'cuz he made you perfect babe"
So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
listen to me when I say.

I'm beautiful in my way
'cuz God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret,
just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way.

Ooh there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooh there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way
Right track baby I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be.

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure,
I must be myself; respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin,
believe capital H-I-M
I love my life, I love this record and
mi amore vole fe yah (self DNA)

I'm beautiful in my way
'cuz God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret,
just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way.

Ooh there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooh there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today 'cuz baby you were born this way

No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track baby I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track baby I was born to be brave

I'm beautiful in my way
'cuz God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret,
just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way.

Ooh there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooh there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby I was born this way

I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way

I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way
