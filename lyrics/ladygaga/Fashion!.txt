Fashion!
Looking good and feeling fine (3x)
Sweat, sweat
Looking good and feeling fine (3x)

Fashion!
Step into the room
Like it's a catwalk
Fashion!
Singing to the tune
Just to keep them talking
Fashion!
Walk into the light
Display your diamonds and pearls in light
Fashion!
Married to the night
I own the World, we own the World

Look at me now!
Like we're on top of the World in my Fashion!
Look at me Now!
Like we're on top of the World in my Fashion!
Looking good and feeling fine (3x)
Sweat, sweat
Looking good and feeling fine (3x)
Sweat, sweat

You've got company
Make sure you look Your Best
Fashion!
Make up on your face
A new design dress
Fashion!
There's a life (?) in us
When their couture's beyond, beyond
Fashion!
Married to the stars!
I own the World, we own the World!

Look at me now!
Like we're on top of the World in my Fashion!
Look at me now!
Like we're on top of the World in my Fashion!
Looking good and feeling fine (3x)
Sweat, sweat
Looking good and feeling fine (3x)
Sweat, sweat

I take it off, I put it on
I feel alive, when I transform
But this love's not material
Now take it in, and turn me on
Zip me up, it can't be wrong
Cause your new look's immaterial
Looking good, and feeling fine (6x)

Je me sens
Fashion!
Donnez moi Christian Louboutins
Je me sens
Fashion!
Le monde est tmoin
C'est la vie en
Fashion!
Je suis en haute couture en
Fashion!
Je suis en haute couture en
Fashion!
Fashion, Fashion! (4x) ---
