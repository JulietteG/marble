A red wine 
Convict 
Gaga 
Ive had a little bit too much 
All of the people start to rush. 
Start to rush babe. 
How does he twist the dance? 
Cant find my drink oh man. 
Where are my keys, I lost my phone. 
Whats go-ing out on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I cant see straight anymore. 
Keep it cool whats the name of this club? 
I cant remember but its alright, alright. 

[Chorus] 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance. Spin that record babe. 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Duh-duh-duh-duh 
Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-just dance. 

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth. 
Howd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out babe. 
Control your poison babe 
Roses have thorns they say. 
And were all gettin hosed tonight. 
Whats go-ing out on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I cant see straight anymore. 
Keep it cool whats the name of this club? 
I cant remember but its alright, alright. 

[Chorus] 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance. Spin that record babe. 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Duh-duh-duh-duh 
Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-just dance. 

[Colby O' Donis] 
When I come through on the dance floor checkin out that catalogue. 
Cant believe my eyes so many women without a flaw. 

And I aint gonn give it up, steady tryna pick it up like the car 
Ima hit it, Ima hit it and flex until the til done until tomorr yeah. 
Show me I can see that you got so much energy 
The way you twirling up them hips round and round 
Theres no reason, I know why you cant leave here with me 
In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down. 


[Chorus Lady Gaga] 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance. Spin that record babe. 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance. Gunna be okay.

Im psychotic synchypnotic 
I got my blue burners and phonic 
Im psychotic synchypnotic

Im psychotic synchypnotic 
I got my blue burners and phonic

Don't slow. Drive it, clean it like so clean its been molesto, I got it, and your
