We are the crowd 
We're c-coming out 
Got my flash on it's true 
Need that picture of you 
It's so magical 
We'd be so fantastical 

Leather and jeans 
your watch glamorous 
Not sure what it means 
But this photo of us 
It don't have a price 
Ready for those flashing lights 
'Cause you know that baby I- 

I'm your biggest fan 
I'll follow you until you love me 
Papa-Paparazzi 
Baby there's no other superstar 
You know that I'll be your- 
Papa-Paparazzi 

Promise I'll be kind 
But I won't stop until that boy is mine 
Baby you'll be famous 
Chase you down until you love me 
Papa-Paparazzi 

I'll be your girl backstage at your show 
Velvet ropes and guitars 
Yeah cause you know I'm starting between the sets 
Eyeliner and cigarettes 

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and return 
My lashes are dry- But the teardrops I cry 
It don't have a price 
Loving you is Cherry Pie 
'Cause you know that baby I- 

I'm your biggest fan 
I'll follow you until you love me 
Papa-Paparazzi 
Baby there's no other superstar 
You know that I'll be your 
Papa-Paparazzi 

Promise I'll be kind 
But I won't stop until that boy is mine 
Baby you'll be famous 
Chase you down until you love me 
Papa-paparazzi 

Real good, We're dancing in the studio 
Stop-stopped, That shit on the radio 
Don't stop, for anyone 
We'll Blast it but we'll still have fun 

I'm your biggest fan 
I'll follow you until you love me 
Papa-Paparazzi 
Baby there's no other superstar 
You know that I'll be your 
Papa-Paparazzi 


Promise I'll be kind 
But I won't stop until that boy is mine 
Baby you'll be famous 
Chase you down until you love me
