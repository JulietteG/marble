There's no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
I've got a  reason you should take me home tonight

I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong, 
Tonight yeah babe, 
Tonight yeah babe, 
Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight

It's time to feel the rush, 
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall there in love

I'm on the edge of glory, 
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth, 
Out on the edge of glory, 
And I'm hanging on a moment with you, 
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you 
I'm on the edge with you
Another shot, before we kiss the other side, 
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright, alright
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah baby
Tonight, yeah baby
Who does it hurt if everybody knows my name tonight
Alright, alright

It's time to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run back to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall there in love

I'm on the edge of glory, 
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth, 
I'm on the edge of glory, 
And I'm hanging on a moment with you, 
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you 
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge of glory, 
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth, 
I'm on the edge of glory, 
And I'm hanging on a moment with you, 
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you 
I'm on the edge with you---Lyrics submitted by Lucy.
