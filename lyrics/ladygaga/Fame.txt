I can't help myself,
I'm addicted to a life of material.
It's some kind of joke,
I'm obsessivly opposed to the typical.
All we care about is;
Runway models, Cadillacs and Liquor bottles.
Give me something , I wanna be
Retro glamour, Hollywood yes we live for the,


Fame fame doin' it for the
Fame fame 'cuz we wanna live the live of
The rich and famous
Fame fame doing it for the fame fame
'Coz we gotta taste for champane
And endless fourtune.
Fame, fame,  baby the fame fame we 
live for the fame, fame fame baby the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby shame shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby fame fame

I can see myself in the movies,
With my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind and whatever
else you'd like to shoot you decide

All we care about is;
Pornographic, Girlson film and body plastic
Give me something I wanna see
Television and hot blondes in odd postions,

Fame doin' it for the
Fame 'cuz we wanna live the life of
The rich and famous
Fame fame doing it for the fame fame
'Coz we gotta taste for champane
And endless fourtune.
Fame, fame, baby fame fame do it 
For the fame, fame baby fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby shame shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby fame fame

Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah I'm gonna make it happen this time

(Instremental)

Fame fame doin' it for the
Fame fame 'cuz we wanna live the life of
The rich and famous
Fame fame doing it for the fame fame
'Coz we gotta taste for champane
And endless fourtune. x2---Lyrics submitted by lady.
