Dont call me Gaga 
Ive never seen one like that before 
Dont look at me like that 
You amaze me 

He ate my heart 
He a-a-ate my heart 
(You little monster) 

He ate my heart 
He a-a-ate my heart out 
(You amaze me) 

He ate my heart
He a-a-ate my heart (2x)

Look at him 
Look at me 
That boy is bad 
And honestly 
Hes a wolf in disguise 
But I cant stop staring in those evil eyes 

I asked my girlfriend if shed seen you round before 
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor baby 
We mightve fucked not really sure, dont quite recall 
But something tells me that Ive seen him, yeah 

That boy is a monster 
M-M-M-Monster 
That boy is a monster 
M-M-M-Monster 
That boy is a monster 
M-M-M-Monster
That boy is a monster
Er-er-er-er-er

He ate my heart 
(I love that girl) 
He ate my heart 
(Wanna talk to her, shes hot as hell) (2x)

He licked his lips 
Said to me 
Girl you look good enough to eat 
Put his arms around me 
Said Boy now get your paws right off me

I asked my girlfriend if shed seen you round before 
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor baby 
We mightve fucked not really sure, dont quite recall 
But something tells me that Ive seen him, yeah 

That boy is a monster 
M-M-M-Monster 
That boy is a monster 
M-M-M-Monster 
That boy is a monster 
M-M-M-Monster
That boy is a monster
Er-er-er-er-er

He ate my heart 
(I love that girl) 
He ate my heart 
(Wanna talk to her, shes hot as hell) (2x)

He ate my heart 
He ate my heart 
Instead hes a monster in my bed (2x)

I wanna Just Dance 
But he took me home instead 
Uh oh! There was a monster in my bed 
We french kissed on a subway train 
He tore my clothes right off 

He ate my heart then he ate my brain 
Uh oh uh oh 
He ate my heart
he a-a-ate my heart
he ate my heart
(Wanna talk to her, shes hot as hell)

That boy is a monster 
M-m-m-monster 
(Could I love him?) 

That boy is a monster 
M-m-m-monster 
(Could I love him?) 

That boy is a monster 
M-m-m-monster 
(Could I love him?) 

That boy is a monster 
Er-er-er-er-er (2x)
