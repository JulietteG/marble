I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves
The way she walks
I touch myself cant get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears
And all the lies
I touch myself and its alright

Just give in
Dont give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes cuz were having a good time

Eh-eh
Eh-eh
So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah Ill love you forever
Up in the clouds
Well be higher than ever

Eh-eh
Eh-eh
So happy I could die
And its alright

Eh-eh
Eh-eh

Ye-ha

I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair
I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night
And when something fall out of place
I take my time
I put it back
I touch myself
Till Im on track

Just give in
Dont give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes cuz were having a good time

So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah Ill love you forever
Up in the clouds
Well be higher than ever

So happy I could die
And its alright
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes cuz were having a good time

So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah Ill love you forever
Up in the clouds
Well be higher than ever

So happy I could die
And its alright
