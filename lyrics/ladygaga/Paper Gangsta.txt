Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand 
Dinkin Lincoln, sand-script with a fan 
Remembering me, before it began 
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam 

Cuz the ones who loved me, told me to stop 
Like homegirl can't catch shit if it drops 
A superwoman chick, you know that I am 
Some shit don't fly by me in a man 

Cuz I do not accept any less 
Than someone just as real, as fabulous 

[CHORUS]
Dont want no paper gangsta
Wont sign away my life to 
Someone whose got the flavor 
But dont have no follow through 
Dont want no paper gangsta
Wont sign no monkey papers 
I dont do funny business 
Not interested in fakers 
Dont want no paper gangsta
oh ohhhh 
Dont want no paper gangsta
oh ohhhh

Got something really shiny to start 
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart? 
I've heard it before 
Yeah, the dinners were nice 
Till your diamond words melted into some ice 

You should been rapping to the beat of my song Mr. California, 
paper gangsta and Im lookin for love, not an 
empty page full of stuff that means nothing but
youve been played

Cuz I do not accept any less 
Than someone just as real, as fabulous 

[CHORUS X3]---Lyrics submitted by kristina.
