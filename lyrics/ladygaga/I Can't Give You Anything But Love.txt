(feat. Tony Bennett)

I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Scheme a while dream a while
We're sure to find
Happiness and I guess

All those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day
You know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love---
