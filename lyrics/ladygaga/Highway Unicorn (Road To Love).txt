We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

Run, run with the t- (repeats)

Run, run with the top down baby, she flies
Run, run with the fury of the saint in her eyes
Run, run hide your cha-cha, baby she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes

Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

Im on the road, Im on the road to love

Im on the road, Im on the road to love

Shes just an American riding a dream
And shes got rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
They dont care if your papers or your love is the law
Shes a free soul burning roads with the flag in her bra

Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely road, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

Im on the road, Im on the road to love
Im on the road, Im on the road to love

Get your hot rods ready to rumble cuz were gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble cuz were gonna drink until we die
Get your hot rods ready to rumble cuz were gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble cuz were gonna drink until we die---Lyrics submitted by Nathy.
