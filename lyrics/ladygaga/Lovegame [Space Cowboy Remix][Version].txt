Let's have some fun,
this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's have some fun,
this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you,
but if I do then I might miss you babe
It's comlicated and stupid
got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Because he want's to play
wants to play
A love game 
A love game

Hold me and love me
I just wanan touch you for a minute,
baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun this beat is sick,
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think to much
just bust that kick I wanna take a ride on you disco stick

Let's play a love game,
play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Know the love game

I'm on a mission
and it involves some heavy touchin ya.
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, Yes
and now I want it bad,
want it bad
A love game
A love game.

hold me and love me just wanna touch you for a minute
baby three second is enough for my haert to quit.

Let's have some fun
this beat is sick,
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick.

Let's play a love game,
play a love game
do you want love or you want fame?
are you in the game?
Know the love game

I can't see you starin' there from across the block with a smile
on you mouth and you hand on your huh!
The story of us it starts with a boy and a girl and a huh, and 
a game!!
and a game,
and a game,
and a game.
A love game.

Let's play a love game.
play a love game
do you want love or you want fame?
are you in the game?
Know the love game

Let's have some fun,
this beat is sick I wanna
take a ride on your disco stick.---Lyrics submitted by britt.
