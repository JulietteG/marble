In your brown eyes
I walked away
In your brown eyes
I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes
You'll watch her go
Then turn the record on
And wonder what when wrong
What went wrong?

If everything
Was everything
But everything is over
Everything
Could be everything
If only we were older
I guess it's just
A silly song about you
And how I lost you
And your
Brown eyes

In your brown eyes
I was feeling low
Cause the brown eyes
And you never know 
Got some brown eyes
But i saw her face
I knew that it was wrong 
So baby, turn the record on
Play that song

Where everything 
Was everything
But everything is over
Everything
Could be everything
If only we were older
I guess it's just
A silly song about you
And how I lost you
And your
Brown eyes
Brown eyes

Everything
Was everything 
But baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything
But it's time to say goodbye
So, get your last fix
And your last hit 
Grab your old 
Go and plan new tricks
Honey, yeah it's no surprise 
That i got lost 
In your brown eyes

In your brown eyes
Brow-ow-own
Brow-ow-own
Eyes
In your brown eyes

Brow-ow-own
Brow-ow-own
Eyes
Got some brown eyes

Brow-ow-own
Brow-ow-own
Eyes
Your brown eyes---Lyrics submitted by lucia.
