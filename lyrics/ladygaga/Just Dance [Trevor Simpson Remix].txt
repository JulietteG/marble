Red One 
Konvict 
Ga Ga (oh, yeah) 

Ive had a little bit too much 
All of the people start to rush. Start to rush by. 
How does he twist the dance? 
Cant find my drink oh man. 
Where are my keys, I lost my phone? 

Whats go-ing on on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I cant see straight anymore. 
Keep it cool, whats the name of this club? 
I cant remember but its all right, a-alright. 

Chorus: 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Da-da-doo-doo 
Just dance. Spin that record babe. 
Da-da-doo-doo 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Duh-duh-duh 
Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-ju-ju-just dance. 

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth. 
Howd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out babe. 
Control your poison babe 
Roses have thorns they say. 
And were all gettin hosed tonight. 

Whats go-ing on on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I cant see straight anymore. 
Keep it cool, whats the name of this club? 
I cant remember but its all right, a-alright. 

Chorus 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Da-da-doo-doo 
Just dance. Spin that record babe. 
Da-da-doo-doo 
Just dance. Gunna be okay. 
Duh-duh-duh 
Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-ju-ju-just dance. 


(Colby O`Donis)
When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalogue. 
Cant believe my eyes so many women without a flaw. 
And I aint gon give it up, steady tryna pick it up like the call 
Ima hit it, Ima hit it and flex until the til done until tomorr yeah. 
(Akon)
