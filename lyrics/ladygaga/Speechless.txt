Hooow?
Haaaa-oooo-wow?
H-ooow?
How

I cant believe what you said to me
Last night when we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby you gave up, you gave up

I cant believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

Ill never talk again
Oh boy youve left me speechless
Youve left me speechless, so speechless

and ill never love again
Oh boy youve left me speechless
Youve left me speechless, so speechless

I cant believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams, bubble dreams

I cant believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
Hes gonna get you and after hes through
Theres gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that its complicated
But Im a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

Ill never talk again
Oh boy youve left me speechless
Youve left me speechless so speechless

Ill never love again,
Oh friend youve left me speechless
Youve left me speechless, so speechless

Hooow?
Haaaa-oooo-wow?
H-ooow?
How

Haaaa-oooo-wow?
H-ooow?
How

And after all the drinks and bars that weve been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you?

And after all the boys and girls that weve been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up?

If I promise boy to you
That Ill never talk again
And Ill never love again
Ill never write a song
Wont even sing along

Ill never love again
ah ah ah
So speechless baby
haha
You left me speechless, so speechless baby
Why you so speechless, so speechless?

 you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
Youve left me speechless
so speechless

Some men they follow me
But you choose death and company
Why you so speechless? Oh oh---Lyrics submitted by zena.
