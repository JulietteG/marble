Times have changed
And weve often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.
If today, any shock they should try to stem,
Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And goods bad today
And blacks white today
And days night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

So though Im not a great romancer
I know that youre bound to answer
When I propose, anything goes ---
