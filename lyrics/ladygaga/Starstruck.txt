Groove slam work it back
Filter that baby bump that track
Groove slam work it back
Filter that baby bump that track
Groove slam work it back
Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room, so starstruck
cherry cherry cherry cherry boom boom

Rollin up to the club on the weekends
Stylin out to the beat that youre freakin
Fantasize on the track that youre tweakin
Blow my heart up
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavour
Cue me up on the twelve on the table
Im so starstruck

so Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)

Baby now that were alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist
Got your dirty headphones with the left side on
Wanna smack it back and forth back and forth uhuh
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavour
Put the brake down first
the chorus to the verse (reverse)

so Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)

Hey, and Im all like really really is that him 
I havent seen you before, and youve got them big wheels 
Into that cash flow, Im a fan of you, dont trip 
Shawty say hand over you signature right here 
Like its just a dotted line and Im supposed to sign 
How she at it a fanatic and I think its goin down 
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck 
Like she had an overdose, to many starbucks 
Aint never seen a baller, paper thats that taller 
Stunners that let their top back on their Chevy impalas 
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers 
What did you call that when she only worth two dollars 
But thats another chapter, son of a bachelor 
All on me, then start it up baby act up 
So please swagger, theyre gonna dagger 
She got what she wants 
Shawty happily ever after

Im so starstruck (struck)
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
(and so what)
Starstruck,
baby 'cause you blow my heart up
