DUET
This one here--it come into my world.
I can't tell if it's a boy or girl.
The ugliest thing that's ever been seen.
But then I want and need and all it does is sing.

It got some hairs on the top of its head.
Four be alive, yes, the other three be dead.
It's got two feet like a bathroom mat.
It come from miles away, go, "smack, boom, boom, smack."

It's got two teeth in the middle of its mouth,
One pointin' north, boys, the other's pointin' south.
Well, why's that wart on the end of your nose?
I've never heard you speak a word so I guess we'll never know.

I named this beast Magalina Hagalina.
You're musky and crusty. You're famously obscene.
And it don't matter that your voice is true
Because the Lord has put a curse onto you.

(Now, Munly went to east coast schools.)
(He thinks he is so deep.)
(But the deepest thing on Munly)
(Are the divots in his cheeks.)

(You named me Magalina Hagalina, true.)
(But the Lord has brought me unto you.)

(Now, Munly, I'd like to teach you that beauty is deeper than skin.)
(Each and all's got a beauty so deep within.)
(Good people all come and sing along.)
(Help Munly Munly learn the beauty in my song.)---Lyrics submitted by RAM.
