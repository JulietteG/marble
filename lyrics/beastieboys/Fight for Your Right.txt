Kick it!
You wake up late for school man you don't wanna go
You ask your mom please but she still says no
You miss two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk

You gotta fight
For your right
To Party

Your pop caught you smoking man he said no way
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag...Busted

You gotta fight
For your right
To Party

You gotta fight

Toss you out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said what's that noise
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the beastie boys.

You gotta fight
For your right
To Party

You gotta fight
For your right
To Party
