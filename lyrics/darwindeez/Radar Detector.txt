You and I buy star maps
And drive my car around Los Angeles
You and I buy star maps
And ding-dong-ditch a televangelist

It's only been a week
But I know that you are mine to keep

You are a radar detector
I drive 1,000 miles an hour
I won't go on and on 
But you are always looking out for me

You and I go shopping 
And find exactly what we're looking for
You and I go shopping 
And fall asleep inside the mattress store

We cruise the neighborhood
But it's not supposed to feel this good

You are a radar detector
I drive 1,000 miles an hour
I won't go on and on
But you are always looking out for me

Because
You are a radar detector (x17)
I drive 1,000 miles an hour
And I won't go on and on and on and
But you are always looking out for me

When I'm driving I'm driving I'm driving around
You are a radar detector
You are a radar detector

When I'm driving I'm driving I'm driving around
You are a radar detector 
You are a radar detector---Lyrics submitted by Joelle.
