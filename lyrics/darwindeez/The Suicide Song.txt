From the window ledge I fall
Watch my necktie whip back in the wind
From the top of an office building
I can't even see why I should live

"But don't give up" they all say 
But I'm not giving up anything anyway
On the way down I see your face
It's laughing at one of my idiot boy mistakes

But you can laugh now
'Cause it's over
Have one last laugh watching me go to waste

'Cause I don't need a reason why
Does anyone?
Does anyone?
No, I don't need a reason why
Does anyone?
Oh, does anyone?
Does anyone?---Lyrics submitted by Joelle.
