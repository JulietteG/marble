I hope that the last page
Of your 800 page novel is missing
I hope that it rains if 
You leave the window down on your red mustang

'Cause everyday ought to be a bad day for you
Everyday ought to be a bad day for you

If you drop your keys
I hope there's a sewer somewhere there nearby
I hope that your team lost
I hope the new girl takes off with the new guy

'Cause everyday ought to be a bad day for you
Everyday ought to be a bad day for you

And I would like to be your 
girlfriend so I could dump you
And I would like to be your 
garbage man so I would never have to pick up your trash again

Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
Oh!

'Cause everyday ought to be a bad day for you
Everyday ought to be a bad day for you
Everyday ought to be a bad day for you

'Cause everyday ought to be a bad day for you
But I'm sorry if it ever is
I'm sorry if it ever is
I'm sorry if it ever is
I'm sorry if it ever is---Lyrics submitted by Joelle.
