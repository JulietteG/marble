Chorus:
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy O
(Repeat twice at the beginning)

I am a weaver, a Calton weaver
I am a brash and a roving blade
I got silver in my britches
And I follow a roving trade

Chorus

As I went into Glasgow city
Nancy Whiskey I did to smell
I walked in, sat down beside her
Seven long years I loved her well

Chorus

The more I kissed her, the more I knew her
The more I loved her, the more she smiled
I forgot my mother's teaching
Nancy soon had me beguiled

Chorus

I woke early in the mornin'
Lying halfway off the bed
I tried to rise but was not able
Nancy damn near knocked me dead

Chorus


I'll gang back to the Calton weaving
I'll surely make those shuttles fly
I'll make more at the Calton weaving
Than ever I did in a roving way

Chorus

All you weavers, Calton weavers
All you Weavers where e're ye be
Beware of Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
She'll ruin you, she ruined me
