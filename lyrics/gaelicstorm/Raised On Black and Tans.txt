Uno, Dos, Tres
I was rasied on black and tans well Ronnie Drew and Van the Man
I go off to mass on sunday, and then its back to the pub on monday.
I got a sister meagan with a Celtic cross tattoo.
Ill tell you a few stories and every one of them is true.

*Chorus*My Mothers brothers sisters cousins anties uncle barnies fathers brother had a cousin from Killarney.*Chorus*

Well my great grandad and his mates, they tried to make it to the states.
His great uncle, he was a failure, he got deported off to Australia.
So they stowed upon a steamer on the famous white star line. 
I was raised upon these stories since I was the age of nine.

Chorus

Well my great uncle he liked the races,
He liked the dogs and steeple chases.
His wife my dear old antie she kept a tea shop way way down in Bantry.
But he fixed a race in Donegal and nows hes got to hide
but the sticky buns and cakes and gowns and whisky on the side.

Chorus

I was rasied on black and tans well Ronnie Drew and Van the Man.
I go to mass on sunday, and then its back to the pub on Monday.
Im from the wrong side of the southside of an Irish neighborhood.
Ive never been to Ireland but I know it's in my blood.
