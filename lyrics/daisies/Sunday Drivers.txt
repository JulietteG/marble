Gin and tonic alcoholic, stereophonic melancholic, I'm on
Sunday drivers, sunday driving, where theyre driving, who knows?
Too much beer on friday night you can't remember what it's like to breath
Hydroponic, supersonic, acrophobic, claustrophobic, alone

And we are, know that were all alone
And we are, know that were all alone
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home

Apologetic, pornographic, psychiatric, telepathic, they know
Sunday drivers, sunday driving, where theyre driving, nowhere to go
Too much beer on friday night you can't remember what it's like to laugh
Apologetic, pornographic, psychiatric, telepathic, supersonic, hydroponic, alcoholic

And we are, know that were all alone
And we are, know that were all alone
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home---Lyrics submitted by Eddie Phanichkul.
