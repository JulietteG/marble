Laredo rose, your garden has a scent of cheep parfum.
The sun is a stranger to you, how's the rose suppose to grew.
Laredo rose, a rose that hangs from your bed host.
A man you just met kissed her, stumbles, putten on his clothes.

As he walks away, you watch caddilac play, on a photograph.
A husband and a son and a daughter,
You bought her a dress today, to sent them all away.

Laredo rose, your garden has a scent of cheep parfum.
The sun is a stranger to you, how the rose suppose to grew.

Solo......

Couple bills on the dressoir, father confessing,
Knows away it is a sin.
Many times they've been pay, as shure as night, follows day,
You'll be paying again, till heaven knows when.

And heaven knows, how it will looks down for the party fall
And even footsteps grow thing till, as they echoed down the hall

Laredo rose, your garden has a scent of sheep parfum.
The sun is a stranger to you, how the rose supose to grew.

The sun is a stranger to you, how the rose supose to grew. ---Lyrics submitted by Naomi Clifford.
