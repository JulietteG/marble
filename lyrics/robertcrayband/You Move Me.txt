It's been so long
I really need to see you, baby
So long

When I called you up
And talked to you yesterday, baby
You really rocked me
Oh, you rocked me

I made my promise to you, darling
And I'm gonna do what needs be done
You've made me understand, baby
That hearts ain't made from stone
The things you do to me, yeah

Three o'clock in the morning
I wake up
Can't go back to sleep

I get a real, real, real good feeling
Way down inside
Knowing you're in love with me

It's so hard
To be away from you, baby
Only makes me want you more

You're so good to me, baby
It makes it hard to walk out that door
But, oh, the things you do to me, yeah

I made my promise now, darling
And I'm gonna do what needs be done, yes I am
You've made me understand, baby
That hearts ain't made from stone
And, oh, the things you do to me, yeah

Oh, the things you do to me
It's so hard to be away from you, baby
Oh, those things you do to me, yeah
The things you do to me
Aww, you really rock me, you rock me, you rock me, baby ---
