Verse One (Kandi): 
Come a little bit closer and look into my eyes, 
If only for a moment, boy don't be surprised. 
I want you right here next to me, 
So tell me can we spend some time. 
So I can hold you softly, 
In these gentle arms of mine. 
And the moonlight's gazing,ooh, 
Shining on my window pane, 
Beaming down on the midnight hour, 
I hear the sound of rain. 

Chorus: 
Tonight, tonight, ooh... 
Tonight, tonight, ooh... 

Verse Two (Tamika): 
So why don't you stay awhile, 
I can't help it if you put me in a daze boy. 
But you look so good to me, 
In your satin PJs. 
So let's make love by candlelight, 
And listen to the quiet storm. 
As I kiss you in the places, 
That make your body warm. 

Repeat Chorus 

Break: 
I'm holding you 
(Repeat x6) 
Holding you tight all through the night 
(Repeat x2) 
Looks like it's gonna rain
Looks like its gonna rain baby
c'mon baby now c'mon c'mon
Looks like its gonna rain

Holding you tight all through the night 
(Repeat x2) 
And I'll make you say yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
yeahhhhhhhh Holdin you tonight---Lyrics submitted by Meshelle.
