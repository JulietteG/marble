Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...
Mmm...mmm...mmm...

What I need from you is understanding
How can we communicate
If you dont here what I say (Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...)
What I need from you is understanding
So simple as 1-2-3
Understanding is what we need

You dont even know me
You just wanna do what you wanna do
Thats not the way it should be, no
You should listen to me, boy {You better listen to me, boy}

I try so very hard
To make you understand
But the choices you make
Baby, theyre old to me, oh

I try so very hard
To keep our love alive
But you dont wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

Theres no way that we can work it out
If we dont pull together
I dont mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you is understanding (Ooh...)
How can we communicate (Mmm....mmm...mmm...)
If you dont here what I say
What I need from you is understanding (Mmm...hmm...)
So simple as 1-2-3 (Yeah)
Understanding is what we need

I listen to you, baby
And I know the things your goin through
I try to understand
Thats why Im still with you, baby {Im still with you}

See, every day were living
Is one thing that will always be unsure
Thats why I need you, baby, pleading, baby
Please let our love endure

I try so very hard
To keep our love alive
But you dont wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

And theres no way that we can work it out
If we dont pull together
I dont mean to be demanding
I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you is understanding (All I need, babe, is understanding)
How can we communicate
If you dont here what I say (You dont hear what I say)
What I need from you is understanding (All I need from you, baby)
So simple as 1-2-3 (Cant you see, 1-2-3, mmm)
Understanding is what we need

All I need , all I need
All need is understanding
How
If you dont here what I say
Cant you see, baby
Ooh...

I try so very hard
To keep our love alive (Yes, I do)
But you dont wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

Theres no way that we can work it out [No way]
If we dont pull together
I dont mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you is understanding (Understanding)
How can we communicate (Now how can we communicate)
If you dont here what I say (Please hear what I say, yeah)
What I need from you is understanding (Come on, baby, come on)
So simple as 1-2-3 (Its so simple as 1-2-3)
Understanding is what we need

What I need from you is understanding (All I need from you, whoa)
How can we communicate (How can we communicate)
If you dont here what I say (Oh)
What I need from you is understanding (Understanding)
So simple as 1-2-3 (Ooh...oh)
Understanding is what we need

What I need from you is understanding---Lyrics submitted by jalisa.
