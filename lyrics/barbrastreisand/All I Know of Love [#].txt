Barbra:
Once I found the perfect love 
And you showed me everything there was 
to know of love 
Time will not betray the truth 
And for all the years we've shared 
I celebrate with you 
For you...

Josh: Un giorno t'incontrai 
Barbra: And me
Josh: Pensai, "Adesso lei"
Barbra: Will be...
Josh: D'allora insieme noi...

Both: 
Forever
You are all I know of love 
How could I ask for more 
You're everything I'm dreaming of 
You're all I need from love 
And every star above 
Spells out your name 
I swear I'll always feel the same 
You're all I want

Barbra: From love
Josh: All I want from love 
Dimmi
Barbra: (Humming)
Josh: Che per l'eternita
Barbra: Like a memory
Josh: Mi terrai ad abitare nei pensieri tuoi
Con te
Barbra: You are my only heart
Josh: In te 
Barbra: I loved you from the start
Josh: Noi due
Barbra: Together not apart

Both: 
Forever
You are all I know of love 
How could I ask for more 
You're everything I'm dreaming of 
You're all I need from love 
And every star above 
Spells out your name 
I swear I'll always feel the same 
You're all Want

Josh: From love

Both: 
You're all I want from love

Josh: Pensami
Barbra: I think of him
Josh: Perche'io sogno te
Barbra: You'll be with me
Josh: Due cuori e un anima
Barbra: My love flows free through you
Josh: ...E liberi
Barbra: I live my whole life
Josh: I'll live my life

Both: 
To be with you 
You'll always be the one who taught me
Everything my heart knows to be sure 
My heart knows you 
You're all I know of love 
How could I ask for more 
You're everything I'm dreaming of 
You're all I need from love

Barbra: And every star above
Josh: Every star above

Both: 
Spells out your name 
I swear I'll always feel the same 
You're all I want

Josh: From love
Barbra: You're all I want from love

Both: 
You're all I know of love---Lyrics submitted by Alda.
