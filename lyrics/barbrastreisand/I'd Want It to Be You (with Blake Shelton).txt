Time has a way of changing everything
That goes for almost anything but us
Always have and I always will remain
Words from a heart that you can trust

While others come and go
You can always know
I'm here for you
Whenever you might need me

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

You're still sweet as a honeybee, after all these years
And you'll always be that funny girl to me
Season to season we'll always have a reason
You mean, to be the best of friends that we can be

Someone you can turn to (I turn to you)
Every minute of the day
Warm memories to hold on to
That will never fade away

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

You're like a sweet familiar song
A good book when I'm alone
A cup of coffee when I'm cold
A country road that leads me home

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

Until I make it home again
I thank God he gave me you
We'll stay the way we were forever true
There's no one in this world that's been
A better friend to me than you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
