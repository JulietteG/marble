(Verse)
They say there's a universal plan
 for every woman, for every man.
I do believe there's a higher power 
but in our darkest hour it's hard to understand.
So we start to question, start to doubt.
We lose faith in what life's all about.
Why did the right road take the wrong turn?
Why did our heart break?
Why'd we get burned?
Just like the seasons, there are reasons for the path we choose.
There are no mistakes,
Just leasons to be learned.

(Verse)
Don't give up, keep on looking deep inside.
Let your heartbeat be your guide.
'Cause there's a gift for those who keep believing.
You'll find what you've been needing is right before your eyes.
You'll hold the answer in your hands
And then you'll know,
You'll finally understand.
Why did the right road take the wrong turn?
Why did our heart break 
And why'd we get burned?
Just like the seasons, there are reasons for that path we take.
Thee are no mistakes, just leasons to be learned.

(Bridge)
No matter how many times you stumble or fall,
The greatest leason is loving yourself through it all....

Why did that right road take that wrong turn?
Why did our heart break?
Why'd we get burned? 
Just like the seasons, there are reasons for the path we take. 
There are no mistakes, just leasons, leasons to be learned.---Lyrics submitted by Tracy.
