(with Elvis Presley)

Wasn't it just yesterday
When you held me near
Whispering the sweetest words
That I long to hear

Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go

You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled

For my darlin' I love you
And I always will

Love me tender
Love me long
Take me to your heart

For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled

For my darlin' I love you
And I always will

Love me tender
Love me true
Tell me that you're mine

I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time

Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled

For my darlin' I love you
And I always will

And I always will---
