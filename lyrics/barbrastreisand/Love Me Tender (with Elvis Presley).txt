Wasn't it just yesterday
when you held me near
Whispering the sweetest words
that I longed to head

Love me tender,
love me sweet,
never let me go

You have made my life complete
and I love you so

Love me tender,
love me true,
all my dreams fulfilled

For my darling I love you
and I always will

Love me tender
(Love me tender)
love me long
take me to your heart

For it's there that I belong,
and we'll never part

Love me tender,
love me true
all my dreams fulfilled

For my darling I love you
and I always will

Love me tender,
love me true
tell me you are mine

I'll be yours through all the years
till the end of time

Love me tender,
love me true
all my dreams fulfilled

For my darling I love you
(I love you)
and I always will
and I always will---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
