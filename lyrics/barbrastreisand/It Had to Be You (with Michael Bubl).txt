Seems like dreams like I always had
Could be, should be making me glad
Why am I blue?
It's up to you to explain
I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away
Someday, some way, you'll come and say
It's you I need and you'll be pleading in vain

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wondered around, finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad
Thinking of you

Some others I've seen,
Might never be mean, might never be cross,
Or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do
'Cause nobody else gave ma a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, crazy old you, it had to be you---
