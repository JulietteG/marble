Forget what you've been told
Before we grow old
Make you remember
Not a single word

It will be you
To know where you are going
Flowers to grow
Instantly

It will be you
To know where you are going
Flowers to grow
Instantly

Feel your own hands
Fingers that will lead you
Somewhere, you want
To be forever soon

It will be you
To know where you are going
Flowers to grow
Instantly

It will be you
To know where you are going
Flowers to grow
Instantly

It will be you
To know where you are going
Flowers to grow
Instantly---Lyrics submitted by Hannah Nikka.
