Cause I lost my job
Two weeks before Christmas
And I talked to Jesus at the sewer
And the Pope said it was none of his God-damned business

While the rain drank champagne
My Estonian Archangel came and got me wasted
Cause the sweetest kiss I ever got
Is the one I've never tasted

Oh but they'll take
Their bonus pay
To Molly McDonald,
Neon ladies, 
Beauty is that which obeys,
Is bought or borrowed...

Cause my heart's become a crooked hotel
Full of rumours
But it's I who pays the rent
For these fingered-face out-of-tuners
And I make 16 solid half hour friendships
Every evening

Cause your queen of hearts who is half a stone and likes to laugh alone
Is always threatening you with leaving..

Oh, but they play
Those token games
On Willy Thompson
And give a medal to replace the son
Of Mrs. Annie Johnson

Cause they told me everybody's got to pay their dues
And I explained that I had overpaid them

So overdued I went to the company store
and the clerk there said that they had just been invaded
So I set sail in a teardrop
And escaped beneath the doorsill

Cause the smell of her perfume
Echoes in my head still

Cause I see my people trying to drown the sun
In weekends of whiskey sours
Cause how many times can you wake up in this comic book
And plant flowers?---Lyrics submitted by juanj mdo.
