Pressure (8x)

I am the killer of the sun
Just a glimpse of what I have become
You can't tell shelter from the shade
Shadows move and leave you wide awake

Collect your tears, shoot 'em down
Even giants hit the ground
Hit the ground

Felt the pressure, seen the breaks
Let the fortune teller take it all, all
Pressure!
Heard the echoes of mistakes
Call our name until we shake it off, off
Pressure!

Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Pressure!

I am the reaper and the rain
I see your hands vanish from the frame
You have to crawl to paradise
Whispered words push you through the night

Collect your tears, shoot 'em down
Even giants hit the ground
Hit the ground

Felt the pressure, seen the breaks
Let the fortune teller take it all, all
Pressure!
Heard the echoes of mistakes
Call our name until we shake it off, off
Pressure!

Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Pressure!

It's never enough and you're breaking it down
It's never enough and you're breaking it down
It's never enough and you're breaking it down
It's never enough and you're breaking it down

Felt the pressure, seen the breaks
Let the fortune teller take it all, all
Pressure!
Heard the echoes of mistakes
Call our name until we shake it off, off
Pressure!

Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Oh I, oh I can feel the pressure
Pressure! (10x) ---
