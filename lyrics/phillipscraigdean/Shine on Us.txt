Lord, let Your light, light of Your face,
Shine on us
Lord, let Your light, light of Your face,
Shine on us

That we may be saved
That we may have live life
To find our way in the darkest night
Let Your light shine on us

Lord, let Your grace, grace from Your hand,
Fall on us
Lord, let Your grace, grace from Your hand,
Fall on us

That we may be saved
That we may have live life
To find our way in the darkest night
Let Your grace fall on us

Lord, let Your love, love with no end
Come over us
Lord, let Your love, love with no end
Come over us

That we may be saved
That we may have live life
To find our way in the darkest night
Let Your love come over us

Let your light shine on us---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
