We built you a throne of praise
Let our worship raise you high
All our crowns lay at your feet
As an offering
We cry, we cry
Holy

What a healer
Hope of glory in his stars
Rescuing our hearts
Our great shepherd
Voice like thunder calling down
Hear your people shout

We built you a throne of praise
Let our worship raise you high
All our crowns lay at your feet
As an offering
We cry, we cry
Holy---
