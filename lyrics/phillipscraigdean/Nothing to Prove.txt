You taught me how to ride a bike,
Tie my shoes and fly a kite,
How to swim and how to fish,
To see a star and make a wish
So it's okay to make mistakes
Just don't get stuck in yesterday
forgive forget and move ahead
cause life is what you make of it!

Now you're gone and all I have, are memories I hold dear
But if I'm quiet I hear your voice, still ringing in my ears

Saying live with no excuses, and love with no regrets,
Laugh a lot and leave this this world,
with nothing left unsaid,
Make this world a better place,
Don't be afraid to cry,
and when it's finally time to say goodbye,
Nothing To Prove, Nothing To lose, Nothing To Hide.

You see life can not be measured by,
the place you live, the car you drive,
The thing that counts the day you die,
is who you are and what's inside,
so tell the truth don't ever lie,
integrity at any price,
your words, your bonds, your highest price,
so guard it close and live your life,
so many things I learned from you,
bout life and love, and play,
but I learned more by how you lived, than what I heard you say,

Live with no excuses and love with no regrets,
Laugh a lot and leave this life,
with nothing left unsaid,
Make this world a better place,
don't be afraid to cry,
and when it's finally time to say goodbye,
There's Nothing To Prove, Nothing To Lose, Nothing To Hide.

I only want to live my life, half as well as you,
to leave behind, what I received is all I want to do,
so I live with no excuses and I love with no regrets,
I laugh a lot and I leave this life,
with nothing left unsaid, 
make this world a better place,
don't be afraid to cry,
And when it's finally time to say goodbye,
When it's finally time to say goodbye,
When it's finally time to say goodbye,
There's Nothing To Lose Nothing To Prove, Nothing To Hide.---Lyrics submitted by William Crean.
