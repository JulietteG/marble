That You hear me when I call
Is it true that You are thinking of me?
How You love me
Its amazing

Who am I that You are mindful of me?
That You hear me when I call
Is it true that You are thinking of me?
How You love me
Its amazing

I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
He calls me friend

Who am I that You are mindful of me?
That You hear me when I call
Is it true that You are thinking of me?
How You love me
Its amazing, so amazing, Its amazing
