Once there was a holy place
Evidence of Gods embrace
And i can almost see mercys face
Pressed against the veil
Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail
And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With Justice no longer in the way

Chorus
Mercy came running like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that i carried was all i could see
And when i could not reach mercy 
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls i never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still 
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when i felt like giving in

Chorus

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where i really should be
He gently calls to my heart
Just to remind me
