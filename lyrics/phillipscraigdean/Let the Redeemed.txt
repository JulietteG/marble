Freedom's song is loudest if you have lived a life of chains
And grace is so amazing in the middle of your shame
Hope burns at it's brightest when the night has been to long
A fathers arms so welcome when you have been so far from home
He who has been forgiven much loves much in return

Let the redeemed declare it "Look what God has done!"
Tell of his endless mercy and his everlasting love
Let the redeemed declare it "Name above all names lavish him with grace"
Let the redeemed

Arms of love feel strongest when you have been all alone
Faith is so surprising when fear is all you've know
Forgiveness kiss tastes sweetest when you have all but lost your way
Life is so much sweeter when you have looked death in the faces
One once lost has now been found the dead now live again

Let the redeemed declare it "Look what God has done!"
Tell of his endless mercy and his everlasting love
Let the redeemed declare it "Name above all names lavish him with grace"
Let the redeemed

Sing of his mercy sing of his grace
Tell of his kindness lift high his name

Let the redeemed declare it "Look what God has done!"
Tell of his endless mercy and his everlasting love
Let the redeemed declare it "Name above all names lavish him with grace"
Let the redeemed
Let the redeemed
Sing aloud---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
