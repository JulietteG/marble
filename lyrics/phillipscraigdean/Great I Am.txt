I want to be close, close to Your side 
So Heaven is real and death is a lie 
I want to hear voices of angels above  
Singing as one 

Hallelujah, holy, holy 
God Almighty, the great I AM 
Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
God Almighty, the great I AM 

I want to be near, near to Your heart 
Loving the world and hating the dark 
I want to see dry bones living again 
Singing as one 

Hallelujah, holy, holy 
God Almighty, the great I AM 
Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
God Almighty, the great I AM

The mountains shake before You the demons run in fear 
At the mention of the name King of Majesty 
There is no power in hell 
Or any who can stand 
Before the power and the presence of the great I AM 

Hallelujah, holy, holy 
God Almighty, the great I AM 
Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
God Almighty, the great I AM---
