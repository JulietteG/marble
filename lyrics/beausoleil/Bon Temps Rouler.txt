You see me there, well I aint no fool,
Im one smart Frenchman never been to school.
If you want to get somewhere in a Creole town,
You start to let me show you your way around.

(Chorus)
You let the bons temps roluer,
You let the mulet puller,
Now dont you be no fool, eh,
You let the bons temps roluer.

I got a Creole gal, shes one fine dish,
Well, shes got ways like the old crawfish,
She dont do nothing but wait till Saturday night,
But when it comes to lovin, shes all right.

Chorus

Well, if you want to have yourself some real fine fun,
Go down to Louisiana and you get you one,
Youll find them cutting cane all down the line,
Ive got a cotton picker, shes really fine.

Chorus

At the church bazaar or the baseball game,
At the French la-la, its all the same,
If you want to have fun now, you got to go
Way out into the country to the zydeco.
