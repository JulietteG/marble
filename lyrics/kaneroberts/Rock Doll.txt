Decked out headed straight for me.
A leather girl cut from silk.
She's young, she's wild, she's free.
From her head on down she's dressed to thrill.

Pretty little woman.
Would you mind steppin' into the light?
You look so hot I've got to get me some let.

So much more than flesh and bone,
Rock Doll!!!!
A metal heart pumpin' lace and chrome.
And you're my one desire, every Saturday night.
Rock Doll!!!!

When the backbeat hits the room.
Angel vision fills my eyes.
She moves there's a crash and boom.
A million guitars light the sky.

Pretty little mover.
Let me say I'm enjoyin' the show.
And all I know if I've got to get me some leg.

So much more than flesh and bone,
Rock Doll!!!!
A metal heart pumpin' lace and chrome.
And you're my one desire, every Saturday night.
Rock Doll!!!!

Hey!  Hey!  What do you say?
6 and 9 and you've got bingo!

So much more than flesh and bone,
Rock Doll!!!!
A metal heart pumpin' lace and chrome.
And you're my one desire, every Saturday night.
Rock Doll!!!!

Angel hold me tight.
Rock Doll!!!!
Angel rock the night.
Rock Doll!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Ken.
