Little honey got the rock house rockin'.
Everybody was talkin' how you laid it down.
You said it all for the whole damn place.
What a body, what a face!
You're the talk of the town.

And here I stand in the flames of your desire.
Can you smell the smoke of a burnin' heart?

If this is heaven, it feels like hell.
You put my heart in danger.
If this is heaven, it feels like hell.
You must be the devil's angel.

We held each other in a wild embrace.
Then you pulled out the chains and the leather and lace.
Once you knew I had you under my skin.
Well the pleasure was over, let the pain begin.
Dreams come easy in the heat of burnin' passions.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

If this is heaven, it feels like hell.
You put my heart in danger.
If this is heaven, it feels like hell.
You must be the devil's angel.---Lyrics submitted by Ken.
