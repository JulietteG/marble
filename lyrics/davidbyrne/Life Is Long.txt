Ev'rybody says that the living is easy
I can barely see cause my head's in the way
Tigers walk behind me- they are to remind me that
I'm lost- but I'm not afraid

Soul to soul- A kiss and a sigh
Sawed in half- by the passage of time
Halfway home- from a window you see
Chains and bars- but I am still free

People on the outside- I remember sweet times
This old rose- is always in bloom
Ev'ryone is happy- to be a baby daddy
Stone love- with nothing to lose

Life is long- if you give it way
So stay, don't go- cause I'm fading away
Soul to soul- between you and me
Chain me down- but I am still free

Now I can say- those three little words
And ev'ry day- I'm dreaming a world
Soul to soul- a kiss and a sigh
Holding back- the waters outside.

Life is long- if you give it way
So stay, don't go- cause I'm fading away
Soul to soul- between you and me
Chain me down- but I am still free---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
