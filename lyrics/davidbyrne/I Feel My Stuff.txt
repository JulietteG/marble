I think I waited too long
I'm moving into the dollhouse
Some days we exercise
Some days we harmonize
Look away, look away, look away- oh yeah

Emily said she'd suddenly waken
Look at that guy with the government coupon
Yoo hoo, yoo hoo, gonna get you
Japanese chairs in somebody's concert
Telephone bills on the company paycheck
Who knew?, who knew?, I do

Emily lost her mobile phone
Last nights dance on a bumpy road
I won't go out in the cold
Lebanese Chinese in my school
Imagine who can make you cool
Who's gonna pay for this call?

The cheapest dog, the hottest sun, the fiercest cat & the meanest gun
You got to hold the peelings in your hands, baby
It's a safety belt, it's a Christian crime, a rocket ship, it's a joke of mine
I took away the day that I'd be gone- shoot!

Lebanese take their sailors home
The broken stuff in the outer wall
I'm sticking out in the road
Memorize toilets, Chang Mai School
I like my song but I lost my cool
I need my laser, don't move

Put him in the ground where the Duchess grows
Where the word is true and the girls are strong
Gonna stuff it, step it, pick it, going bye
Take another life of a wretched soul
When they get too high where the bushes grow
& They rope it, squeeze it, push it side to side

The chicken shack, the rising sun, the written word in a foreign tongue
You got to hold it all before it drops, baby
It's a little bit, it's a lot inside, it's a bigger thing than YOU can hide
I took away the parts that need controlling

Hooligans jump in the budget sign
In the tropic zone, where the fix is fine
Gonna chase it, place it, face it with my eye
Stinky little bird in a dirty tree
Gonna figure out it's your lucky day
If ya smell it, sell it, tell it to my ear

Lowered in the ground where the Duchess grows
Where the word is true and the girls are strong
Gonna stuff it, step it, pick it, going bye
Take another life of a wretched soul
If they get too high where the bushes grow
& They rope it, squeeze it, push it side to side

(I'm sayin') I feel my stuff
I get enough
I come back to be stronger
I feel my stuff
I changed my luck
I come back to be stronger---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
