I ride on a perfect freeway
Many people on that road
I heard the sound of someone laughing
I saw my neighbors car explode

Just up ahead
Against the sky
Quicker than you blink your eye

Chorus:
Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
And among the living, we are giving, all through the night

From the milk of human kindness
From the breast we all partake
Hungry for a social contract
She welcomes you with dark embrace

(puts) socks and shoes
Upon our feet
Little fishes swim upstream

Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
In the deepest silence, gold and diamonds, all through the night

Everything that happens will happen today
and nothing has changed, but nothing's the same
and ev'ry tomorrow could be yesterday
and ev'rything that happens will happen today

ev'rything that happens will happen today
and nothing has changed but nothing's the same
and ev'ry tomorrow could be yesterday
and ev'rything that happens could happen today---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
