My reflection of all the things you would say
And the hopeless vision of how you move me that way
Oh, but everybody sees someone misled
And how these contradictions got me outta my head

For understanding
Let me lay it on the line
For all decisions
We ain't got but a little time
Oh all you needed
You can't say that I didn't try
You're everlasting and I would do it over again, again
Do it over again

All or nothing baby is a feeling I know
Ooh this contemplation's turning up on its own, oh
Your body's churnin' when the livin' is rough
Well are you yearnin' or are you givin' it up

For understanding
Let me lay it on the line
For all decisions
We ain't got but a little time
Oh all you needed
You can't say that I didn't try
You're everlasting and I would do it over again, again
Do it over again

Divine emotion, the sanctified and true
Oh what's worth saving if you're not feeling it too
No compromisin' could be ready for change
If your fadin' with devotion, you know it's never too late

For understanding
Let me lay it on the line
For all decisions
We ain't got but a little time
Oh all you needed
You can't say that I didn't try
You're everlasting and I would do it over again, again
Do it over again---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
