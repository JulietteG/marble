(verse1)
how did she fall in love
tired and shakin up
could it be hangin around in love 
no one was foolin when they told her
bout the sense and sensibility
in moving on

(1st bridge)
all that i seems that we live in life
did you fail when you found you payed the price
hope it wasn't lost in a honest truth
going past all the things that we been through
every little thing that you did was right 
but who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly (oh you cried endlessly)

(chours)
take a message from my love
take a message from my love (take a message, take a message)
take a message from my love
take a message from my love

(verse2)
what could i say to you oh
when makin the ways was left unconcious
i didn't mean to tell you why oh why
but you habored your defenses 
and your makin it hard to bring that hope back
for you and i
