Who's peaking out from under a stairway,
calling a name that's lighter than air?
Who's bending down to give me a rainbow?
Everyone knows it's Windy...

Who's tripping down the streets of the City,
smiling at everybody see sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy...

And Windy has stormy eyes
that flash at the sounds of lies
and Windy has wings to fly above the clouds...
above the clouds...
above the clouds...
above the clouds...

(Lead)

And Windy has stormy eyes
that flash at the sound of lies
and Windy has wings to fly above the clouds...
above the clouds...
above the clouds...
above the clouds...

Who's tripping down the streets of the City,
smiling at everybody see sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy...
