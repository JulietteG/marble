Got to say hello, its a lucky day,
Kiss the moon goodbye and be on our way,
Its a lucky day since I found you,
Gonna build a new world around you,
Touch the sun and run its a lucky day.

Hello life, goodbye Columbus,
Ive got a feeling that your gonna hear from us,
Youre gonna know that weve taken the world by surprise,
Got that look in our eyes.

Its lucky day, just for changing leaving the old world behind,
Lucky day, for walkin a new road, just to clear your mind,
Its a day, for starting a new way, telling the old world goodbye,
Lucky day for gettin above it, grab your wings and fly.

Hello life, goodbye Columbus,
Ive got a feeling that your gonna hear from us,
Youre gonna know that weve taken the world by surprise,
Got that look in our eyes.

Its lucky day, goodbye Columbus,
Ive got a feeling that your gonna hear from us,
Youre gonna know that weve taken the world by surprise,
Got that look in our eyes.

Its a lucky day, yeah, goodbye Columbus,
goodbye Columbus, goodbye Columbus,
goodbye Columbus, goodbye Columbus...
