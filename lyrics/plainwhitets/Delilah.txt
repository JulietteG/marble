Hey there Delilah what's it like in New York city?
I'm a thousand miles away but girl tonight you look so pretty yes you do.

times square can't shine a bright as you,I swear its true
Hey there Delilah don't you worry bout the distance i'm right there if you get lonely give this song another listen , close your eyes.
Listen to my voice it's my disguise
I'm by your side 

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah I know times are getting hard
but just believe me girl, some day I'll pay the bills with this guitar
we'll have it good
we'll have the life we knew we would
my word is good

Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say
if every simple song i wrote to you
would take your breath away I'd write it all
even more in love with me you'd fall
we'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

a thousand miles seems pretty far
but they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to if I had no other way
our friends would all make fun of us
but we'll just laugh along because
we know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah i can promise you that by the time that we get through
the world will never ever be the same
and you're to blame

Hey there Delilah you be good and don't you miss me
two more years and you'll be done with school
and I'll be makin' history like i do
you'll know it's all because of you
we can do whatever we want to
hey there Delilah heres to you
this one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do you do to me
