She tries to hide the bruises
She says it wasnt him
but sometimes he loses his temper and again
He'll come home
Look for a fight but she tells herself it's alright

She hopes someday it's alright

She doesn't tell anybody
but everyone can tell
that theres something shes hiding
She hasn't been herself
but she still goes out every night
She tells herself it's alright

(Chorus) 
She hopes someday it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

She has to make excuses
for all of this abuse
And it's sad
the truth is she's scared of what he'll do
if she ever walked of his life
so she's tells herself its alright

(Chorus)
It's alright
It's alright

She sits and she waits
It's not getting any better
It's never too late
but she knows it's now or never
She'll get up the strength
to stand up to him tonight
Cause she knows that it's alright

She says today she's leaving
She says she's had enough
Sick of being mistreated 
She's knows that isn't love
So tonight she's saying good-bye 
And she tells herself it's alright

Yeah she knows she's gonna make it tonight
Yeah she's finally going on with her life

(Chorus)
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

She sits and she waits
It's not getting any better
It's never too late but she knows it now or never
She'll get up the strength
to stand up to him tonight
Cause she knows that it's alright---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
