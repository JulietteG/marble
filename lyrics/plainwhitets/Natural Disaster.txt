she said she saw me on tv
this girls a ledgened in the late night scene
and you can see she aim to please
cause she just wouldnt take her eyes off me
she made the music come to life
she moves her body like a butchers knife
choping up every guy in  sight
she was mystiriouse i could not resist to save my life
i dont know what this girl was after shes a natural (oh) 
natural disaster
shes so sexy i hade to have her shes a natural (oh) 
natural disaster
natural disaster
and when she left me on the floor
she knew id folow her right out that door
shed always leave you craving more
just the addiction i was waiting for
she made the music come to life
staring me down with those electric eyes
and when she said your place of mine 
i was delirious i could not resiste to save my life
i dont know what this girl was after shes a natural (oh)
natural disaster
shes so sexy i hade to have her shes a natural (oh)
natural disaster
natural disaster
all night long
(whats your name whats your game show me how to play)
all night long
(cause i can see you and me going all the way)
all night long
(i dont even really care what your after)
all night long
as long as you keep going faster 
faster
she said she saw me on tv
this girls a ledgend in the late night scene
and you can see she aim to please
cause she just couldnt take her eyes off me

i dont know what this girl was after shes a natural (oh)
natural disaster shes so sexy i hade to hade shes a natural (oh) 
natural disaster
i dont know what this girl was after she a natural(oh)
 natural disaster
shes so sexy i hade to have her shes a natural (oh)
natural disaster
