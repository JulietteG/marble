My head is stuck in the clouds, she begs me to come down
Says, "Boy, quit foolin' around"
I told her, "I love the view from up here, warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above as it turns to the rhythm of love"

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Well, my heart beats like a drum, guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes, deep like the sea that roll back when she's laughin' at me
She rises up like the tide the moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone, you'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind, the way to make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love---Lyrics submitted by Joshua Green.
