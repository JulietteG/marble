I heard that you`ve been asking bout me.
Least thats the word on the street.
I just dont know what  to belive
Why was I dumb enough to leave?
I saw you with him today.
The boy who took my place.
You seemed so much happier with  me.
But maybe thats just the way I want it to be.
But it's just another one of those days.
The way you made it all feel so right.
The way you fit into my arms at night
I'll remember that feeling for the rest of my life.
But it's just another one of those days
I can't help but feel a little upset.
About the things you and I never had
I had the world,But instead threw it all away.
Now it's just another one of those days.
So tell me what happens next?
It's out of my hands,I guess.
I just don't know what to belive.
Why don't you tell me belive.
Why did you let me leave?
It's not the way it's gotta be.
Whats wrong with me?
Why don't you tell me to belive.
Why did you let me leave?
Is that the way this has to be?
But it's just another one of those days.
The way you made it all feel so right.
The way you fit into my arms at night.
I'll remember that feeling for the rest of my life.
But it's just another one of those days
I can't help but feel a little upset.
About the things you and I never had
I had the world,but instead threw it all away
Now,it's just another one of those days.---Lyrics submitted by Hillary.
