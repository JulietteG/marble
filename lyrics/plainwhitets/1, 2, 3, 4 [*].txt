1-2-1-2-3-4
Give me more loving than Ive ever had
Make me feel better when Im feeling sad
Tell me Im special even though I know Im not
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad
Barely getting mad
Im so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy
It's as easy as 1-2-1-2-3-4
Theres only one thing
To Do
Three words
For you
(I love you) I love you
Theres only one way to say
Those three words
Thats what Ill do
(I love you) I love you
Give me more loving from the very start
Piece me back together when I fall apart
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad
Youre the best that Ive had
And Im so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy
Its easy as 1-2-1-2-3-4
Theres only one thing
To Do
Three words
For you
(I love you) I love you
Theres only one way to say
Those three words
Thats what Ill do
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you
You make it easy
Its easy as 1 2 1 2 3 4
Theres only one thing
To Do
Three words
For you
(I love you) I love you
Theres only one way to say
Those three words
Thats what Ill do
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you
1-2-3-4
I love you
(I love you) I love you---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
