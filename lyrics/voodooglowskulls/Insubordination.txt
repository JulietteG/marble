What do you mean i have a bad attitude
Don't get me wrong but my nature is rude
I know when i'm being taken advantage of
People are people i'm sure you make mistakes too
Call my bluff, use your power
Everyone knows you're the man of the hour
Write me up, send me home early
In the end you're giving me what i asked for

Hey, hey, hey

Everyone knows i'm a rebel
Not a troublemaker can't you tell
I just speak up for myself
At the same time i'm losing my dignity
Losing my dignity
Losing my dignity

Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination

What do you mean i have a bad attitude
Don't get me wrong but my nature is rude
I know when i'm being taken advantage of
People are people i'm sure you make mistakes too
Call my bluff, use your power
Everyone knows you're the man of the hour
Write me up, send me home early
In the end you're giving me what i asked for

What did you gain
Well, not my respect or trust
Well go ahead make a fool of yourself
Go ahead write me up

What do you mean i have a bad attitude
Don't get me wrong but my nature is rude
I know when i'm being taken advantage of
People are people i'm sure you make mistakes too
Call my bluff, use your power
Everyone knows you're the man of the hour
Write me up, send me home early
In the end you're giving me what i asked for

Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
