Come here, baby. Mary, I love you. Do it girl. 

Mary Jane, Mary Jane 

I'm in love with Mary Jane. 
She's my main thing. 
She makes me feel alright. 
She makes my heart sing. 
And when I'm feeling low, 
She comes as no surprise. 
Turns me on with her love. 
Takes me to paradise. 

Do you love me, Mary Jane? 
Yeah. Whoa-oh-oh. 
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? 
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane. 
Don't you play no games. 

Mary Jane 
I love her just the same. 
Mary Jane 
I love her, Mary baby, just the same. (Mary Jane) 
The woman plays no games (Mary Jane) 
Now, now, now. 

I'm in love with Mary Jane. 
I'm not the only one. 
If Mary wanna play around, 
I let her have her fun. 
She's not the kind of girl 
that you can just tie down. 
She likes to spread her love 
and turn your head around. 

Do you love me, Mary Jane? 
Yeah. Whoa-oh-oh. 
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? 
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane. 
Don't you play no games. 

Yeahhhhh! Ooowoooo. 
Oh baby. Oh baby. Hit me. 
Whoah, Mary. Only love. 
I love you, yeah. Whooo! 
Something until we give it now, lovey-dove. 
Uh-huh. Wow, baby! 
Sing! La-du-da-da-du-da-dahh. 
Sing! La-du-da-da-du-da-dahh. 
Sing it for me baby. 
Come Mary, Mary Jane. 
Sing it for me baby.---
