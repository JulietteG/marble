How do you cool your lips 
After a summers kiss? 
How do you rid the sweat 
After the body bliss? 
How do you turn your eyes 
From the romantic glare? 
How do you block the sound of a voice
Youd know anywhere? 

Oh, I really should have known 
By the time you drove me home 
By the vagueness in your eyes 
Your casual goodbyes 
By the chill in your embrace 
The expression on your face that told me
Maybe you might have 
Some advice to give on how to be 
Insensitive, insensitive, insensitive 

How do you numb your skin 
After the warmest touch? 
How do you slow your blood 
After the body rush? 
How do you free your soul 
After youve found a friend? 
How do you teach your heart 
Its a crime to fall in love again? 

Oh you probably wont remember me 
Its probably ancient history 
Im one of the chosen few 
Who went ahead and fell for you 
Im out of vogue Im out of touch 
I fell too fast I feel too much 
I thought that you might have 
Some advice to give on how to be 
Insensitive---Lyrics submitted by Jelaine.
