Hide your heart under the bed and lock 
your secret drawer. Wash the angels 
from your head won't need them anymore. 
Love is a demon and you're the one he's 
coming for. Oh my Lord. 

He's bringing sweet salvation, let temptation 
take him in. He's every fear and every hope 
and every single sin. He's the universe the 
love you've been imagining. Oh my Lord. 
Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord. 

And I am ashes. I am Jesus. I am precious. 
Could I be your girl. Could I be your girl. 

Put a chair against the door and turn the lights 
down low. Write a letter to yourself 
no-one will ever know. Tell them all about 
the girl who just refused to fall. Oh my Lord. 

He is the very breath you feel inside your lungs at night. 
He is the bitter wind who's drying up your appetite. 
He is the darkness that seeps into your fading light. 
Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord. 

And I am ashes. I am Jesus. I am precious. Could I be 
your girl. Could I be your girl. I am worthless 
sounds compared to all your perfect words. 
Could I be your girl. Could I be your girl. 

Wash the angels from your head won't need them 
anymore. Hide your heart under the bed and lock 
your secret drawer. Love is the demon and you're 
the one he's coming for.
 Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord. 
Could I be your girl. 
Could I be your girl.(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Emmerson.
