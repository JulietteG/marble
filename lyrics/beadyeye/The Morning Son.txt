You'll never know unless you try
You're blinded by what you idolize
I stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose

He's in my mind
He's in my soul
He's even in my rockn'roll
I stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose

I'm here to show
I'll help you out
It takes a lifetime, I've worked it out
I stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose---Lyrics submitted by dror.
