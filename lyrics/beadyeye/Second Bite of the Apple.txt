Shake my tree, wheres the apple for me
Tickle my feet with the enemy
No point laughing if you dont know why
I phone my love just to hear her smile

The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough

Girl in the queue, got an eye on you
Think youre in and shes looking for sin?
Yes youre not wrong
She wants to know whats in your pocket
Singing that song, dig it all night long

The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is if youre tough enough

Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now

Shake my tree wheres the apple for me
Tickle my feet with the enemy
No point laughing if you dont know why
I phone my love just to hear her smile

The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is if youre tough enough

The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is up if youre tough enough
The word is if youre tough enough

Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now
Come on, show what you love now ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
