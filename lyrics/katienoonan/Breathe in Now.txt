I see love and Beauty all around, i also see the sadness thats embedded in your frown, i wonder why you choose not the talk to those who surround, a sense i fear of lifting heavy feet higher than you want to i just want to believe your true

You stand their but you did not cast a shadow you walk away with every word you choose not to say I suppose like moving on paint a new colour for each day I dont like to see dreams hang on the shelf to tell the family one day I just want to be happy for you.

Cause i only have one second this minute today i cant press rewind and turn it back and call it now ohhhhhhhh and so this moment i just have to sing out loud and say i love while i can breathe in now ohhhhh and say i love i live and breathe in now

i move on holding on to what i learned its time to let go of the notion that the whole worlds against me break free ill share cause not for time time free and now and now i know its not all up to me i can count on another so move on lighter and be free

cause i only have one second this minute today i cant press rewind and turn it back and call it now ohhhhhhh and so this moment i just have to sing out loud  and say i love while i can breathe in now ohhhhhhhh and say i love i live and breathe in now

i believe in for today i just want to know if you're ok cause i believe in grieving just for today i just want to know if you're ok

Cause i only have one second this minute today i cant press rewind and turn it back and call it now ohhhhhhhh and so this moment i just have to sing out loud and say i love while i can breathe in now  and say i love i live and breathe in now and say i love i live in breathe in nowwwwwwwwwwwww---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
