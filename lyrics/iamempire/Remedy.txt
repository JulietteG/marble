Planet crash
Ocean splash
Feel the weight sinking in
Iron cross
Count as loss
God is not a penny toss
I don't know how to believe in
The love that haunts my resistance

Walking in your shoes
Running from the truth

This is for everything
The time we gave away, oh
Nothing left to say
This is a remedy
For all the things we've lost
Inside a heavy heavy heart

I am not about to stop pushing theories overboard
Secret spot see I'm not hiding in you anymore
I saw the hands of forgiveness
Release the chains of regretful bliss
I give into the sound of your smile

This is for everything
The time we gave away, oh
Nothing left to say
This is a remedy
For all the things we've lost
Inside a heavy heavy heart

Looking back at all my mistakes
They vanish with the pain
I don't need to know anything at all
I'm kicking in the walls
Rebuild, rebuild, rebuild!

This is for everything
The time we gave away, oh
Nothing left to say
This is a remedy
For all the things we've lost
Inside a heavy heavy heart

This is for everything
The time we gave away, oh
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
This is for everything
This is my remedy---Lyrics submitted by Sam Miller.
