Feel your breath on my shoulder
And I know we couldnt get any closer
I don't wanna act tough 
I just wanna fall in love
As we move into the night

 I get crazy thinking how it's gonna be with you baby
I don't wanna play rough 
I've been loving you enough
Oo baby

CHO
wanna take forever tonight
wanna stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
wanna take forever tonight
fill you up, fill you up with love
when we close the door all i need
is in your eyes
ooo wanna take forever tonight

Touch my lips
oo I'm on fire
You're the only one I'll ever desire
Turn the lights down low
Make the world go slow
When I'm holding you tonight

oo It's so easy
nothing moves me like you do when you tease me
and to rush would be a crime
I just wanna spend some time with you baby oo

CHO
wanna take forever tonight
wanna stay in this moment forever
I wanna give you all the love that I've got
I wanna take forever tonight
Fill you up, fill you up
give you all my love tonight
when we close the door all i need is in your eyes
oo i wanna take forever.

BRIDGE
And when I'm here beside you
I wanna see what drives you out of your mind.

O baby
I never wanna leave
I only wanna be with you
Cuz I love how you feel
Your love is for real

O you know I wanna take forever tonight
Wanna stay in this moment forever (moment forever)
I wanna give you all the love that I've got
Wanna take forever tonight
Wanna stay in this moment forever(moment forever)
I wanna give you all the love that I've got
Cuz I can't live withot you---Lyrics submitted by karen.
