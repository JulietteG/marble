Well, Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
Well, Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
People call me night owl
Baby, it don't bother me

Well, Im an all night worker
There's nobody quite like me
Well, Im an all night worker
There's nobody quite like me
People call me night owl
Baby, it don't bother me

Work!

Eight oclock in the morning
Time to get some rest
Got all day to sleep now
You know I got to look my best
Im an all night worker
There's nobody quite like me
People call me night owl
Baby, it don't bother me

Well, Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
Well, Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
People call me night owl
Baby, it don't bother me---Lyrics submitted by Elias James.
