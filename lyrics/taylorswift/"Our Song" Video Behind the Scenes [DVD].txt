I Was Riding Shotgun With Hair Undone In The Front Seat Of His Car
He's Got A One Hand Feel On The Steering Wheel The Other On My Heart
I Look Around Turn The Raido Down, He Says Baby Is Something Wrong
I Say Nothing I Was Just Thinking How We Don't Have A Song, And He Says

Our Song Is The Slam Of Screan Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow 
Cause It's Late And Your Mama Don't know
Our Song Is The Way You Laugh, The First Date Man I Didn't Kiss Her When I Should Have
And When I Got Home Before I Said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Again

I Was Walking Up The Front Porch Steps After Everything That Day
Had Gone All Wrong, Had Been Trampled On And Lost Or Throne Away
Got To The Hallway Well On My Way To My Loving Bed
I Almost Didn't Notice All The Roses And The Note That Said

Our Song Is The Slam Of Screen Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause It's Late And Your Mama Don't Know
Our Song Is The Way You Laugh, The First Date Man I Didn't Kiss Her When I Should Have
And When I Got Home Before I Said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Again

Da Da Da Da


I've Heard Every Elbum Listend To The Raido
Waiting For Something To Come Along That Was As Good As Our Song

Cause Our Song Is The Slam Of Screen Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause It's Late And Your Mama Don't Know
Our SOng Is The Way You Laugh, The First Date Man I Didn't Kiss Him When I Should Have
And When I got Home Before I said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Agai-ai-ai   ain Again Oh Yeah Oh Oh Yeah

I was Riding Shot Gun With My Hair Undone In The Front Seat Of His Car
I Grabbed A Pen ANd An Old Napkin And I Wrote Down Our Song---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
