I like the way you sound in the morning.
Were on the phone and without a warning. 
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard. 

I like the way I cant keep my focus. 
I watch you talk you didnt notice.
I hear the words but all I can think is.
We should be together.

Every time you smile, I smile, 
And every time you shine, Ill shine for you. 
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby. 
Dont be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me.
Baby, never gonna leave you. 
Say that you wanna be with me too. 
So Ima stay through it all. 
So jump then fall.

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
Youve got the keys to me. 
I love each freckle on your face.
Oh I Ive never been so wrapped up.
Honey,  
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted. 
I had time to think it all over. 
And all I can say is come closer.
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me. 

Cause every time you smile I smile. 
And every time you shine Ill shine for you. 
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby. 
Dont be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me. 
Baby, never gonna leave you say that you wanna be with me too. 
So Ima stay through it all. 
So jump then fall.

The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet. 
Ill catch you, Ill catch you. 
And people say things that bring you to your knees. 
Ill catch you. 
The time is gonna come when youre so mad that you could cry. 
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile.

And whoa oh I need you baby. 
And dont be afraid please jump and fall, jump then fall into me. 
Baby, Im never gonna leave you.
Say that you wanna be with me too. 
Cause Im a stay through it all so jump and fall, jump then fall, 
Baby jump then fall into me into me. 

Every time you smile I smile, 
And every time you shine Ill shine. 
And every time you hear baby Ill show you, Ill show you, 
You can jump then fall jump then fall jump then fall into me, 
Into me yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
