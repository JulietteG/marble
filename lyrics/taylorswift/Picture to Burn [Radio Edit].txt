to state the obvious i didnt get my birthday fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me 
so go and tell your friends that im obsessive and crazy thats fine
you wont mind if i say

by the way i hate that stupid old pick up truck 
you never let me drive your a redneck heart break 
whos really bad at lieing
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
cause as far as im concerned your just another picture to burn

theres no time for tears  im  just sittin here
planin my revenge
theres nothing stopping me from
goin out with all of your best friends
and if you come around sayin sorry to me
my daddys gonna show you how sorry you'll be 

cause i hate that stupid old pick up truck you never let me drive
your a redneck heart heart break whos really bad at lieing
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned your just another picture to burn

and if your missing me you better keep it to yourself
cause coming back around here would 
be bad for your health

cause i hate that stupid old pick up truck you never let me drive 
your a redneck heart break 
whos really bad at lieing 
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you havent heard i really really hate that stupid old 
pick up truck you never let me drive
your a redneck heart break whos really bad at lieing
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned your just another picture to burn
burn, burn burn baby burn
just another picture to burn
baby burn---Lyrics submitted by ashlyn.
