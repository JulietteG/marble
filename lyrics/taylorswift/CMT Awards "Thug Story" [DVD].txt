Eh Eh, T-Swizzle,T-Pizzle
I'm like 8 foot 4, blonde hair to the floor, your shawty's never thought I dreamed about rappin' hardcore
no I ain't got a gun, no I never really been in a club
still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangsta you can find me bakin' cookies at night, you out clubbin'
well I just make Caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain, rappin' on the same track, it's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?!
I had a dream last night, I had hightop nikes I had diamonds in my mouth and diamonds on my mic,
by the time I woke I was singin' I'm on the boooooat, cuz I'm a singa turned rappa
(shawty I'm a make it) Straight to the top yo  (shawty Imma take ya) 
They, call me T-swizzie now I'm a rap star, (It's a thug story now tell em who you are)
Singa turned gansta, you dont wanna fight me, (straight to the top ) in my extra small white tee, 
T-Swift and T-Pain rappin on the same track, it's a thug story, now can you handle that?
WHAT?! WHAT?!         I KNIT SWEATERS YO, WHAT WHAT, DON'T EST ME (bleep)
Hold on hold on, I didn't even say anything, (what) I said yo ( yo)  you guys bleeped me and I didn't even swear ( she didn't even swear) Hello?! 
Uh!!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.
