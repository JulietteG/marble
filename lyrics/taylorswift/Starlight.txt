I said oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night at the window,
He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

He said "look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking away "
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking in crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

I said oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things? ---
