We were both young
When I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there...
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd and say "Hello."
Little did I know...
That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my Daddy said "STAY AWAY FROM JULIET!!!"
And I was crying on the staircase begging you "PLEASE DON'T GO!!!"

                                                    CHORUS
And I said
"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince
And I'll be the princess
It's a LOVE STORY!
Baby, just say "Yes!!" "

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cuz we're DEAD if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little whi-le...

UH OH!!

'Cuz you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my Daddy said "STAY AWAY FROM JULIET!!!"
But you were everything to me,
I was begging you "PLEASE DON'T GO!!!"

                                                 CHORUS
Romeo save me! 
They're trying to tell me how to feel 
This love is difficult
But it's re-al 
Don't be afraid 
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a LOVE STORY!!
Baby, just say "Yes!!"

Oh..ohh......

(Music Break)

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said
"Romeo save me! I've been feeling so alone...
I keep waiting for you but you never come!"
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think.
He knelts to the ground
And pulled out a ring and said
"Marry me Juliet! You never have to be alone!
