Please take down the mistletoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doin alright if you were wondering 
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Everybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year

Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were you cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this should'nt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't
Wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
