I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you though it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

(CHORUS)
Don't say yes run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me, you wish it was me... don't you?

(CHORUS x2)

I hear the preacher say '"speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's a silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

(CHORUS)

And you'll say, "let's run away now"
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows, so glad you were around when they said Speak Now---Lyrics submitted by deric.
