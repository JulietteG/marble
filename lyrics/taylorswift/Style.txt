Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
The end of you
Oh, its been a while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then, we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
Youve got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate, and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes
He cant keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, hes taking off his coat
I say, Ive heard, that youve been out
And about with some other girl, some other girl
He says, what youve heard is true, but I
Cant stop thinking about you and I
I said, Ive been there too a few times

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then, we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
Youve got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate, and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home

Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style---
