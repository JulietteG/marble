Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not here
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything we've been through
Maybe i've been going back too much lately
Time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now....
Like you could you could if you just said you're sorry

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cos nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down the street
Flashback to a night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose...

Come back come back come back....---Lyrics submitted by SarahTaylor.
