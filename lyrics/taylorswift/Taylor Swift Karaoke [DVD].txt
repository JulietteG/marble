Say youre sorry that face of an angel comes out 
Just when you need it to 
As I pace back and forth all this time 
Cause I honestly believed in you 
Holding on, the days drag on 
Stupid girl I should have known, I should have known 

That Im not a princess 
This aint a fairytale 
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet 
Lead her up the stairwell 
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now its too late for you and your White Horse, 
To come around. 

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes 
I never really had a chance 
I had so many dreams about you and me 
Happy endings, now I know 

Im not a princess 
This aint a fairytale 
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet 
Lead her up the stairwell 
This aint Hollywood, this is a small town 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now its too late for you and your White Horse, 
To come around. 

And there you are on your knees 
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
Just like I always wanted, but Im so sorry 

Cause Im not your princess 
This aint a fairytale 
Im gonna find someone, some day 
Who might actually treat me well. 
This is a big world, that was a small town 
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now. 
And its too late for you and your White Horse 
Now its too late for you and your White Horse 
To catch me now. 

Oh whoa whoa whoa oh 
Try and catch me now .. Ohh 
Its too late .. to catch me now.---Lyrics submitted by emily.
