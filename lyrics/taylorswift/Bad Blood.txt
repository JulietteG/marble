'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny, now its all rusted
Did you have to hit me?
Where Im weak, baby, I couldnt breath
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound, like youre laughing right at me
Oh, it so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey

Did you think wed we be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knives
So dont think its in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this wont
So if you come in my way, just dont
Oh, its so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey

Band aids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band aids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs bad

'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
'Cause baby, now weve got bad blood, hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now weve got bad blood, hey---
