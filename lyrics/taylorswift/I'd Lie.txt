I don't think that passenger's seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
I count the colors in his eyes

He'd never fall in love, he swears 
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

Chorus:

And I can tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He got his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on
Doesn't he know that I had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
He stands there and walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

And he'd never tell you
But he can play guitar
I think he can see through
Everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is my God, He's beautiful
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
And if you ask me if I love him
I'd lie---Lyrics submitted by Cassie  Kraemer.
