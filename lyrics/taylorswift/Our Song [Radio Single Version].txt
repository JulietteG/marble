I was riding shotgun with the hair undone
in the front seat of his car
He's got a one hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart

I look around turned the radio down
he says baby is something wrong?
I say nothing 
I was just thinking how we don't have a song
And he says


*CHORUS*
Our song is a slaming screen door
sneeking out late
tapping on your window
when you're on the phone
and you talk real slow
'cause its late and you're mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
the first date,
man, I didn"t kiss her and I should have
And when I got home
before I said amen
asking god if he
could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away

I got to the hallway
well on my way
to my loving bed
I almost didn't notice
all the roses
and the note that said

**CHORUS**

"Da-Da Da-Da"

I've heard every album 
listened to the radio
I've ben waiting for something to come along
that was as good as our song


'Cause our song is a slaming screen door
sneeking out late
tapping on his window
when we're on the phone 
and he talks real slow
'cause it's late
and his mama don't know

Our song is the way he laughs
the first date 
man, I didn't kiss him and I should have

and when I got home
before I said amen
asking god if he 
could play it again

Oh yeah Oh Oh yeah

I was riding shotgun
with my hair undone 
in the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin

And I wrote down our song...---Lyrics submitted by Nora.
