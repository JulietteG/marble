Tall dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I know every word that you say, yay
You smile and say how are you
I say just fine
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you ... forever

I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
To save the world ill be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Talk dark and beautiful
Hes complicated hes so irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeeeeahhh
Something in his deep browns eyes has me sayin Hes not all bad like his, reputation
I can't hear one single word they say, 
You really got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day


I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
To save the world ill be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you dont save some other girl
dont forget, dont forget about me
Im far away but i'll never let you go
Im lovestruck and looking out the window
Dont forget dont forget where ill be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

Cuz I loved you from the very first day

I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today to save the world
Ill be around forever and ever
I watched superman fly away
I swear ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
La, la, la
When you come back down---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
