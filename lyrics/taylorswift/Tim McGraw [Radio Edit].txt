You said the way my blue eyes shined
put those Gorgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie
your just a boy in a chevy truck
that had attendacy of getting stuck
on backroads at night and i was right there
beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up 
to find that summer gone 

{Chorus}

well when you think Tim McGraw 
i hope you think my favorite song 
the one we danced to all night long 
the moon like a spot light on the lake
when you think happieness 
i hope you think that little blackdress
think of my head on your chest 
and my old fadded blue jeans
when you think Tim McGraw i hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
and thanken god that you wern't here
to see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read
three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and lookin back on all of that
it's nice to belive

{Chorus} 

And i'm back for the first time since then 
i'm standing on your street 
there's a letter on you doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read 
is that when you think Tim McGraw
i hope you think my favorite song 
some day you'll turn your radio on i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happieness i hope you think that little black dress
think my head on your chest 
and my old fadded blue jeans
when you think Tim McGraw i hope you think of me
oh think of me
mmmmmmmmmmmmm
you said the way my blue eyes shine put those 
Gorgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie---Lyrics submitted by jasmine.
