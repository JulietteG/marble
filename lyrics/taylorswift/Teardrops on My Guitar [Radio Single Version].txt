Drew looks at me   i fake a smile so he wont see
that i want and i need him
everything we should be
i bet she beautiful that girl he talks about
and shes got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me i laugh cause its just so funny
i cant even  see anything when hes with me
he says hes so in love hes finally got it right
i wonder if he knows hes all i think about at night


hes the reason for the tearsdrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do


drew walks by me can he tell that i cant breath
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight give him all her love
look in them beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause

chorus

so i drive home at night as i turn out the light
ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do
hes the time taken up but theres never enough
and hes all that i need to fall into


drew looks at me i fake a smile so he wont see---Lyrics submitted by stephani.
