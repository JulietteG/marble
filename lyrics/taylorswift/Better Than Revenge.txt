Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

Me for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone
And let's hear the applause
She took him faster and you could say sabotage

I never saw it coming
wouldn't I suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from..

She's not a saint
She's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa!
She's better known for the things that she does on a mattress, whoa!

Soon She's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't you many friends
She should keep in mind 
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge!

She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Or they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
She's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa!
She's better known for the things that she does on a mattress, whoa!

Soon She's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't you many friends
She should keep in mind 
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge!

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always got the last word..

She's not a saint
She's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa!
She's better known for the things that she does on a mattress, whoa!

Soon She's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't you many friends
She should keep in mind 
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge!

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Cause I don't you do, oh!
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause!
C'mon show me how much better you are
So you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better!

She took him faster and you could say sabotage!---Lyrics submitted by KC de Casro.
