Verse 1:
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life tell me hows your family 
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather your 
Guard is up and I know why 
Cause the last time you saw me is still burned in the
Back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them in the dark


Chorus:
So this is me swallowin my pride 
standin in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time 
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you 
wishin I d realized what I had when you were mine 
I go back to December turn around and make it alright 
I go back to December all the time

Verse 2:
These days I havent been sleeping 
stayin up playin back myself leavin 
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times 
I watched you laughing from the passengers side 
And realized I loved you in the fall 
And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love 
And all I gave you was goodbye

Chorus:
So this is me swalloin my pride
standin in front of you sayin Im sorry for that night
I go back to December all the time
turns out freedom aint nothing but missin you
wishin Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Bridge:
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile 
so good to me so right 
and how you held me in your arms that September night 
the first time you ever saw me cry 
maybe this is wishful thinking 
probably wildish dreamin 
but if we loved again
I swear I would love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant 
so if the chain is on your door
I understand

Chorus:
But this is me swalloin my pride
standin in front of you sayin im sorry for that night
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missin you
wishin Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it alright
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind 
I go back to December all the time 
All the time---Lyrics submitted by Ariana.
