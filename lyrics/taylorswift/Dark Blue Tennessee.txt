He said I got me a nice new apartment
In the city
Wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with the broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today
and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to LA
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands
and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today
and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
these simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today
and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
