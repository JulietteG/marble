Oh, maybe I just wasn't good enough
To blow your mind, you know I've tried.
Them silver lines they cut like blades of glass
Not worth the blood we've shed for love.

So give it up, stop beating, hearts have gone cold
Had enough repeating, it's all been done before.
Give it up, stop beating, hearts have gone cold
Hey now, when we gonna wake up?

But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but, baby, we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
For the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time

So maybe I just wasn't strong enough
To tow the line, make true the lies.
The fortune found, now it's all locked away
We've lost the key, hard to believe.

So give it up, stop beating, hearts have gone cold
Had enough repeating, it's all been done before.
Give it up, stop beating, hearts have gone cold
Hey now, when we gonna wake up?

But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but, baby, we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
For the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time

Oh, baby, I just wasn't good enough
'Cause, baby, I just wasn't strong enough

But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but, baby, we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better

But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but, baby, we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
For the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time---
