Get back time to kick it off
Throw your head back honey
Take your sweater off I said
Nows the time for you to check your heart
To keep from falling babe fly when the rhythm starts

Get down time to kick it off
My bodies aching from emotion like my train of thought
I said slow down lady what you tryin' to do
She said the v-u-p-p-o go 'bout till thirty two
She said said

Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for

Saturday's child like a friday night
She's getting naughty on a speaker about to loose her mind
I said
Cop comes to take her away all of a sudden he was shaking what his momma gave

I said hey now! Hey Now! Burnin' up the floor
turn into an all night hang out
turn it up some more

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Hey Now! Hey Now! Burnin' up the floor
I really want to hear you begging for more
Tell me what ya here for

All this conversation standing at the wall (standing, standing)
Stop your hesitation its time to let it go (shake it, shake it)
Shake up all your reasons throw 'em out the door
It's time you let me know

Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for

(Oh! Oh! Electric)
(Oh! Oh! Electric)
(Oh! Oh! Electric)

All this conversation standing at the wall (standing, standing)
Stop your hesitation its time to let it go (shake it, shake it)
Shake up all your reasons throw em out the door
Its time you let me know

Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for
Tell me what ya here for

Tell me what ya here for

Tell me what ya here for

Tell me what ya here for ---
