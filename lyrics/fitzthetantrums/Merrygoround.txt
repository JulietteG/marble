I'm tied to the wings of a plane.
The skies pass the anchors, the haze.
But yesterday's tired, today.
I'll try to remember my name.

Spinnin all my life's like turning til the wheels brake.
Dancin on the wind of this merry-go-round, oh.
Spinnin all my life's like turning while the wheels shake.
Dancin on the wind of this merry-go-round, oh.

I'm stuck on the edge of no place.
The walls scream in silent to make.
The faces blend into each day.
I'll try to remember my name.

Spinnin all my life's like turning til the wheels brake.
Dancin on the wind of this merry-go-round, oh.
Spinnin all my life's like turning while the wheels shake.
Dancin on the thrill of this merry-go-round, oh.
Spinnin all my life's like turning til the wheels brake.
Dancin on the wind of this merry-go-round, oh.

Spinnin all my life's like turning til the wheels brake.
Dancin on the wind of this merry-go-round, oh.
Spinnin all my life's like turning while the wheels shake.
Dancin on the thrill of this merry-go-round, oh. ---
