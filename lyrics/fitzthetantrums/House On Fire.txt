So here we stand
You got caught with love in the hand
Blinded by the sun and the steel
Nothing but the sound of the feel
The blood sweat and tears

Shake off my past
I knew it but I see it at last
And now it's like climbing the walls
All I see, the smell of the smoke
The tears that they choke

I never wanted
Truth is a liar
I never needed
This house is on fire

Flashes kick in
Honoring the day you stepped in
Image of him touching your hand
Thought of it as just innocence
But now it makes sense

You were so free
Never saw that picture with me
Now this fly is climbing the walls
All I see are ashes, the pain
The love lost in vain

I never needed
Truth is a liar
I never needed
This house is on fire
I never wanted
Truth is a liar
I never needed
This house is on fire

Bury the echoes
Turn it back
Melt all my wishing
For the times we once had
Damage my vision
Set it ablaze
Destroy the hour
Take me away

I never wanted
Truth is a liar
I never needed
This house is on fire---
