Fog in my light
Hole in the moon
Talking my number, silent storm through
I get a hit off
I get a kick off
Being here with you
Ohhhh

I heed the touch of the wind
Scratching on the wheels
of the burning pavement
I took control of
I wanna get off
Faster, faster, move girl!
Here I go

Woooaahhh
Come on let me hear you say
Yeaaaahhhh
The thrill has got a hold on me
Wooooahhhh
Take me on and get away
Yeaahhhhh
Come on let me hear you say

Break in the road
Sun on my heels
Focus on the wild open barren spaces
I get a kick off
I get a hit off
Being here with you
Ohhhh

I feel the warmth of the rain
Dancing on the dust
of the burning pavement
I lose control of
I wanna get off
Faster, faster, watch out!
Here I go

Woooaahhh
Come on let me hear you say
Yeaaaahhhh
The thrill has got a hold on me
Wooooahhhh
Take me on and get away
Yeaahhhhh
Come on let me hear you say

And this place that I'm running to
And this feeling I'm needing you
Gets me higher and higher
It's the fast life, fast pace
Take me, take me, get away!

Woooaahhh
Come on let me hear you say
Yeaaaahhhh
The thrill has got a hold on me
Wooooahhhh
Take me on and get away
Yeaahhhhh
Come on let me hear you say
Woooaahhh
Come on let me hear you say
Yeaaaahhhh
The thrill has got a hold on me
Wooooahhhh
Take me on and get away
Yeaahhhhh
Come on let me hear you say---
