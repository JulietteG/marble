What we got is tonight
Aint gonna wait and watch you slip so here I go
Gettin hot, vertigo
Dont know what hit me but I know I need some more

You should know what it feels like
Dont you wanna know? You wanna know
Let me show you what it feels like
Dont you wanna know? You wanna know

Yeah, say you feel it like I feel it
Say you want me like I want you
Say youll give in to the moment
No one wants you like I want you

So give me tonight
So give me tonight

Take a chance and give in
Just like I done now when you swept me off the ground
Lets forget bout tomorrow
All the matters, you and me right now

You should know what it feels like
Dont you wanna know? You wanna know
Let me show you what it feels like
Dont you wanna know? You wanna know

Say you feel it like I feel it
Say you want me like I want you
Say youll give in to the moment
No one wants you like I want you

So give me tonight
So give me tonight (Woah-oh-oh)

say you feel it like I feel it
Say you want me like I want you
Say youll give in to the moment
No one wants you like I want you
Like I want you

So give me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

So give me tonight
So give me tonight

Oh, oh, oh oh
So give me tonight---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
