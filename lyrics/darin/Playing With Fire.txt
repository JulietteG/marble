I wait I turn
Things are heating up
But I keep looking at her

I see your curves
We dont need no water
We can just let it burn

Is It me or is it getting hot in here
You keep touching on me
But I dont care
This aint where you want me
I want you yeah

Youll see tonight
Well leave tonight
Youll fall tonight
Yeah I can feel it heating up

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

I can feel it heating up
I can make you fall in love

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

The nerve of me
To want your body all over me
Gimmie the third
Degree
Baby I cant wait to see
Is it me or is it getting hot in here
You keep touching on me
But I dont care
This aint where you want me
I want you yeah

Youll see tonight
Well leave tonight
Youll fall tonight
Yeah I can feel it heating up

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

I can feel it heating up
I can make you fall in love

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

Is it me or is it getting hot in here
I can feel it heating up
I can make you fall in love

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire

I can feel it heating up
I can make you fall in love

You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire
You keep playing with fire---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
