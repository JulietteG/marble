I can't believe she's gone.
I can't believe, that we're not together anymore.
Something in her eyes, I've never seen before.
It took me by surprise,
When she said: I'm not in love anymore.
Oh, baby.
I keep holdin' on, can't let go.
Please let me know ..

Why does it rain? why does it hurt?
Please God explain, 'cause I don't understand.
Love made me fly, now I just cry.
Please tell me why, (oh, my baby.)
Why does it rain?

We used to be as one, we never were apart. (no.)
The sun was always shinin' in my heart.
Now those days are gone,
I miss the love we had.
No-one ever told me, life could be so sad.
Oh, baby.
I keep holdin' on, can't let go.
Please let me know ..

Why does it rain? why does it hurt?
Please God explain,'cause I don't understand.
Love made me fly, now I just cry.
Please tell me why, (oh, tell me.)
Why does it rain?

(Ooh, ooh, ooh.)
(oh, my baby.)
(oohoohooo)
I keep holdin' on, can't let go.
Please let me know ..

Ooh, why does it rain?
Why does it hurt?
Please God explain, 'cause I don't understand.
Love made me fly, now I just cry.
Please tell me why.
Why does it rain? (why does it hurt?)
Please God explain, 'cause I don't understand.
Love made me fly, (ooh, ooh.)
(now I just cry.)
Please tell me why, (ooh, noo.) why does it rain?---Lyrics submitted by Tara.
