I can tell that you dig me, I dig you too
What's it gotta do? I'm falling for you
And you know what you want
And I'll find a way, some way

I need to be where you are
Can't keep away, not too far

You know that, baby, I like you, do you take me back?
Say that you want me 'cause I want you back
You need to get closer to know what you have
I'm yours, so yours

Baby, I can't take the distance no more
Say that I got you, don't put me on hold
Now I am here 'cause I want you to know
I'm yours, so yours

Tired of thinking of things that could go wrong
Now's the time, yea I've waited so long
Gotta know what you think, if you feel the same
The same

I need to be where you are
Can't keep away, not too far

You know that, baby, I like you, do you take me back?
Say that you want me 'cause I want you back
You need to get closer to know what you have
I'm yours, so yours

So yours
So yours
I'm yours

Yeah baby, throw your love back at me
I just want you to see, always find it in me
Yeah, I'll be all that you need
I'm yours, so yours

Baby, I can't take the distance no more
Say that I got you, don't put me on hold
Now I am here 'cause I want you to know
I'm yours, so yours

So yours
So yours
I'm yours, so yours---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
