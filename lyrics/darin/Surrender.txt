We were best friends even though I wanted more
Too afraid to ask but I was always sure
I see you now and then but my feelings never change
You went and fell in love, left me standin in the rain
I guess he stole your heart but I see he broke it too
Thats something I would never do

[Chorus]
If only you would walk away
And be without the shadows left by him
He never loved you anyway
I wish that you would break and let me in
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender, whoa

With every shot he fires, its a bullet of a truth
It pierces your heart, but it pierces mine too
You masquerade the pain with the miserable tears
The things are gonna change when Ill make you forget his name
So now youre back in town and I see you everyday
Tonight Im not afraid to say

[Chorus]
If only you would walk away
And be without the shadows left by him
He never loved you anyway
I wish that you would break and let me in
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender, whoa

I think you know, its been you
Nobody else
Ive waited, a long time
And Id be damned if I just let you go

[Chorus]
If only you would walk away
And be without the shadows left by him
He never loved you anyway
I wish that you would break and let me in
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender,
Surrender, to me.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
