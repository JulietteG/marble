(feat. Prophet of 7Lions)

I saw her sitting by herself that night
The room was rich with her perfume
Adjust my tie to get my swagger right
I think I'm 'bout to make a move

Pulling me close with her eyes
My body is losing control
Temperature starting to rise
When we touch  sparks
Makes me wanna scream

Mamma mia
You work it so good that it's bad
Mamma mia
These feelings that I never had
I can't get you out of my skin like a drug
Falling way deeper than love
Mamma mia
Mamma mia

I think I'm drunk just from a single kiss
And I don't even know her name
She whispered to me what the reason is
Said she put pure love in my vein

Pulling me close with her eyes
My body is losing control
Temperature starting to rise
When we touch  sparks
Makes me wanna scream

Mamma mia
You work it so good that it's bad
Mamma mia
These feelings that I never had
I can't get you out of my skin like a drug
Falling way deeper than love
Mamma mia
Mamma mia

Dame un beso
If you say so
Watch her kill him when she hopping up the range road
One kiss gets you hot and space probed
One night, now you giving up your safe code
Overdosing off her potion and the body work
Hangover, love gotta hurt
Make it taste like a ~ tequila
Now screaming out, mamma mia

Mamma mia
You work it so good that it's bad
Mamma mia
These feelings that I never had
I can't get you out of my skin like a drug
Falling way deeper than love
Mamma mia
Mamma mia

Mamma mia
You work it so good that it's bad
Mamma mia
These feelings that I never had
I can't get you out of my skin like a drug
Falling way deeper than love
Mamma mia
Mamma mia

Mamma mia
Mamma mia
Mamma mia
Mamma mia---
