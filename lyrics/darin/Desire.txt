Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you see in me
Give me what I want
Give me what I need
Give me what youve got... give me

Girl you're sexy 
Girl you're cool
Let me give you what you need
Girl you're sexy
Girl youre cool
Let me show you what you need

(Yes...)
You just knock me out
No matter what you do
Come and do me right 
Light my fire
Ive got what you need
And youve got what I want
just hand me the key
pure desire

Ill tell you what I want
Ill tell you what I need
Ill tell you what I see in you
Ill give you what you want
Ill give you what you need
Ill give you what Ive got
You see....

Girl you're sexy ....

I like the way you move your body, yes I do....... ooooohh
I like the way you touch me honey, Yes its true

You just knock me out...---Lyrics submitted by ke.
