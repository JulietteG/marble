I had a bad reaction to your public hobby writings 
Cover your breath, cover your teeth 
I get no satisfaction from your very recent sightings 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Cover your breath, cover your teeth 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Like when I hear a sound of feet slapping on the runway 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Like a small bird pretty while it's crapping on a new day 
Cover your breath, polish your teeth 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
So disappointed I was that I had big small talk with You 
Polish tour teeth, alter your breath 
I'm not feeling your buzz, I only smell your crack of stew 
Alter your teeth, cover your breath 

Bagboy x 8 

She had some beauty of manners, but she looked like a bug 
Cover your breath, alter your speech 
Migrations other type where such good planners and not smart 
Cover your breath, alter your speech 

Bagboy (Bagboy) x 8 

You are proselytizing alone listening to the voice with your ears 
Cover your breath, cover your teeth 
You have her good You're tainting a tone, now sad and You're trapped for 
many years (or smth) 
Cover your breath, polish your speech 
Picked up from dead things that You licked 
(Smth, smth, smth) 

Bagboy x 3---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
