And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

I stumbled up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding light
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray
It ain't even the weekend
Maybe that's how I know you're the one for me

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

Hungover, I think I'm broken
You said the fix is a shot of Jack
I said, "Man, what are you smoking?"
But alright, pour a glass, and we'll throw 'em back

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and party
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do ---
