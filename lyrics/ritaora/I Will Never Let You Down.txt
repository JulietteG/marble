Tell me baby, what we're gonna do
I'll make it easy, got a lot to lose
Watch the sunlight coming through
Open the curtain, let it shine on you

'Cause I been sick and working all week and I been doing just fine
You been tired of watching me, forgot to have a good time, boy
You can't take it, all these face, never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

When you're feeling alone in love
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

Oh ooh
I will never let you down
Oh ooh 
I will never let you down

There's a million ways to go
Don't be embarrassed if you lose control
On the rooftop, now you know
Your body's frozen and you've lost your soul

'Cause I been sick and working all week and I been doing just fine
You been tired of watching me, forgot to have a good time, boy
You can't take it, all these face, never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

When you're feeling alone in love
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

Oh ooh
I will never let you down
Oh ooh 
I will never let you down

Let me take you where you never go
Have a little fun, it's the only way we know
Let me show you what you never see
You know how to love, only when you're holding me, oh!

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

When you're feeling alone in love
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down

When you're feeling alone in love
And you might just give it up
Oh ooh
I will never let you down---Lyrics submitted by Callum.
