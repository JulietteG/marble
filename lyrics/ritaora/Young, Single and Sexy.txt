Tired of sittin' here in my room
Waiting for you to change
With my dress and my lipstick on
You should see it on me, it's such a shame
But I know about the girl you called
The one from the park with the pink heels on
We're damaged, uneven, broken, I'm leaving
I'm way too fly for that

I won't sit back if you want my love
You act like my love is not enough
Don't make me erase you from my phone
Cause I can always go out alone
Who said you were my first and last
Look in the mirror, know what I am
They say love leaves you blind
Well not these eyes of mine

So now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'cause I'm young single and sexy
I'm young single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young single and sexy

He'll be lonely on a Friday night
And thats just what he gets
I've been calling and calling all day
And he still hasn't called me yet
And when he does it'll be too late
You know I'll be at the party hanging with my mates
I'm not gonna sit at home
I'm too busy to wait
I'm way too smart for that

I won't sit here and go back and forth
You act like it's okay, you just got caught
Who said you were my first and last
Look in the mirror, know what I am
They say love leaves you blind, well not these eyes of mine

So now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'cause I'm young single and sexy
I'm young single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young single and sexy

Now I can dance when I wanna
Clap my hands when I wanna
No one can say come home
I'm single on my lone yeah
And I will not be bothered
If I wanna party til tomorrow
Cos I'm sexy and free
That's how it should be
So come on, come on and do it with me

So now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'cause I'm young single and sexy
I'm young single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young single and sexy

So now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'cause I'm young single and sexy
I'm young single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young single and sexy ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
