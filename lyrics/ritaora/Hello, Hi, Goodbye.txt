Hello, hi, goodbye
So I'm saying, hello, hi, goodbye
Saying, hello, hi, goodbye
Saying, hello, hi, goodbye
Saying...

Imagine the future of you and me
Seems good and then you leave
The pain in this vision is killing me
Reality is we will never be
I'm prone to a love travesty
And this feels like another tragedy
And the truth really is we're too young to understand love domain
Love express I'll take you out the fireflies
And it should go and crash
No replying from the ash
We'll just be burning up after that
I hate you, or, you hate me, or, I'll take you, or you'll break me, or
And now I'm scared, cause I've been there
Stuck in this prison, No optimism

And now it's hello, hi, goodbye
My heart has no room for love, so I'm saying, hello, hi goodbye
My heart felt no gimme, saying, hello, hi goodbye
In the other time, I'll be up, saying, hello, hi goodbye
But that thing in me is gone

I know you wish somehow I could explain
I'm still numb from the pain
And I don't want to know your name
Please get up and walk away
I don't wanna fall in love again
Don't want to start anything that could end
I know you think you can get through to me
But I'm in lock in loves penitentiary
I already know how this goes
Laid down, broken, heart broke
I hate you, or, you hate me, or, I'll take you, or you'll break me, or
And now I'm scared, cause I've been there
Stuck in this prison, No optimism

And now it's hello, hi, goodbye
My heart has no room for love, so I'm saying, hello, hi goodbye
My heart felt no gimme, saying, hello, hi goodbye
In the other time, I'll be up, saying, hello, hi goodbye
But that thing in me is gone ---Lyrics submitted by Eronnaa.
