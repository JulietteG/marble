It ain't because of me, baby
That you're bein' alone
Nobody's fault but your own
If you've been lonely
Because if only, reach out for me

You'll reach out for me, baby
I'm as close as your phone
Ever since you've been gone
I've been home
And home ain't home

Without that feelin' without that smile
Without your love baby it's all not worthwhile
And I need that feelin' I need that smile
To make my life worth livin
Oh sweet honey chile
Sweet, sweet honey chile

Let's get together
Lets get together---
