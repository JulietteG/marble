 

I see the crystal raindrops fall 
And the beauty of it all 
Is when the sun comes shinin' through 

To make those rainbows in my mind 
When I think of you some time 
And I want to spend some time with you 

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try 
Just the two of us, just the two of us 
Building castles in the sky 
Just the two of us, you and I 

We look for love, no time for tears 
Wasted waters all that is 
And it don't make no flowers grow 

Good things might come to those who wait 
Not to those who wait too late 
We got to go for all we know 

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try 
Just the two of us, just the two of us 
Building castles in the sky 
Just the two of us, you and I 

I hear the crystal raindrops fall 
On the window down the hall 
And it becomes the morning dew 

Darling, when the morning comes 
And I see the morning sun 
I want to be the one with you 

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try 
Just the two of us, just the two of us 
Building big castles way on high 
Just the two of us, you and I 

Just the two of us, let's get together, baby 
Just the two of us, we can make it 
Just the two of us, we can make it 
Just the two of us---
