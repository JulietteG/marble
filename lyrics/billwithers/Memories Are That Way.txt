Memories take you back
To the good times
When it's over
And the sad times disappear
Memories are that way, memories are that way

Memories tell you that
All the best times
In your lifetime
Are the times of yesteryear
Memories are that way, memories are that way
Memories are that way

Memories are the words to love songs
Sung throughout the years
Memories of the herds of love songs
Sung through smiles and tears

Memories take you back
To the lean times
In between times
And the times when you knew fear
Memories are that way, memories are that way ---Lyrics submitted by Deborah Douglas.
