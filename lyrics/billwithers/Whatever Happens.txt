Whatever happens 
We'll have some love along the way 
But it ain't easy 
We'll look for some words of love to say 
And smile..mmmmm 
It may happen anyway 
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight' 

And whatever happens 
They're'll be some time along the way 
When it ain't easy 
It just can't be sunshine everyday 
We'll smilemmmmm 
And be happy, anyway 
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight' 

I've got you in my life 
Together we can reach the higher ground 
We'll be alright 
Just as long as you're around 
Girl, I won't let you down 

Whatever happens 
There'll be some good times, and some bad 
But it ain't easy 
Let's just remember the good times that we had 
And just smilemmmm 
And be happy, anyway 
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight'---
