I get a warm summer feeling walking through the snow
Even chilly darkness has the brightest glow
And I just love you so, sometimes I just don't know
Time just seems to help this wondrous feeling grow
Maybe I might wake up early one morning
And find it isn't so

I just love you so
Sometimes I just don't know

Feeling like a rich man haven't got a dime
Feeling like a young man but I'm old as father time

And I just love you so
Sometimes I just don't know
I just don't know---
