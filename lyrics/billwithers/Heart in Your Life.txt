There is only one love in your lifetime 
There is only one lover can only do right 
When they love you until the daylight 
They put their heart on your life 

There is only one love in your lifetime 
Keeps on turning you on when you turn out the light 
And they love you with all their might 
They put their heart on your life 

Put a little heart in your life oh 
Put a little heart in your life 
Put a little heart in your life 
They put their heart in your life 

Hold on! I'm in love and only love 
What she can do tonight 
Hold on! When the lover in your life 
They put their heart in your life 

There is only love in the nighttime 
Keep on turning you on when you turn out the light 
When they do unto you to do right 
Put the heart on in your life 

There is only one love in your lifetime 
There is only one lover can only do right 
When they love you until the daylight 
They put their heart on your life 

Put a little heart in your life oh 
Put a little heart in your life 
Put a little heart in your life 
They put their heart in your life---
