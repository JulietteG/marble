Hold up, let me answer my phone 
Some bitch callin me about some bullshit probably 
I'ma call you right back 
I'm doin' this mixtape right now 
Now back to what I was sayin 

Somebody said they saw you 
The person you were kissing wasn't me 
And I would never ask you 
I just kept it to myself 

I don't wanna know 
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low 
Cause my heart can't take it anymore 
And if your creepin, please don't let it show 
Oh baby, I don't wanna know 

Oh baby 
I think about it when I hold you 
When lookin in your eyes, I can't believe 
I don't need to know the truth 
Baby keep it to yourself 

I don't wanna know 
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low 
Cause my heart can't take it anymore 
And if your creepin, please don't let it show 
Oh baby, I don't wanna know 

Did he touch you better then me (touch you better then me) 
Did he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep) 
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me (do to me baby) 
If your better off that way (better off that way) 
Baby what I like to say (all that I can say) 
Go on and do your thing and don't come back to me 
(Stay away from me baby) 

I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin 
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin 
It's been proven, my love you abusin 
I can't understand, how a man got you choosin (yeah) 
Undecided, I came and provided 
My undivided, you came and denied it (why?) 
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (I know when you lyin) 
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin (stop cryin) 
I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know 
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go) 
And I don't wanna let you leave 
Can't say I didn't let you breathe 
Gave you extra G's (c'mon), put you in the SUV 
You wanted ice so I made you freeze 
Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right) 
Now it's time you invest in me 
Cause if not then it's best you leave 
Holla, yeah 

I don't wanna know 
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low 
Cause my heart can't take it anymore 
And if your creepin, please don't let it show 
Oh baby, I don't wanna know 

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low 
Cause my heart can't take it anymore 
And if your creepin, please don't let it show 
Oh baby, I don't wanna know 

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low 
Cause my heart can't take it anymore 
And if your creepin, please don't let it show 
Oh baby, I don't wanna know---
