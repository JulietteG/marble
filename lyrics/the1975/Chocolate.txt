Hey now, I call you a split because I know that you will
Oh, you buy your friend like chocolate
You said we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Now run run away from the boys in the blue
Oh, my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, I think about what to do
I think about what to say
I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it

Oh, and we go where nobody knows
We've guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't start smoking it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Hey now, we're building up speed as we're approaching a hill
Oh, my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now, you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Go and get it, go and get it, go and get it, go and get it, go
And play it cool

Oh, you said we go where nobody knows
We've guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Well I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go

Well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

We go where nobody knows
We've guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Well I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go

Well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca.
