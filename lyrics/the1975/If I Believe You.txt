Ive got a God shaped hole thats infected
And Im petrified of being alone now
It's pathetic, I know

And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I lost my head (lost my head)

And if I believe you
Will that make it stop?
If I told you I need you
Is that what you want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
And I'm asking you Jesus, show yourself

I thought Id met you once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be your child if you insist
I mean if it was you that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I'm a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell and miss, you better start selling this

And if I believe you
Will that make it stop?
If I told you I need you
Is that what you want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
And I'm asking you Jesus, show yourself

If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
Then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah---
