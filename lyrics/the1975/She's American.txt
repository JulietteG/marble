A big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look! He's having a breakdown
Oh what a let down, a shame, I think he might die!"
She's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said I've got a lot to learn

You know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)

She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
Don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)

Well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me looking vacant

If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)
If she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)---
