She had a face straight out a magazine
God only knows but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
When she gets his gun he's begging, "Babe stay, stay, stay, stay, stay."

I'll give him one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, cause I know you

Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You've got a pretty kinda dirty face
And when you're leaving your home she's begging you, "Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay."

I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Just said one more line
There'll be a riot, cause I know you

Well, now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
Now shoot him if it's what you're worth
And if you just take off your mask
to find out that everything's gone wrong, wrong, wrong.

Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
She says, "Babe, you look so cold, you look so cold, you look so cold, cold, cold, cold
You look so cold, you look so cold, you look so cold, cold, cold, cold, cold."---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
