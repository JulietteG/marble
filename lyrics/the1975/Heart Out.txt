Im rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beats made for two
Cos I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said its nice to have your friends round
We're watching a television with no sound

Its just you and I tonight
Why dont you figure my heart out

Push your lack of chest out look at my hair 
Gotta love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking up whole towns
A reflection on your mental health
Cos I remembered when I found you
Much younger than you are now
Once it started I am friend zone
You created a television in your mouth

Its just you and I tonight
Why dont you figure my heart out

You've got something to say
Why dont speak it out loud
Instead of living in your head
It's always to say why dont you take your heart out
Instead of living in your head

Its just you and I tonight
Why dont you figure my heart out---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
