Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war.
With nothing but your t-shirt on.
And go sit on the bed 'cause I know that you want to.
You got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong.

And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade.
And go lie on the floor if you want.
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was they're too strong, too strong.
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong.

Yeah, If you wanna find love then you know where the city is [x4]

Yeah counting cards was the best job he ever had.
Cleaning up.
He got good with his 4s and his 2s.
Community service was the best job he ever had.
Cleaning up.
He got sick on the floor and his shoes.

Oh and she said "It's your birthday,
Are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD.
You'll be feeling just fine.
Your brother is just sat there,
You said you felt snide.
You hope that that boy will be alright.

Yeah, If you wanna find love then you know where the city is [x4]

Yeah well she said "It's your birthday,
Are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD.
You'll be feeling just fine.
Your brother is just sat there,
You said you felt snide.
You hope that that boy will be alright.

Yeah, If you wanna find love then you know where the city is [x4]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
