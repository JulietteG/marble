A soft sound to the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face.
Oh what a let down, I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place.

You're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you.
You're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two.

For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your arms, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you.

A small town dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face.
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place.

You're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking around you.
You're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two.
