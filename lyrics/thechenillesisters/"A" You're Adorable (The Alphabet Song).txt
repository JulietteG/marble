A youre adorable
B youre so beautiful
C youre a cutie full of charm
D youre a darling
And E youre exciting
And F youre a feather in my arms.
G you look good to me
H youre so heavenly
I youre the one I idolize
J were like Jack and Jill
K youre so kissable
L is the love light in your eye
M,N, O, P,
I could go one all day
Q, R, S, T,
Alphabetically speaking, 
Youre ok
U make my life complete
V means youre very sweet.
W, X, Y, Z,
Its fun to wonder through
The alphabet with you
To tell you what you mean to me.

M,N, O, P,

Its fun to wonder through
The alphabet with you
To tell you what you mean to me.
Its fun to wonder through
The alphabet with you
To tell you what you mean to me.---Lyrics submitted by Jordanna Wagner.
