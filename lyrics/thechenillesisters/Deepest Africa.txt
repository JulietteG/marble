I was in deepest Africa
Yes I was, yes I was
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching  elephants to dance
Dont look askance
For elephants love to sing and dance
In their fancy hot pants
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching elephants to dance

I was in deepest Africa
Yea I was, yeas I was
I was in deepest africa
Watching a Tucan can-can
When in the Sudan
A Tucan can can-can
Better than any ten Tucans can
I was in deepest Africa
Watching a Tucan can-can

I was in deepest Africa
Yes I was, yes I was
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching a gnu to gnit
Each stitch that gnu would knit
He would throw a fit
like a gnu-canit-fit
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching a gnu to gnit
Connect one, pearl two
Connect one, pearl two

I was in deepest Africa
Yes I was, yes I was
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching a baboon to croon
Each tune that baboon would croon
Made the she baboon
Loonier than moon goon
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching a baboon to croon

I was in deepest Africa
Yes I was, yes I was
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching Hippopotami to fly
Dont sigh,
Look up in the sky
Hippopotami will be flying by
I was in deepest Africa
Teaching hippopotami to fly---Lyrics submitted by Jordanna Wagner.
