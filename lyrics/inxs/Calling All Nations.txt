Well you spent the whole day
With your axe to the wheel
Read the late paper it was full of bad news
Excuse me but I think what I'm saying is true
You've got to find some time and devote it to you

So come on down
To the party
Callin' all nations
To put it on the line

So come on all you people with the stars in your hair
You know what's going on
There's no need to despair
Take the chains from your mind
Take the chains from your feet
And do the sex dance 'cause it's necessary

You don't have to be rich
You don't have to be famous
You just gotta have a little bit of patience
Jump into your old car
Or take a cab, train or boat
The only thing that matters
Is that ya gotta really go---
