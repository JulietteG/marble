You've got me popppin champagne
I'm at it again
Caught up in the moment 
But not in the right way
I'm falling in between 
Tearin' up at the seams
With tracks aimin' to please
And aesthetics don't hurt one bit

So follow me down (follow me down)
Take this all the way
Any way you want to

Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between 
The nights and days fly by 
When I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?

You've got me thinkin' that
Merely I've been wishin'
The television set would show me 
More than than just a picture
Of things that I've grown to detest

I strip down my dignity
They can't take all of me
But they wont ever take
What I still believe
So follow me down (follow me down)
Take this all the way any way you want to 

Why don't you say so
I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days
Fly by when I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes they despise you
For who I am
Why don't you say so
Why don't you say so

Cause on the let go
I'm just a boy with a dream 
And you can take one look 
As I'm falling between
And my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so? 
Why don't you say so?

I know
I know 
I know that there's
A place for me somewhere out there
I know 
I know 
I know that there's a place for me somewhere out there

Why don't you say so? 
I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets

And my eyes they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so? 
Why don't you say so?
Cause on the let go
I'm just a boy with a dream
And you can take one look 
As I fall in between

With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?---Lyrics submitted by Kyera.
