The time on the clock reads half past four.
I'm wide awake and thinking, with my pillow on the floor.
That maybe i'm just wasting my time dreaming, in a harsh reality.
I don't wanna wake up to find out i've been deceived.

(Chorus)
Let it roll.
Our time is fleeting so we take control.
From california to my home sweet home.
Our days repeating like it's all er know.
It's all we know.

(guitar)

Out here the hills roll on for miles.
And the sun is like my own sence of direction.
I'm always drawn to each horizon.
When it's rising, when it sets, but all i can think about is sex.
And playing one more game of six-cup in the back yard.
At "The Wedge".
I know i'll never die alone because of all of you.

(Chorus)

Take, take a breath, we've got all the time in the world.
To get a grip on the fact that we don't last.
But right now i wanna watch the tide roll in with my bestfriends.

Let it roll.
Our time is fleeting so we take control.
From california let it roll.
Our time is fleeting so we take control.
From california to my home sweet home.
Let it roll.
It's all we know.
It's all we know.---Lyrics submitted by arielle.
