long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I wanna be saved
my song has not been sung
so long live us

looking out at a town called suburbia,
everybody's just fighting to fit in,
little rats running mazes, having babies,
it's a vicious little world
that we live in

looking back at a life on the other side
i realize that i didn't fit in
didn't hate it
but I didn't quite relate it
to my precious little world

so long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I wanna be saved
my song has not been sung

and long live the fast times
so come what may
I don't think I'll ever be saved
our song has not been sung
long live us

breaking out of a town called suburbia
i remember everybody always saying
"little brats must be crazy, never make it
in our vicious little world"
still I'm leaving

got a van, got a chance, got my diginity
got a dream, got a spark, got somewhere to be,
take a breath, say goodbye
to their precious little world
(Say goodbye to me)


so long live the reckless and the brave
I don't think I wanna be saved
my song has not been sung

and long live the fast times
so come what may
I don't think I'll ever be saved
our song has not been sung
long live us
long live us---Lyrics submitted by Guillermo.
