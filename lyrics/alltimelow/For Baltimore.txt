Mayday situation overload
I'm restless, obsessed with your future
And all my worries they don't bother you
Collected, you render me useless
But I carry on

Right now, I think that you think that I'm
Half drunk, searching for something of
Substance, casually dropping a line, designed
To keep you next to me
I can't awkwardly craft in advance
I know, that you wouldn't fall for that
You say "Shut up and take my hand"
And we carry on

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me

Hot damn, look at me now
I'm all, caught up riding the high of my
Good luck, casually dropping a line, designed,
To keep you next to me
I bet you never thought you would fall again
So much for keeping this, just friends
Shut up and kiss me now
And we carry on

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me
(Do it for me)

Mayday situation overload
I'm restless, obsessed with your future
And all my worries they don't bother you
Collected, you render me useless
But I carry on

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me ---Lyrics submitted by Alana Nicole.
