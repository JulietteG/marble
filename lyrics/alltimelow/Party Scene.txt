Hey, kid, you've got, a lot of potential 
but I think its time to move up, so go on and blow us away with your sound;
Now you're everything that we've come to love,
you taught us to move, so we'll show it off,
just drop us the beat...

Here's to the fast times; the times we felt alive; 
to all the nights that we forgot to get back home.
Stay seventeen,
the party scene has got the best of me and you,
we've got to let this go...

Drink up last call before the sunrise sets the scene,
of empty bottles, heavy hearts,
the memories of broken dreams...
We were so tired yet so alive,
wrapped up in lies like sheets of another one night stand,
you know you left the girl with nothing but the,

Sunrise through the window pane, where tired eyes will close....
Stay seventeen, the party scene has got the best of me and you,
we've got to let this go...

I know she hopes I choke on this last drink,
drop dead before my influence gets to her head...
She said, "I'll love you forever, or find something better.
It's all just the same as when we sleep together.
We wake up with headaches, and trouble remembering
what went wrong..."

Stay seventeen,
the party scene has got the best of me and you,
we've got to let this go...---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
