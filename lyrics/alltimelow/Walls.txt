Hey there it's good to see you again
It never felt right calling this just friends
Im happy if youre happy with yourself
Take off your shirt, your shoes
Those skinny jeans I bought for you
Were diving in, theres nothing left to lose

Im gonna break down these walls (down these walls)
Ive built around myself
I wanna fall so in love (so in love)
With you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together well move on, just dont turn around
Let the walls break down

I used to wear you like a ball and chain
I'd run and hide at the call of my name
It was obvious you were too much for me
Oblivious, I was young and horny
In retrospect I won't do it again
Stop talking shit to every one of your friends
Im not the same boy you knew back then

Cause I can break down these walls (down these walls)
Ive built around myself
I wanna fall so in love (so in love)
With you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together well move on, just dont turn around
Let the walls break

I cant breathe my bodys shaking
You got a way with the way you take me
Cause you break me down
You know you break me down

Im gonna break down these walls (down these walls)
Ive built around myself
I wanna fall so in love (so in love)
With you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together well move on, just dont turn around
Let the walls break down

(Im gonna break down these walls Ive built around myself)
Let the walls break down
(Im gonna break down these walls)
Cause you break me down
(Cause you break me down)
Cause you break me down
Let the walls break down---Lyrics submitted by courtney.
