Should I write myself out of the history books, 
and mark a place in time for every chance you took, 
Don't get me wrong I know you've got your life in place - 
I've yet to take the hint, 
Some day 
I'm sure I'll get the picture, 
and stop waiting up... 

When it all comes down, 
to a sunrise on the east side, 
will you be there to carry home, 
the remains of my wasted youth, 
this wasted time on you 
has left me shaking in waiting, 
shaking in waiting for something more. 

Tonight is alive with the promise of a street-fight, 
and there's money on the table, 
that says your cheap-shots won't be able, 
to break bones. 
I've yet to break a sweat 
I'll make your past regret its future. 
Here's to you. 

When it all comes down, 
to a sunrise on the east side, 
will you be there to carry home, 
the remains of my wasted youth, 
this wasted time on you 
has left me shaking in waiting, 
for something more. 

Make all of my decisions for me, 
I've never taken the fall for deceit, 
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing, 
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like... [repeat] 

I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing, 
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing, 
for more than just a moment of truth between the lies told, 
to pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back home... 
I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing, 
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here... 

When it all comes down, 
to a sunrise on the east side, 
will you be there to carry me home, 
the remains of my wasted youth, 
this wasted time on you 
has left me shaking in waiting, 
for something more.---Lyrics submitted by kami.
