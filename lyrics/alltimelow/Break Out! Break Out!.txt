Luck loves me not tonight, I'm running out
This four leaf clover's all but useless now
I've got four wheels that say I'm not alone tonight
I'm always looking for a joy ride through the brightest part of this town

Break out, break out, as we escape through the window
Head for the car and never look back singing, singing
Break out, break out, our time has come and we've got these big city dreams

Put up or shut up, we're not wasting time again
The credits are rolling and we're getting lost again
In parking lots to serenading sirens as the blue lights bathed our smiles

Break out, break out,as we escape through the window
head for the car, and never look back singing, singing
Break out, break out, our time has come and we've got these big city dreams

Lets take a moment to reflect,on the past few years of my life
I haven't worked myself away, to stay inside
This is the time to let us...

Break out, break out, as we escape through the window
Head for the car, and never look back singing, singing
Break out, break out, our time has come and we've got these big city dreams---Lyrics submitted by Eric.
