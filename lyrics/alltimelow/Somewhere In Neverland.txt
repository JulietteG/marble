Say goodbye to the halls and the classes
Say hello to a the job and the taxes
The weekends with old friends spilling into 9 to 5 routine
Tell me how you feel over and done with
Like your life is a map with no compass to guide
At the bar drinking way too much
We sing along to forever young, 

So here we go again (again)
Wish that we could start again
Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy dont you see what you do to me
I wanna be a lost boy
The last chance a better reality
(Yeaaah) 
Wendy we can get away
I promise if youre with me say the word and well find a way
And I can be a lost boy
The last chance your everything that I planned
Ohh Somewhere in neverland (x2),

Well start a life of the plane and the simple
Of great times with far better people
And weekends with our friends
Laughing about the wine that stains there teeth
Well talk about how your parents separated and
How you dont wanna make the same mistakes as them
Ill say its all about sticking it out and trying to feel forever young

So here we go again (again)
Wish that we could start again
Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy dont you see what you do to me
I wanna be a lost boy
The last chance a better reality
(Yeaaah) 
Wendy we can get away
I promise if youre with me say the word and well find a way
And I can be a lost boy
The last chance your everything that I planned
Ohh Somewhere in neverland,

(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh  )

So here we go again (again)
Wish that we could start again
Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy dont you see what you do to me
I wanna be a lost boy
The last chance a better reality
(Yeaaah) 
Wendy we can get away
I promise if youre with me say the word and well find a way
And I can be a lost boy
The last chance your everything that I planned
Ohh somewhere in neverland (x3).---Lyrics submitted by Ellie Geddes.
