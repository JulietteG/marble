Wishing on a star that's just a satellite
Driving in a car with broken tail-lights
Growing up with eyes glued shut

Wishing on a star that's just a satellite
Driving in a car with broken tail-lights

Na-na Na Na-na Na
Na-na Na Na-na

Strip club in a strip mall
Million ways to die
All the things we lost in
The backseat of the sky

Growing up with eyes glued shut

Wishing on a star that's just a satellite
Driving in a car with broken tail-lights

Na-na Na Na-na Na
Na-na Na Na-na

We were just kids, we were just kids singing
We were just kids, we were just kids---
