Who's gonna listen when you run out of lies?
Who's gonna hear you, when your words seem worthless?
Who's gonna save you when you're out of time?
And who's gonna want you, when you're on your knees, begging:

"Oh, please take me at my word, I'm desperate
I swear, I never meant to hurt no one, no
Oh, please stay for what it's worth, I'm desperate"
You're on your own

So don't you call my name
I will take you down
Should've known that you've been dancing with a wolf
So don't you call my name
I will take you down
I'm not your friend, you burned a bridge
I chew you up and spit you out
Oh woah oh woah oh
There's no love for a liar, no love for a liar
Oh woah oh woah oh
There's no love for a liar, no love
So don't you call my name
(Call my name)

No one to listen when you're running your mouth
No one to hear you when your words seem worthless
No one to save you when you're coming down
No one to want you, when you're on your knees, begging:

"Oh, please take me at my word, I'm desperate
I swear, I never meant to hurt no one, no
Oh, please stay for what it's worth, I'm desperate"
You're on your own

So don't you call my name
I will take you down
Should've known that you've been dancing with a wolf
So don't you call my name
I will take you down
I'm not your friend, you burned a bridge
I chew you up and spit you out
Oh woah oh woah oh
There's no love for a liar, no love for a liar
Oh woah oh woah oh
There's no love for a liar, no love
So don't you call my name

Fool me once, it's shame on you
Fool me twice, and let the wolves come crashing through
Fool me once, it's shame on you
Fool me twice, and let the wolves come

So don't you call my name
I will take you down
Should've known that you've been dancing with a wolf

Don't you call my name
I will take you down
Should've known that you've been dancing with a wolf
So don't you call my name
I will take you down
I'm not your friend, you burned a bridge
I chew you up and spit you out
Oh woah oh woah oh
There's no love for a liar, no love for a liar
Oh woah oh woah oh
There's no love for a liar, no love
So don't you call my name
(Call my name, call my name)---
