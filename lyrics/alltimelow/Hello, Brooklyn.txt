This city
So pretty
Under moon-lit skies
We'll be hanging like a cigarette

So stunning
Start running
Tonight's like a knife
Would you cut me with your kiss

I bleed red lips,
You're unbelievable
Can't miss this chance to take you
Out, here's my invitation (invitation)

Hello, Brooklyn
Hey, LA
Take the streets all night
'Cause we sleep all day
When the world comes crashing down
Who's ready to party?
Hello, Brooklyn
Hey, LA
Coast to coast,
I'll take you down in flames
Let the good times roll
We can let go
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh (x2)

This city
Was your city
Heels on the sidewalk
Begging' for a back-beat

Don't worry
I fight dirty
Tonight's like a right-hook
Knock you off your feet

I'll be yours truly
Unbelievable
Can't miss this chance to take you
Out, here's your invitation (invitation)

Hello, Brooklyn
Hey, LA
Take the streets all night
'Cause we sleep all day
When the world comes crashing down
Who's ready to party?
Hello, Brooklyn
Hey, LA
Coast to coast,
I'll take you down in flames
Let the good times roll
We can let go
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world

Kiss it all goodbye
Tonight you've never been more alive
You're so alive
You're not afraid to die
And I can see it in your eyes, your eyes

Hello Brooklyn, hey LA
Take the streets all night cause we sleep all day
When the world comes crashing down, who's ready to party?
Hello Brooklyn, hey LA
Coast to coast, I'll take you down in flames
Let the good times roll, we can let go
Everybody knows that there's a party at the end of the world
