He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes,
started making his way past two in the morning,
he hasn't been sober for days,
leaning now, into the breeze,
remembering sunday he falls to his knees.
they had breakfast together,
but two eggs don't last like the feeling of what he needs.

now this place is familiar to him,
she pulls on his hand with a devilish grin,
she led him upstairs,
she led him upstairs,
left him dying to get inside.

forgive me i'm trying find,
my calling, i'm calling at night.
i don't mean to be a bother,
but have you seen this girl?
she's been running through my dreams,
and it's driving me crazy it seems,
i'm gonna ask her to marry me.

even though she doesn't believe in love,
he's determined to call her bluff,
who could deny, these butterflies?
they're filling his gut.
waking the neighbors,
unfamiliar faces,
she pleads oh she tries,
but she's only denied,
now he's dying to get inside.

forgive me i'm trying find,
my calling, i'm calling at night.
i don't mean to be a bother,
but have you seen this girl?
she's been running through my dreams,
and it's driving me crazy it seems,
i'm gonna ask her to marry me.

the neighbors said she moved away.
funny how it rained all day.
i didn't think much of it then,
but it's starting to all make sense.
oh i can see now,
that all of these clouds,
are following me in my desperate endeavor,
to find my whoever,
where ever she may be.

[juliet simms]
i'm not coming back,
i've done something so terrbile,
i'm terrified to speak but you'd expect that from me,
i'm mixed up,
i'll be blunt,
now the rain is just washing you out of my hair,
and out of my mind.
keeping an eye on the world,
with so many thousands of feet of the ground.
i'm over you now,
like i'm at home in the clouds,
towering over your head.

[all time low]
i guess i'll go home now,
i guess i'll go home now,
i guess i'll go home now,
i guess i'll go home.---Lyrics submitted by carsen.
