Caught in a cold sweat,
Stuck splitting hairs,
And drinking too much I'm on my way to striking out,
Go to sleep with the pressure of everyone,
Watching and waiting they're yours for the taking,
But I still have my doubts.

Before you ask which way to go,
Remember where you've been.

Stay awake,
Get a grip and get out, you're safe,
From the weight of the world just take,
A second to set things straight,
I'll be fine,
Even though I'm not always right,
I can count on the sun to shine,
The dedication takes a lifetime,
But dreams only last for a night.

Figure it out,
Boy you're tripping, so pull yourself together,
Or you'll wash up like the rest,
This ship is sinking,
I'm thinking "I'm done for",
I'll watch as the sails disappear underwater,
Cause I'm no captain yet (I'm no captain yet).

I said before you ask which way to go,
Remember where you've been.

Stay awake,
Get a grip and get out you're safe,
From the weight of the world just take,
A second to set things straight,
I'll be fine,
Even though I'm not always right,
I can count on the sun to shine,
The dedication takes a lifetime,
But dreams only last for a night.

Believe you me,
I'll give them everything,
I'd tell them anything,
To show them everything,
Believe you me,
I'll tell them everything,
I'd tell them anything,
To show them everything.

Cause you ain't the only one's who wanna live it up! 
You ain't the only one's! 
Cause you ain't the only one's who wanna live it up! 
You ain't the only one's! 
Cause you ain't the only one's who wanna live it up! 
You ain't the only one's! 
Cause you ain't the only one's who wanna live it up! 
You ain't the only one's! 

Stay awake (wake),
Get a grip and get out your safe (safe),
From the weight of the world just take (take),
A second to set things straight,
I'll be fine (fine),
Even though I'm not always right (right),
I can count on the sun to shine (shine),
Dedication takes a lifetime,
But dreams only last for a night.---Lyrics submitted by Linsaay.
