I heard that you've been self-medicating
In the quiet of your room, your sweet suburban tune
And if you need a friend, I'll help you stitch up your wounds

I heard that you've been having some trouble
Finding your place in the world, I know how much that hurts
But if you need a friend, then please just say the word

You've come this far you're all cleaned up
You've made a mess again
There's no more trying, time to sort yourself out

Hold on tight, this ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done

Now don't lose your fight, kid
It only takes a little push to pull on through
With so much left to do
You'll be missing out and we'll be missing you

I heard that you've been having some trouble
Finding your place in the world, I know how much that hurts
And if you need a friend, then please just say the word

You've come this far you're all cleaned up
You've made a mess again
There's no more trying, time to sort yourself out

Hold on tight, this ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done

Now don't lose your fight, kid
It only takes a little push to pull on through
With so much left to do
You'll be missing out and we'll be missing you

Grit your teeth, pull your hair, paint the walls black
And scream "fuck the world, 'cause it's my life, I'm gonna take it back"
And never for a second blame yourself

Hold on tight, this ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done

Hold on tight, this ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done

Now don't lose your fight, kid
It only takes a little push to pull on through
With so much left to do
You'll be missing out and we'll be missing you---
