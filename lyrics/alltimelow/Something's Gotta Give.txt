I woke up in a strangers bed
With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I dont even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I dont have a clue at all
Oh yeah

Im sinking
Youre waiting
Im thinking somethings gotta give
Wake me up, say enough is enough
Im dying to live
Somethings gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
Im dying to live
Somethings gotta give

Maybe Im a f-cking waste
Filling up the empty space
Ive been here way too long
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Im feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on the last paycheck
Im the cliche in a song
And everybodys singing along

Someone please come pull me
Out from the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up, Im falling
Wake me up, say enough is enough
Im dying to live
Somethings gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
Im dying to live
Somethings gotta give---
