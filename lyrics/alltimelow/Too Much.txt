I admit, I miss seeing your face, babe
(Seeing your face, babe)
Being alone is starting to take its toll
I'm cold and it's getting old
(Getting old)

I admit
(I admit)
I should've made some changes
(Changes)
We were so smothered in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air
(For air)What a waste

Where did the time go?
Where did our minds go?
I don't know
What's this place?
Where did our home go?
We won't know
I don't know

Too much of anything
Is too much
Too much of love
Can be too much
We had too much time
Too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, much
Much too much

I admit, I'm still watching the days go by
(Watching the days go by)
Sleeping alone is starting to break me down
It's cold, but I should've known
(Should have known)

I admit
(I admit)
I made a few mistakes, babe
(Mistakes, babe)
We were so caught up in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air

What a waste
Where does the time go?
Where did our minds go?
I don't know
What's this place?
Where did my heart go?
We'll never know
I'll never know

Too much of anything
Is too much
Too much of love
Can be too much
We had too much time
Too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Much too much

I need to find a reason to feel
Like everything was meant to be let go
Take it slow
'Cause I can't be on my own

Too much of anything
Is too much
(It's just too much)
Too much of love
Can be too much
(It's just too)
We had too much time
Too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, much
Much too much---Lyrics submitted by courtney.
