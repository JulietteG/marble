I fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up
All my broken things

'Cause you left me
Police scene, chalk line
Tequila shots
In the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling
That I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh, oh, oh
How was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me?
I think that I should go(Go!)
Something's telling me to leave
But I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya
Damned if I don't

It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call
And I end up alone
You made up, dressed up, messed up
Plans I set in stone

And you may be too
But i dont like dancing in the alley
With a streetrat night life
Can't keep living with a feeling
That I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh, oh, oh
How was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me?
I think that I should go(Go!)
Something's telling me to leave
But I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya
Damned if I don't

Make a fool of myself
When you hang around
When you're gone
I'm a match that's burning out
Could've been, should've done
What I said I was going to
(Said that I was going to)
But I never promised you
(But I never promised you)
Promised you, promised you

Oh, oh, oh
How was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me?
I think that I should go(Go!)
It never took a fool
To see the things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya
Damned if I do ya

Oh, oh, oh
('Cause you left me)
How was I supposed to know
(Police scene, chalk line)
That you were oh, oh, over me?
(Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime)
I think that I should go
Something's telling me to leave
But I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya
Damned if I dadado  
Damned if i do ya 
Damned if I don't---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
