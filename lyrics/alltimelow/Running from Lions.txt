Get me out of this place
before I cause more damage
A small price to pay for building houses
out of matchsticks
And when things get too hot
You've got me to blame
For every fire that breaks out 
In every lovers name

Chorus:
Don't forget we've got 
unfinished business
Stories yet to unfold
Tales that must be retold
And I regret not knowing
When to put an end to all this madness
Keeps me wanting, keeps me wanting more

Sell me out I'm
Yesterdys old news
Phrases on paper black and bleeding through
the pages where we made our history
Call me foolish
I feel hopless

Running from lions, 
never felt like such a mistake (Like a dear caught in the headlights)
Running from lions, 
never felt like such a mistake (I won't know what hit me...)
Running from lions, 
never felt like such a mistake (Like a dear caught in the headlights)
Running from lions, 
never felt like such a... (I won't know what hit me...)

Don't forget we've got 
unfinished business,
stories yet to unfold, 
tales that must be retold,
and I regret not knowing when to put an end to all this madness,
keeps me wanting, keeps me wanting, 
keeps me wanting, keeps me wanting more---Lyrics submitted by Zoe.
