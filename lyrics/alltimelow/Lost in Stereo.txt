Lost in stereo, lost in stereo (x2)

She works for the weekend, mix-tape of her favorite bands, tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound, she's trouble in tank-top, pretty little time-bomb, blowin' up-take you down, livin in the radio lost in the stereo's sound. 

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go, but she's so lost in stereo, lost in stereo. She's out of control, so beautiful in stereo, lost in stereo. I've been ,waiting, for so long, she'll never know, I'm losing hope, 'cause she's so lost in stereo, lost in stereo.

Shake-down on a Saturday, Sit back, gotta catch my breath, 'cause everytime I see her, know she's gunna take back somehow, Tattoos and a switch-blade attitude, snake-bite heart wth a bubble-gum smile, sex in stereo, don't turn the radio dial,

CHORUS

I'm just like cellophane, 'cause shes sees right through me, I know, she's glittler and gold, and that's just the price I pay, when I don't even know her name, she's slipping away,

She works for the weekends, mix-tape of her favorite bands, tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound.

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
