Do you feel like something's missing,
when your skin is pressed to mine?
I would whisper you a riot if you'd listen,
to the sound that you've ignored a thousand times...

'Cause I am only me when I'm without you,

All I ever wanted was a part of you that I couldn't break,
a piece of you that I couldn't take apart, but we're in pieces now,
and all you ever wanted was a part of me that I couldn't fake,
I never made it easy to shape my heart, but it's not beating now,
I have to let you down...

There is ice in place of answers,
and a cold that chills the bones,
When September came and went without an answer,
we were left to Fall for Winter on our own...

Now I am only me when I'm without you,

All I ever wanted was a part of you that I couldn't break,
a piece of you that I couldn't take apart, but we're in pieces now,
and all you ever wanted was a part of me that I couldn't fake,
I never made it easy to shape my heart, but it's not beating now,
I have to let you down...

('Cause I am only me, when I am without you,
yeah I am only me when I am without you...)

All I ever wanted was a part of you that I couldn't break,
a piece of you that I couldn't take apart, but we're in pieces now,

All I ever wanted was a part of you that I couldn't break, (yeah, I have to let you down...)
a piece of you that I couldn't take apart, but we're in pieces now, (I have to let you down,)
and all you ever wanted was a part of me that I couldn't fake,
I never made it easy to shape my heart, but it's not beating now,
I have to let you down... ---
