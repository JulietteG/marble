Make it a sweet, sweet goodbye.
This could be for the last time and it's not right.
"Don't let yourself get in over your head," he said. 
"Alone and far from home we'll find you"

Dead - like a candle you've burned out 
Spill the wax over the space left in place of angry words.
Scream to be heard like you needed any more attention 
Throw the bottle, break the door and dissappear. 

Sing me to sleep. 
I'll see you in my dreams. 
Waiting to say "I miss you I'm so sorry."

Forever's never seemed so long cause when you're not around 
It's like a piece of me is missing. 
I could have learned so much from you but what's left now? 
Don't you realize you've shown this family a world of pain? 
Can't you see this should've been a happy ending we let go? 

Sing me to sleep. 
I'll see you in my dreams. 
Waiting to say "I miss you. I'm so sorry." 

(Sing me to sleep 
Sing me to sleep 
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep)

Sing me to sleep 
(You've taken so much with you)
I'll see you in my dreams
(But why you left the worst with me?)
Waiting to say "I miss you I'm so sorry," 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.---Lyrics submitted by angelina.
