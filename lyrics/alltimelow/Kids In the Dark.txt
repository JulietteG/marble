(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

Here we are at the end of the road
A road thats quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we dont
We dont miss where we started

Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far
How we got this far

They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
Well never surrender the kids in the dark
So let the world sing

What a shame, what a shame
Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
Well never surrender the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

Here we are at the top of a hill
A hill thats quietly crumbling
Its been awhile since youve dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling

Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard
Why we fall so hard

Well never surrender the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark ---
