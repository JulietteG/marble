When I was younger I was certain,
that I'd be line without a queen,
just a king inside his castle,
with an ocean in between,
Now all I do is sit,
and count the miles from you to me,
Oh, Calamity...

We get older by the hour,
watch the changes from afar,
keep forgetting to remember,
where we've been is who we are,
Now all I do is wonder,
why we ever set the scene,
Oh, Calamity....

It's such a shame that we play strangers,
no act to change what we've become,
Damn, it's such a shame that we built a wreck out of me,
Oh, Calamity...Oh, Calamity...

If I catch you on the corner,
will you even know it's me?
Will I look familiar to you?
Do you offer me a seat?
Can we find a new beginning?
Do you turn the other cheek?
Oh, Calamity...

It's such a shame that we play strangers,
no act to change what we've become...

Damn, It's such a shame that we play strangers,
no act to change what we've become,
Damn, it's such a shame that we built a wreck out of me,
Oh, Calamity, come back to me... ---
