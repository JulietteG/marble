You told me I was lucky
To have my chance with you
Now last year's summer romance
Is this year's winter blues
I treated you so nicely
To jewellery and champagne
But you left me empty handed
Yeah you left me feeling
Play-ay-ayed

Now I hope you're happy with yourself
cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday
When I gave you my heart
You ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along
And it goes
merry Christmas kiss my ass

They say I'm losing my mind
I thought that for a while
I tear down decorations
They remind me of your smile
I hate that mistletoe
It makes me think of our first kiss
You bit my lip, you pulled me close
And then you taught me how to quit

Now I hope you're happy with yourself
cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday
When I gave you my heart
You ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along
And it goes
merry Christmas kiss my (ass)

So sick of calling
You wont telephone me
No fuck you girl I'm going out
I gave you my all
But our love hit a wall now
I'm jingle belling
And everyone's yelling
We'll drink till the bars shut us down

Ain't that just what Christmas is all about

And I hope you're happy with yourself
cause I'm not laughing (not laughing)
Don't you think it's so damn trashy
What you did this holiday
(so trashy)
I gave you my heart (heart)
You ripped it apart
Like the wrapping paper trash (wrapping paper trash)
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along
Here it goes
merry Christmas (bitch) kiss my ass---Lyrics submitted by Heather Cook.
