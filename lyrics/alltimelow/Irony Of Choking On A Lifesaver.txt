Stop fucking around with my emotions
I like you better when you're numb
I'm sick and tired of false devotion
Devote yourself to moving on
Or suck it up and let it go

But you're always out to get me

You're the snake hidden in my daffodils
When I'm picking flowers
That's just my luck these days
Why can't you just be happy for me?

You're the break lines failing as my car
Swerves off the freeway
It kinda feels like sabotage
Why can't you just be happy for
Why can't you just be happy for me?

You think your opinions make you savvy
Your running mouth falls on deaf ears
You say you're winning cause you're laughing
Well I'm crying crocodile tears
Just suck it up and let it go

But you're always out to get me

You're the snake hidden in my daffodils
When I'm picking flowers
That's just my luck these days
Why can't you just be happy for me?

You're the break lines failing as my car
Swerves off the freeway
It kinda feels like sabotage
Why can't you just be happy for
Why can't you just be happy for me?

Why can't you just be happy for me?
(I'll never be good enough, no)
(I'll never be good enough)
Why can't you just be happy for me?
(I'll never be good enough, no)
(I'll never be good enough)

But you're always out to get me

You're the snake hidden in my daffodils
When I'm picking flowers
That's just my luck these days
Why can't you just be happy for me?

You're the break lines failing as my car
Swerves off the freeway
It kinda feels like sabotage
Why can't you just be happy for...
Why can't you just be happy for me?

(Stop fucking around with my emotions)

Why can't you just be happy for me? ---
