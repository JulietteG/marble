Debra was a catholic girl
she held out 'till the bitter end
Carla was a different type
she's the one who put it in
Mary was a black girl 
and I was afraid of a girl like that
Susan painted pictures
sitting down like the buddha sat

Reno was a nameless girl
a geographic memory
Cathy was a jesus freak
she liked that kind of misery
Vicky had this special way
of turning sex into a song
Camela who couldn't sing 
kept the beat, kept it strong

Zilla was an archetype 
the voodoo queen, the queen of wrath
Joan thought men were second best
to masturbating in the bath
Sherry was a feminist
she really had that gift of gab
Kathleen's point of view was this:
take whatever you can grab

Seattle was another girl 
who left her mark upon the map
Karen liked to tie me up
and left me hanging by a strap
Jeanie had this nightclub walk
that made grown men feel underaged
Maryella, who had a son
said "I must go" but finally stayed

Gloria the last taboo
was shattered by her tongue one night
Mimi brought the taboo back
and held it up for the light
Marilyn who knew no shame
was never ever satisfied 
Julie came and went so fast
she didn't even say "goodbye"

Well, Rhonda had a house in venice
lived on brown rice and cocaine
Patty had a house in houston
shot cough syrup in her veins 
Linda thought her life was empty
filled it up with alcohol 
Kathryn was much too pretty
she didn't do that s**t at all

Pauline thought that love was simple 
turn it on and turn it off
Jean-Marie was complicated 
like some french filmmakers plot
Gina was the perfect lady
always kept her stockings straight 
Jackie was a rich punk rocker
sliver spoon and a paper plate

Sarah was a modern dancer
lean, pristine transparency 
Janet wrote bad poetry
in a crazy kind of urgency
Tanya, Turkish liked to f**k
while wearing leather biker boots
Brenda's strange obsession 
was for certain vegetables and fruit

Rowena was an artists daughter
the deeper image shook her up
Deedee's mother left her father
took his money and his truck
Debi Rae had no such problems
perfect Norman Rockwell home
Nina,16, had a baby
left her parents lived alone
Bobbie joined a new wave band 
and changed her name to bobbie socks
Elouise who played guitar
sangs songs about wells and cops
Terry didn't give a s**t
was just a realist
Well, Ronnie was much more my style
because she wrote songs just like this
Jizzabelle went forty days
drinking nothing but perrier
Dinah drover her chevrolet
into the San Francisco bay
Judy came from Ohio 
she's a scientologist
Amaranta here's a kiss
I chose you to end this list---Lyrics submitted by billy.
