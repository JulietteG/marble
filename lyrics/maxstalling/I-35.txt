It was freezing cold in Dallas when I made my get away
I out ran a cold front when I gave my truck the reins
Barreling down I-35 with one thought on my mind
Forget the race find an open space, leave that city far behind

Well hello there Austin, you look to be just fine
Well pardon me San Marcos, but Im trying to make some time
Theres a storm in my rear-view and a city on my nerves
But theres a piece of mind in the straight-away and comfort in the curves

I didnt pull off in Von Ormy, like I normally do
I went on down to Devine town, I bought a six-pack or two
I glanced back across my shoulder, like a seventh season buck
All I saw was a wall of clouds, I hopped back in my truck

Guten-tag New Braunfels, how are you today
Hola Ol San Antonio, please stand out of my way
Theres a storm in my rear-view and a city on my nerves
But theres a piece of mind in the straight-away and comfort in the curves

Well I know that Mother-Nature will catch me in the end
But Ill put some miles behind me before I turn to face the wind
Well dont ya leave that barn door open, not even just a crack
If I see a hint of daylight, youll never get me back

Well hello old Batesville, do you remember me
And look out there La Pryor, but Im coming through cant you see
Theres a storm in my rear-view and a city on my nerves
But theres a piece of mind in the straight-away and comfort in the curves

I say Im barreling down I-35 with one thought on my mind
Forget the race find an open space, leave that city, that damned old city far behind
Leave that city way far behind---Lyrics submitted by Betty Smith.
