Another morning, another motel bed, 
another city waitin up ahead 
Light another menthol, to clear my mind

Of those memories I pretend to forget, 
cause I always want to live with out regrets 
but yeah
I still think of her from time to time 
Only shes still livin across the Harlan County Line

Now when we met we were both livin far from home
tryin to get by and tired of being alone,
for a moment I thought she was mine
Cause she had a voice I just wanted to believe
She said her mother was full blood Cherokee and her
Daddy was a union man down in the mines
Fighting the good fight across the Harlan County Line

People can be Noble, and People can be Cruel 
theyll make you President or theyll make you a Fool but, 
she always treated me nice and kind
Until that day she left me on my own said there 
was trouble she had to handle back home
Then she gave me a number and said call any time
if I ever made it across the Harlan County Line

Now the years disappear out on the highway 
And I lost her number somewhere along the way
So Ill say a little prayer that shes doing fine

Another morning, another motel bed, 
another city waitin up ahead 
And another small memory to leave behind 
somewhere across the Harlan County Line

across the Harlan County Line.---Lyrics submitted by Gksel Snbl.
