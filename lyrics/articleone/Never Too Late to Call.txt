On days like to today grace has a way of sounding to good to be true. 
Would it be easy to forgive and undue?
You chose your direction, lost all connections, slowly your falling apart. 
You call it searching to find out who you are.

And I still remember the hope in your eyes, time is waiting. 
We were the best when we stood side by side.

Chorus:
 The bridges have not burned down. 
I hope you come around.
And how far you fall doesn't matter at all,
its never to late to call.

Can't stop the world from spinning in circles.
Now its caught up with the life 
I pray from a distance for the tears that you cried.

We've all cut corners and fallen short
There's lessons to learn from mistakes in need of forgiveness.
We all stand and see.

And I still remember when you lost your way,
Time stood standing.
The darker your night, the brighter your day.

(Chorus)

Love will light your way. Heaven waits the same.

We were the best when we stood side by side. 

(Chorus 2x)---Lyrics submitted by Kaylamarie.
