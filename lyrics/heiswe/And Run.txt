Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh,
Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.
Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh,
Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.



Kinda wish I had the courage,
A bit of bravery.
So tired of waiting on a man to come and save me.
Wishing I had everything,
Or something really.
Hard to admit it,
But now Im thinking freely.

Im going to open my mind to all these,
New found exciting possibilities.

Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.
Im making all my own plans,
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Throwing all my old ones away.
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Gonna grow up, Be someone.
Draw a map, find a path.
Take a breath and run.
And run.

Filling my head with words to encourage me,
Gotta get my act so straight so I can truly believe.
That what Im waiting for, is really worth the wait.
Stop bringing myself down,
I gotta know what makes me great.

Im going to open my mind to all these,
New found exciting possibilities.

Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.
Im making all my own plans,
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Throwing all my old ones away.
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Gonna grow up, Be someone.
Draw a map, find a path.
Take a breath and run.

I am trying to get past this,
Be better than I once was.
Tired of waiting, on someone else.
I am trying to get past this,
Be better than I once was.
Tired of waiting on someone else,
I can fix it by myself.
Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.
Im finally taking a stand,
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Ive learned from all my mistakes.
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Im making all my own plans,
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Throwing all my old ones away.
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Gotta grow up, be someone.
Draw a map, find a path.
Take a breath and run.

Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh
Run, run, run, run.
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Run, run, run, run.
(Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.)
Oh ah oh ah oh ah oh oh.---Lyrics submitted by colleen.
