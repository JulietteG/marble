Merrily we fall out of line
Out of line
I'd fall anywhere with you
I'm by your side
Swinging in the rain
Humming melodies
We're not going anywhere until we freeze.
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid.
Forever is a long time.
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.
Carefully we'll place for our destiny
You came and you took this heart
And set it free.
Every word you write and sing is so warm to me.
So warm to me.
I'm torn, I'm torn
To be right where you are.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid.
Forever is a long time.
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.
Tell me everyday
I get to wake up to that smile.
I wouldn't mind it at all.
I wouldn't mind it at all.
You so know me.
Pinch me gently.
I can hardly breath.
Forever is a long, long time.
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side.
Tell me
Everyday I get to wake up to that smile.
I wouldn't mind it at all.
I wouldn't mind it at all.---Lyrics submitted by Cailey.
