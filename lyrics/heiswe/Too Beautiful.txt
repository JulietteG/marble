What kind of man lays his hands on the woman?
He loves,calls her "Angel" shows no remorse,
And the blood,
He covers her body with bruises and scars,
You don't understand just how beautiful you are.


You are too beautiful,
Your heart,
wants something more.
Those shades of blue.
 on that face of yours,
Hide that smile
 that beats in your chest!


When he's done with her beating he just stands aside,
wipes the sweat from his brow,
and yells over her cries,
"You don't know what I've been through!'
He yells and he says,
"You don't know what I've done for you!"
and hits her again.

You are too beautiful,
Your heart,
wants something more.
Those shades of Blue.
 on that face of yours.
Hide that smile
 that beats in your chest!


She stands in the mirror,
She looks less alive,
She lifts up her shirt,
to see has five,
branded fingers on her side.
She's feeling it all!
But she doesn't cry!
She doesn't cry!


You are too beautiful,
Your heart,
wants something more.
Those shades of Blue.
on that face of yours.
Hides that smile
that beats in your chest!---Lyrics submitted by Emily Mecham.
