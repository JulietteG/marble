La da da dum dum dum
La da da dum

What do you know? I went and got myself all in a mess, 
Get a little invest, youre not gonna mess it up this time.
Here we go, yes is now, Im melting us together,
Im feeling a little bit crazy, Im thinking that maybe 
I could blow your mind,
If thats all right.

Id love to take you away from here,
Hold on and magically disappear.
Its all the rush from the inside out,
A feeling I couldnt breathe without.

Who wouldve known that I could ever feel this way?
Youre miles away, unless you say Im with you today, where you are!
Ill meet you oh so very far, so grab your guitar and jump in my car,
Alone and away, yeah.
Thats okay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Id love to take you away from here,
Hold on and magically disappear.
Its all the rush from the inside out,
A feeling I couldnt breathe without.
Take all of me, hold on tight.
This time, I swear that well do it right.
Its all the rush from the inside out,
A feeling I couldnt breathe without.

Id love to take you away from here,
Hold on and magically disappear.
Its all the rush from the inside out,
A feeling I couldnt breathe without.

Id love to take you away from here,
Hold on and magically disappear.
Its all the rush from the inside out,
A feeling I couldnt breathe without.
Take all of me, hold on tight.
This time, I swear that well do it right. 
Its all the rush from the inside out,
A feeling I couldnt breathe without.

Ohhh, I couldnt breathe without.
Ohhh, woah, I couldnt breathe without.
