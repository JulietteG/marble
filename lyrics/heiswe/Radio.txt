He grew up just a little too fast,
A loss and need, thats on his past.
I can hear him humming from the other side of the room,
Guess hes got rhythm, cause he hums every time hes blue, oh

Radio, bleed me a melody,
Thatll make this boy cry.
Radio, bleed me a melody,
Thatll make him wonder why he was so cold.

Broken glass and a pretty face,
Silent mourn, full of hate.
Quiet face, silent mourn.
Screaming for consequence, 
Pleading for more.

Radio, bleed me a melody
That will make this boy cry.
Radio, bleed me a melody
That will make him wonder why he was so cold.

Write him a song that reminds him of a time
When he wasn't tumbling down, down, tumbling down.

Radio, bleed me a melody
That will make this boy cry.
Radio, bleed me a melody
That will make him wonder why he was so cold.

Radio, radio, radio, lead me a melody.
Radio, radio, radio, lead me a melody.
Radio, radio, radio, that boy's got rhythm cause he hums every time.
Radio, radio, radio.---Lyrics submitted by Stella Lu.
