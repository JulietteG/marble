I said goodbye and I know all along
You broke my heart although it may not show
Someday youll see how I feel and then youll want me
But Ill be gone for awhile

After Ive gone then perhaps you may find
That Im the one who will be on your mind
Someday youll see how I feel and then youll want me
But Ill be gone for awhile

I find it hard not having you
But its the only thing to do
(Repeat)

After Ive gone then perhaps you may find
That Im the one who will be on your mind
Someday youll see how I feel and then youll want me
But Ill be gone for awhile
Gone for awhile 
Gone for awhile---Lyrics submitted by Steven Salch.
