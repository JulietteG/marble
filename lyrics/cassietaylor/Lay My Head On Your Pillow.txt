it's been a long day 
so much to do 
got to cook and clean 
but i love looking after you 

and i'm going to lay my head on your pillow 
fall asleep 

it's been a long week 
got our bills to pay 
no matter how hard we work 
can't seem to get away 

and i'm going to lay my head on your pillow 
fall asleep 

it's been a long month 
it seems we've come so far 
taking on responsibilities 
spending too much time in the car 

and i'm going to lay my head on your pillow 
fall asleep 

it's been a long year 
change has come and gone 
brought us new excitement 
and purchased us a home 

and i'm going to lay my head on your pillow 
fall asleep 

it's been a long life 
the children are all grown 
the days are getting cooler 
nights are getting long 

and i'm going to lay my head on your pillow 
drift asleep---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
