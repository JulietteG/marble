i cook your meals 
i wash your clothes 
i kiss your neck 
i rub your toes 
i clean your house 
i scrub your floor 
give you want you want baby 
but you still want more 
and i do everything 
to keep you satisfied 
so put a ring on my finger baby 
make me your bride 

well i don't need diamonds 
just a band will do 
but you're still standing there 
nothing i can do 
so tell me please 
just tell me what i can say 
are you gonna make this forever 
or is this just another day 
and i do everything 
to keep you satisfied 
so put a ring on my finger baby 
make me your bride 

well i never should have 
shacked up with you 
cause now you got the cow 
gonna drink the milk too 
so tell me please 
just tell me what i can do 
cause you're the one i love 
and baby i chose you 
and i did everything 
to keep my baby satisfied 
he put a ring on my finger baby 
made me his bride---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
