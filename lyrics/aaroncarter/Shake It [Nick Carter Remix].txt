yo, this is aaron carter
i wanna introduce you to my boys, 95 cent
and its all about this new dance
called shake it

all around the world
everywhere i go
ive learned a new dance
that i want to know

youve got to shake it to the left
shake it to the right
shat it everybody
cause it feels so right

just shake it, just shake it
everybody just shake it
everybody just shake it

now what you wanna do is
shake it, bake it, twist it all around
let aaron take you through it if you wanna get down


just shake it to the left
shake it to the right
shake it everybody
cuz it feels so right

just shake it, just shake it
everybody just shake it
everybody just shake it

all you gotta do is shake it all around
come on everybody its time to get down

and shake it to the left
shake it to the right
shake it everybody
cuz it feels so right

just shake it, just shake it
everybody just shake it
everybody just shake it

95 south on the house, come on
95 south on the house, come on

just shake it, just shake it
everybody just shake it
everybody just shake it

from london to l.a.
sown to tampa bay
just shake it, just shake it

frankfort likes to shake it
new york likes to shake it
japan likes to shake it
come on everybody just shake it

that feels so right just shake it
everybody just shake it
everybody just shake it

just shat it, shake it
just shake it, shake it
just shake it, shake it
just shake it

now what you want to do is
shake it, just shake it
everybody just shake it
everybody just shake it---Lyrics submitted by Janessa.
