I dont have a God I can put on a stand
Or a God I hold in the palm of my hand
I have a God thats holding me

And I dont have a god that I can create
In the place I live with the money I make
I have a God He made everything

CHORUS
So I dont need a temporary man made deity
When I got the real thing
I got the real thing
Hes the Lord of all the earth
Maker of all things
He alone is the one true God
Kingdoms rise and fall
But even through it all 
He remains
The one true God
Music interlude

I dont have a thing that I got on my own
I dont have a care that I carry alone
But I have a God whos carrying me

And I dont have a sin that He doesnt forgive
And I dont have a heart that is worthy of His
But I have a God who still loves me

CHORUS

Who is this King of Glory
The Lord strong and mighty
Who is this King of Glory 
The Lord strong and mighty
Who is this King of Glory
Who is this King of Glory

Repeat chorus 2x

I dont have a God I can put on a stand
Or a God I can hold in my hand
But I have a God holding me---Lyrics submitted by jamie.
