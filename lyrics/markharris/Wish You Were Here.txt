Verse 1
I wanted to tell you how closely I've kept
The memories of you in my heart
And all of the lifetimes that we've had to share
Live even though we're apart

But don't cry for me
'Cause I'm finally free

Chorus:
To run with the angels
On streets made of gold
To listen to stories of saints new and old
To worship our Maker
That's where I'll be
When you finally find me

Verse 2
Now don't you be weary cause waiting for you
Are wonders that you've never known
Just hold on to Jesus, reach out for His hands

And that's when you'll be
Finally Free
Finally Free

Chorus

I wish you were here 2x

Bridge
And all of the dreams that you treasure
Will soon come together
And that's when your sorrow will find tomorrow
And you will rise again

Chorus 2x

I wish you were here 3x---Lyrics submitted by Gisela.
