[Chorus 1: X2]
Fear nobody but his Majesty
My spirit, youll be deep
For you I wait, silently
It seems that you believe in me

Indestructible, digging through the rubble
Bubblin, we dont need no more trouble
Never had this cold vision, hot hot friction
Like Im running a muck upon a rhythm
Stay on a plan so you dont lose the vision
Stay sizzlin, (Peter paddled from a plane
Like this is from the city fillin in)?
Your breathin in
You put on your glasses and you see through it

[Chorus 2: X2]
(Fear no one) Fear nobody but his Majesty
My spirit, youll be deep
(His Majesty) For you I wait, silently
It seems that you believe in me

Some of them run, run, runnin like a rat on a wheel
Try feel fine, a new deal
Who is there? Ticket for a meal
The world is real, on the heels of the final generation
I remember that day in November
Standing on a roof and Im feeling so tender
All shook up, like Ive been in the blender
Fend off the demons in the park after dark
Lend me your hand, I want to be a member
Spent too much and now Im rendereddead
Mend these wounds, we got to find a common thread
Want to fly in the sky ya heavy like lead

[Chorus 2: X2]

Just a tool in the hands of the builder
Fill them with the strength to go further
Digging deep for eternal treasure
Stay away from quick sand and false pleasure
Them mouths speak with arrogance
Appearance like a lion lurking in the mist
They surround and they gaze their fix
Grab the rope of Gods heritage

[Chorus 2: X2]

Release me from their schemes
My distress you will relea-
-shield me on the path thats dark and slippery
Their sick deception and futility
I stand with integrity
Sneak to the roof of that building
Dont want nobody here to see me
Theyre saying that Im living in a fantasy
But I believe if I did keep
And I bleed in sincerity
Wont you utterly remove the cloud hanging over me
Wont you wave that decree in the shade of your wings
Shelter me from the wicked who have plundered me
From my mortal enemies, wont you shield me
