Just livin the miracle, candles are my vehicle
Eight nights, gonna shine invincible
No longer be divisible, born to the struggle
Keep on moving through all this hustle
Head up, head down through all the bustle
New York City wanna flex your muscle
You look so down, look so puzzled
Huddle round your fire through all the rubble

Bound to stumble and fall but my strength comes not from man at all
Bound to stumble and fall but my strength comes not from man at all

[Chorus]
Do you believe in miracles
And Am I hearin you 
Said am I seein you
Said eight nights and eight lights
End these fights, keep me right
And bless me to the highest heights in your miracles

Against all odds, trod on till tommorrow
Wipe away your tears and sorrow
Sunrise in the sky like an arrow
No need to worry. No need to cry. 
Light up your mind no longer be blind
Him who searches he will find
Leave your problems behind
We will shine like a fire in the sky
What's the reason we're alive. 
Bound to stumble and fall but my strength comes not from man at all
Bound to stumble and fall but my strength comes not from man at all

[Chorus]
Do you believe in miracles
And Am I hearin you 
Said am I seein you
Said eight nights and eight lights
End these fights, keep me right
And bless me to the highest heights in your miracles

Eight is the number of infinity one more than what you know how to be
And this is the light of festivity when your broken heart yearns to be free

[Chorus]
Do you believe in miracles
And Am I hearin you 
Said am I seein you
Said eight nights and eight lights
End these fights, keep me right
And bless me to the highest heights in your miracles---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
