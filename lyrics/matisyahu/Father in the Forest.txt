A scream and a cry and a yell.
A father in the forest searching for his children.
Children, children where have you gone to.
Because of me you have forgotten.

Children, children come home to me.
Because I am lonely to be sitting all alone.

Father, Father we cannot come home.
Because there is a guard standing by the door.---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
