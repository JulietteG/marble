Welcome to my broken car
It don't move fast
But it goes so far
Though you might
Bang your head or scrape your toes
Fred Flinstone
With my feet on
Through the holes

But don't you worry now
Don't you worry
CAuse it will get you there
Where you need to go
Where you need to go
Where you need to go

Over the hillsides and the valleys
Far and wide
Where the sun goes
And the sky it shines
Fire gonna rage tonight

Welcome to my broken home
It's not so fancy
Made from sticks and stones
It's often empty
I hope you like to be alone
You can stare out the window
Until you find your zone

Take cover fromt the bombs and the bullets
Take time to heal your wounds
Forget what they told you now
Just listen on to the tunes
Listenin' to the tune

Welcome to my broken house
You don't have to tip toe here
You can put ya feet down
Feel the floor beneath you
Feel the ground
Don't worry bout the future
You're here right now
Unpack your bags and relax for a while
rest your weary eyes
I know you've been tired

Where do you need to go
Where you got to be
Where do yu need to go
I'm your taxi
Don't you worry
Don't you worry now
Don't you worry now
Fire gonna rage tonight

Welcome to my broken heart
I know it's hard
Sometimes you fall apart

Welcome to my broken song
Don't worry now baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Welcome to my broken heart
I know it's hard
Sometimes you fall apart

Welcome to my broken song
Don't worry now baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Where you need to go
Where you need to go
Where you need to go---
