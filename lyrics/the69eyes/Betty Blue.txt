We're like two fingers of the same hand
The hand of fate writing on the sand
What does it matter
What does it mean
Can you see the difference
In the lines between

[chorus]
I'm gonna run away with you
Gonna run away into your eyes blue
I'm gonna run away with you
I'm gonna run away
into your eyes blue

We're like two fingers of the same hand
Beautiful strangers of the strange land
Qhat does it matter
What does it mean
Can you tell the difference
And the passion between

[chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
