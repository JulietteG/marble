we live where they is no tommarrow 
no past no rules to follow consumed by 
the innononce we take we live in our
days in the absents of light just one kiss and
the lover unite and 

i feel my temperate rising you gotta 
get up get up get out

we own the night just you and i and 
were gunna live for ever into the stars we will never die if we stay together
(we own the night) i feel the blood and the heart start pumping and flows of nothing
we own the night if stay to gether

Give in to a heart desire new drug couldnt get much higher
no shame for  the animals we are 
feel alive kill case hunger
twilight is the spell were under tonite we never felt so alive

i feel my temperate rising you gotta
get up get up get out

we own the night just you and i and 
were gunna live for ever into the stars we will never die if we stay together
(we own the night) i feel the blood and the heart start pumping and flows of nothing
we own the night if stay to gether

come we gotta get up get up get out

we own the night just you and i and 
were gunna live for ever into the stars we will never die if we stay together
(we own the night) i feel the blood and the heart start pumping and flows of nothing
we own the night if stay to gether---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
