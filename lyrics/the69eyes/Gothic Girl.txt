You can see her
Whenever it rains
From Rome to New Orleans
Dancing on the graves

Burden by the heart
She loves her sunglasses after dark
And every single day her little life falls apart

She's out to look so macabre and alone
She's close to hook on her dying

Just like a gothic girl
Lost in the darken world
My lil' gothic girl
Darkerside jewel are your razorcuts for real, baby

You can see
She's on her road to ruin
Stigmata from crucifixion
On her pale white skin

Tribal pagan art
She loves her tattooed Egyptian mark
And every single day her love will tear us apart

She's out to look so macabre and alone
She's close to hook on her dying

Just like a gothic girl
Lost in the darken world
My lil' gothic girl
Darkerside jewel are your razorcuts for real, baby---Lyrics submitted by chase matthews.
