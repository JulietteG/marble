Me and my homies we tighter than a glove 
Chop a lot of game as how we do it at the Playaz Club 
Check the fool or kick it in the tub 
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club 

I got a hoe named Real de Real 
She got a buddy named SP-12 now you know the deal 
We getz freaky in the studio late night 
That's why the beats that you hear are comin real tight 
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to 
use a playa in the game this will hold you 
Mo money mo money for the bank roll 
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo 
A lot of fools put salt in the game 
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh 
I run my own and I'm my own self person 
No respect make the situation worse then 
Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale 
There's a playaz club every one you dwell 
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street 
A different part of town a different kind of freak 
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug 
press play on the remote at the playaz club 

(chorus) 

(more champagne, Mr. Forte?) 

From day one I had to get my money right 
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh 
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet 
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check 
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation 
Took a flight back to the Golden State and 
Shops made orders from a whole new capital 
Words get now 4-Tay's out rappable 
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case 
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase 
Cuz the chase is on because it don't stop 
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop 
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day 
By the way just in case you never heard 
Rappin 4-Tay I'm on the smooth tip 
Never trippin off them suckas poppin off the lip 
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro 
Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes 
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub 
And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club 

(chorus) 

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted 
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed 
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself 
Now homie what you all about? 
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's 
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys 
You can learn a whole lot from a playa 
Lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer 
A lot of people get a misconception 
And start driftin in the wrong direction 
Miss goody two sure see you later 
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin but a playa hater 
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona 
They chop game like we do in California 
Another show another flow a new bank account 
But cash money comes in large amounts 
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast 
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass 
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub 
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club 

(chorus) 
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove 
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club 
Check the fool or kick it in the tub 
Cuz we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club
