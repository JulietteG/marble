Verse 1

I stand accused 
Theres a list a mile long 
Of all my sins
Of everything that Ive done wrong
Im so ashamed..
Theres no where left to hide
This is the day 
I must answer for my life
My fate is in the judges hands
But then he turns to me and say..

Chorus 

I know you 
I love you
I gave my life to save you
Love paid the price
For mercy
My verdict 
NOT GUILTY

Verse 2

How can it be?
I cant begin to comprehend
What kind of grace 
Would take the place for all my sins
I stand in awe..
Now that I have been set free
And the tears well up
As I look at that cross
Cause it should have been me
My fate was in the nail-scarred hands
He stretched them out for me 
And said..

Chorus

I know you 
I love you
I gave my life to save you
Love paid the price
For mercy
My verdict 
NOT GUILTY

Vamp

Im falling on my knees to thank you
With everything I am I praise you
So grateful for the words 
I heard you say
I know you 
I love you
I gave my life .

Chorus

I know you 
I love you
I gave my life just to save you
Love paid the price
For mercy
My verdict is
NOT GUILTY
Love paid the price 
for mercy 
My verdict
NOT GUILTY
NOT GUILTY---Lyrics submitted by Kelisha.
