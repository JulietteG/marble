I got your message on the phone
So tell me whats goin on
You say your day started so great
And then it went so wrong yeah
Well no one ever plans for the bad days
Do they no
But im here 
If your needin a friend

chorus

hey dont give up tonight
I know your goin through the valley
but your gonna make it out alright
hey tell your troubles goodbye
go on and leave it in the valley
leave it in the valley tonight

so you think he dont know what hes doin
you think he aint by your side yeah right
god knows when your broken 
and hes lovin you 
hes holdin you so tight
so let the rain fall
hell be standin there
gettin wet with you
you might be cold 
but you wont be there alone

hey dont give up tonight
I know your goin through the valley
but your gonna make it out alright
hey tell your troubles goodbye
go on and leave it in the valley
leave it in the valley tonight

and when your hangin by a thread
hold on
you know the darkest part 
is right before the dawn
so when your fears let you down
feels like the sky is on the ground
he aint gonna let you down
hell never let you down
oh oh oh

hey dont give up tonight
I know your goin through the valley
but your gonna make it out alright
hey tell your troubles byebye
go on and leave it in the valley
leave it in the valley 

hey
leave it in the valley tonight 
hey 
tell your troubles goodbye
go on and leave it in the valley
leave it in the valley tonight---Lyrics submitted by Chantelle.
