I need a minute can we get some time(get some time)
We both know we don't see eye to eye
I know it's hard on us when we disagree
But don't you think that me and you could take a chance and 

     (Chrous)
Love somebody(love somebody)
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Take a chance and pass it on
You can be the one to love
(love love love love love love love love love love)

I had a dream just the other day(other day)
With blinded eyes we let
Real love guide the way
Nobody felt we had to look the same or talk the game
We found true beauty and we weren't afraid to go ahead and

                     (Chrous)
Love somebody(love somebody)
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Take a chance and pass it on
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to love
(love love love love love love love love love love)
Wooooa Toby

             Toby Mac:
If Mandisa ain't changed you mind
It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme
'Cause she gave me eight to flow and translate
Recalibrate end all debates
'Cause this bomb is about to drop y'all
DiVerse City just can't be stopped
So here we go,come check the show
Come one,come all,come overflow with love
(love love love love)

Love somebody
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Take a chance and pass it on
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to love
(you can be the one to love,you can be the one to love)

Go ahead and love somebody
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Take a chance and pass it on
You can be the one to 
Love somebody
Somebody needs you
You can be the one to love
(you gotta,you gotta love somebody)(x2)


There is some extra singing at the end and in some parts of the song but I got the lyrics off of youtube.---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
