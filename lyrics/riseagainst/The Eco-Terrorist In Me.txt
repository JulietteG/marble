Spray paint the cameras, jam the frequency
What you killed just kept alive in me
Under bandannas, but not an enemy
You can define us any way you please

You make the rules, we make the calls
My conscience clean, my sins absolved
'Cause I found god [hey] in the sound of your factories burning down
Now I sleep so sound

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let go?

Instead of doing what's right they build higher walls
Where we can't shed a light on true criminals
When business and suffering is one and the same
When laws fail the people they turn to the flame

I found love [love]
I found life [life]
As a thorn stuck in your side
And you wonder why

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on? [Will you hold on?]
Did you hold on, or just let it fall?
Did you let it fall?

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down
When it all comes down

When the lights all go out, and roadblocks go up
And you sleep to the sound of alarms going off
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?---
