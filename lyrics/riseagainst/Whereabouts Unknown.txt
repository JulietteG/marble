To the ends of this lost world 
You have marched and you have sworn 
To a tainted crown of thorns 
As the hungry sails unfurl 
We are thrusted from the shore 
And it's you that we stood for 

The blackest night 
The midnight sun 
The covered tracks 
The days spent on the run 
The strangers we've become 

These whereabouts unknown 
Please know you can come home 
It's alright 
I long for the moment 
Our silence is broken 
It's alright 

Another place, another time 
We took the same side of the line 
Yeah we saw eye to eye 
Even then the saddest sounds 
Were nothing laughter could not drown 
But we are not laughing now 

I see your face 
In my sights 
I hesitate 
And then look for a sign 
Somewhere in the sky 

These whereabouts unknown 
Please know you can come home 
It's alright 
I long for the moment 
Our silence is broken 
It's alright 

Even together we stand apart 
Swallow the sun, erase the sky 
An invitation that's been denied 
Where did you go? Where did you go? 

Your whereabouts unknown 
Please know you can come home 
It's alright 
I long for the moment 
Our silence is broken 
It's alright 
All is forgiven 
If you could just listen 
It's alright, it's alright---Lyrics submitted by matilda.
