and all these things things that we tie together
keep unraveling apart
and the light that used to burn so bright
now is dark
with anger-laced intent we set fire
to the bridges that remain
and they're wading through the current now

and they drown in the flood of the tears 
that have been wept 
and I scream to the sky
"no, you are not alone"

if you think that your words will make a difference
think again and carry on
because the weight behind the hand that 
holds us is strong
but there is hope in the roar of a
thousand pleading cries
and all these things that we tie together

the sound of their tongues being bitten
is all I hear
as we fire all the whites of theirs eyes
dance on ashes of the world

as they drown in the flood of the tears
that have been wept
and their tongues being bitten
is all that I can hear
as I scream to the sky
"I need you now"

can you feel this truth
now unraveling
or will you chase the burning sun
into the sea---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
