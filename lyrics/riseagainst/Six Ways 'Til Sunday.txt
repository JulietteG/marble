the years unfold in one moment
the voices that we heard so loud
are now suddenly silent
inside this crowd
and if your surrounded by the lives
of those who found something to hold
so bringing everybody down
is all you know

you've been hiding so long you can't find yourself
in this sheltered life you live
when everything you want is at you finger tips
you'll never know what need is

you're claiming to be something different
so wanting to believe
that you're better than the rest
to make up for self-esteem
you talk to hear your own voice
and you've left me know choice but to choose
I miss the person that you were
but I don't miss you

you've been hiding so long you can't find yourself
in this sheltered life you live
when everything you want is at you're finger tips
you'll never know what need is

you're the new revolution
the angst-filled adolescent
you fit the stereotype well

1,2,3,GO!

you're the new revolution
the angst-filled adolescent
you fit the stereotype well---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
