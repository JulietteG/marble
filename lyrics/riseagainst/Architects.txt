Are there no fighters left here anymore?
Are we the generation we've been waiting for?
Or are we patiently burning
Waiting to be saved?

Our heroes our idols have mellowed with age
Following rules that they once disobeyed
They're now being led when they use to lead the way

Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
Are you out there on the front lines
Or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
Or would you rather be the architect of what we might create?

They laid out the blueprints, the poured down a base
Concrete solutions to slow our decay
And when they are gone
Who the fucks going to take their place?

Will it be the cynics, the critics galore?
The cliche apathetic passed out on the floor
The trusting complicit who collectively ignore

Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
Are you out there on the front lines
Or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
Or would you rather be the architect of what we might create?

Don't you remember when you were young
And you wanted to set the world on fire?
Somewhere deep down I know you do
Don't you remember when we were young
And we wanted to set the world on fire?
Because I still am and I still do

Make no mistake
We are not afraid
To bear the burden of repeating
What they're thinking anyway
Let's raise the stakes
On the bet we made
Let's decide to be the architects
The master of our fate

We still believe in all the things that we stood by before
And after everything we've seen here maybe even more
I know we're not the only ones, and we were not the first
And unapologetically we'll stand behind each word---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
