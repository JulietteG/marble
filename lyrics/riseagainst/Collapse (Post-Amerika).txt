When our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow.
When our summers grow longer and Winters won't snow.
From the breaks of the oceans and The ice in the hills.
To the fight in the desert where progress stands still.
When we've lost our will that's when we'll know.

This is not a Test.
We'll Know....This is Cardiac Arrest.
When the world is too proud to admit our mistakes.
We're crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace.

When the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke.
When the marsh fever spreads form the swamps to our homes.
When your home on the range has been torn down and paved.
The buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grace.
What more will it take for us to know.

This is not a Test.
We'll Know.....This is Cardiac Arrest
When the world is too proud to admit our mistakes.
Kissing the ground as we all fall from grace.

This is a chance to set things straight.
To bend or break the rules back into place, 
there is no middle ground,
No Compromise,
We've drawn the line with perfect aim.
We've stood back and thrown.
Glass windows break.
And it's all about to blow.
Lights go out, as we pass the torch again.
And hope that it stays lit.
Neutrality means that you don't really care.
Because the struggle goes on,
Even when you're not there.
Blind and Unaware.
That' how we'll know...

This is not a Test.
We'll know....This is Cardiac Arrest.
When the world it too proud to admit our mistakes.
They're crashing into the ground as we all....
Yeah we all.....
All Fall from Grace---Lyrics submitted by matt.
