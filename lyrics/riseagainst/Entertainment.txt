all we are is entertainment
caught up in our own derangement
tell us what to say and what to do
all we are are pretty faces
picture perfect bottled rage
packaged synthesized versions of you

we've all made petty fortunes but we can't afford a life
confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms
they all scream california and it's toppling empire
but can't you see the end is coming soon?

come one come all the new sensation
guarantees then obligations
spotlights follow every single move
basking here on ten foot stages
pouty lips and oh so jaded
all as if we have something to prove

despite these petty fortunes we still can't afford a life
confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms
they all scream california and its toppling empire
but can't you see the end is here?

and if we cared at all
about this unknown plight
then we'd do something more
to finally make this right

is this only entertainment?
pull the curtains, places please
we've learned to sing and dance and cry on cue
but this is more than entertainment
in a world so sick with pain
this is the only thing that's real or true

we've all made petty fortunes but we can't afford a life
confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms
they all scream bloody murder over graves already dug
but you can't see the end---Lyrics submitted by lauren.
