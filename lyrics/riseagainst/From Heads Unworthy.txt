We are the children you reject and disregard 
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts 
You can't disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood 
And we don't disappear just because your eyes are shut, now tell me 

Love, loss 
Like a bullet's path 
Tear through 
The cavity of my chest 
Lights out 
Because the fuse has blown 

As their castles crumble slowly 
We watch them fall 
Their crown slips from heads unworthy 
As we gain control 

This is the family that we crossed or never had 
This is a war that was lost the day it began 
'Cause it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start 
And it's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart, that's how we 

Read you 
Like a polygraph 
Not one 
Single bone in your back 
Own up 
To how you let us down 

As their castles crumble slowly 
We watch them fall 
Their crown slips from heads unworthy 
As we gain control 

Except for you and me, love 
Everyone's the same, we know 
But if to live, we have to be numb 
I'd rather know the pain, I'd rather know 
This happens almost never 
But it happened once to me 
And this will never be the same 
The ends we seam together 

I'm not after fame and fortune 
I'm after you 
When I've served my time I swear I 
Will come back for you 

As their castles crumble slowly 
We watch them fall 
Their crown slips from heads unworthy 
And right on to ours 

I'm after you...---Lyrics submitted by ren.
