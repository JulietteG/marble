Bad idea (x4) 
Ninety-nine per cent is great,
The other one percent I hate,
Little things keep bugging in my head 

Wake up calls, smack and that, fashion cafe, friendly fire
GMTV, darker mornings and pay per view, litter dropping 

I made a list, I got the lot and all
That stuff is all on top It's not fair but I don't care not me 

Rocky Five, Indie shite, KKK, number crunching
bungee jumping, paying taxes, pavement cracks
car alarms, dinosaurs and protest songs are- 

Bad idea (x4) 

Give me a B-A-D-I
Give me a D-E-A...
BAD IDEA!---Lyrics submitted by Jacki.
