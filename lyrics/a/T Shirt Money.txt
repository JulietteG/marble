Who is the man, who is the man, who is the man?
Why does it take control of you? Because it can

Who cleans the floors, who mends the doors ?
Who wanted more, who wanted more? You wanted more

Stuck half up a mountain
With no rope, use shouting
Got no hope, it's not funny
They're making T-shirt money

Who is that girl, who is that girl? Beautiful girl
She doesn't need no makeover, natural curls
She looks so rich, with perfect legs, but she's a bitch
Dad's got the cash, her looks won't last, thick as a brick

Stuck half up a mountain
With no rope, use shouting
Got no hope, it's not funny
I want the same things

But I don't know what to say
I can't change it anyway
And I wish I had your face
And I wish I had your brains
But I don't

Stuck half up a mountain
With no rope, use shouting
Got no hope, no money
I want the same things

But I don't know what to say
I can't change it anyway
And I wish I had your face
And I wish I had your brains

Stuck half up a mountain
With no rope, use shouting
Got no hope, no money
I want the same things

But I don't know what to say
I can't change it anyway
And I wish I had your face
And I wish I had your brains
But I don't---Lyrics submitted by Ausan.
