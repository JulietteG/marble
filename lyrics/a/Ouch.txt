Dappy: What we shared was no ordinary.
Tulsia: I feel the same until you had to go and tear my heart like. [x2]

Tulsia:
Six Thirty in the morning I've arrived early from tour, Dappy: 
Step into the house I'm walking up the stairs,
1 step, 2 step, 3 step 4,
I'm on the second floor I'm opening the door,
I could not brace my self for what I saw,
Who's this woman in my bed?
"Names Shaniqua and what? "
Nah, get the hell off of my ba baby. 

Chorus:
Dappy: 
Now she the type of lady,
That every man needs she's straight up feisty,
She keeps me on my feet but I don't wanna fuck things up by 6,
Tulsia:
Some other hoe in our bed,
What do you take me for?
To hell with you.
Dappy: To hell with me.
Tulsia: Yeah, I never wanna see your face again.
Dappy: Where the f**k do you think you is going (going).
Tulsia: I love you so much but you cheated on me.
Dappy: What we shared was no ordinary.
Tulsia: I feel the same until you had to go and tear my heart like.

Tulsia: Ha Ha Ha Ha
Fazer: 
It use to be the other way around but,
Ha Ha Ha Ha
Tulsia:
The story changed my heart is breaking,
Ha Ha Ha Ha
Dappy: 
You need to recognize she was just a,
Ha Ha Ha Ha
Tulsia: I think it's time for me to go.

Dappy: 
Semi brown skin beauty had to get it back,
I understand she upset,
She wants to kick and slap,
But true say I'm from the slum,
I would never stand for that,
Fake underneath the bridge with that fake looking t**t,
Now remember when we were financially unstable,
Channel 1 to 5 no sky or cable,
Had to do some dirty work in order to be able
To take care of you and put food on the table.

Fazer: 
Actions speak louder then words,
I can't blame her for wanting the worse,
She might be wishing that I'm dead, But I no she don't mean it,
Think when I found those nike's I couldn't believe it,
Remember when we had the feds knocking at our door,
You took care of the stash and hid the money from the draw
You done the right thing, they had me up on the floor
So you saved me from getting 5 years or more,
That's why,

Chorus:

Dappy: She the type of lady,
That every man needs she's straight up feisty,
She keeps me on my feet but I don't wanna f**k things up by 6,
Tulsia:
Some other hoe in our bed,
What do you take me for?
To hell with you.
Dappy: To hell with me.
Tulsia: Yeah, I never wanna see your face again.
Dappy: Where the f**k do you think you is going (going).

Dappy: 
See how's this suppose to solve the situation,
When were both as stubborn as each other,
Fazer: We would argue for hours over something dumb,
Tulsia: "What the f**k! "
Fazer: Ssh. Conversation done,

Dappy: 
How our ego trips never help us get nowhere,
You should know this by now
When you shout I smile,
When you hit me I laugh,
I get all C**y like b**h go run me a bath.

Tulsia: 
So you wanna play it like that,
But baby I can get back,
You don't wanna feel my,
Ouch, ouch, ouch,
I've done it before; I'll do it again,
Fazer: Just,
Tulsia: Leave me alone...

Dappy: Where the f**k do you think you is going (going).
Tulsia: I love you so much but you cheated on me.
Dappy: What we shared was no ordinary. 
Tulsia: I feel the same until you had to go and tear my heart like.
