Days are gone
Days are long and you're
You're looking older
Over you shoulder

You're never wrong
Carry on and you're
You want you baby to want you
Now you're stuck in a corner, yeah

Your ocean's drying out
Don't let your sun go down

Made  a start
With a holes in you heart and you're
You're feeling much stronger
You baby she wants you

You're always the same
You're always to blame and you're
You pray for the weekend
Now in at the deep end, yeah

Your ocean's drying out
Don't let your sun go down

Sunday mornings, gone away
They'll be back someday

Your ocean's drying out
Don't let your sun go down
Your oceans drying out
Don't let you sun go down

Sunday mornings, gone away
They'll be back someday, yeah, yeah
Sunday mornings, gone away
They'll be back someday---Lyrics submitted by Ausan.
