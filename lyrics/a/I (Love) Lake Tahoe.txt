Four long years ago
Searching for the snow
We found the Tahoe lakes
Just about the perfect place 

Fifty rooms at Heavenly
And the nights at Squaw Valley
Yeah, the trees are pretty wide-
That's where Sonny Bono died 

All is quiet on New Year's day,
Think I'll try'n impress my mates
So I jump into the lake
Yeah, I won't do that again! 

Every year we say the same,
"Try somewhere different for a change"
But we jump onto the plane, yeah,
And here we go again! 

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na naaaa

The south shore has the lot
And last month Dave Lee Roth,
He did a solo spot
And some German bloke got shot 

Every year we say the same
"Try somewhere different for a change"
But we jump onto the plane, yeah,
And here we go again! 

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na naaaa

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh... (etc.) 

Naa naa naa (etc.)---Lyrics submitted by Jacki.
