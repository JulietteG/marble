In the height of conversation
There's a sudden situation
On the old and rocky road
There's a place where no one goes

There's a statue in the fields
Mother Mary gently kneels
Coffee spilling on the floor
Some say they've seen this day before

A thousand miles away
For all of you who believe in faith
There's an evil plan and nation
And it's calling out your name

So give me the drums and the bass line
And give me a bunk and a flashlight
And give me the moon and the room
You can have the night

Smoke to death in the back
That is the place where it's at
Give me the breach to believe
You can have the night

A thousand miles away
For all of you who believe in faith
There's and evil plan and nation
And it's calling out your name

A thousand miles away
For all of you who believe in faith
There's voices in the air out there
They're calling near a day

A thousand miles away
For all of you who believe in faith
There's and evil plan and nation
And it's calling out your name

A thousand miles away
For all of you who believe in faith
There's voices in the air out there
They're calling near a day---Lyrics submitted by Ausan.
