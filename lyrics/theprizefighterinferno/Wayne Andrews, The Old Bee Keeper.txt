I'm the keeper of the bees
As you know
Just a worthless memory
In this house
Through the light of day and dark
Will you notice me?
I'm the keeper of the bees
I'm a dead man
Dear diary, I won't keep her awake... anymore
I won't love her anymore
She won't let me
Just a journeyman's journey
To the end
Will this road hold home, for good? 
Will I ever see
Against this broken street again
It will comfort me
Dear Diary, I won't keep her awake..... anymore---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
