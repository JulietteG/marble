Affection that I feel for you
Makes worship overflow
I could fill the deepest oceans
With emotions of my soul
My heart expands to hold the love
I long to share with you
These words are true expressions of
Thanks for all you do.

Chorus:
I simply love You, I love You
What more can I say to try to convey
That I love You, I love You.---Lyrics submitted by Kiara.
