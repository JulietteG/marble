I'm at peace
Even though my heart is breaking
I'm at peace
I never thought I would be shaken
But You came and laid Your hands on me and now...
Oh oh Lord, You came and laid Your hands on me and now
I can see, my storm has moved away

I'm at peace
Even though I'm not worthy
I'm at peace
Even though I cannot see
Oh oh Lord, You died for me on Calvary and now...
Oh oh, You died for me on Calvary and now
I can see, my storm... (Come on, can you point to your storm right now?)
My storm has moved away

I'm at, I'm at peace
(Come on, you oughta lift your hands and thank Him for peace)
Even though my heart is breaking
I'm at peace
I never thought I would be shaken, oh Lord
I remember the day Lord, I remember the moment Lord
You came and laid Your hands on me and now...
Oh oh Lord, You died for me on Calvary and now...
I can see, my storm has moved away
You came and laid Your hands on me and now...
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
You came and laid Your hands on me and now...
It will be all over in the morning
You came and laid Your hand on me and now...
I can see, my storm has moved away---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
