You keep saying, you got something for me 
Something you call love but confess 
You've been messin' where you shouldn't have been messin' 
And now someone else is getting all your best

These boots are made for walking 
And that's just what they'll do 
One of these days these boots 
Are gonna walk all over you

Yeah, you keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin' 
And you keep losing when you oughta not bet 
You keep samin' when you oughta be changin' 
Now, what's right is right but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walking 
And that's just what they'll do 
One of these days these boots 
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin' 
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burnt 
Ah, I've just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah 
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn

These boots are made for walking 
And that's just what they'll do 
One of these days these boots 
Are gonna walk all over you

Walking

These boots are made for walking 
And that's just what they'll do 
One of these days these boots 
Are gonna walk all over you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
