(feat. Tiny G)

I keep on moving to the same old rhythm
I keep on hearing it again
This record start keeps on skipping
I wish that sometimes it would end
Cause I know that your words are the bullets that I feel
When they hit
Yeah they hurt
Shake 'm off
This ain't real
Cause ??
In my heart still the beat's made of steel
So let's go down

We got to live tonight
Don't you know that will do it alright
We've got it all we give and more
So just sing it with me
And sing it once more
For the love love love love
You know it's all about the love love love love
Let's sing it for the love love love love
You know it's all about the love love love love
Let's sing it tonight

Let's sing it tonight
Let's sing it tonight

I knew I kill it with a brand new vision
I only wanted things to change
And now I'm on it I've made that decision
Don't let it stop just let it play

Cause I know that this plane that I've held in my heart
Is the hit that I need
I can make a new start
So I'll kick and I'll scream and I'll ride all my stars
If you help me sing

We got to live tonight
Don't you know that will do it alright
We've got it all we give and more
So just sing it with me
And sing it once more
For the love love love love
You know it's all about the love love love love
Let's sing it for the love love love love
You know it's all about the love love love love
Let's sing it tonight

Let's sing it tonight
Let's sing it tonight

Cause I know that this plane that I've held in my heart
Is the hit that I need
I can make a new start
So I'll kick and I'll scream and I'll ride all my stars
If you help me sing

We got to live tonight
Don't you know that will do it alright
We've got it all we give and more
So just sing it with me
And sing it once more
For the love love love love
You know it's all about the love love love love
Let's sing it for the love love love love
You know it's all about the love love love love
Let's sing it tonight---
