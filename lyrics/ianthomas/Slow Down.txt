Move fast in the city lights
Step aside of the pretty lights
Take time to take your way
The sun goes down and we begin to
Get lost in the shadows
You can't find of the weirdo's
When seconds turn to eternity

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I like when everything slows down
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I like when everything slows down
Round you
When everything slows down
Round you
How everything slows down
Round you
I am so glad that I found you

Butterfly kisses
Rain falling in the stairs
Reflections of your face
?? in the middle
Slow dance to the fiddle
When seconds turn to eternity

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I like when everything slows down
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I like when everything slows down
Round you
When everything slows down
Round you
How everything slows down
Round you
I am so glad that I found you

Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I like when everything slows down
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I like when everything slows down
Round you
When everything slows down
Round you
How everything slows down
Round you
I am so glad that I found you
Found you
Found you---
