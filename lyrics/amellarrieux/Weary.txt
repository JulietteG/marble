This woman is growing weary
Of having to be so strong
Of having to pretend I'm made of stone
So I won't end up with no broken bones
I can't fight every battle alone

I want someone to lift me
Heal my wounds and give me kisses on my head
Say words that should be said
Fear is not the matter
I would so much rather open up my heart
And lay down my guard

Chorus 2x
If I could trust someone
To have my back and never do me wrong
Then I would give my love up
Just like that stop singing this soldier song


Whomever said love was overrated
Must not be getting' none
My independent days have had their fun
But when the parties over
And the workin' day is done
I just want to come home to someone

I want a love to take me
As I am not make me compromise myself
Or be like no one else
Fear is not the matter
I would so much rather open up my heart
And just lay down my guard

Chorus

I want someone to lift me
Heal my wounds and give me kisses on my head
Say words that should be said.
(repeat)
