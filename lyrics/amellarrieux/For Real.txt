I can run, I can race for hours and hours 
And don't stop 
I can float I can fly us to the highest 
Mountain top I can breathe you, I can drink in your laugh 
I can... I can live on your smile I can trip and if I can fall into your arms I can 
Stay there my whole life 

[Chorus]
I can live 
I can love
I can be better with you,
For real 
I can hear 
I can feel 
I can see
I can tell 
You are for real 

I can stare; I can memorize your face, your hands, your hair 
Every part of you I can cut off any loose ends and not even wanna keep a few 
I can speak to you so honestly I can't even run any game 
I can hear a million angels singing in my ears 
When I say your name

[Chorus]

I can't smile, can't dream like a child 
Can't feel safe in this wide world without you 
I can't go can't disturb this flow
Can't begin to know what I would do
I can't see, can't find strength to be 
Rather not be me without you 
I can't deal, I can't even feel, without you I'm not real---Lyrics submitted by aujuree.
