"Please take care of yourself." Was the last thing I said
Right before that operator made us disconnected.

Please take care of yourself was the last thing I said,
Right before that operator made us disconnected.
If you can hear me right now, I've got a formula vow
That swears I'll do my best to figure out this situation.

First of all I'll explain why I caused all that water
But never fixed that leaking pipe that floods us to the sealing.
An empty shot glass doesn't lie so I fulfilled my appetite
And crossed my fingers that the good Lord will take care of you and I again.

So now that I found it,
I'll tie the ropes around it.
And make sure that the bottle never bothers us again.
Well I promise this time really. yeah?
Well I'm cleaning up sincerely. yeah.
And I'll make sure that the devil never bothers you again.

How I wish that you had sold me on all of those big goals
Of being a good father not a careless liar.
Well am I really that old, ignorant or to slow
To realize I have lost my golden ticket back home?---Lyrics submitted by angie.
