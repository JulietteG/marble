Well I watched your black tied family
Rise up from graves near cemeteries
That I have not been to since you goodbye
And I drank another simile
And compared your Jesus to a thief
He took my bones and turned them into bread.
Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones.
I was scared to call your mother
For news that you weren't getting better
Well my God, what the hell am I supposed to do?
And I ran off and ran on to something
That I swore was everything but beautiful
I only say that word for you
Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones.
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones.
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
And hallelujah to the one that we love---Lyrics submitted by Lindsay.
