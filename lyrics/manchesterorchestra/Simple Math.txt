Hunter eyes
I'm lost and hardly noticed, slight goodbye
I want to rip your lips off in my mouth
And even in my greatest moment doubt
The line between deceit and right now

Simple math, it's how our bodies even got here
Sinful math, the ebb and flow to multiply
What if I was wrong and no one cared to mention
What if it was true and all we thought was right was wrong?
Simple math, the truth cannot be fractioned
Either way...

I imply to mitigate the guilt, we could align
A perfectly constructed alibi
To hush the violent guilt that eats and never dies
In actual blame, they call me once the dark divides

Simple math, it's why our bodies even lay here
Sinful math, the truth cannot be fashioned
What if you were crazy, would we have to listen then?

What if we've been trying to get to where weve always been?
What if I was wrong, and started trying to fix it?
What if you believed me? Everything is brilliant

Oh, oh, oh

What if Ive been trying to get to where Ive always been?
What if weve been trying to get to where weve always been?
Simple math, believe me, all is brilliant
What if we've been trying to kill the noise and silence?

What if I was wrong and you had never questioned it?
What if it was true, that all we thought was right, was wrong?
Simple math, the truth cannot be fractioned
I imply I've got to get it back then

Oh, oh, oh ---Lyrics submitted by pugsley.
