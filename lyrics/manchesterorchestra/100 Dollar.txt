several women's magazines
stacked up on top of a picture of me
when i tried to call...
no one answered

it's not  even that i'm all angry
just want to know why you would do this thing
you said there's an understanding

i offered you a small dog in the kitchen
just wanted you to feel at home

and that's why
i am fine i am fine
i am fine i am fine
i just need one hundred dollars

i am fine 
i am fine
i am fine
i am fine
i just need one hundred dollars

from you and you and you and you and you---Lyrics submitted by Jeff.
