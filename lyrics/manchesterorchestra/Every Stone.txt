You might just have missed the mark
If you're keeping everyone away
Didn't mean to
Didn't want to
Well we might just leave a mark
If you don't give anyone a say
Never want to
Never mean to

Every stone I've thrown has gone away
Has gone away [x2]

Every stone I've thrown has gone away
Has gone away
It's gone away
Away [x2]

It's a notion
That doesn't matter even if we stay
And it's overrated
And manipulated
Nobody ever has a say
It makes me wonder who can wait
And attest my patience
Cause it's not worth waiting

Every stone I've thrown has gone away
Has gone away
It's gone away

Every stone I've thrown has gone away
Has gone away
It's gone away
Away [x5]

Away [x2]---
