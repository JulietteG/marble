I want to watch it all fall until it's dark,
you both look exactly the same at night
I'd arrange the bed like crosses, watched them fall into the floor
Made me stop and forget what we were fighting for
It's like everything that I ever have imagined's coming true today

There is a cost, my friends
Of living out some other dream to find the consequence
It comes and goes in seasons around here, I thought again
There's nothing left around to yield this sorry ignorance
If I do echo I hope you never see
There is no one there that's waiting after me
And I hope if there is one thing I let go it is the way that we cope

Now I hope if there is one thing that we know
From the way that you and I will wander on
And we won't become a lifeless lope that wanders round and hopes for sorrow

And I know!
I know!
I know! Know!
I know! ---
