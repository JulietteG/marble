Cause you always talk so loud,
And you never notice,
I don't mind the sound but you've,
rearranged the pieces of your life,
So many times you burned out the parts.

I don't wanna believe,
But I wanna believe you,
I don't mean what I say,
But I say what I mean to

So now your last name is mine,
And I feel no different,
I made a match that's trying to prove,
Trying to find a way I can explain,
There was nothing else to possibly say.

I don't wanna believe,
But I wanna believe you,
I don't mean what I say,
But I say what I mean to

You waste so much time,
You waste so much time,

On desperate friends,
Trying to reconcile their names,
There is a name for men like you inside the dark,
And I know your faults,
I know the way you write them off,
I don't want anything to do with it no more.

I bet most the time,
You're too insecure to admit it,
You're the last in line to move,
Now I'm running out of things that I can say,
Cause nothing that I say is really helping anyway.

I don't wanna believe,
But I wanna believe you,
I don't mean what I say,
But I say what I mean to

I don't wanna believe,
But I wanna believe you,
I don't mean what I say,
But I say what I mean to

You waste so much time,
You waste so much time,
You waste so much time,
YOU WASTE SO MUCH TIME ---
