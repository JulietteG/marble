There's two twin deaf kids and they've gotta make
An ungodly decision
They decide which one gets to leave this place
And which one will forsake it, to make it

So, the first kid says in his temporal tone,
"I don't think there's a way to resolve this.
We should wrap up these towels round our blistering bones.
Wait it out in the closet."

His brother looks him up and down and prophesied
How all of this should end
Said they're buried underneath the yard
And no one ever listens... or visits.

All that I know, it's no way to fix it [x4]

Did it really matter how it happened when it did?
Cause when it happened, you reacted with an apathetic wind
So she tried to wash it out but that's a stain that won't dissolve
And we all believed in ghosts until you walked into the wall

So give up! [x4]

All that I know, it's no way to fix it [x4]---
