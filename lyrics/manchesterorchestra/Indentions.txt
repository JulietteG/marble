God is all of the time
Red box, wood baptist sign tonight

Some local kid lit a fire
They burned down everything inside

I won't leave indentions of me, me

God is watching tonight
How long can you be knighted now?

Cause all the progress you made
Won't end up meaning anything

I won't leave indentions of me
I won't leave intentionally

It doesn't matter to me
I tell myself repeatedly

What a nightmare it seemed
To honestly think anything

I won't leave indentions of me
I won't leave intentionally ---
