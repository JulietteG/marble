That boat
When I float, it's the last in its class
I'm the first one to know
That bay
It's never made, I'm the last of my kind
Fucking tricked by my training

Oh, Oh, No

I, I give it to the ocean, the ocean, the ocean

I hope
You don't choke on that last passive word that you keep in your throat

It's so cool to be you
we're all walking around like a kid out of school

I, I give it to the ocean, the ocean [x2]

There's a ghost
and it knows
what I know

So I let go

I, I give it to the ocean, the ocean [x4]---
