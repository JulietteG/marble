This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields

Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Steping over heads

Running from the underground
This is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide

This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is a warning
4 minute warning---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
