appliances have gone berserk
i cannot keep up
treading on people's toes
snot-nosed little punk

and i can't face the evening straight
you can offer me escape
houses move and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief, relief, relief, relief

and if i'm gonna talk
i just wanna talk
please don't interrupt
just sit back and listen

cos i can't face the evening straight
you can offer me escape
houses move and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief, relief, relief, relief
relief, relief

it's too much, too bright, too powerful
too much, too bright, too powerful
too much, too bright, too powerful
too much, too bright, too powerful---Lyrics submitted by Ivan.
