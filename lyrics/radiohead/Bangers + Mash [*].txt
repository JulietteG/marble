You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me, now I want more

Standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
It's all been sent to recover hell
The bangers and the mash
The negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not

Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off
Chief of police or vice-chancellor
Lord and lady, blah blah
The vicar or the judge
You are dancing to my little red book

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison, and I want more

If you are on top
Then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power
We're changing the hour
If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark
The black will stare back
Back into your soul

I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
When I go down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
I'm kicking at the wall

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
Poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
I got the poison---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
