The Moonies are up on the mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture

Singing "We're here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail
Together
Together"

You made a pig's ear
You made a mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait

Where's the truth?
What's the use?
I'm hanging around
lost and found

With your head
In the sand
Fat chance
No plan

No regard
For human life
Keep time
You've no rhythm

You're fast to lose
You will lose
Jump the queue
Go back again

President for life, lord of all
The flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth
The fish in the sea
You've lost command---Lyrics submitted by Andrei Muntean.
