You there
Get up on that wall
Get up on that-
Who? Who? you (fool) you, you (fool) you, you
Toodaloo
You fool
Jew (Go on and shoot 'em) X 16
Get up on that wall
Jew, Jew (wall) Jew, Jew (wall) Jew, Jew
Shoot 'em X 10
(Get up, Got 'em) X 5
Save 'em
(Go on and shoot 'em) X 17
Get up (Got 'em) X 10---Lyrics submitted by jason.
