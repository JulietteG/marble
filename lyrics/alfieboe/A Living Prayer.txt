In this world I walk alone 
With no place to call my home 
But there's one who holds my hand 
The rugged road through barren lands 

The way is dark, the road is steep 
But He's become my eyes to see 
The strength to climb, my griefs to bear 
The Savior lives inside me there 

In Your love I find release 
A haven from my unbelief 
Take my life and let me be 
A living prayer, my God to Thee 

In these trials of life I find 
Another voice inside my mind 
He comforts me and bids me live 
Inside the love the Father gives 

In Your love I find release 
A haven from my unbelief 
Take my life and let me be 
A living prayer, my God to Thee 

Take my life and let me be 
A living prayer, my God to Thee 
A living prayer, my God to Thee 


A Gaelic Blessing (Deep Peace) 

Deep peace of the running wave to you 
Deep peace of the flowing air to you 
Deep peace of the quiet earth to you 
Deep peace of the shining stars to you 
Deep peace of the gentle night to you 
Moon and stars pour their healing light on you 
Deep peace of Christ, of Christ 
The light of the world to you 
Deep peace of Christ to you. 

Deep peace of the quiet earth to you 
Deep peace of the shining stars to you 
Deep peace of the living God and the love of His Son to you. 
Deep peace of Christ to you.---Lyrics submitted by Ella.
