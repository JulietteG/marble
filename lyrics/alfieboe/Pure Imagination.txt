Come with me,
And you'll be,
In a world of
Pure imagination.
Take a look,
And you'll see,
Into your imagination.

We'll begin,
With a spin,
Traveling in
The world of my creation.
What we'll see,
Will defy,
Explanation.

If you want to view paradise,
Simply look around and view it.
Anything you want to, do it.
Want to change the world?
There's nothing
To it.

There is no,
Life I know,
To compare with
Pure imagination.
Living there,
You'll be free,
If you truly wish to be.

If you want to view paradise,
Simply look around and view it.
Anything you want to, do it.
Want to change the world?
There's nothing
To it.

There is no,
Life I know,
To compare with
Pure imagination.
Living there,
You'll be free,
If you truly
Wish to be.---Lyrics submitted by Ella.
