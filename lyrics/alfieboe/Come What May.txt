Never knew I could feel like this,
Like Ive never seen the sky before.
Want to vanish inside your kiss,
Every day I love you more and more.
Listen to my heart,
Can you hear it sing?
Telling me to give you everything.
Seasons may change,
Winter to spring,
But I love you until the end of time.
Come what may,
Come what may,
I will love you,
Until my dying day.

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place.
Suddenly it looms with such a perfect grace.
Suddenly my life doesnt seem such a waste. 
All revolves around you.

And there is no mountain too high,
No river too wide.
Sing out this song and
I will be there by your side.
Storm clouds may gather,
Stars may collide.
But I love you,
I love you,
Till the end of time.
Come what may,
Come what may,
I will love you ,
Until my dying day.---Lyrics submitted by Ella.
