In my daughter's eyes, 
I am a hero.
I am strong and wise, 
And I know no fear.

But the truth is plain to see,
She was sent to rescue me.
I see who I want t' be,
In my daughter's eyes.

In my daughter's eyes,
Everyone is equal.
Darkness turns to light,
And the world is at peace.

This miracle God gave to me,
Gives me strength when I am weak.
I find reason to believe,
In my daughter's eyes.

And when she wraps her hand around my finger,
Always puts a smile in my heart.
Everything becomes a little clearer,
I realize what life is all about.

It's hanging on when your heart has had enough,
It's giving more when you feel like giving up.
I've seen the light,
It's in my daughter's eyes.

In my daughter's eyes,
I can see the future,
A reflection of 
Who I am and what will be.

Though she'll grow and someday leave,
Maybe raise a family,
When I'm gone I hope you see,
How happy she made me.

For I'll be there,
In my daughter's eyes.---Lyrics submitted by John Trumbull.
