I wanna walk with you into the love
I wanna power you
I wanna walk with you, you get me so high
I wanna fly with you

Its all right, all right
All night, all night
Youre mine, youre mine
X 2

Youll be mine
Youll be mine
Youll be mine
Youll be mine

Tonight Im gonna fight for my right
Cause loving you feels so right ()
X 2

Its gonna be all right
Its gonna be ok
X 4

I wanna drive with you all the days
And with you
I wanna break with you
All the roads that keep me away from you

Its all right, all right
All night, all night
Youre mine, youre mine
X 2

Youll be mine
Youll be mine
Youll be mine
Youll be mine

Tonight Im gonna fight for my right
Cause loving you feels so right ()
X 2
Its gonna be all right
Its gonna be ok
X 4

I wanna walk with you into the love
I wanna power you
I wanna walk with you, you get me so high
I wanna fly with you

Its all right, all right
All night, all night
Youre mine, youre mine
X 2

Youll be mine
Youll be mine
Youll be mine
Youll be mine

Tonight Im gonna fight for my right
Cause loving you feels so right ()
X 2
Its gonna be all right
Its gonna be ok
