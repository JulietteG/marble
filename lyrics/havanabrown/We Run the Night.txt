When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy are you afraid of the dark, dark
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start, start
And when the base gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part, part
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well the sound is the key to my heart

[Chorus:]
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night
We run.. a yes, we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run.. a yes, we run the night, we, we, we, run
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night, night, night, night

Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em
Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em

Feel the life go rush, rush, rush
Pushing past me, all over my skin, skin
I can get enough 'nough 'nough 'nough
'cause the beat keep pullin' me in
Takin' me so high up, up, up
Place that I've never been, ahhhh
Party, party all night, night, night,
sleep all day then do it again, 'gain

[Chorus:]
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night
We run.. a yes, we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run.. a yes, we run the night, we, we, we, run
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night.

Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em
Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em

[Techno Voice]
eh, eh, eh,
eh, eh, eh,
Turn the lights down
Turn the lights down
eh, eh, eh,
eh, eh, eh,
Turn the lights down, down
Turn the lights down

[Chorus:]
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night
We run.. a yes, we run the night, night, night, night, night
We run.. a yes, we run the night, we, we, we, run
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night, night, night, night ---Lyrics submitted by Cat.
