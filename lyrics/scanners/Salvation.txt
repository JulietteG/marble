Went to the sea,but the tide was out
Stood on the shore,but the wind was cold
Waited around till no ones about
Thought of my spirit till my head took hold

whoaaaa ooooooh (2x)

Looked to my heart, but my heart was empty
Looked the ground, but the road was long
But now I found my new salvation
It's so new the old ones young

(whoaaaa ooooooh)
I've been waiting for the dark to come
(whoaaaa ooooooh)
My temptation and salvation
(whoaaaa ooooooh)
I've been waiting for the tide to turn
(whoaaaa ooooooh)

Dark eyes become divine
I need the love I crave
Your hands they burn like mine

I'll take you to my grave
(repeat)

(whoaaaa ooooooh)
I've been waiting for the dark to come
(whoaaaa ooooooh)
My temptation and salvation
(whoaaaa ooooooh)
I've been waiting for the tide to turn
(whoaaaa ooooooh)

Dark eyes become divine
I need the love I crave
Your hands they burn like mine
I'll take you to my grave
I'll take you to my grave

I've been waiting for the dark to come
My temptation and salvation
(whoaaaa ooooooh)
I've been waiting for the tide to turn
(whoaaaa ooooooh whoaaaaaa)

Dark eyes become divine
I need anekatips the love I crave
Your hands they burn like mine
I'll take you to my grave
I'll take you to my grave---Lyrics submitted by Tina.
