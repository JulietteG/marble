...Sarah Connor... 
...Naturally Seven... 
...Music Is The Key... 

People have always been singing 
To wipe away tears 
To ease all their pain 

Music has always been healing 
Some people just sometimes 
And others again and again and again 

So we hope that today you are ready 
To understand 

Whenever you're falling down 
Hopeless and pushed around 
Find your own melody 
Trust me that music is the key 

It makes you feel proud and strong 
Helps you to carry on 
If you are down on your knees 
You should sing it with me 
Music is the key - sets you free 

Stories we've always been telling 
It's part of our nature 
To speak with a friend 

So we hope that today you are ready 
To understand 

Whenever you're falling down 
Hopeless and pushed around 
Find your own melody 
Trust me that music is the key 

It makes you feel proud and strong 
Helps you to carry on 
If you are down on your knees 
You should sing it with me 
Music is the key 

It's the key to the heart of all people 
It can open the door to your soul 
It's the key to a world 
Where the flower of love 
Always grows - don't you know... 

Whenever you're falling down 
Hopeless and pushed around 
Find your own melody 
Trust me that music is the key 

Whenever you're losing faith 
Just wanna leave your place 
Come sing along with me 
Trust me that music is the key 

Just sing with me loud and strong 
Help us to carry on 
If you are down on your knees 
You should sing it with me 
Music is the key - sets you free
