When the rain keeps falling
Can't you hear me calling?
For somebody new
Someone just like you
Don't you feel there's something
Deep inside you waiting
For the slightest change
To go and do your dance

You're lying awake in the night
You just wanna do something right

[Chorus]
So don't forget to breathe
Let it in, let it out
For all the world to see
From within and without
You're shining like a star
Let it in, let it out
Tonight you are my desire
The evil's on the move
Let it in, let it out
It's coming straight to you
From within and without
Keep shining like a star
Let it in, let it out
Tonight you are my desire


Don't you keep me waiting
When I'm concentrating
Let me be your girl
And we can rule the world
Love will lead us somewhere
And you will like it I swear
Without pain no gain
We'll never be the same

We're lying awake in the night
And all that we do is just right

[Chorus]


I'd like to taste my chocolate right before drinking
You've got to shake your butt un poco if you want bling bling
Oh, mi amore, take your time this is what I'm thinking
Just keep your breath
'Cause you will never know when the ship's sinking

Aire dentro, aure fuera
No te olvides de respirar
Brillas como una estrella
Esta noche eres mi deseo
Esta noche eres mi deseo

So don't forget to breathe
Let it in, let it out
For all the world to see
From within and without
You're shining like a star
Let it in, let it out
Tonight you are my desire
The evil's on the move
Let it in, let it out
It's coming straight to you
From within and without
Keep shining like a star
Let it in, let it out
Tonight you are my desire---Lyrics submitted by saeed.
