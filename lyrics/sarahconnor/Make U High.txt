Intro:
I'm gonna make u high, high
When you're feeling low, low
Show you all the joy, joy
You've never seen
And then we do it right, right
Lovin' you in slow mo
This is what you get
If you're gonna be with me
I'm gonna make you high, high
When you're feeling low, low
Verse 1:
Hey boy, I've been watching you
Been thinking of
What we could do
And now I know you can feel it too
We're gonna come together every night
And hey you, come on over here
I surely feel
The time is near
And in my mind I can see it clear
I show you how it's gonna be alright
So...
Bridge:
Better stop to mess around
It's the night we're gettin' down
Gonna take you higher
We can do it now
Chorus:
I'm gonna make u high, high
When you're feeling low, low
Show you all the joy, joy
You've never seen
And then we do it right, right
Lovin' you in slow mo
This is what you get
If you're gonna be with me
I'm gonna make you high, high
When you're feeling low, low
Everything you want, want
Get it from me
I hold you very tight, tight
Wanna let it grow, grow
This is what you get
If you're gonna be with me
Verse 2:
Now I got you hypnotized
It's always me
Who's on your mind
Come over here, baby, don't be shy
We're gonna play together every night
And no one's stoppin' you and me
They have to face
Reality
There is no chance, we're in ecstasy
And stay there 'til the dawning of the day
Bridge
Chorus

You wanna know
I'm gonna make you high, high
When you're feeling low, low
