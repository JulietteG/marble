If you were my man, I could be your fantasy 
And if you were my man, I'd give you sweet ecstasy 
Yes if you were my man, what I'd od 
If you were my man, if you were my man 

Verse 1: 
Boy I see you lookin' at my body 
With that look in your eyes 
And even though you're standing with your girl 
You've got me on your mind 

B-section: 
If we spent one night, boy I'd love to touch your heaven 
And do you right, just sit back 
Enjoy the ride 
Baby close your eyes, there's so many things that I want to do 
Baby with you, oooh baby baby 

Chorus 

Verse 2: 
I'm not into stealin' other lovers 
But we both know this game 
And lookin' at the way you want me baby 
I know you feel the same oooh baby
