Baby, now I'm gonna get my message to you
And I hope that you believe in it, too
It maybe take some time
But all that's in your mind
You can make it come true

And it's crazy
That the people wait for someone who's strong
Even though they could do it on their own
'Cause everyone of us
Has a hero in his heart

[Chorus]
So this is your time
You can take it
And love is no crime
You should make it
Whenever you feel you gotta go
Deep inside your soul
From zero to hero
So this is your life
You can live it
And if you feel love
Just go out and give it
Whenever you feel you gotta go
Deep inside your soul
From zero to hero


Maybe you've been falling deep in love with a girl
You're so happy, wanna tell the whole world
You better wait a while
Until you make her smiley
And you know she loves you too

Don't be lazy, gotta prove to her your love is so strong
And without her all you do is just wrong
She will be loving you
For the hero in your heart

[Chorus]


Take your chances baby
You can make it trough
From zero to hero
Just follow your soul

This is your time
You can take it
Love ain't no crime
So you should make it

This is your life
And you'll be living it
From Zero
This is
To hero
You're digging it

So this is your time
You can take it
And love is no crime
You should make it

Whenever you feel you gotta go
Deep inside your soul
From zero to hero

So this is your life
You can live it
And if you feel love
Just go out and give it

Whenever you feel you gotta go
Deep inside your soul
From zero to hero

Wins a girls heart---Lyrics submitted by saeed.
