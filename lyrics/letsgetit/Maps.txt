No I don't wanna be in love anymore,
Cuz I dont wanna lose you,
These memories used to mean everything to me but I can't,
No I dont wanna be in love anymore,
I cant stop what I cant stop but I, no i dont wanna be in love anymore,
you should know by now youre my heart my soul, you're where i'll start and where i'll go,
cause weve been through worse than this yeah, ill be gone for a minute but dont forget, all the saturday nights,gathering inside the attic tight, we didnt know what we were doing,
but you said well be alright butterflies my hands were shaking,
better love that we were making take a breath let it out, another night, another town, these memories used to mean everything too me but I cant no i dont wanna be in love anymore i cant stop what I cant stop but i,
no I dont wanna be in love anymore, we flip through paged of thought, second guess if what were doings all worth doing or not, cause sometimes you gotta fight for what you really believe, but sometimes you just let go and dont forget to let your heart beat,
These memories used to mean everything to me but I can't,
No I dont wanna be in love anymore,
I cant stop what I cant stop but I,
no i dont wanna be in love anymore, all those nights on the phone when you said boy im lonely come over, you taught me how to sweat, let the mic do the rest,
(I wake up) I wonder where our time went, believe me when I say, girl this aint so easy for me, we make sacrifices,
do what we do, in hopes for something better, cause i dont wanna lose you, but girl I cant let this go and soo..,
no i dont wanna be in love anymore,
these memories used to mean everything too me but I can,
no I dont want to be in love anymore,
I cant stop what I,
Cant stop but I,
No I dont wanna be in love anymore,
tonight Im chasing my dreams, and leave you chasing me if your not here then I dont wanna be in love anymore,
tonight im leaving home and it hurts,
but i know we're gonna make it,
thats why I say, and I dont wanna be in love anymore---Lyrics submitted by Aly.
