Been tracking in all my thoughts
I can't find the principle
My heart can't stop racing
I see your face, I fall apart.

I feel everything
This is the first time
Everything seems fine since the start
I've been waiting so long.


This is the falling anthem
For the first time
Can't stop this thing from happening. 

This is our falling anthem
And it feels right
Can't stop our hearts from pounding. 


Your kisses still stop time
The disaster's beautiful
Remember the phases
those unhappy spaces
That tore my heart.


You healed everything
I know how I'm feeling
I know I'm not dreaming
I smile
Waiting here all along.

Can't stop
Can't stop this
Can't stop this thing from happening...---Lyrics submitted by gnes.
