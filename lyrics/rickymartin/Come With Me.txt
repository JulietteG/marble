This is not the way I wanted things to be
I hope someday you'll understand
My heart beats stronger when I know, close to you
It's helped me to be a better man

Why must all of the love come falling
Why don't we just take our chance
I could walk this road again with you my love, oh, oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where it leads

This is not the way we started, you and I
How was it that I lost my way
Two souls can drift apart without a word
Were those the words I did not say

Why must all of the dreams come falling
Why don't we just take this chance
I could walk this road again with you my love, oh, oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where it leads

I could walk this road again with you my love
Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where it leads---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
