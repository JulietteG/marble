Its the story of my life
Its how it always begins
I see you once, I see you twice
I got a taste of paradise
Its not as easy as it seems
When you have complicated dreams

So take me home
Take me to the zone
Tonight
The story of my life
Its gonna be alright

Courus:

Lady im your one night man
Come with me and take a chance
You won? t forget it
Never regret it
I can promise you that
Lady give me one last dance
Give me, give me, give me all you can
Suavecito, suavecito
Lady Im your one night man

Its the way it has to be
I know its hard to understand
And while it breaks my heart to leave
Somehow you got to believe
I will remember now and forever
This precious time that we spend
Together

So take me home
Take me to the zone
Tonight
The story of my life
Its gonna be alright---Lyrics submitted by mazen.
