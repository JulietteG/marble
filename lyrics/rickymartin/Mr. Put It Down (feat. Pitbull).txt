Now first of all 
Come on baby take it off
Come on baby break me off 
Then she said she loves the fact 
That Pitbull's such a dog!
It's simple baby, I ain't picky
Only rule of mine is no hickeys 
Remember, lust can get tricky
It's Mr. Worldwide and Ricky, dale 

I'm not tryna get in your head
And I'm not tryna push your limits 
Cause I just wanna make you feel special
A little fun, little love, little dancing
Who has to love to live in
We got the nigh right now
We need to want unclearly
You're gonna call me Mr. Put It Down

Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that
Baby give me that, give me that
Hi give me that, give me that

Baby I can recognize from miles away that you don't wanna be alone
Ain't nobody looking like you do today
So tell me how to turn you on

Hola, oh my
Oh where you come from?
Oh wow, no high
To pick the right one
I got my spot girl
Someone that likes you
Just follow me

Who has to love to live in
We got the nigh right now
We need to want unclearly
You're gonna call me Mr. Put It Down---
