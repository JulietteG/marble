Oh, it's the middle of the night
And I'm reaching out for you
In the darkness I can feel your touch break through
When I look into your eyes
And your skin's against my skin
I will hold you until the sun comes crashing in
Where would I be now
Without the tenderness that you possess

[Chorus]

The Touch
The Touch that makes me strong
That keeps me holding on
I come to you when times are tough
Your love is just enough
To lift me up so high
There's nothing I won't give
To be with you, to reach for you
I live to for touch

Oh, it's the middle of the night
And I'm reaching out for you
In the darkness I can feel your touch break through
When I look into your eyes
And your skin's against my skin
I will hold you until the sun comes crashing in
Where would I be now
Without the tenderness that you possess

[Chorus]

The Touch
The Touch that makes me strong
That keeps me holding on
I come to you when times are tough
Your love is just enough
To lift me up so high
There's nothing I won't give
To be with you, to reach for you
I live for the touch

Oh, I want to be the one you need
I need to be the one you see
I gotta justify the faith you have in me
You're the beauty in my life
You're the sun that lights my soul
You're the other half I need to make me whole
Who would I be now
Without the warmth you bring to everything

[Chorus]

All my life has been a journey here to you
Every road and river brought me closer to the touch
