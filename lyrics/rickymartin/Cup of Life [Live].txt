The Cup of Life
This is the one
Now is the time
Don't even stop
Push it along
Gotta be strong
Push it along
Right to the top

B SEC 1
The feelin' in your soul
Is gonna take control
Nothing can hold you back
If you really want it
I se it in your eyes
You want the cup of life
Now that the day is here
Gotta go and get it
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)

Here we go! Ale, Ale, Ale!
Go, go, go! Ale, Ale, Ale!
Tonight's the night we're gonna celebrate
The cup of life... the world is ours today!

Verse 2
The cup of life
It's do or die
It's here it's now
Turn up the lights
Push it along
Then let it roll
Push it along
Go! Go! Goal!

B SEC 2
And when you feel that heat
The world is at your feet
No one can hold you down
If you really want it
Just steal your destiny
Right from the hands of fate
Reach for the cup of life
Cause your name is on it
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)
Do you really want it ... (Yeah!)
