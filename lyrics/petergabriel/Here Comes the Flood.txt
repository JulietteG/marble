When the night shows
The signals grows on radios
All the strange things
They come and go, as early warnings
Stranded starfish have no place to hide
Still waiting for the swollen easter tide
Theres no point in direction if we cannot even choose a side.

I took the old track
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
On the tall cliffs
They were getting older, sons and daughters
The jaded underworld was riding high
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
And as the nail sunk in the cloud, the rain was warm and soaked the crowd.

Lord, here comes the flood
We will say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent
In any still alive
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, youre running dry.

When the flood calls,
You have no home, you have no walls
In the thunder crash
Youre a thousand minds, within a flash
Dont be afraid to cry at what you see
The actors gone, theres only you and me
And if we break before the dawn, they'll use up what we used to be.

Lord, here comes the flood
We will say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again, the seas are silent
In any still alive
Itll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, youre running dry.---Lyrics submitted by Jan.
