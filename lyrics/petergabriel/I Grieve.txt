it was only one hour ago
it was all so different then
nothing yet has really sunk in
looks like it always did
this flesh and bone
is just the way that we are tied in
now there's no-one home

i grieve for you
you leave me
it's so hard to move on
still loving what's gone
they say life carries on
they say life carries on and on and on and on

the news that truly shocks is the empty, empty page
while the final rattle rocks its empty, empty cage
and i can't handle this

i grieve for you
and you leave me

let it out and move on
missing what's gone
they say life carries on
they say life carries on and on and on

life carries on
in the people i meet
in everyone that's out on the street
in all the dogs and cats
in the flies and rats
in the rot and the rust
in the ashes and the dust
life carries on and on and on and on
life carries on and on and on

it's just the car that we ride in
the home we reside in
the face that we hide in
the way we are tied in
life carries on and on and on and on
life carries on and on and on

did i dream this belief?
or did i believe this dream?
now i can find relief
i grieve---Lyrics submitted by kayla.
