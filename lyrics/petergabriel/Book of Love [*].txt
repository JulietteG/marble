The book of love, is long and boring;
No one can lift the damn thing.
It's full of charts, and facts and figures, 
And instructions for dancing.

And I, I love it when you read to me.
And you, you can read me anything.

The book of love, has music in it;
in fact that's where music comes from.
Some of it's just transcendental;
some of it's just really dumb.

And I, I love it when you sing to me.
And you, you can sing me anything.

The book of love is long and boring,
and written very long ago.
It's full of flowers, and heart-shaped boxes;
and things we're all too young to know.

And I, I love it when you give me things.
And you, you want to give me wedding rings.

And I, I love it when you give me things.
And you, you want to give me wedding rings.---Lyrics submitted by Chidi Mbanisi.
