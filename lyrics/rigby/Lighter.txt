Live can knock you down
Stand up straight love
Together we'll be back around
In the cold
In the cold dark night
Just warm your body
Your body's so close to mine
Can you feel my heart
Like drums beating to this song
I knew you'd be the one
It's so much lighter
It's so much lighter now
I have searched across the seas
From my haven next to me
So much brighter
So much brighter than before
You put the colours in my world
You put the colours in my world

With a stroke
Of a new found pen
You draw ?? 
To pick it up and start again
Can you feel my heart like drums
Beating to this song
I knew you'd be the one
It's so much lighter
It's so much lighter now
I have searched across the seas
From my haven next to me
So much brighter
So much brighter than before
You put the colours in my world
You put the colours in my world
You put the colours in my world

It's so much lighter
It's so much lighter than before
You put the colours in my world.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
