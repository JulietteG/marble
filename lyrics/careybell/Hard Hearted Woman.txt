Hard Workin' woman
Nothin' but a man's slave

Hard Workin' woman
Ain't nothin' but a man's slave

She work hard all her life
Ain't a dime, she can save

She work hard like a mule 
Down in the Georgia cotton field

She work hard like a mule 
Down in the Georgia cotton field

You should know people now
Just how, how she feels

She come home every Friday
Ah, She better bring some bread

She come home every Friday
And, she better bring home some bread

If she don't......
he will go up-side her head

She gonna leave at midnight
And put that damn fool down

She gonna leave at midnight
And put that damn fool down

She gonna find herself a workin' man
To fill her empty ground---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
