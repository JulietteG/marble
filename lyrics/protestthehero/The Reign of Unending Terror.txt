Each word bitten, every fuck is pronounced.
With conviction written, injustice announced.
And every hand that feeds is bitten, if it steals from hungry mouths.
Convention be damned, I know who I am and words are just too fucking loud!

They can't be ignored!

Twice out bitter lifetime tucked tightly in their belts
But spat and bit in such a way that you know just how it felt.
What it means to be a man and what it means to refuse it!
Things I learn along the way while listening to their music
So laugh then cry we'll try but laugh again.
Throw your hands up in relief that twenty years won't end their reign
Their reign, their reign!!!

The Reign of Unending Terror, the rain that brings us warning.
The rain that breaks the sky and gives us hope for the end of this long night.
Red sky morning light..

The truth is, some days I don't have any morals at all..
The truth is, I left them in the men's room at the truck stop in the second stall..
The truth is, some days I don't have any morals at all..
The truth is, I left them in the men's room at the truck stop in the second stall!!

That's the kind of enemy that obscures the very core of me
My shallow lacking and disbelief, flipping through the sleeves of
CD books with cold cocked hooks, flip the knings uplift the rooks
Spit on the diamonds cuffs of the real crooks!!

When you look in my eyes, who do you see?
When you look in my eyes, who is it?
When you look in my eyes, who do you see?
When you look in my eyes, who is it?---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
