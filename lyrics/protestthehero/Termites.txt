Gin, always the gin, always take one on the chin!
The devil dogs and scorpions peel away and wear my skin..

Smokeless flame, the common name.
Less than the angels but more of the same.
No paradise, the grateful will lay their claim,
Whether the intentions are violent or just mundane...

With the wind he disappeared..
Confirming everything that I feared...
The time passed is shown by the length of his beard...

Solomon stands, dead on his feet..
waiting for termites to resolve his conceit!!
In the mountains, in the seas, in the air waits the disease!!
We are not Gods, death comes to us all,
but tonight I'm invincible, tomorrow I'll crawl!!
In the mountains, in the seas, in the air waits the disease!!

The gin in this bottle, just don't let him drown..
Next lesson you swallow, might be hard to keep down.
Taste the penalty of the blazing fire..
Taste the penalty, sing with the Devil's choir..

OH>>>>OH>>>

Gin, always the gin, never thick and never thin!
Thicker than blood, less than kin, the rattle trap night ends where it begins!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
