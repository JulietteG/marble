He's looking at you
It was gonna leak eventually, so eventually it did
And bad new, travels fast indeed
In a minute the country will be stiff, stiff inside their pants.

All the editors are hard, all the journalists are wet
All the boys are jerking off in private on the internet.

The manager is sweating, The parents smoking cigarettes
And it doesn't matter if their vision shatters
"It's no good" says E! and it punches up a storm 
(And it punches up a storm, it punches up a storm)
And it better be, fucking better be, it better be good!!

She looks angry, run that tape!
Yeah, she looks so fine in the limelight!

In a sickly green she might have been, a girl I know or a place I've seen.

Now all the editors are hard, and all the journalists are wet
And all the boys are jerking off in private on the internet
Now all the editors are hard, and all the journalists are wet
And all the boys are jerking off in private on the internet

Between the slut and the silhouette
Between the drink and the regret,
Have you film and don't forget...
Everyone's naked!

Some where on the in-ter-net
Some where on the in-ter-net

The Jonas generation got rings wrapped 'round their dicks
The whole world waits with patience for one of them boys to slip

Reflected, directed, for one simple fact
Be careful what you're looking at because it might be looking back.
Reflected, directed, for one simple fact
Be careful what you're looking at because it might be looking back,
Be careful what you're looking at because it might be looking back!!

In a sickly green, she might have been..
A girl I know, a place I've seen
Innocently green, she might have been
A fantasy that I've foreseen!!

Yea!
Get if off, get it off online!!!
Get it off get if off get it off online!!!

in a sickly green, she might have been
A girl I know or a place I've seen
A girl I know or a place I've seen!!!---Lyrics submitted by christian.
