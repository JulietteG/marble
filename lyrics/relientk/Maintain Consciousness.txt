Our concentration
it contains a deadly flaw
Our conversations
change from words to
Blah, blah, blah
We took prescription drugs
but look how much good that did
Well I think I had a point,
but I just got distracted

Lately it just seems to me
like we've got the letters A.D.D.
branded into our mentality
we simply can't focus
on anything

Because it's
17, 18, 19 routine
and here at 23 it's
the same old me
and that one thing
of the moment
that we all happen to like
will only very temporarily
kinda break the cycle
of the double-edged sword
of being lazy and being bored
we just want more
and more and more
until it's all we can afford

to keep our eyes open
for just one more day
to keep on hoping
that we'll stumble on a way
to keep our minds open
for just one more day
cause it's completely up to us
to maintain consciousness

well no one can possibly
listen to this
more than 4 reps
is just monotonous
we're losing interest
losing interest
losing interest

Because it's
17, 18, 19 routine
and here at 23 it's
the same old me
and that one thing
of the moment
that we all happen to like
will only very temporarily
kinda break the cycle
of the double-edged sword
of being lazy and being bored
we just want more
and more and more
until it's all we can afford

to keep our eyes open
for just one more day  [one more day]
to keep on hoping
that we'll stumble on a way  [on a way]
to keep our minds open
for just one more day
cause it's completely up to us
to maintain consciousness---Lyrics submitted by Canaan.
