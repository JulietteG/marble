Let it all out
Get it all out
Get it out, remove it.

Don't be alone when the world begins to bleed.
Because we're so scared to find out
What this life's all about.
So scared we're gonna lose it.
And knowing all along 
That's exactly what we need.

And today I will trust you with the confidence 
of a man who's never known defeat.
But tomorrow upon hearing what I did
I will stare at you in disbelief.
Oh inconsistently.

Crying out for consistency.

Chorus:
And you said I know that this will hurt
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse.
And if the burden seems too much to bear
Remember, the end will justify the pain it took to get us there.

And I'll let it be known,
Times i have shown
Signs of all my weakness.
But somewhere in me there is strength.

And you promised me
That you believed
In time I will defeat this.
Somewhere in me, 
There is strength.

And today i will trust you with the confidence 
of a man who's never known defeat.
And try my best to just forget 
That that man isn't me.

Chorus:
And you said I know that this will hurt
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse.
And if the burden seems too much to bear
Remember, the end will justify the pain it took to get us there.

you said I know that this will hurt
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse.
when the burden seems too much to bear
Remember, the end will justify the pain it took to get us there.

Reach out to me.
Make my heart brand new.
Every beat will be for you.
For you.

And you know, you know
you touched my life.
When you touched my heavy heart,
and made it light.---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
