Ive given up on giving up slowly, Im blending in so 
You wont even know me apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention is my one last shot at redemption 
because I know to live you must give your life away
And Ive been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
Ive been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
And Ive been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, theres no way in knowing where to go, promise Im going because
I gotta get outta here 
Im stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here 
And Im begging You, Im begging You, Im begging You to be my escape.

Im giving up on doing this alone now
Cause Ive failed and Im ready to be shown how
Hes told me the way and Im trying to get there
And this life sentence that Im serving
I admit that Im every bit deserving 
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

Cause Ive been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
Ive been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
And Ive been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, theres no way in knowing where to go, promise Im going because
I gotta get outta here 
Cause Im afraid that this complacency is something I cant shake
I gotta get outta here 
And Im begging You, Im begging You, Im begging You to be my escape.

I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self detained and forced to live in this mess Ive made
And all Im asking is for You to do what You can with me
But I cant ask You to give what You already gave 

Cause Ive been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
Ive been locked inside that house all the while you hold the key
And Ive been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, theres no way in knowing where to go, promise Im going because
Ive gotta get outta here 
Im stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
Ive gotta get outta here 
And Im begging You, Im begging You, Im begging 
You to be my escape.

I fought You for so long
I should have let You in
Oh how we regret those things we do
And all I was trying to do was save my own skin
But so were You

So were You---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
