I've given up. I'm giving up slowly.
I'm blending in
so you won't even know me
apart from this whole world
that shares my fate.

This one last bullet
you mention is my one last shot
at redemption,
because I know to live
you must give your life away

And I've been housing
all this doubt and insecurity,
and I've been locked
that house all the while you
hold the key.

And I've been dying to get out and
that might be the death of me
And even though, theres no way of
knowing where to go

Promise I'm going because
I gotta get out here
I'm stuck inside this rut
that i fell into by mistake
I gotta get out here
I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to
be my escape

I'm giving up, I'm
doing this alone now
Cause I've failed
And I'm ready to be
shown how

You showed me the way
now I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence
that I'm serving
I admit that I'm
every bit deserving, but
the beauty of grace
is that it makes life not fair

Cause I've been housing
all this doubt and insecurity
and I've been locked
that house all the while you
hold the key

And I've been dying to get out and
that might be the death of me
And even though, theres no way of
knowing where to go

Promise I'm going because
I gotta get out here
Cause I'm afraid that
this complacency
is something I can't shake. Yeah, 
I gotta get out here, and 
I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to
be my escape

I am a hostage
to my own humanity
Self detained and forced
to live in this mess of me.

And all I'm asking if for you
to do what you can with me
But I can't ask you to
give what you already gave

Cause I've been housing
all this doubt and insecurity
and I've been locked inside
that house all the while you
hold the key

And I've been dying to get out and
that might be the death of me
And even though, there's no way of
knowing where to go

Promise I'm going because
I gotta get out here
I'm stuck inside this rut
that i fell into by mistake
I gotta get out here, and
I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to
be my escape

I fought you for so long
I should have let you win
Oh, how we regret those
things we do
And all I was trying to do
was save my own skin,
but so were you
So were you.---Lyrics submitted by robin.
