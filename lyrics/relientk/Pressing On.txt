Music.....
VS 1:      I think were going somewhere.
Were on to something good here.
Out of mind, out of state,
Trying to keep my head on straight.
I think were going somewhere,
were on to something good here,
There's only one thing left to do,
drop all i had and go with you.
Some where back there I left my worries all behind!
My problems fell out of the back my mind,
were going and I'm never knowing,
never knowing, where were going,
to go back to where i was would just be wrong!
Music.....
Chorus: I'm Pressing on! Pressing on!
All my distress is going going gone!
Pressing on pressing on!
And i, won't sit back,
and take this anymore,
cuz I'm done with that!
Ive got once foot out the door,
and to go back to where i was would just be wrong!
Im Pressing on!
Music....
Vs 2: I think were going somewhere.
Were on to something good here.
Out of mind, out of state,
Trying to keep my head on straight.
I think were going somewhere,
were on to something good here,
Adversity, we'll get around it,
search for joy in you i've found it!
Some where back there I left my worries all behind!
My problems fell out of the back my mind,
were going and i'm never knowing,
never knowing, where were going,
to go back to where i was would just be wrong!

Chorus: Im Pressing on! Pressing on!
All my distress is going going gone!
Pressing on pressing on!
And i, won't sit back,
and take this anymore,
cuz im done with that!
Ive got one foot out the door,
and to go back to where i was would just be wrong!
Im Pressing on!

Music....

Vs 3:  And to go back to where i was would just be wrong,
I'm Pressing oooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnn,
On Pressing On all my distress is going going gone,
Pressing on Pressing on!
And i, won't sit back and take this anymore,
cuz I'm, done with that!
Ive got one foot out the door
and to go back to where i was would just be wrong!
I'm Pressing on.....

Vs 4:
You look down on me, but you
don't look down on me at all.
You smile and laugh, and i feel the love you have for me.
I think we're going somewhere.
And we're on to something good here.
we're gonna make it after all. (fades away)---Lyrics submitted by Jeff.
