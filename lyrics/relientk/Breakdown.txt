Oh what a lousy excuse for a car
One mile to go but i can't push it that far
I think i've had enough
I think i'm giving up

Saved all my money to buy a new guitar
Then i got ripped off by the guy who fixed my car
I think i've had enough
I think i'm giving up

Once again life's thrown me a curve and it blew up right in my face
Once again life's rattled my nerves
Don't you see what i'm stuck in the place?

All because you're giving me a ...breakdown

break oh oh breakdow breakdown oh oh breakdown breakdown 
oh oh breakdown breakdown oh oh breakdown breakdown 
oh oh breakdown breakdown oh oh breakdown breakdown 
oh oh breakdown breadown

Stuck on the side of the road
Emotional over-load
He'll seek and destroy everything that i enjoy
But i won't be the one he takes down
No i won't breakdown---Lyrics submitted by courtney.
