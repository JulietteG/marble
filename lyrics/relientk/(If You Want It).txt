I can't keep a straight face and say this is not the end
Not if you want it its upon us and I wanna say it's sinking in
If I was hasty maybe I was rushed along
I won't move into little boxes and then
not get the itch to move on

So think real slow
don't forget that yes is yes and no is no
Melting prints of grass and snow
Means I may forget the way to get back home
Cause this is the end if you want it
This is the end

You're not the first thing in my life I've loved and lost
Yeah I've thought worse things that
I might be less inclined to merely
just shrug off

You'll take me home
Like my family did my father did I know
you'll think real slow
But don't forget the speed that I can go away
Cause this is the end if you want it
Yeah this is the end

I've been convincing myself that I'm worthwhile
Cause I'm worth what I'll convince myself to be

I met the devil and I stared her in the eyes
Her hair had scales like silver serpents
I a statue, stood there mesmerized

I took the fire escape and made it out alive
Yeah I still burn from time to time but I've
a healing hand against my side

Blisters on my feet I crawled back home
Frozen from the sleet burned sand and stones
Nourished back to life by life alone
With one shake of the mane regain the throne---Lyrics submitted by Salina.
