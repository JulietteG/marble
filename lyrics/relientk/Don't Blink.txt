Don't know where to go from here
My thoughts are tangled, twisted fears
Been waitin' a while now on the dawn
Seems like the sun may never come

I made my way through the darkest night
To the break of day on the other side
For some time the light's been creepin' in
Now I'm feelin' like I could trust again

You're the only person who reminds me
Love is beautiful and true
Life is beautiful and new
You're the only person who reminds me

Hold on now don't you blink or it's gone
I've been terrified of life for way too long
Oh no now don't you blink or it's gone
In another life who knows what we'd become?

Love is beautiful and true
Life is beautiful and new

Been making plans and drawing maps
I plan to take the righteous path
And hope and pray it leads me back
To all the happiness I had

Been making lists and crossing off
Every kiss that wasn't love
And every word that stretched the truth
Like when she said she loved me

You're the only person who reminds me

Hold on now don't you blink or it's gone
I've been terrified of life for way too long
Oh no now don't you blink or it's gone
In another life who knows what we'd become?

Hold on now don't you blink or it's gone
Hold on now don't you blink or it's gone
In another life who knows what we'd become?

Love is beautiful and true
Life is beautiful and new

Been making lists and crossing off
Every kiss that wasn't love
And every word that stretched the truth
Like when she said she loved me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
