The way that girl can break a heart
Its like a work of art
And this is the worst part
She knows it

And shes so confident
That shes what everybody wants
But nobody wants 
Her to know that

So fall back on all of your premonitions
And just learn to listen
To those that have more wisdom than you
And just stop 
Putting so much stock
In all of this stuff
Live your life for those you love

And Im still waiting for
You to be the one Im waiting for

The way that girl can turn a head
Well she is such a threat
But dont ever forget
She knows it

And shes got it all
All figured out
And she wont let you doubt
She knows it 

Im still waiting for 
You to be the one Im waiting for

Something tells me that this is going to make sense
Something tells me its going to take patience
Something tells me that this will all work out in the end---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
