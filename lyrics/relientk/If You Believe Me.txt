I got a chill 
And I wanted to say it was you 
Be still because what I'm about to say is the truth 
Unless we stretch until the point of nearly breaking in two 
We'll never find our weakness coming unglued

A cracked sculpture 
I wanted to say it was you 
Feeding vultures are why I feel the way I do 
I fell in love 
And I wanted to say it was you 
I wanted to say it was you

If you believe me 
We could stand the test of time like no one else 
If you believe me 
It means you'd have to disbelieve yourself

A sudden wind 
And I wanted to say it was you I've never been 
So confused about who knows the truth 
Where to begin 
Well I wanted to say it was you 
Because you swore you had your hand in this too

Cause I'm here wondering what could you be thinking 
Though I know you're there thinking that I wonder that all the time 
I can still invade your thoughts when you're not with me 
Yeah don't mind me I'm just a parasite on your mind 
Yeah don't mind me I know you're wondering all the time---Lyrics submitted by Kat.
