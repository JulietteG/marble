When he was seeing her 
You could see he had his doubts.
And now he's missing her 
Because he knows he's missing out.
And now its haunting him
His memory's like a ghost.
And he's so terrified cause 
No one else even comes close.

He's the guy that you should feel sorry for,
He had the world but he thought that he wanted more.
I owe it all to the mistake he made back then,
I owe it all to my girls ex-boyfriend.

So then along comes me, 
this undeserving mess. (undeserving mess)
Who would believe 
my life would be so blessed?
Two years ago when you left all the debris (left all that debris)
Who would have know 
He would leave everything I need.

He's the guy that you should feel sorry for 
He had the world but he thought that he wanted more.
I owe it all to the mistake he made back then
I owe it all to my girls ex-boyfriend.

if it wasn't for him
i would still be searching
if it wasn't for him 
i wouldn't know my bestfriend
if it wasn't for him
you would be able to see
that if it wasn't for him 
he'd be as happy as me

when she and i settled down you can bet
that he is gona have to settle for less
he's someone i would hate to be
i got the girl and he's left with just the memories

he's the guy that you should feel sorry for
he had the world but he thought that he wanted more 
i owe it all to the mistake he made back then
i owe it all to my girls ex-boyfriend

if it wasn't for him
i would still be searching
if it wasn't for him
i wouldn't know my bestfriend
if it wasn't for him 
you would be able to see 
that if it wasn't for him
he'd be as happy as me---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
