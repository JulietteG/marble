Let's talk about the way things were let's talk about the way things should be
Think I'm certin but I'm not so sure if I'll deliver what's expected of me
Let's make believe we're all o.k. or better yet pretend
We're doing better than we've ever been I think it's safe to say that we've forgotten
What our regrets were

Cause that's exactly what a catastrophe is
Ignoring warnings thinking kids will be kids will be
A delusion kept at a distance
I think it's strange to have to fight resistance
Gonna get it right for the first time, gonna get it right, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right for the first time, unmask ourselves and we'll find
We're nothing, we're nothing without you
(3X) We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without you

I've given up on acting like I'm perfect I advise you all to do the same
Perfection's rare so the last time I checked we've all been introduced to feeling ashamed 
Let's talk about the things were let's talk about the way things should be
I think I'm certin but I'm not so sure If I'll turn my back
As soon as God lets me

Cause that's exactly what a catastrophe is
Ignoring warnings thinking kids will be kids will be
A delusion kept at a distance
I think it's strange to have to fight resistance
Gonna get it right for the first time, gonna get it right, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right for the first time, cause when we try it alone then we find
We're nothing, we're nothing without you
(3X) We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without you

(And it's been brought to my attention, that nothing's really worth a mention)
(When me and You subtract the latter, equals nothing really matters)

You make me sure in the midst of heartbreak and turbulance 
That my spirit soars only because it's Yours 

We're nothing, we're nothing without you
(3X) We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without you

(And it's been brought to my attention, that nothing's really worth a mention)
(When me and you subtract the latter, equals nothing really matters)---Lyrics submitted by Luke.
