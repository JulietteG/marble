Hey, I try to run away
But everywhere I turn, I turn around
And you're right back in my face
And everything you say
I can't get away from you
I just can't escape

Cause you're at my favorite bar
Your hoodie's in my car
The smell of your Chanel 5 won't die hard
Yeah I don't stand a chance
You're hanging with my friends
When I see you again that's when it starts

We break just like it ain't no thing
But we ridin' on a boomerang
Our love is like a rubber band
Snap back, snap back
Here we go again

Snap back, snap back
Here we go again
Snap back, snap back
Here we go again

Hey, already on the way
End up at your place when I should be driving home
Girl what was I thinking
Girl what was I drinking
Trying to tell myself that it can't be wrong

You were at my favorite bar
Your hoodie's in my car
The smell of your Chanel 5 won't die hard
Yeah I don't stand a chance
You're hanging with my friends
When I see you again that's when it starts

We break just like it ain't no thing
But we ridin' on a boomerang
Our love is like a rubber band
Snap back, snap back
Here we go again

Snap back, snap back
Here we go again
Snap back, snap back
Here we go again

We break just like it ain't no thing
But we ridin' on a boomerang
Our love is like a rubber band
Snap back, snap back
Here we go again
