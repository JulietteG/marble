Verse 1
Am I at the point of no improvement?
What of the death I still dwell in?
I try to excel, but I feel no movement.
Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?

Chorus:
Never underestimate my Jesus.
You're telling me there's no hope.
I'm telling you your wrong.
never underestimate my Jesus
When the world around you crumbles
He will be strong, He will be strong

Verse 2:
I throw up my hands    "Oh, the impossibilities"
Frustrated and tired Where do I go from here?
Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly
Overcoming these obstacles   is overcoming my fear

Chorus:
Never underestimate my Jesus.
You're telling me there's no hope.
I'm telling you your wrong.
Never underestimate my Jesus
When the world around you crumbles
He will be strong, He will be strong

Bridge:
I think I can't, I think I can't
But I think you can, I think you can
I think I can't, I think I can't
But I think you can, I think you can
Gather my insufficiencies and
place them in your hands, place them in your hands, place them in your hands

Chorus:
Never underestimate my Jesus.
You're telling me there's no hope.
I'm telling you your wrong.
Never underestimate my Jesus
When the world around you crumbles
He will be strong, He will be strong
(repeat x2)

he will be strong (repeat x3)---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
