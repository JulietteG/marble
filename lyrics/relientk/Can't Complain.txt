Looking at the cop in the rear view mirror
Probably should have stopped but the crosswalk was clear
I'll just imagine it's a ticket to a Broadway show

Looking at the clouds and they seem kinda funny
Probably gonna rain but my outlook is sunny
I'll just imagine that I'm laying out in Mexico

Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain
And I know that things won't always go my way
And I know that life is gonna suck some days

But I can't complain
I can't complain
Every days too short to let it go to waste

Now I can't complain
I can't complain
You gotta treat every day like a holiday

And I'm telling you
That I know some days I'm gonna stumble
And I know the cookie's gonna crumble
And I know that life is gonna suck some days
But I can't complain

Waiting on a never ending train at the crossing
Paying it no mind cause you just keep talking
We'll just imagine it's the good old days and take it slow

Spending Christmas Eve on the floor of the airport
Dying to get back to the people that I care for
Smiling just dreaming about my puppy in my bed back home

Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain
And I know that things won't always go my way
And I know that life is gonna suck some days

But I can't complain
I can't complain
Every days too short to let it go to waste

Now I can't complain
I can't complain
You gotta treat every day like a holiday

And I'm telling you
That I know some days I'm gonna stumble
And I know the cookie's gonna crumble
And I know that life is gonna suck some days

If you can't say nothing good
Don't say nothing
If you stop to think you could come up with something
That makes you feel so good when times are rough it's ok

I can't complain
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Don't let it go to waste

Now I can't complain
I can't complain
Every days too short to let it go to waste

Now I can't complain
I can't complain
You gotta treat every day like a holiday

And I'm telling you
That I know some days I'm gonna stumble
And I know the cookie's gonna crumble
And I know that life is gonna suck some days
But I can't complain---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
