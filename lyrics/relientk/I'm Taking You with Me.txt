I made a habit
Of never making promises
That arent easy to keep
And there you have it
But now I make you one that is
To keep you here with me 
'Cuz ever second that goes by
I feel its just a waste of time
If I'm not with you

If home is wher the heart is, 
Then my home is where you are
But its getting on so hard 
To spend these days without my heart
So im taking you with me.
Anywhere that I 
Could ever want to be
For the rest of my life
I want you there with me 
And if there ever comes a time
When I should have to leave
I hope you know that I... 
Im taking you with me 

And so Im trying
To hold it all together and
To make it though the day
When Im just dying
To drop it all and take your hand
So we can run away
From all the miles and the hours 
You seem to nervously devorer
At time that I could be with you

If home is where that heart is
Then my home is where you are
But its getting on so hard
To spend these days without my heart
So Im taking you with me 
Anywhere that I 
Could ever want to be 
For the rest of my life
I want you there with me
And if there ever comes a time 
Where I should have to leave
I hope you know that I...
Im taking you with me

Every second that goes by
Theres on more second off my life
And couldnt be more clear
That I would die without you here
Yeah, every second that goes by
Theres one more second off my life
And it couldnt be more clear
That I would die without you here
Yeah, every second that goes by
Yeah, every second that goes by

So Im taking you with me
Anywhere that I 
Could ever want to be 
For the rest of my life
I want you there with me
And if there ever comes a time
Where I should have to leave 
I hope you know that I... 
Im taking you with me---Lyrics submitted by Shanni.
