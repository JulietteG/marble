I'm falling out of grace with the world
They say i've lost my midas touch
What turned to gold now turns to rust
I'm falling out of line with all the stars
That flood my dreams with their guitars and magazines

Face down this carpet tastes like coffee grounds
Ground into my face now
And every angle's covered with just another...

I'm falling out of style with the current way things are
The things that make conforming hard
I'm falling out of control and you just can't stop me now
I'll fight as long as time allows

Face down this carpet tastes like coffee grounds
Ground into my face now
And every angle's covered with just another (band-aid)
I'm out here way beyond
A shadow of a doubt
And i know i'm never falling out (fallin' out)
 of favor with you 


I'm out here way beyond
A shadow of a doubt
And i know i'm never falling out (falling out, falling out)
of favor with you 

I won't think twice or even three times
About taking a gamble with you
Cause with my life you have been so kind
I take all my comfort from you

Face down this carpet tastes like coffee grounds
Ground into my face now
And every angle's covered with just another (band-aid)

I'm out here way beyond
A shadow of a doubt
And i know i'm never falling out (fallin' out) of favor with you

I'm out here way beyond
A shadow of a doubt
And i know i'm never falling out (falling out, falling out) of favor with you---Lyrics submitted by mallory.
