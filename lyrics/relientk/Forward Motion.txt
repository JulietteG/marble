Whoa- oh!
I be banging my head against the wall
And for so long it seems I knocked it down
Yeah it got knocked down

Whoa- oh!
And the heating bill went through the roof
Whoa-oh!
And the wall i knocked down was the proof
That my landlord needed to kick me out

I got evicted now I'm living on the street
My spirits lifted... oh wait that wasn't me
Too many turns have turned out to be wrong
This time I learned that I knew it all along

When car crashes occur 
Then I'll be what you were 
When I see what I should
When I see that it's good (that it's good)

To experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat 
Then brush my teeth
Experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush my teeth

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
I struggle with forward motion 
We all struggle with forward motion
'Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
Well everytime I gain some ground 
I gotta turn myself around again
It's harder than it sounds
Well everytime I gain some ground
I gotta turn myself around again

Whoa- oh!
I've been banging my head against the wall
Whoa- oh!
For so long it seems I got knocked out
Yeah, I got knocked out cold
Whoa- oh!
And the medical bills went through the roof
Whoa- oh!
And the scar on my head is the proof
That I'll still remember this when I get old

I got evicted and now I'm living on the street
My spirits lifted... oh wait that wasn't me
Too many turns have turned out to be wrong
This time I learned that I knew it all along

When I grasp the concept
Then I'll sleep where you slept
When I know I need help
When I allow myself (allow myself)

To experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush your teeth
Experience the bittersweet
To taste defeat
Then brush your teeth

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion

'Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
Well everytime I gain some ground
I gotta turn myself around again
It's harder than it sounds
Well everytime I gain some ground
I gotta turn myself around again

'Cause I struggle with forward motion 
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion

('Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
Well everytime I gain some ground 
I gotta turn myself around again
'Cause forward motion is harder than it sounds
Well everytime I gain some ground
I gotta turn myself around again)

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion

'Cause I struggle with forward motion
'Cause I struggle with forward motion
We all struggle with forward motion---Lyrics submitted by Bonny.
