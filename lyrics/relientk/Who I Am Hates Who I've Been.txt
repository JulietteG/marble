I watched the proverbial sunrise 
Coming up over the Pacifican
And you might think I'm losing my mind 
But I will shy away from the specifics 

Cause I don't want you to know where I am 
Cause then you'll see my heart 
In the saddest state it's ever been 
This is no place to try and live my life 

Stop right there!
That's exactly where I lost it 
See that line?
Well, I never should've crossed it 
Stop right there!
Well, I never should've said that 
It's the very moment that I wish that I could take back 

I'm sorry for the person I became 
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change 
I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again 
Cause who I am hates who I've been 
Who I am hates who I've been 

I talked to absolutely no one 
Couldn't keep to myself enough 
And the things bottled inside 
Had finally begun to create so much pressure 
That I'd soon blow up
And I heard the reverberating footsteps 
Syncing up to the beating of my heart 
And I was positive that unless
I got myself together 
I would watch me fall apart
And I can't let that happen again 
Cause then you'll see my heart 
In the saddest state it's ever been 
This is no place to try and live my life 

Stop right there 
That's exactly where I lost it 
See that line?
I never should've crossed it 
Stop right there 
I never should've said that 
It's the very moment that I wish that I could take back 

Stop right there!
That's exactly where I lost it 
See that line?
Well, I never should've crossed it 
Stop right there!
Well, I never should've said that 
It's the very moment that I wish that I could take back 

I'm sorry for (Sorry for) the person I became
I'm sorry that (Sorry that) it took so long for me to change 
I'm ready to (Ready to) be sure I never become that way again 
Cause who I am hates who I've been 
Who I am hates who I've been 

Who I am hates who I've been 
And who I am will take the second chance you gave me 
Who I am hates who I've been 
Cause who I've been only ever made me 

So sorry for (Sorry for) the person I became 
So sorry that (Sorry that) it took so long for me to change 
I'm ready to (Ready to) be sure I never become that way again 
Cause who I am hates who I've been 
Who I am hates who I've been---Lyrics submitted by rene.
