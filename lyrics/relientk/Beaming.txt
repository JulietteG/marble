Everyone was beaming
Everyone
Everywhere

And Scottie did lots of the work.
And I said 
"Beam me, up Scottie. 
And can I get a cup of coffee
And the internet it,
still doesn't work."

I said wo-o-o-oahh
you know we're beaming.
I said wo-o-o-oahh
you know we're beaming.
I said wo-o-o-oahh
you know we're beaming.---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
