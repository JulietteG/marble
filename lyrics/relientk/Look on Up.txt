I remember when a photograph was worth a thousand words
A thousand words
Now a thousand pictures come my way, every day
And I like them all the same, but they can't take my breath away
I'm fighting the temptation not to look
But I'm still leafing through the pages like the world's my open book
Why don't I got something else to do?
Feeling trapped behind the viewfinder to share it all with you

And that's not what it's about
I'm so tired of missing out

I look on up to the sky
I wonder why I put a filter between beauty and my eyes
I look on up into your eyes
It's time I put down my devices and I start to live my life

I look on up, I look on up
To the sky

Have you ever tried to photograph the moon?
Well I have too, I have too
Find it funny how it never turns out right
It's like someone poked a pinhole in the canvas of the night

And that's not what it's about
I'm so tired of missing out

I look on up to the sky
I wonder why I put a filter between beauty and my eyes
I look on up into your eyes
It's time I put down my devices and I start to live my life

I look on up, I look on up

'Cause it's a Nick Drake Pink Moon seeing the pines
In the Pacific North West for the first time
I cannot believe my eyes
Yeah, I'm singing out loud in the middle of the night
On a balcony in Brisbane looking up into the sky
Into the sky
It's time I put down my devices and I start to live my life

I look on up to the sky
I wonder why I put a filter between beauty and my eyes
I look on up into your eyes
It's time I put down my devices and I start to live my life

I look on up to the sky
I wonder why I put a filter between beauty and my eyes
I look on up into your eyes
It's time I put down my devices and I start to live my life

I look on up, I look on up
To the sky

Have you ever tried to photograph the moon?
Well I have too, I have too---
