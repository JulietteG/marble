I made it through the year and I did not even collapse 
Gotta say thank God for that 
I'm torn between what keeps me whole and what tears me in half 
I'll fall apart or stay intact 
Tired eyes I stumble back to bed
I need to realize my sorry life's not hanging by a thread 
At least not yet 

So look at me now 
It's finally Christmas and I'm home 
Head indoors to get out of this weather 
And I don't know how but the closest friends I've ever known are all inside 
Singing together
Singing, "Merry Christmas, here's to many more"

Always hurt to be all by myself this time of year 
A cold and lonely Christmas Eve 
And living out my days alone, well, that had been my deepest fear 
But you promised you won't leave 

I look towards the east and see a star 
Jesus Christ has blessed my life to know just who you are 
You are my hope 

So look at me now
It's finally Christmas and I'm home 
Head indoors to get out of this weather 
And I don't know how but the closest friends I've ever known are all inside 
Singing together 
Singing, "Merry Christmas, here's to many more" 

Deck the halls with mistletoe 
May all your heavy burdens go up the chimney in a cloud of smoke 
The fire's burning bright 
Strike up the band and play the tune 
Cause Christmas we'll be hear and soon 
Hear our song in every room this merry Christmas night 

Singing, "Merry Christmas, here's to many more"---Lyrics submitted by Luke.
