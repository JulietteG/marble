I go to another place when I draw that smile on your face
And it takes me on a daydream vacation
I close my eyes and smile
Shot in space a thousand miles
That takes me on a daydream vacation
Everybodys standing
Youre standing in the back row watching someone else go
Everybodys watching
You gotta come down now
Gotta come along now

I go to another place when I draw that smile on your face
And it takes me on a daydream vacation
I held my breath and sighed as I sailed into the sky
And it takes me on a daydream vacation
Everybodys standing
Youre standing in the back row watching someone else go
Everybodys watching
You gotta come down now
Gotta come along now 

Will you see?
Maybe someday
Maybe someday youll go take a chance
Take a chance

Everybodys standing
Youre standing in the back row watching someone else go
Everybodys watching
You gotta come down now
Gotta come along now
Everyone is waiting
Theyre still picking daisies
Youre still picking daisies
Everybodys standing
Your standing in the back row by yourself
You know why---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
