[Chorus:]

I look her dead in the eye, I care for you
Without this I cant survive, I care for you
As long as I am alive, I care for you
I care for you, I care for you 
It should come as no surprise, I care for you
Your directing my life, I care for you
Protect you till the day I die, I care for you
I care for you, I care for you 

[Verse 1:]
Destiny, this one is for you 
Feels our love just must be true
Even though I never did,
You made me feel like I always knew what to do
With us its like, god made one from two
If anybody ever fucks with you or tries touching you 
He better leave the crib or wherever it is he feels comfortable 
My destiny, my every breath, my ecstasy
You plan every step for me, whats next for me 
My good health couldve been lapasy
When Im wishing you listen when I talk 
You give me whatever that I want 
Trucks and cars, you made a star out of a kid on the side walk 
Now whenever that I walk 
Wherever I go, I could be comfortable at any time
I own homes in five zones
I got you so, I know for a fact that Ill never die alone
It will be the path that you took 
It will be the outcome that god chose 
A million nights, I never sleep none
Go ahead girl you could run as fast as you want
I could keep up, your all I got 
My dreams, my goals
Nobody could take you from me 
Ill never let you go 

[Chorus:]

I look her dead in the eye, I care for you
Without this I cant survive, I care for you
As long as I am alive, I care for you
I care for you, I care for you 
It should come as no surprise, I care for you
Your directing my life, I care for you
Protect you till the day I die, I care for you
I care for you, I care for you 

[Verse 2:]

When I was young, I aint had a good life
All I had was you, day dreaming about 
What you grow up to look like
Look at us now, made it through the ups and downs
When I pulled left you pushed right
The way you started, I never could have figured 
That you wouldve been the good type
You went from ugly to gorgeous
I used to deny you, t was denial 
You turned you back on me 
Youre the reason that I went through papas trial 
You was there when they put him in prison 
You was there when I visit
There when the tears was blurring my vision
It was your decision, I lost trust for you
It was all up to you, I cant believe that you did this 
Depression is starting to tempt me 
Are you with me, against me, what is it
You told me that I was a lien 
You told me my heart was strong 
From boy to a man, man to a giant 
There was your plan all along 
Destiny, youre whats best for me
My air, my breath I breathe
When Im gone, your whats left of me
My name, my legacy, shh 
Youre all I got, my dreams, my goals
Nobody could take you from me 
Ill never let you go.

[Chorus 2x:]

I look her dead in the eye, I care for you
Without this I cant survive, I care for you
As long as I am alive, I care for you
I care for you, I care for you 
It should come as no surprise, I care for you
Your directing my life, I care for you
Protect you till the day I die, I care for you
I care for you, I care for you---Lyrics submitted by Ranoosh.
