[Intro:]
Gangstas rule the world still.
Yeah.
And y'all was mad before this.
Kurupt and Belly bitch.

[Hook: x2]
They ask me why I do it,
cause I fuckin can.
Ask about me bitch,
I'm the fuckin man.
Ask about me homie,
I'm the fuckin man.
All around the world,
I'm the fuckin man.

[Verse 1:]
They ask me why I do it, cause I fuckin can.
Spend a hundred grand if I snapped a rubber band.
I turn a couple dollars to a couple grand.
I can stand on the beach, post up and hustle sand.
The hatas can hate, long as hustlers love.
I went from rags to riches, getting something from crumbs.
Now you son of a bitches can meet this son of a gun.
Every couple of months I just double my funds.
Dudes talk and they speak or keep bumpin there guns.
Don't get carried away, they could be dumber then dumb.
Girls come and they go, with me they come and they come.
And they come and they come, and they come and they come.

[Hook: x2]
They ask me why I do it,
cause I fuckin can.
Ask about me bitch,
I'm the fuckin man.
Ask about me homie,
I'm the fuckin man.
All around the world,
I'm the fuckin man.

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
she said I fuck the best, cause I'm the fuckin man.
I got them D's on my shit just because I fuckin can.
I'm the man homie, fifty grand homie.
A liquor store posted, fifty grand on me.
Nigga move slow, or slowly get moved.
Chisel and chipped run throu your hood on Dubs servin.
Swervin like look it here cous.
This is our spot, officially today.
Unless you want the message, you should officially walk away.
I'm sinister, prime minister, doc oc.
A menace motherfucker, for the weed and the gwap
Respect it, shootin at the cops.
While I pop, bang up.
You don't walk hard no more, I'm in the land.
I'm everything you ain't, that's what I am.
I got movie star hoes all across the land.
Brazilian from chili, Palestine and Japan.

[Hook: x2]
They ask me why I do it,
cause I fuckin can.
Ask about me bitch,
I'm the fuckin man.
Ask about me homie,
I'm the fuckin man.
All around the world,
I'm the fuckin man.

[Verse 3:]
They ask me why I do it, I don't even try.
They just hatin on me because they couldn't be this fly.
Is it the life I lead, that's the reason why.
There's a 65' (Impala), I don't need a key to drive.
The reaction I get, when I'm passin your set.
Is like a roller coaster ride my passenger gets.
I'm flyer then fly, I'm flashy and fresh.
Drivin something that look like I wrote NASA a check.
You remain in the struggle, but you claim that you hustle.
Only knots you ever had was pains in your muscle.
I came from the rubble, a lot of danger and trouble.
I'm back to play baby, while the games in a huddle.
So keep the change baby, headed straight out the funnel.
I make it rain baby, you can bathe in a puddle.
I'm a hold you down, six summers down.
I ain't the government but I'm the fuckin man.

[Hook: x2]
They ask me why I do it,
cause I fuckin can.
Ask about me bitch,
I'm the fuckin man.
Ask about me homie,
I'm the fuckin man.
All around the world,
I'm the fuckin man.

Cheers, I'm the fuckin man.
You motherfuckers, I'm the fuckin man.
Bitches, I'm the fuckin man.
All motherfuckers, I'm the fuckin man.
Bitches, I'm the fuckin man.
You motherfuckers, I'm the fuckin man.
You bitches, I'm the fuckin man.
You motherfuckers, I'm the fuckin man.
YEAH!

But I'm the fuckin man.
Got my dick in my hand bitch, I'm the fuckin man.
I never gave a fuck, you don't know about Kurupt.
I thought I told you hoe, now hoe you gotta go.
You know why hoe?
Cause I'm the fuckin man.
And all you niggas look, I'm the fuckin man.
I'm a gangsta dp, I'm the fuckin man.
I never gave a fuck, I'm the fuckin man.
You know me, o.g.---Lyrics submitted by Ranoosh.
