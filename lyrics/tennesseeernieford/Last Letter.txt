Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend?
What have I done that has made you so different and cold?
Sometimes I wonder if youll be contented again,
Will you be happy when you are withered and old?
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine.
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves.
But if you say that you long to forever be mine,
Think of the heartaches, the teas, and the sorrows you save,
When you are lonely and tired of another mans gold,
When you are weary, remember this letter my own.
Dont try to answer though I suffer anguish untold,
If you dont love me, I with you would leave me alone.
While I am writing this letter, I think of the past,
And of the promises that you are breaking so free.
But to this world I will soon say my farewell at last.
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me.---Lyrics submitted by Donna Fridley.
