I want a full time job making love to you
I'll do anything you want me too.
But if you have no plan to use a full time man
a part time job will do.
I want a life time job being close to you
making all my dreams come true.
But if your heart don't throb about a full time job
a part time job will do.
You wouldn't have to pay me
a nickle or a dime.
As long as you will let me
get in a little bit of over time.
I want a full time job holding hands with you
I think you kind of like it too.
But if your heart don't throb about a full time job 
a part time job will do.
You wouldn't have to pay me
a nickle or a dime.
As long as you will let me
get in a little bit of over time.
I want a full time job holding hands with you
I think you kind of like it too.
But if your heart don't throb about a full time job 
a part time job will do.---Lyrics submitted by T J Autry.
