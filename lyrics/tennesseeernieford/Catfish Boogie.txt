Woke up this morning 'bout half past four,
Who'd i see tiptoeing across my floor,
My everlovin' baby with a rod in her hand,
Headin' for the creek called catfish land,
She yelled at me and said get up son,
Come along with me and let's have some fun,
I grabbed my britches and a long cane pole,
Headed for the red hot catfish hole.

Catfish boogie do it baby with me.

We arrived posthaste on the bank of the creek,
Don't make no noise don't even speak,
She threaded a worm right on that hook,
And dropped it in the water in a shady nook,
The bobber jumped when Mr. Whiskers hit,
My gal flipped and throwed a fit,
She pulled and tugged and yelled what's wrong,
I said baby he's a biggun that cat's real gone.

Catfish boogie do it baby with me.

We fished for awhile caught a great big mess,
A long string of blue cat happiness,
She smiled at me and her eyes did roll,
We walked along the creek me and my miss,
She gave me a hug and a great big kiss,
She held me close and said i love you,
I said i got all of this and fishing too.

Catfish boogie do it baby with me.---Lyrics submitted by Jud.
