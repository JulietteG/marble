Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurtin' people like me
people like me
People like me
People like me,e
people like me

Is it fair to say that I am stressing out
I am stationed in iraq and they won't let me out
My homie said I was stupid for even jonin'
my consolence said my decesion was disappointin'
How she had good stakes for good state colleges
And wit my good grades it wouldn't a been a problemificance
more than brilliance and certainly more than div
but they don't understand just the power of signidence
And if you ask me know, would I repeat it
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in?
Well the answer is, its not me where the cancer is
They been doin' this before the Jesus of Nazereth,
And after all this time, its still deadly hazardous,
And Bush that in real ain't being all that inaccurate
When he says we winning the war cuz its staggerin'
becuase that's cuz we killin' everyone we say
And most of us soilders so we can barly fall asleep
And time and time again im feeling incompetent
Cuz my women back we constantly arguin'
And i must be crazy cuz all im obsessin with is her myspace face book and whos competent,
God if she's cheating im doing her ass in
i can tell with on look it came to me like a songbird
(sayin')
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurtin' people like me
people like me
People like me,e
People like me
people like me

meet sara the proud mother of young sebastian
Suburban professinal went to college in Ashlyn
In self-pitty she suddenly cried, would my life be important if i suddenly died
Neighbors saying what a nice women she was
keeping mostly to herself since ever since the divorce
And with the company desizing and the fall and all
She really should take it that personal at all
It wasn't her boss who had his eyes on her thighs and got a rise from her risin off the desk though.
And despite remembering saying no plenty a times it was still a damn surprise being let go
And now being stuck with a mortgage she can't afford
And to educated to blame the corporrate world
She got on welfare and hated it
Case work a power trippin'
And generally being degrated if
Nothing else she was playing sick
and ineffective, which was the worst thing she been left with
Damn. no magic from david blane no pain, no paintin' this dangerous game
No Morgan Freeman to narrate the shame,
So she took refuge and prayer, kinda like finding God in an phone book
And it came to her soundin' somethin' like a song hook
(sayin)
Heaven, is there a chance that you come down
And open doors to hurtin' people like me
people like me
People like me,e
People like me
people like me

I guess I told you bout myself to some degree
Just by telling you about people like me
But people like me they speak polietly and don't start no beef for a piece of white meat
Everybody gotta eat, but everybody doesn't
Which is why I wanna tell you bout my favorite cousin
He and I grew up, where the sunshines
And we both partook, in the gun crimes
And we both liked American rap rhymes
Eventhough we didn't understand one line
If you remember my line and notes in my last album,
I talked about a close call, with a gernade
I think we both must a been bout 7th grade
But dont panic, we both survived without damage
But we developed a bond like we survived the Titanic,
So when the country became frantic, my mother tried to get us out
planned it to the last minute, but the plan got de-railed cuz there wasn't enough money for plane tickets
How bitter when my mother had to choose who to take wit her
So my cousin got left in the war, and that's just hard to record
but now I take refuge and prayer,
Kinda like finding God in a phone book,
it cam to me sounding something like a song hook,

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurtin' people like me
people like me
People like me,e
People like me
people like me

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurtin' 
people like me
people like me
People like me,e
People like me
people like me---Lyrics submitted by jelli.
