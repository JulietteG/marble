basically i got beef i want to talk to you directly 
i cant ignore i cant escape as cause you effect me
you criple me you shackle me you shot at my own children in front of me 
this energy is killing me i got to let pour like blood soobax
chorus: 
meelky way dictalagala soobax meekyway batele gala soobax meekyway goutela gala soobax degala soobax degala soobax milkyway dictalagala soobax meekyway batele gala soobax meekiway pourtelegalas soobax


so for real whos to blame we loose lies over the mills name 
disregard for the soul we just dont give a fuck no more
left alone all alone settle your issues on your own what to do where to go
i gota be a refugee damn soobax
chorus
morgadisho used to be a place where the world would come to see 
jeseeda sugum to leada predeglay eo madinay argasa puisaso bardede eos perpara
my skin needs to feel the sand and the sun im tired of the cold god damned soobax
chorus
i guess i could use the last part of flow known as the lyrical ryme domino
