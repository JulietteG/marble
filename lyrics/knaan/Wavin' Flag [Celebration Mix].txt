Oh oh oh oh...

Give me Freedom, Give me fire
Give me reason, Take me higher
See the champions, Take the field now
You define us, make us feel proud

In the streets, our hands are lifting
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, its around us
Every nation, all around us

Singing forever young, 
Singing songs underneath the sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day

We all say
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back , and then it goes ...

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back , and then it goes ...

Oh oh oh oh oh... 

Give You Freedom, Give you fire
give you reason, take you higher
See the champions, Take the field now
You define us, make us feel proud

In the streets, our hands are lifting
As we lose our inhibition
Celebration, its around us
Every nation, all around us

Singing forever young, 
Singing songs underneath the sun
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game
And together at the end of the day

We all say
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back , and then it goes ...

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back , and then it goes ...

Oh oh oh oh oh... 

We all say
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back , and then it goes ...

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back , and then it goes ...

Oh Oh...

And everybody will be singing it ....

Oh oh oh...

And we all will be singing it ...---Lyrics submitted by Patty.
