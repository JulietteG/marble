Picture the morning, taste and devour
we rise early, pace up the hour
streets is bustling hustling they harder
you cant have the sweet with no sour
spices herbs and sweet scent of flower
she came out precisely the hour
clouds disappeared, and sun shows the power
no chance of a probable shower
i fell in love with my neighbor's daughter
i wanted to protect and support her
nevermind im just twelve and a quarter
i had dreams beyond our recorder

*Chorus*
is it true all they say you need is just love?
is it true?
what about those who have loved
only to find that its taken away?
and why do they say that the children have rights to be free? (to be free)
what about those who have known
whose memory still lives inside of me?
Fatima 
what did the young man say
before he stole you away?
on that faithful day (oh fatima)
fatima
did he know your name
or the plans we made
to go to new york city? (oh fatima)
*Chorus*

and after school we study the lessons
i asked god to slow down the seconds
he does the opposite
thats what im guessing
i'd better chill and count my own blessings
fatima fatima what is the matter
how come you ain't come up the ladder
so we can be like there's no tomorrow
damn you gonna make me wait till tomorrow

she spoke arabic and soowahlie
she's say offend on unto hav eelie 
you so bright you shine like my tv
then one day she never came to meet me

*Chorus*

if beauty was in the eyes of beholder
how come everyone hushed when she walked by
how come girls would look just to scold her
how come the angel wanted to hold her

Fatima Fatima
Im in America
I make rhymes and I make them delicate
you would've like the parks in Connecticut
you would've said im working too hard again
damn you shooter, damn you the building
whose walls his the blood she was spilling
damn you country whose so good at killing
damn you feeling for persevering

is it true all they say you need is just love?
is it true?
what about those who have loved
only to find that its taken away?
and why do they say that the children have rights to be free? (to be free)
what about those who have known
whose memory still lives inside of me?
Fatima 
what did the gun man say?
before he took you away
on that faithful day? (oh fatima)
fatima
did he know your name
or the plans we made
to go to new york city? (oh fatima)
(2x)

(Fatima)
Now i just want to make it clear
I dont want you to shed a tear
Cause this here (Fatima)
is a celebration
were not mourning
we celebrating 
(Fatima)
so baby dont cry
please dont let the tears fall
please dont cry---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
