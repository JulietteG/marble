I believe the children are our future teach them well and let them lead the way show them all the beauty they poses inside give them a sense of pride to make it easier let the childrens laughter remind us how we use to be everybody searching for a hero people need someone to look up to I never found anyone to fulfill my needs a lonely place to be and so I learn to depend on me I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow if I fail if I succeed at least I live as I believe no matter what they take from me the can't take away my dignity because the greatest love of all is happening to me I found the greatest love of all inside of me---Lyrics submitted by david.
