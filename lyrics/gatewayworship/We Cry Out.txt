I
FATHER of Life 
sited on your Throne of Grace
it's only by Your Mercy we are save

LORD you've said;if we call upon your name
We and our Family's will be save!

Chorus:

So we cry out your name
Elshaddai, GOD of Grace
Lord most high,JESUS CHRIST.

We rely on your Grace
Adonai,Crowned and Praise
Lord most High, JESUS CHRIST.

II

FATHER of Love, 
never failing to forgive
each moment is gift from you to live.

We're on here 
To tell the world about your Grace 
 Until the day you take us all away.

Refrain

We will cry out your name
 Elshaddai, GOD of Grace
Lord most high,JESUS CHRIST.

We rely on your Grace
Adonai,Crowned and Praise
Lord most High, JESUS CHRIST.
