VERSE 1
Who is this King of glory
Beautiful and matchless one
Who is this King so holy
Every knee will bow at His throne

PRE-CHORUS
Jesus, the Lamb of God
Savior and King

CHORUS
You alone are worthy of our praise forever
You alone are seated on the throne of Heaven
Glorify, glorify, You alone

VERSE 2
Who is this King of mercy
Wonderful and full of grace
Who is this King so worthy
Nations fear and kingdoms praise

VERSE 3
You are the King that saves us
Powerful and full of love
You are the King that gave us
Life with every drop of Your blood---Lyrics submitted by Marimil Malto.
