This alabaster jar
Is all i have of worth
I break it at your feet, lord
It's less than you deserve

You're far more beautiful
More precious than the oil
The sum of my desires
And the fullness of my joy!

Prechorus:

Like you spilled your blood,
I spill my heart as an offering
To my king

Chorus:

Here i am, take me
As an offering
Here i am, giving every heartbeat
For your glory take me

The time that i have left
Is all i have of worth
I lay it at your feet, lord
It's less than you deserve

And though i've little strength
And though my days are few,
You gave your life for me
So, i will live my life for you

Worthy, worthy
You are worthy
Worthy is the lord (repeat as desired) (sing simultaenous with chorus)---Lyrics submitted by edmar.
