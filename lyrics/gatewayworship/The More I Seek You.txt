Verse:
The more I seek You,
the more I find You.
The more I find You,
The more I love You.

Chorus:
I want to sit at Your feet;
drink from the cup in Your hand.
Lean back against You and breathe,
feel Your heartbeat.

This love is so deep,
it's more than I can stand.
I melt in Your peace,
it's overwhelming.

Repeat verse and chorus 3x.---Lyrics submitted by Kristey.
