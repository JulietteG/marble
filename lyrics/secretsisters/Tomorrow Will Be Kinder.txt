Black clouds are behind me
I now can see ahead
Often I wonder why I try
Hoping for an end

Sorrow weighs my shoulders down
And trouble haunts my mind
But I know the present will not last
And tomorrow will be kinder

Tomorrow will be kinder
Its true, Ive seen it before
A brighter day is coming my way
Yes, tomorrow will be kinder

Today Ive cried a many tear
And pain is in my heart
Around me lies a somber scene
I dont know where to start

But I feel warmth on my skin
The stars have aligned
The wind has blown but now I know
That tomorrow will be kinder

Tomorrow will be kinder
I know Ive seen it before
A brighter day is coming my way
Yes, tomorrow will be kinder

A brighter day is coming my way
Yes, tomorrow will be kinder---
