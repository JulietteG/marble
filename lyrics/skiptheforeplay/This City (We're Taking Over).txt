[Tyler Hoare]: Aww yeah! Looks like we're going to have to join forces on this one!
[Alexandre Erian]: Yeah we gotta take this to a new level!
[Jonathan Cabana]: Let's fucking do this...
[Marc-Andr Fillion]: NOW! COME ON!
We're rounding up the forces to destroy the masses and take this city back...
[Jonathan Cabana]: Forever!
Let's burn this fucking city down.
I wanna kill the king and take his motherfucking crown.
This kingdom is now mine, this is our fucking time.
Prepare yourself for ARMAGEDON!
This is a new sound of DESTRUCTION!

[Marc-Andr Fillion]: This is history in the making.
This city is ours for the taking.
Hold it down.
You know we gotta hold it down.

[Alexandre Erian]: We're taking over.
Say goodbye to your lover.
Your ass is mine, baby you're so fine.
Bitches be catching feelings.
Our beats be raising ceilings.
This city is ours.

[Tyler Hoare]: I'm on fire and Imma set you ablaze.
You want the best, you got the blessed and imma up your plays.
I got this city in the palm of my hand.
From north shore to south side...
[Marc-Andr Fillion]: We're creating a foot clan.
[Tyler Hoare]: I'm here to set the stage,
I'm here to start the rage.
And when your heart goes boom,
Wigga I'm to blame.

[Marc-Andr Fillion]: This is history in the making.
This city is ours for the taking.
Hold it down.
You know we gotta hold it down.

Okay! This is the next level.
Top of the food chain.
You know we're so paid.
You know we're so paid.

You wanna hold it down.
I'll hold it down with you.
Rock the club till the early morning.
Make it hurt and show no mercy.

Prepare yourself!
Prepare yourself!
Prepare yourself for Armageddon!

This is the new sound!
This is our town!
Hold it down!
Hold it down!

Yeah,
We did exactly what we said we were gonna do.
(Skip The Foreplay)
Yo Alex,
