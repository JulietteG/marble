I've been waiting for something to happen
For a week or a month or a year
With the blood in the ink of the headlines
And the sound of the crowd in my ear

You might ask what it takes to remember
When you know that you have seen it before
Where a government lies to a people
And a country is drifting to war

There's a shadow on the faces
Of the men who send the guns
To the wars that are fought in places
Where their business interest runs

On the radio, talk shows and the TV
You hear one thing again and again
How the USA stands for freedom
And we come to the aid of friend

But who are the ones that we call our friends
These governments killing their own
Or the people who finally can't take anymore
And they pick up a  gun, or a brick, or a stone

And there are lives in the balance
There are people under fire
There are children under cannons
And there is blood on the wire

And there's a shadow on the faces
Of the men who fan the flames
Of the wars that are fought in places
We can't even say the names

They sell us the President the same way
They sell us our clothes and our cars
They sell us everything from youth to religion
At the same time they sell us our wars

I wanna know who the men in the shadows are
I wanna hear somebody asking them why
They can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are
But they're never the ones to fight or to die

And there are lives in the balance
There are people under fire
There are children under cannons
And there is blood on the wire
