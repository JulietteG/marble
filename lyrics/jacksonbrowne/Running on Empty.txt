Looking out at the road rushin' under my wheel
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In sixty-five I was seventeen and I'd run it up one to one
I don't know where I'm runnin' now I'm just runnin' on

Runnin' on, runnin' on empty
Runnin' on, runnin' blind 
Runnin' on, runnin' into sun but I'm running behind

You gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Try not to confuse with what you do to survive
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned to the road I'm on

Runnin' on, runnin' on empty
Runnin' on, runnin' blind 
Runnin' on, runnin' into sun but I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me

If it takes all night, that'll be alright
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushin' under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels

Look around for friends that I used to turn to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them runnin' too

Runnin' on, runnin' on empty
Runnin' on, runnin' blind 
Runnin' on, runnin' into sun but I'm runnin' behind

Honey you really tempt me, you know the way you look so fine
I'd love to stick around but I'm runnin' behind, 

Runnin' on,  you know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
Runnin' blind, runnin' into sun but I'm running behind---Lyrics submitted by William.
