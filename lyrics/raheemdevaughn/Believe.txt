Believe In Me (Believe in me)
Oooh believe in me (Believe in me)
Oooooh Oooooh  (Believe In me)
Try to believe oooooh

With affection like a dreamer
With patience and understanding
Like a teacher with a student
Vice versa, I promise 
Not to hurt ya, not to leave
Not to lie , not to cheat
Not to fuss, not to stress
Like the rest in your past (Ooooh)

Believe it, I ain't like most men (Noooo)
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past
Just have some faith, that's all I ask, believe in me (Ooh hoo ooh)

Believe it, I ain't like most men (No baby)
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past
Girl all I ask (All I ask) just have some faith (Have some faith)
Believe in me (Believe in me) believe in me

Why go searchin' elsewhere lurkin'
When you been hurtin' for the real thing
And since I'm here (Here) before your eyes (Oh)
Let's make love til sunrise, I'll be something like a rebirth of love
With a twist, let's start it (Right here, right now)
A simple kiss,  what could be more precious than the rebirth of love

Believe it, I ain't like most men (Rebirth of love)
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past 
Just have some faith, that's all I ask, believe in me (Ooh hoo ooh) 

Believe it, I ain't like most men (Baby)
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past 
I'm just askin you, to have some faith, believe in me

Believe in me
Believe in me, just try...try
Believe in me
believe in me, believe in me

Believe it, I ain't like most men (I plan to do you right)
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past 
Just have some faith, that's all I ask, believe in me
(I'm not perfect, but i'll try, when times get harder, i'll get harder, go hard, be stronger for you baby)
Believe it, I ain't like most men 
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past 
All I ask, (All I ask) have some faith (Is that you believe in me, believe in me)

Believe it, I ain't like most men (I ain't like most men)
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past 
Just have some faith, that's all I ask, believe in me 

Believe it I ain't like most men 
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in your past 
All I ask, have some faith, believe in me 

I got another way I want to tell you

Lately I been thinking
About this crazy world
Being one step away from war
So tonight baby, I want to make love to you
Like the world is coming to an end
And if we should die tonight, In the next life
I'm gonna love you the same
Nothin ain't gonna change---Lyrics submitted by GREG.
