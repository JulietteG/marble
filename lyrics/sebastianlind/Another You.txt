I don't care, what you choose
I'm just bringing the offer to you
You can have, all you see
You can go on adventures with me

What you think, is what you get
but if you open your mind instead
you could have, something more
Something you did not have in your thoughts 

Crazy fool, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
Crazy fool, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you

There's always another you (uuh)
There's always another you (uuuh)
There's always another you (uuh)
There's always another you

I don't care, what you do
This decision is all up to you
Yeah you're cool
Yeah you're fine
but there's a long way from that to sublime

And I don't care, what you choose
I'm just bringing the offer to you
And I don't care, if you say no
I aren't going cry over you if you go

Crazy fool, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
Crazy fool, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you

There's always another you (uuh)
There's always another you (uuuh)
There's always another you (uuh)
There's always another you

Crazy fool, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
Crazy fool, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you

There's always another you (uuh)
There's always another you (uuuh)
There's always another you (uuh)
There's always another you---Lyrics submitted by Julie Kofoed.
