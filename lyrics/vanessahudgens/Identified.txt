I know what you're tryin' to do
Know what you're tryin' to say
You're giving me the eye
Then pushin' me away

It's like your playin' games
Like your the only one,
We're both one and the same, so think about it
All your friends keep telling me
There's only one ambition on your mind
You keep on denyin' it 
But all the proof I need is in your eyes

[Chorus]
You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But'cha identified, you play my heart cuz you're smart
Put up a front but I see what's inside
Got'cha identified, you play my heart cuz you're smart

You keep askin' how I am
And watchin' what I do
You're waitin' for the chance
Come on and tell the truth
it's more than obvious, the way you cover up
So tell me why the fuss, just come on over

All your friends are telling me
there's only one ambition on your mi (repeat 10x) 
You keep on denyin' it
But all the proof I need is in your eyes (It's in your eyes)

[Chorus 2x]

I got a confession, I got, I got a confession (repeat 7x)
I got a confession, I can see through what'cha doin'
Had it right from the beginning, got'cha identified
Come on over to me
Tell me now before you lose me
It's no secret you persue me
Got'cha id-ent-i-fied (techno on 'identified)

[Chorus 2x]---Lyrics submitted by Dolly.
