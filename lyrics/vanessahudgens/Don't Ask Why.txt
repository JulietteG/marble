I remember the day I first met you
You really caught my attention
Didn't know I was lookin for a rescue
I wasn't thinking that hard
Now and Then I was there in the moment
I was ready for nothin
That doesn't mean that I really didn't love you while I'm breaking your heart

[Chorus]
Don't ask why before we get too close just let me 
Say good bye it's easier this way
Don't ask why before you ask the question and
I die inside just let me walk away

I feel bad that I let my past hurt you cos' I really didn't mean to
I was lost I was lucky you found me but it only got worse
Right now while you're looking right at me, the emotions so scary
Doesn't mean that I really don't love when I'm making you hurt

[Chorus]

And though I want this more than ever
I wish there was another way
You see my words can only hurt you
Until this shadow fades away

[Chorus X2]---Lyrics submitted by Marisa.
