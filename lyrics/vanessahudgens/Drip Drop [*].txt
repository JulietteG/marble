Drip drop, Drip drop... 

Now only heaven knows 
How I really feel inside 
I try my best not to let it show 
But late at night, In my room 
I think of you and start to cry 

You know that I'm emotional 
But still you break my heart 
Let's make no mistakes 

We both know that 
You're the one responsible 
For hurting me this way 
Now my tears fall like rain 

Drip drop 
When will my tear drops stop 
Falling for you? Don't know what to do 
Tick tock 
Steady as a clock, Drip drop 
I'm hoping someday soon 
I'll be over you - Drip drop 
When will my tear drops stop 
Falling for you? Don't know what to do 
Tick tock 
Steady as a clock, Drip drop 
I'm hoping someday soon 
I'll be over you 

It's a quater after twelve 
I know I should be in bed 
Boy you got me feeling sorry for myself 
I must confess, this loneliness is killing me 
I'm so upset 

How could you break all your promises 
Like you told me, You'd be there to hold me 
I can not believe the way I fell for it 
I was a fool to buy all the lies you sold me 

Drip drop 
When will my tear drops stop 
Falling for you? Don't know what to do 
Tick tock 
Steady as a clock, Drip drop 
I'm hoping someday soon 
I'll be over you - Drip drop 
When will my tear drops stop 
Falling for you? Don't know what to do 
Tick tock 
Steady as a clock, Drip drop 
I'm hoping someday soon 
I'll be over you 

Maybe we were never meant to be 
I'm sorry that it took so long for me 
To see what's happening 
You come around and then it rains again 

Drip drop... 

when will they stop 

Drip drop 
When will my tear drops stop 
Falling for you? Don't know what to do 
Tick tock 
Steady as a clock, Drip drop 
I'm hoping someday soon 
I'll be over you - Drip drop 
When will my tear drops stop 
Falling for you? Don't know what to do 
Tick tock 
Steady as a clock, Drip drop 
I'm hoping someday soon 
I'll be over you 

It's raining, It's pouring 
I try hard ignoring these tears 
I try so hard, Ignoring the tears 
It's raining, It's pouring 
I try hard ignoring these tears---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
