[Chorus]
If I should your love boy, shame on me
I was just too stubborn to blind too see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
(Don't wanna lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Lose your love)

I remember the moment I first looked in your eyes
And seen nothin' lookin' back at me
It was then I realized, that even though
You were there your heart was long gone
And I knew right then how lost I'd be
Before you moved on

[Chorus]

Before it's final, before you close
I'm asking please, can we try this once more
Just hold me tight, don't ever let go
And if it never comes around, I want you to know

I want you 
I need you 
can't lose you tonight
No, no

I won't do nothing to lose you
I won't lose this fight
I'm gonna make it right, yeah
(Right) Right
