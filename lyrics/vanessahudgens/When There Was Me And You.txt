It's funny when you find yourself looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want is to be over there
Why did I let myself believe that miracles could happen
Cause now I have to pretend that I don't really care

I thought you were my fairytale my dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star that's coming true
But everyone else can tell that I confused my feelings
With the truth when there was me and you

I swore I knew the melody that I heard you singing
And when you smiled you made me feel like I can sing along
But then you went and change the words now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's and once a upon a song

Now I know your not a fairytale and dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes upon a star just don't come true
Cause even now I can tell that I confused my feelings with the truth
Because I liked the view when there was me and you

I can't belive that I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And i didn't mind

Because I like the view (Ooooh hoo hoo)
I thought you felt it too
When there was me and you---Lyrics submitted by Alaina Gonzales.
