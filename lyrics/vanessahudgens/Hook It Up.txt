(Chattering) 
Girl, whats up? 

Rock Mafia, ok 
Rock Mafia, ok 

Everybody likes a fiesta 
Everbody wants to have fun 
Bring a couple of friends and Ill betcha 
They'll be hookin' up with someone 

Cause Im tired of all the boys 
Who dont like to dance 
And if you dont like to dance 
You dont stand a chance 

So why you standing in the corner 
With your arms all folded 
When you know that she's ready to dance 
Right up on ya' 

You got the money, money 
She's got the hottie body 
We wanna party, party 
Hook it all up (hook it up) 
You pick the song theyre playing 
She waits anticipating 
All the while the DJ saying 
Hook it on up (hook it up) 

Hook it up, baby 
Hook it up 

If you think you can just stand around youre dreaming 
Its gonna take a little bit more 
To have a chance with me is a good reason 
To mix it up out on the dance floor 

So, hell no, we dont dance 
'Less we dont stand a chance 
Then we pull up our pants 
And hit the dance floor, baby, so 

If you want a chance, better 
Get up and dance 'less ya 
Cant really dance in that case 
Stay at home, playas only 

You got the money, money 
She's got the hottie body 
We wanna party, party 
Hook it all up (hook it up) 
You pick the song theyre playing 
She waits anticipating 
All the while the DJ saying 
Hook it on up (hook it up) 

Beat is dropping... 
Theres no stopping... 
What could happen here tonight 

I'll Hook you up with my friends 
Ill hook you up with her friend 
No ones gonna feel alone tonight 

You got the money, money 
She's got the hottie body (hook it up) 
We wanna party, party (hook it up) 
Hook it all up (hook it up) 
You pick the song theyre playing 
She waits anticipating 
All the while the DJ saying 
Hook it on up (hook it up) 

You got the money, money 
Shes got the hottie body (hook it up) 
We wanna party, party (hook it up) 
Hook it all up (hook it up) 
You pick the song theyre playing 
She waits anticipating 
All the while the DJ saying 
Hook it on up 

Santa Ana Hook it up (Beat is droppin) 
Montana Hook it up (There's no stoppin) 
Hits Ville hook it up (What could happen..) 
Louisville hook it up (..here tonight) 
Bakers ville hook it up (Ill hook you up with my friends) 
Victor ville hook it up (Ill hook you up with her friend) 
South cali hook it up (No one's gonna feel..) 
Sanford Valley hook it up (..alone tonight)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
