Oh, oh, oh, yeah

It takes a girl to understand
Just how to win, she knows she can
I think it's fair who wears the pants
What boy could stand a chance?

She makes it look easy (Ohh)
In control completely
She'll get the best of you every single time
Thought by now, you realize you should...

[Chorus]
Never underestimate a girl
Gets anything she wants
She's never gonna stop
(you know it, we know it)
Never underestimate a girl
She's always got a plan
The world is in her hands

She's got the lipstick, puts it together
Boys have it good, but girls got it better (watch out!)
Your secretary might end up your boss
Whether you really like it (haha) or not

She makes it look easy (Ohh)
In control completely
She'll get the best of you every single time (that's right)
No, no, no, no, no, no you should...

[Chorus}

She might be president
Make all the rules
Don't try to win the game
You're only gonna lose
Now girls you know we got it
Got it goin' on
We've been tryin' to tell them all along
Listen up guys, take a little sound advice, uh

That's right
Hey, come on now
Oh, oh, oh that's right

No, no, you should...

[Chorus 2x]---Lyrics submitted by Dolly.
