Like a shooting star, you're headed for me
You've touched my heart, but I won't set it free
Oh boy, you've got to be patient with me
Oh boy, I wanna get to know you much better

Let's start it out being friends for a while
You caught my eye when I first saw you smile
Oh boy, this could really turn into something
Oh boy, that's why I don't wanna rush it

[Chorus]
Don't talk, don't tell your friends about us
Don't talk, or this all will end, I promise
(Be quiet, be quiet, or I will just deny it) 
Be quiet, don't talk (Shh) keep it between us

I'm going out with a bunch of my friends
You can meet up with us a quarter to ten
Oh boy, don't act like there's something between us
Oh boy, for now let's keep it a secret

[Chorus]

I know we feel that this is real
But I need some time to see
If you're gonna be the one for me
For now, let's just keep it hush
Keep it between us

[Bridge]
This is the real reason
I don't really care
Cause people like to talk
And people like to stare
It's one thing to guess 
And it's one thing to know
So when it comes to us
Baby, keep you're mouth closed

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Dolly.
