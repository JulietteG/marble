I thought I had control 
But I slipped, and I dont, and I dont know where to go 
I thought I knew it all 
But all I do is think about the next time I see you 
I thought I had control 
But we kissed, and I slipped and I dont know where to go 
All I really know; 
Its getting too emotional 

When you came to me 
Yeah, I thought youd be like every other guy that Id ever met 
Wed hang for a while then Id soon forget you 
But this is something new 
I was not prepared to wonder where you are when youre not with me 
This feels so crazy 

I thought I had control 
But I slipped, and I dont, and I dont know where to go 
I thought I knew it all (knew it all) 
But all I do is think about the next time I see you 
I thought I had control 
But we kissed, and I slipped and I dont know where to go 
All I really know; 
Its getting too emotional 

Its a strange feeling 
To care about someone, I guess I never really did til I met you, boy 
How was I to know how you would affect me? 
They say I talk too much 
I talk too much about you 
The definition of being out of control and I dont wanna feel this anymore 

I thought I had control (I think) 
But I slipped, and I dont, and I dont know where to go 
I thought I knew it all (knew it all) 
But all I do is think about the next time I see you 
I thought I had control 
But we kissed (kissed), and I slipped (slipped) and I dont know where to go 
All I really know; 
Its getting too emotional 

I get this feelin inside my heart when 
You come around, and when were apart then 
I feel so torn up inside 
Ive gotta get control of my life 

I thought I had control (I think) 
But I slipped, and I dont, and I dont know where to go 
I thought I knew it all (knew it all) 
But all I do is think about the next time I see you 
I thought I had control 
But we kissed (kissed), and I slipped (slipped) and I dont know where to go 
All I really know; 
Its getting too emotional
