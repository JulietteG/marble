Turn it off turn it on 
Like the vibrate on your phone 
Call me up wanna talk 
Then you freeze me 
It's the same when you're gone 
Keep me guessin' what you want 
But my heart says it's you who can please me 

I get pushed to extremes
And I should know what it means 
But I can't get bear the game to be over 
When your moods never change 
Only got myself to blame 
Cause I fall for it over and over 

[Chorus]
You're like my first bad habit 
I can't live without it 
I can't give you up, give you up 
And even though you're trouble 
I come back for double 
I can't say enough is enough 
I'm a part of you, you're a part of me 
And I know it's wrong but I can't get free 
You're like my first bad habit 
How am I gonna give you up 

You're the worst, you're the best 
Something different from the rest 
It's a fact seeing you's never easy 
Love my style hate my friends 
No the conflict never ends 
How much worse can it get when you tease me 

And I know [repeat  4x]
The way we go around 
Can't put my first bad habit down 
And I know [repeat 4 x]
The way we go around 
I just can't give you up 

[Chorus] 

Turn it off turn it on
Off, off on, on 
Keep me guessin' what you want 
Guessin', guessin' what you want
[repeat 2x] 

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Dolly.
