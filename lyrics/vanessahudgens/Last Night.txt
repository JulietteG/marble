All I want is to be a part of your weekend 
All I need is a little bit of your time 
Baby, Im your girl and I need some attention 
When you ignore me I just lose my mind 
I ain't gon' bug 'bout you going out last night 
No, baby I know that I'm the only one in your sight 

[Chorus]
But please don't tell me nothin' 
I don't wanna know what you did last night 
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time 
I don't wanna know if it's all real or lie, yeah
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there 
I dont wanna know about the other girls there 
I Just wanna know when youre around youre mine 

Na na na na na na

Na na na na na na 


I dont think that Im being obsessive 
I dont think that Im being out of line 
You got your space and I get to be selfish 
You get yours baby, and I get mine 
Im doing just fine as long as we see eye to eye (you with me?) 
No, no, aint nothing wrong with going out and having a good time 

[Chorus]
But I dont wanna know nothin 
I don't wanna know what you did last night 
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time 
I don't wanna know if it's all real or lie, yeah
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there 
I dont wanna know about the other girls there 
I just wanna know when youre around youre mine 

At home I picture you, out meetin' someone new 
Baby, got my mind goin' wild [mind goin' wild]
I know your love is true, but whats a girl to do 
All I need is a sign (just give me a sign) 
Cuz I get jealous, oh baby I get jealous 
Oh so jealous, dont mess me up with whatever is down 

I don't wanna know what you did last night (oh I know I dont know) 
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time (I dont wanna hear about it) 
I don't wanna know if it's all real or lie (whooo) 
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there (dont wanna feel it) 
I dont wanna know about the other girls there (don't wanna know about) 
I Just wanna know when youre around youre mine 
[repeat 2x]
