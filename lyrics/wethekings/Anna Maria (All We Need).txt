You can win 
My hands are tied 
Giving in 
I know you can't see 
But trust me 
Believe 

Cause were on the beach 
Side by side 
There's sand in our toes 
Tonight 
The moonlight 
The waves 
Chasing our feet 

Take me down 

My heart beats faster when I'm with you 
'Cause I know that you would want me to 
I swear to hell I'll never leave 
Cause I know one thing 
Love is all we need 

Let's live tonight 
Like our last 
We'll streak through the town 
Living fast 
'Cause naked, we came 
So naked, we leave 

And we saw the world 
Dying down 
So we lived it up 
Stole the crown 
And now that we are free 
Let's get out 
And breathe 

Take me down 

My heart beats faster when I'm with you 
'Cause I know that you would want me to 
I swear to hell I'll never leave 
Cause I know one thing 
Love is all we need 

Are you ready 
We'll do this together 
We'll make this forever 
I know you don't want me to go 
I could see 
You were waiting for me 
You got love in your eyes 
Now it's time 
To lose all our control 

Cause were on the beach 
Side by side 
There's sand in our toes 
We're alive 
Feel the weight of your kiss 
Crashing down 
On my lips 

x2 
My heart beats faster when I'm with you 
'Cause I know that you would want me to 
I swear to hell I'll never leave 
Cause I know one thing 
Love is all we need 

Love is all we need 
Love is all we need---Lyrics submitted by weaam.
