And I always knew
We would end like this
Trading lick with blood
Bittersweet over lips
Said we fell in love with the way it hurts
In the dripping last, slipping no but hurts

I can't help myself
For the way I feel
Touch the plastic skin
But it feels so real
My big grasp skin fried
And the break up done
With the meaning of love
Nothing much but song

And we got close
We could almost touch
And we got close
We can feel the rush
And we got close only

We are we are the rise and fallen
We are we are the fire and water
Head on my heart
I'll always want it all completely

We are we are the all or nothing
We are we are the bend and broken
Whatever we are I'll always want it all completely

She let me dance with the devil ones
And we tried and we tried but we couldn't come clean
See my angel my angel with dirty wings

Yeah well still she tripped in an empty street
We were laugh we were laugh while the city sleeps
What the chemichals, poured to our drinks
Yeah we're one with with the world
Yeah we're one with the bricks

And we got close
We could almost touch
And we got close
We could feel the rush
And we got close only

We are we are the rise and fallen
We are we are the fire and water
Head on my heart
I'll always want it all completely

We are we are the all or nothing
We are we are the bend and broken
Whatever we are I'll always want it all completely

Ooo oh
Completely

And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
We would end like this

We are we are the rise and fallen
We are we are the fire and water
Head on my heart
I'll always want it all completely

We are we are the all or nothing
We are we are the bend and broken
Whatever we are I'll always want it all completely

And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew (completely)
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew
And I al, and I al
And I always knew (completely)---
