Check yes Juliet
are you with me?
rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside
check yes Juliet
kill the limbo
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
there's no turning back for us tonight

lace up your shoes
A O A O ah
here's how we do

run baby run
don't ever look back
they'll tear us apart 
if you give them the chance
don't sell your heart
don't say we're not meant to be
run baby run
forever will be 
you and me

check yes Juliet
I'll be waiting
wishing, wanting
yours for the taking
just sneak out 
and don't tell a soul goodbye
check yes Juliet
here's the countdown
3...2...1... now fall in my arms 
now they can change the locks
don't let them change your mind

lace up your shoes
A O A O ah
here's how we do

run baby run
don't ever look back
they'll tear us apart 
if you give them the chance
don't sell your heart
don't say we're not meant to be
run baby run
forever will be 
you and me

we're flying through the night
we're flying through the night
way up high, 
the view from here is getting better with
you by my side

run baby run
don't ever look back
they'll tear us apart 
if you give them the chance
don't sell your heart
don't say we're not meant to be
run baby run
forever will be... 

run baby run
don't ever look back
they'll tear us apart 
if you give them the chance
don't sell your heart
don't say we're not meant to be
run baby run
forever will be 
you and me
You and me
You and me---Lyrics submitted by Juan.
