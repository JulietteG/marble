I'm missing you in ways I never knew existed
I'm missing you....

maybe you could love me for a while
maybe you could make me smile
or maybe you would break my heart again
well, baby I say, either way, until then.....

I'm missing you.....

maybe you could call me on the phone
and tell me you'll be coming home
or maybe you would break my heart again
well, baby I say, either way, until then.....---Lyrics submitted by bug.
