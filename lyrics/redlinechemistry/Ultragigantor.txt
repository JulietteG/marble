I use to be somebody who could control myself 
But I can't anymore 
I used to have a grip on reality 
But I keep on slipping down 
Now I'm under pressure 
Deny the limitation 
I am my own worst enemy it kills me every time 

Big machine 
I'll take it for a ride 
Get inside and grow this 
crushing sound 
Deny the limitation 
Deny the limitation

It's all a part of the animal in myself 
And I just don't care anymore 
I let it take the shape of duality 
And I feel I'm breaking out 
Now I'm under pressure 
Deny the limitation 
I am my own worst enemy it kills me every time 

Big machine 
I'll take it for a ride 
Get inside and grow this crushing sound 
Big machine 
I'll take it for a ride 
Get inside and grow this crushing sound 

Deny the limitation 
Deny the limitation 

Its all a part of the animal in myself
Its all a part of the animal in me

Now I'm under pressure 
Deny the limitation 
I am my own worst enemy it kills me every time 

Big machine 
I'll take it for a ride 
Get inside and grow this crushing sound 
Big machine 
I'll take it for a ride 
Get inside and grow this crushing sound 

Deny the limitation 
Deny the limitation 

I use to be somebody who could control myself 
But I can't anymore 
I used to have a grip on reality 
But I keep on slipping down---Lyrics submitted by Chato Ziegler.
