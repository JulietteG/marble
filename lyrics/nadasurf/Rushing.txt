I should know
I don't know why
Thought I didn't meet
Another stormy sky

I could have thought
Thought I didn't have rules
For the risk it will take
All I thought I could lose

You come rushing at me
And I forget my body
You come rushing at me
And I forget my body
You come rushing at me
And I forget my worries

(Human raver?)
I watched you go by
I set on a base
Solitary and dry

I replayed
The fills in my life
Thought I'd come to the end
I told myself it was fine

And you - you let me in and
I - I let you in and
We - we are (transporting?) and

You - you let me in and
I - I let you in and
We - are (innovative?)

Finally (I'm going?)

You come rushing at me
And I forget my body
You come rushing at me
And I forget my body
You come rushing at me
And I forget my worries

I haven't landed
Since I don't know when
And now I feel like
I can breathe again
I see the street lights
(Gliding?) on your skin
(Gliding?) on your skin

You come rushing at me
And I forget my body
You come rushing at me
And I forget my body
You come rushing at me
And I forget my worries

I haven't landed
Since I don't know when
And now I feel like
I can breathe again---
