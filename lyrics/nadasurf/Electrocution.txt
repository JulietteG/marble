I wouldn't mind if i could find
a little electrocution.
Sometimes i feel i need it here,
a little electrocution.

The wire's hot, lights are red
a sparkle straight to my heart
i'm still livin' in the dark
i'm still livin' in the dark

I wouldn't mind if i could find
a little electrocution.
My despair flows everywhere
to a little electrocution

Spools of coil across the sky
unraveling out for miles
I've been bangin on diles (not sure about this word)
I've been bangin on diles

I wouldn't mind if i could find
a little electrocution.
I need a jolt some thunderbolts
of a little electrocution

No one loves you like i do
no one loves you like, you know, i do

All there is is beautifull
all ther is needs to die
i've been wandering why
i've been wandering why

I wouldn't mind if i could find
a little electrocution.
i'm down quite beneath the light
of a little electrocution---
