When I see your stripes
They're all I've wanted
You visit me every night
My dreams are haunted
Maybe we live too close
And we need a river between
You can't tell the letter's gold but
You don't seem to shiver

Friends say it will let go
If I give it time
But this oven is burning coal
I got a big supply
I always feel this fool
And believe you're mine
One day, I'll love somebody else
One day, I'll take care of myself

When I'm upside mind
I know I can't have you
But that means that half the time
I only think that it's half true
When you wrote goodbye
You said that was it for you
But you see the thing that you don't get
Is every time you ride it's like you're starting something new

One day, I'll love somebody else
One day, I'll take care of myself

Every time my phone rings
Every time something comes in
I pretend, I believe that it's you
There's something that I have to you
Listen to our hearts, mind says I don't know

Friends say it will let go
If I give it time
But this oven is burning coal
I got a big supply
I always feel this fool
And believe you're mine
One day, I'll love somebody else
One day, I'll be good to myself
Do you know I believe you're mine
Didn't you know? I believe you're mine
Did you not know me?
One day, I'll love somebody else
I was day believer
One day, I'll love somebody else
I was day believer
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
Did you not know me?
I was day believer---
