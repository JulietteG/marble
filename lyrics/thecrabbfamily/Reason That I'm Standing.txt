Verse I
I have stood for the gospel when it seemed I've stood alone
But through the heartache and frustration I kept my focus on the throne
So many times I have recalled the Saviors words so true
If you'll not be ashamed of me I won't be of you
So I'll proudly stand until I see the face of the one who gave everything for me

Chorus
When the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me
Every battle that I've fought will fade from memory
I'll bow before his mighty throne then fall down on my knees
When the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me

Verse II
The road has not been easy at times I lost my way
So often I have stumbled searching for the light of day
Circumstances all around me I thought I'd surely fall
The whispering of doubt and fear told me you will lose it all
But he kept me with his amazing grace
Someday soon I'll have the chance to thank him face to face

Bridge
We will join the millions, every kindred tongue and race
Every child of God that day will look upon his face
With the heroes and the martyrs who died on that pagan sword
We'll all stand together and declare Jesus is Lord---Lyrics submitted by taylor bright.
