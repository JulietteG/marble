Verse 1:

Satan has been raging like never before,
Destruction all around us like a dark fatal storm.
We wonder what will happen before this cloud passes on,
If we dont stand with Jesus, we must stand the test alone.

Chorus:

Who will survive the storm that is raging,
Who will be left when the trial is done?
If the blood of the savior is not the refuge youre under,
Then who will survive the storm?

Verse 2:

The Bible has told us of the days that are coming,
That we must be watchful and not be alarmed.
Our faith will be tested by the winds of confusion,
Who will survive the storm?---Lyrics submitted by Karleigh.
