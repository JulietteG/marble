CHORUS:
Im going home with Jesus in the twinkling of an eye,
Ive made my reservations for a mansion in the sky;
I may not know the moment, or I may not know the day,
But I know that Ill be leaving when He calls His Church away!

Im listning for the trumpet to sound most any time,
And a crown of life thats waiting, thank God will soon be mine!
I got my invitation thru a place called Calvary,
By the precious blood of Jesus, the trips been paid for me.

CHORUS:
Im going home with Jesus in the twinkling of an eye,
Ive made my reservations for a mansion in the sky;
I may not know the moment, or I may not know the day,
But I know that Ill be leaving when He calls His Church away!

The Captain of the vessel is calling get on board,
And the destinations Heaven, safe on that crystal shore;
Where well meet again the Savior and our loved ones who have gone,
There to live for all eternity, oh, yes, were going home!

CHORUS:
Im going home with Jesus in the twinkling of an eye,
Ive made my reservations for a mansion in the sky;
I may not know the moment, or I may not know the day,
But I know that Ill be leaving when He calls His Church away!---Lyrics submitted by ANASTACIA FIU.
