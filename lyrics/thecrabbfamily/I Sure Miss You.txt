Verse I 

If life could only bring again, the days I took for granted when 
To hear your voice was just a call away 
Oh what I'd give for just some time, to say the things that slipped my mind 
There's so much now I'd really like to say 
But I can never go back when we did the things we did back then 
I'll store those precious memories in my mind 
I'll take what you've instilled in me; I'll try to be all I can be 
And walk the path that you have left behind 

Chorus 

I sure miss you; life will never be the same with you not here 
Each passing day has brought much pain 
But with God's grace my strength remains 
I sure miss you, but heaven's sweeter with you there 

Verse II 

The little things that seemed so small are now gold in a memory vault 
I cherish every one I have of you 
Now I can see and recognize the part you played to shape my life 
I often see you in the things I do 
In God's design and master plan He saw the hurting hearts of man 
As we would say goodbye to those so dear 
So with our family and friends we'll be together once again 
We'll view all heaven's splendor hand in hand ---Lyrics submitted by Threthany.
