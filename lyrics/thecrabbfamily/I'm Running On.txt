I've took off the weights, I've laid down the sins
I've made up my mind that I'm gonna win
The shackles have fallen, the chains now are gone
I'm running with Jesus
I'm going on

I'm running on (on with Jesus I'm goin' on)
And when the streets (Turn to gold then I'll know I'm home)
When I started out (Started in faith, and one day you'll see)
This race that I'm runnin will bring victory

That night at the altar, I let Jesus in
I started on this journey, me walking with Him
Well the highway is holy
The road is so straight
Satan you can't stop me now, I'm nearly in the gate

I'm runnin' on (on with Jesus I'm goin' on)
And when the streets (Turn to gold then I'll know I'm home)
When I started out (started in faith, and one day you'll see)
This race that I'm runnin will bring victory
