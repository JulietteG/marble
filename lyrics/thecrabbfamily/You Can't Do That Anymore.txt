Remember when we rode our bikes all day through the neighborhood
As long as we were home by dark everything was good
Sometimes mom would even send us down to the grocery store
You cant do that anymore

Remember when You used to fall fast asleep on those cool summer nights
Every single window in the house was open wide
Come to think about it there were no dead bolts on the door
You cant do that anymore

Chorus:
Started believin this world is a scarry place
Traded some freedom for a little more play it safe
Every line thats crossed somethings lost
We may never find again
One more remember when...

The first time I rode a plane I was 17
I even had an old buck knife in the pocket of my jeans
And Granddad was waiting at the gate when I got off board

Chorus:
Started believin this world is a scarry place
Traded some freedom for a little more play it safe
Every line thats crossed somethings lost
We may never find again
One more remember when...
One more remember when...

Every morning down at school we stood up as a class
Put our hands on our hearts, pledged allegiance to the flag
Then wed all bow our heads and give thanks to the Lord
You cant do that anymore
No You cant do that anymore---Lyrics submitted by jodie turbyfill.
