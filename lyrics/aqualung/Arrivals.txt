(Strings Intro)

Mmmmmmmmm
It has started and can't be stopped
Call the fairy mantle, cast me out
Send me, send me over the ocean to find you

Not the radio, not today
There is nothing left you can say
Just get me, get me over the ocean 
I'll find you

Close your eyes, baby
Close your eyes, sunshine
Wait for one more sunrise then I'm home 
I'm home

Feel the rumbling through the chair
Feel the future hanging in the air
Fly me, fly me over the ocean to see you

And we're hurrying and we wait
Now we're tumbling to the gate
Send me, clear me over the ocean to find you

Close your eyes, mmmm hmmmmm
Mmmmm oooh whoaaaaaa
Close your eyes, baby
Close your eyes, sunshine
Just this one last sunrise and I'm home
I'm home.---Lyrics submitted by Peter.
