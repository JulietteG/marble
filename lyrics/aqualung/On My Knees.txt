All I want is to go back to the beginning
And try to make it new
But it is so hard to find a way to be forgiven
Find the right way back to you

Babe, no don't leave me like this
I must have been crazy, girl, to do what I did

Don't you hear me calling
I'm on my knees
Don't you feel me falling at your feet
All alone in the darkness 
Holding my heart singing ple-e-e-ease
Please hear me calling now
Mmhmmmm

In my heart you'll find a piece of me is missing
And there's nothing I can do
Look in my eyes you'll see I'm barely even living, no
Cause what's living without you?

I've got to tell you baby:
I-I've got so much to say
It cuts me to pieces how you turn me away

Don't you hear me calling
I'm on my knees
Don't you feel me falling at your feet
All alone in the darkness 
Holding my heart singing ple-e-e-ease
Please, oh! 

Babe, we've got so much to say
It cuts me to pieces how you push me away

Don't you hear me calling
I'm on my knees
Don't you feel me falling at your feet
All alone in the darkness 
Holding my heart singing ple-e-e-ease
Please hear me calling now

Na na na na na na na
Don't you feel me falling at your feet
All alone in the darkness
Holding my heart singing ple-e-e-ease
Hear me calling now

Oh baby don't leave me now
I'm calling now I'm on my knees
Hear me calling now I'm on my knees
Don't you hear me now I'm on my knees
Hear me calling now I'm on my knees
Don't you hear me now I'm on my knees
Hear me calling now I'm on my knees
Hear me calling now I'm on my knees
Hear me calling now, Hear me calling now
Mmmhmmm---Lyrics submitted by Peter.
