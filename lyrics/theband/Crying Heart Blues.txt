Crying the blues
I'm crying because I have lost you
Blues I can't lose
I guess it's too late now to try
I've tried to chose another to love but it's no use
Crying heart blues there's nothing that's left but to cry

I'll always remember I love you
My teardrops won't let me forget
Each tear is a wish to be near you
They started the day that we met
A trail of tears will lead you to me if you want me
And from my hopeless my crying heart flees---
