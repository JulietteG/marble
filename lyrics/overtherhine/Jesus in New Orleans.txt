The last time I saw Jesus
I was drinking bloody Marys in the South
In a barroom in New Orleans
Rinsin out the bad taste in my mouth

She wore a dark and faded blazer
With a little of the lining hanging out
When the jukebox played Miss Dorothy Moore
I knew that it was him without a doubt

I said the road is my redeemer
I never know just what on earth Ill find
In the faces of a stranger
In the dark and weary corners of a mind

She said, The last highway is only
As far away as you are from yourself
And no matter just how bad it gets
It does no good to blame somebody else

Aint it crazy
Whats revealed when youre not looking all that close
Aint it crazy
How we put to death the ones we need the most

I know Im not a martyr
Ive never died for anyone but me
The last frontier is only
The stranger in the mirror that I see

But when I least expect it
Here and there I see my saviors face
Hes still my favorite loser
Falling for the entire human race---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
