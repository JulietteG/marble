If you came to make some trouble
Better make it good
Your sexy cocktail hour stubble
Is doing what it should
Looks may be sweet and subtle
I think its trouble honey
I think its good
If you came to make trouble
Make me a double, honey
I think its good

Novices have expectations
Cause they think they should
Experts have their revelations
Like they knew they would
What may seem complicated
Is overstated, downright misunderstood
Love will not be outdated
Maybe placated, but its got to be good

Were so precarious with semantics
I think this could be trouble
I think its trouble honey
I think its good
If you came to make trouble
Make me a double honey
I think its good

What may seem complicated
Is overstated, downright misunderstood
Love will not be outdated
Maybe placated, but its got to be good
Were far too serious
I think we could be
Such nefarious pyromantics---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
