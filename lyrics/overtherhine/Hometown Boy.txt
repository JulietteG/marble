Hey love
What do you say
We get outta here today
You aint found your footing yet
But someday youre going to fly
My hometown boy

Cars up on blocks
The neighbourhoods gone to hell
You wonder if the whole worlds breakin down
But you feel somethin
You feel the need to run
But you dont know why
My hometown boy

No love
No sloe gin back porch nights for you
Weve got work to do
White trash blowin down the street
Just pipe dreams on paper
But starting tomorrow
Weve gotta try
Me and my hometown boy---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
