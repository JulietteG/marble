Hello Ohio
The back roads
I know Ohio
Like the back of my hand
Alone Ohio
Where the river bends
And its strange to see your story end

In my life Ive seen a thousand dreams
Through the threshers all torn to pieces
And the land lay bare
Someone turned a profit there
And a good son lost his life in a strip pit

When the sun went down we would all leave town
And light our fires in Egypt Bottom
And the reservoir was just as good for Joni
Cause we knew we would
Dream out loud in the night air

Holly said, Dont go inside the childrens home
Mary said, Dont leave your man alone
Valerie was singin to the radio
Ohio

It was summertime in 83
We were burnin out at the rubber tree
Wonderin what in the world
Would make all this worthwhile
And if I knew then I was older then
Would I see regret to the last mile

Hello Ohio
The back roads
I know Ohio
Like the back of my hand
Alone Ohio
Where the river bends
And its strange to see your story end
How I hate to see your story end
Its so sad to see your story end---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
