I cried when I wrote this
Ill always remember
The worst kind of lonely
Is alone in December

The act of forgiveness
Is always a mystery
The melting of ice
And the future of history

Some call it obsession
I call it commitment
I make my confession
I make it in public

I hope that its helpful
That others can use it
That its more than my ego
And my need to abuse it

Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
And here it is

The leaves on the oak tree
Hold on through the winter
Theyre brown and their brittle
They clatter together

I cant seem to let go
Im so scared of losing
The deeper the love goes
The deeper the bruising

The trouble with talking
Is it makes you sound clever
The trouble with waiting
Is youll just wait forever

Theres a loop of excuses
That plays in your mind
And makes the truth
Even harder to find

Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
And here it is

When they blow Gabriels horn
Rip fiction from fact
I want to get caught
In some radical act

Of love and redemption
The sound of warm laughter
Some true conversation
With a friend or my lover

Somewhere down the road
Well lift up our glass
And toast the moment
And moments past

The heartbreak and laughter
The joy and the tears
The scary beauty
Of whats right here

Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
Im wrappin up my love this Christmas
And here it is---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
