You were the hand that I tried to take
You're the decision that I could not make
You're the religion that I should forsake

You were the story I tried to tell
You were the savior that tripped and fell
Beautiful dancing infidel

Who will guard the door
When I am sleeping
Who will guard the door
When I am sleeping
I'm not sleeping

You were the season that would
not change
I often was the same
Then four horseman came and stole
my name

I never saw you fall apart
I never saw you work so hard
Never saw you need no one
I am my father's son---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
