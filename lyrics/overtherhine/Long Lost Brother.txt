I thought that wed be
Further along by now
I cant remember how
We stumbled to this place

I loved you like a long lost brother
On a bad day maybe I thought why bother
Ive seldom seen so much anger
In a face

I wanna do better
I wanna try harder
I wanna believe
Down to the letter

Jesus and Mary
Can you carry us
Across this ocean
Into the arms of forgiveness

I dont mean to laugh out loud
Im trying to come clean
Trying to shed my doubt
Maybe I should just keep
My big mouth shut

More often than not
When it comes to you
You want whatevers not in front of you
Deep down I know this includes me too

So tell me your troubles
Let your pain rain down
I know my job Ive been around
I invest in the mess
Im a low cost dumping ground

Trouble is Im so exhausted
The plot, you see, I think Ive lost it
I need the grace to find what cant be found---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
