same old question
without words
so familiar
seldom heard
if i answer
i confess
i am only
just a guess
and with my eyes
it's hard to see
with my ears
it's hard to believe that
if I ever lose my will to live
it was me that I could not forgive

there's no savior hanging on this cross
it isn't suffering we fear but loss
this is closer than i ever came
just a burning moth without a flame

isaac's knife can
cut away
all the poisoned
yesterdays
and the anger
ease it down
into the ocean
let it drown
as far as east is
from the west
i let you go
i know it's best
and my answer to the years of strife
is the way I choose to live my life---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
