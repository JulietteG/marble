Strings of lights above the bed
Curtains drawn and a glass of red
All I ever get for Christmas is blue

Saxophone on the radio
Recorded 40 years ago
All I ever get for Christmas is blue

When you play my song
Play it slowly
Play it like Im sad and lonely

Maybe you can solve
Solve my mystery
Wrap me in your arms and whisper
You miss me

Weatherman says its miserable
But the snow is so beautiful
All I ever get for Christmas is blue

It would take a miracle
To get me out to a shopping mall
All I really want for Christmas is you

Let them ring the bells
They wont miss us
Ill be drinkin down your kisses

Deep into the night
Well go stealing
Underneath a starry ceiling
Revealing

White lights on the Christmas tree
Thank God you are here with me
All I ever get for Christmas is blue---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
