If a song could be president
Wed hum on Election Day
The gospel choir would start to sway
And wed all have a part to play

The first lady would free her hips
Pull a microphone to her lips
Break our hearts with Rhythm and Blues
Steve Earle would anchor the news

Wed vote for a melody
Pass it around on an mp3
All our best foreign policy
Would be built on harmony

If a song could be president
Wed fly a jukebox to the moon
All our founding fathers 45s
Lightnin Hopkins and Patsy Cline
If a song could be president

If a song could be president
We could all add another verse
Life would teach us to rehearse
Till we found a key change

Break out of this minor key
Half-truths and hypocrisy
We wouldnt need an underachiever-in-chief
If a song could be president

Wed make Neil Young a Senator
Even though he came from Canada
Emmylou would be Ambassador
World leaders would listen to her

They would show us where our country went wrong
Strum their guitars on the White House lawn
John Prine would run the FBI
All the criminals would laugh and cry
If a song could be president---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
