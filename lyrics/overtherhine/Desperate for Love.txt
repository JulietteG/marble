Are you feelin a little desperate
Get on your knees and confess it
Honey, please dont second guess it
Youre desperate for love

Is this just a little fling
Or is it about a little bling bling
Either way, you feel the sting sting
Youre desperate for love

It might only take a kiss
For the plot to take a twist
That you hadnt counted on
Just a tiny little minute
But eternity will be in it
If you turn me on

Red wine on my lips
Got this black silk slip on my hips
The kitchen faucet just drips and drips
Youre desperate for love---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
