So its been a long year
Every new day brings one more tear
Till theres nothing left to cry

My, my how time flies
Like little children hiding their eyes
Well make it disappear
Lets start a brand new year

Darlin Christmas is coming
Salvation army bells are ringing
Darlin Christmas is coming
Do you believe in angels singing
Darlin the snow is falling
Falling like forgiveness from the sky

If I could have anything
What would I want this new year to bring
Well, Id want you here with me

Tear these thorns from my heart
Help the healing to start
Lets set this old world free
Lets start with you and me---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
