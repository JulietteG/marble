You're makin' a mess
Somethin' I can't fix
This time you're on your own

I'd make it alright
But I wouldn't get it right
I'm leavin' it alone

For cryin' outloud
Cryin' outloud
Cryin' out
You're cryin' out

Yeah

You're makin' a mess
Is that what you do best?
Is madness just a hand-me-down?

It's anyone's guess
But I must confess
The performance isn't that profound

Yeah

I'm waiting for the end
Waiting to begin again

You're makin' a mess
Somethin' you can't hide
A slow suicide
Just one bite at a time

I should love you less
But I can't I guess
Only God can save us now

Cryin' out

Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
