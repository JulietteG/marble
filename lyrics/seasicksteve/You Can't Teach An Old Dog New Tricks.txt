You can't teach an old dog new tricks

Must be something wrong with me
What it is I can't quite see
I can't seem to do nothing right
Man, I need to change my style
Been this way for a long long while
Maybe there's a few things I oughta fix

Can you teach an old dog new tricks

Put a little fire, in my life
Climb a little higher, that is right
Tired of this ordinary bull shit
Man, I need to change my style
Been this way for a long long while
Maybe there's a few things I oughta fix

Can you teach an old dog new tricks

guitar solo

Can you teach an old dog new tricks

Well, that right
Maybe I should leave well enough alone
I might not be perfect but I'm me to the bone
I need to change my style
Been this way for a long long while
There ain't nothing that I got to fix

You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach an old dog new tricks

You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't teach 
You can't teach---Lyrics submitted by Stuart.
