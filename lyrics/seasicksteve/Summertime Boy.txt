Yeah man
Yeah looking out the window in the pouring rain
It's enough to drive a poor ol'boy insane
I need some sunlight
I need some sunlight

Well I heard some folks said they like the cold
They need it just to get my bones so old
I need the sunlight
I need the sunlight

Cause I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Cause I'm a
Cause I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Summertime boy
Summertime

In the winter all the girls just hide away
When the summer comes the clothes start to fall away
They look so pretty with their tans
I'm gonna stare look at their pants
I need the sunlight
I need the sunlight

Cause I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Yes I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Well I'm a
Summertime boy
Summertime boy
Summertime

Summertime

Well I got me a ticket gonna have some fun
You see I got good duty California run
Well I love driving up Pacific highway one
I got my arm out the window
My face in the sun
Maybe I head up to Santa Cruz
I got loads of time
And nothing to loose
I turn right around for Baha Mexico
Do the same dance all the way home

Cause I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Yes I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Well I'm a
Summertime boy
Yes I'm a
Summertime boy
Summertime boy
Summertime

Cause I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Yes I'm a
I'm a summertime boy
Well I'm a
Summertime boy
Yes I'm a
Summertime boy
Summertime boy
Summertime boy
Summertime---
