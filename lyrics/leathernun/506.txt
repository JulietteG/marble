I'm stuck in room 506  - forgotten by the world
And there is nothin u can do..About it baby - theres nothin to do at all
I eat my chinese take away  - and drink the last of the beer
But still this question's buzzin in my head: what am i doing here?

Im stuck in room 506 forgotten by the world
Im stuck in room 506 

I am lookin out the window  - its raining outside
The streets are full of people - but noone comes inside
I talk a walk down the lonesome hall - and i got back to my room - 
The night is gettin darker- but the hours feel so long

Im stuck in room 506 where the looney has lead
Im stuck in room 506 forgotten by the world

Im pickin up the newspaper ive already read
And on the tv they screening some movie -  ive already seen
Im turnin on the radio - but nothin turns me on.. 
And the night is gettin darker  - but the hours feels so long

Im stuck in room 506 forgotten by the world
Im stuck in room 506...

(guitar solo ..)

I'm stuck in room 506 forgotten by the world
I'm stuck in room 506 

Im lookin out the window- it stopped raining outside
And the streets are full of people - but noone comes inside
I take a walk down the lonesome hall and i get back to my room
The night is gettin darker- but the hours feel so long

I'm stuck in room 506 - forgotten by the world
I'm stuck in room 506...

Im stuck in room 506 - forgotten by the world
And there is nothin u can do..About it baby - there's nothin u can do at all
I ate my chinese take away - and the beer is gone..
But still this question's buzzin in my head: what am i doing here?---Lyrics submitted by TT Geigenschrey.
