Talk to, talk to me
Like you used to darling
I know it's cold, I know it's late
But let's go out walking
Cause we haven't heard each other in a long time
And we have been treading water living side by side

You take my breath away
Yeah you still do even though we've been down
So come on talk to me
Yeah come on, even though we've been down
So long, so long, long long long long

Come to me, come to me
Like you used to darling
Every day, every way, we've been losing something
Cause we haven't held each other in a long time
And I need to feel you body close to mine

You take my breath away
Yeah you still do even though we've been down
So come on, talk to me
Yeah yeah, even though we've been down
So long, long, long long long long

Cause it's still inside you and it's still inside me
Still in our blood, in our memory
I'm still longing for you, are you longing for me
A long, long long long long

You take my breath away
Yeah you still do even though we've been down
You take my breath away
Yeah you still do even though we've been so down
You give me the feeling and I love to feel
A long, long long long
You give me it all, before we'll ever take around
A long, long long long
It's a long long
Talk to me, talk to me, yeah
It's a long long
Talk to me, talk to me
It's a long, long long long long long long long long---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
