Goodnight, it seems that,
It won't be the last goodbye,
How strange we see the hours fly, 
The voices slowly fade away.

Still walking tall, come walk with me, 
That royal rocky road,
Dividing the evil from what's good, 
And soon the judge will pass the score.

I had the world in my hand,
The peace and the power, 
A love divine.

I had the land at my feet, 
but bad is bad,
When lose ends meet
One bad apple can spoil them all.

How long will matter,
Have the power over mind,
How long before,
We leave the wars behind.

The leaders write our history in blood.

What would it take before science,
Serve the matters of the heart,
Instead of keeping half the world apart...
The other seeing profit as it's god.

We had the world in our hands,
The sea and the forest, the lonely land.

We had the land at our feet,
We had it all, but
Still it seems it's not enough.

Enough for the most of us...
Enough for the most of us.
