Y'all I wanna know if I can do my thang
I wanna let 'em know how I'm feeling today
I feel good
Let me tell you something

It's a...
Great day to be alive
The sun shine through the rainy skies
You can tell by the look in my eyes
I still grind from a 9 to 5

Come along if you know how it feels to feel good, yea
Come along if you know how it feels to feel good, yea

I said it ain't...
No place like down in my soul
I feel so good
Bout to lose control
I feel good from my head to my toe
I feel good like that old rock & roll

I said it ain't...
No place like down in my soul
I feel so good
Bout to lose control
I feel good from my head to my toe
I feel good like that old rock & roll

Come along if you know how it feels to feel good, yea

Ooh, ooh
When you can't breathe and and need a respirator
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, emotions so high they got elevated, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
Make you scream and shout
Go'on and let it out
