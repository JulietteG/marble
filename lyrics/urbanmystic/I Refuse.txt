[Verse 1]
What are the odds of me bumping into you again (one in a million)
What are the odds of me seeing my first lover friend (two in a million)

It's been two years since we've both graduated, I still can feel how we both
celebrated. I can't get over your voice on my phone, we've been apart for so
long so..

[Chorus]
I refuse to wait. My patience is out the door baby. And I refuse to hear you say
you don't want me no more baby. I refuse to blame (you for anything, you for
anything). Let's not take finding each other in vain, it's not a
coincidence baby.

[Verse 2]
Remember we used to sneak off when your mama dozed off (hit the back seat
of my Chevy in front of the windows). Made love to Sweet Lady our favorite
song (kept it movin, slow and steady, to the tempo). Then we would lay there
and hold onto each other like there was no tomorrow. I can't get over your voice
on my phone, we've been apart for so long.

[Chorus]
I refuse to wait. My patience is out the door baby. And I refuse to hear you say
you don't want me no more baby. I refuse to blame (you for anything, you for
anything). Let's not take finding each other in vain, it's not a
coincidence baby.

[Refrain]
You know damn well you're supposed to be in my life (riding by my side). You
know damn well you're supposed to be coming home to me every night. Baby if
you're not that far away, maybe we can spend the day. Catching up on all the
lovin we lost, let me kiss you in your favorite place.

[Chorus]
I refuse to wait. My patience is out the door baby. And I refuse to hear you say
you don't want me no more baby. I refuse to blame (you for anything, you for
anything). Let's not take finding each other in vain, it's not a
coincidence baby.---Lyrics submitted by Lamont.
