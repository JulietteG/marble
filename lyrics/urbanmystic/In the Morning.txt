under the cover

shobedowop, shodowop under the cover

shobedowop, shodowop under the cover

last night, was a beautiful experience
spiritual, like an angel spreading her wings
oh have mercy
anticipating my whole life, to wake up
show you the sunrise
shine down on you and me

see you in the morning
look at you laying there
finally got you in my bed
all in the dark going threw my head
see you in the morning
sorry i cant help but stare
soon as you turning over
i'm gonna hold you closer
in the morning, good morning
shobedowop, shodowop under the cover
in the morning, good morning
shobedowop, shodowop under the cover

excuse me 
if I'm speaking while I'm sleeping
baby I'm dreaming about your
grinding on me
and right before the early birds
start the countdown
and as the birds sing
its about to go down
hello
your up under me
and i don't want no breakfast babe
your everything i need
gotta get you out my t-shirt before we go to work

ill see you in the morning
look at you laying there
finally got you in my bed
all in the dark going threw my head
see you in the morning
sorry i cant help but stare
soon as you turning over
I'm gonna hold you closer
in the morning, good morning


i sacrificed for you
(sacrificed for you)
I'm stuck on pleasing you
(stuck stuck on pleasing you)
its the best part of the day
(best part of the day)
to leave a smile upon your face

ill see you in the morning
look at you laying there
finally got you in my bed
all in the dark going threw my head
see you in the morning
sorry i cant help but stare
soon as you turning over
i'm gonna hold you closer
in the morning, good morning
shobedowop, shodowop under the cover
in the morning, good morning
shobedowop, shodowop under the cover

under the covers babe

ill see you in the morning baby

early in the morning baby---Lyrics submitted by Frances.
