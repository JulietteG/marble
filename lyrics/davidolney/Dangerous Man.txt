Lawrence died in England,
Now in English soil he lies,
He lost control out on the highway,
The desert sun got in his eyes.

I rode the wind across the desert
I felt the sun upon the sand
I walked the streets of Jerusalem
I held Damascus in my hand
And if you dream while you are sleeping
Youll wake and find you dreamed in vain
I dreamed a dream with my eyes open
And that made me a dangerous man.

We stormed the Turks at Atara,
My Arab brother took a shell,
Before I freed him from his misery
He whispered Allah keep you well.
And death walked with us like a brother,
I welcomed him, I took his hand
I learned the secrets of the desert,
And that made me a dangerous man.

The desert war we fought is over
I sleep beneath the English skies
But every waking hour is haunted
The desert sun still burns my eyes,
And if you dream when you are sleeping
Youll wake and find you dreamed in vain.
I dreamed a dream with my eyes open,
And that made me a dangerous man,
And that made me a dangerous man! ---
