You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right
You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right

A million other drunken white folks
Ever ready with their banknotes
You must've never met my wife though

You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right
You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right

Oh you poor poor boys
You don't know what you've done
You poor poor boys
You know you've still got time to run

I know it's gonna hurt your pride though
To have to put away your knife so
I'll come back here tomorrow night, alone

And you can take anything
You can take anything that you want

Ahhh... 

You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right
You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right
Ohhhh
You're not the only person
To get it wrong
It's all right---Lyrics submitted by Spencer.
