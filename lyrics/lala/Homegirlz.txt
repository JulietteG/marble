Verse 1:
Comin up where i come from life gets a little crazy
But i have no regrets cuz it made me
show respect is how my abuelita raised me
to always represent myself as a lady
and when them haters used to talk alot of stuff
they only jealous cuz they wannabe like us
whether im wrong or right they stick by my side 
my homegurls for life.

Chorus:
Showin love to all my homegurls round my way (got nothing but love for you)
cuz we tight like family and we've been thru everything (Girl we've been thru everything)
Showin love to all my homegurls round my way (To all my homegurls)
Can't believe we made it thru the good times and the bad times 
you always down for me (My homegurls)

Real homies always ask whats cool wit chu
real homies are the ones telling you the truth
real homies even roll when they know your wrong
My real homies know that this is there song

Verse 2:
Girl I dont know wat i would do if you wernt around
when them things wit ma man had to go down
when i needed just to talk, you would listen
wipe my tears then tell me i was trippin (I dont trip)
homegurls for you i would do anything i can (you know i would)
when you had your baby i was there to hold your hand (Did all i could)
whether im wrong or right they stick by my side 
my homegurls for life.

Chorus:
Showin love to all my homegurls round my way (showin love) got nothing but love for you
cuz we tight (So tight) like family and we've been thru everything (Thats right) girl we've been thru everything 
Showin love to all my homegurls round my way
Can't believe we made it thru the good times(good times) and the bad times(Bad times)
you was always down for me (Always been down)

Real homies always ask whats cool wit chu
real homies are the ones telling you the truth (Keep it real)
