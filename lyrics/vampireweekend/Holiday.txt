Holiday, O, A Holiday!
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears

But if I wait for a holiday could it ever stop my fear?
To go away on a summers day never seemed so clear

Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I cant forget just how bad it gets
When Im counting on my teeth

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summers day
Never seemed so clear

A vegetarian since the invasion
Shed never seen the word BOMBS
Shed never seen the word BOMBS blown up
To 96 point Futura
Shed never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day Glo display
A t-shirt so lovely it turned all the history books grey

Ive got wheels, Ive got cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other halfs the surf
So if I wait for a holiday could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summers day never seemed so clear---Lyrics submitted by Akela.
