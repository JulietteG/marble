Who gives a f*** about an Oxford comma
I've seen those English dramas too 
They're cruel 
So if there's any other way 
To spell the word 
It's fine with me, with me 

Why would you speak to me that way 
Especially when I always said that I 
Haven't got the words for you 
All your diction dripping with disdain 
Through the pain 
I always tell the truth 

*Who gives a f*** about an* Oxford comma
I climbed to Dharamsala too 
I did 
I met the highest lama 
His accent sounded fine 
to me, to me 

Check your handbook 
It's no trick 
Take the chapstick 
Put it on your lips 
Crack a smile 
Adjust my tie 
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys 

Why would you lie about how much coal you have?

Why would you lie about something dumb like that? 
Why would you lie about anything at all? 
First the window, then it's to the wall 
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth 

Check your passport 
It's no trick 
Take the chapstick 
Put it on your lips 
Crack a smile 
Adjust my tie 
Know your butler, unlike other guys 
Why would you lie about how much coal you have? 
Why would you lie about something dumb like that? 
Why would you lie about anything at all? 
First the window, then it's through the wall 
Why would you tape my conversations? 
Show your paintings 
At the United Nations 
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth---Lyrics submitted by Bailey.
