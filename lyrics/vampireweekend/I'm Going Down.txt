We sit in a car outside your house
I can feel the heat a comin' 'round
I go to put my arm around you and you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Well you, you let out one of your bored sighs
Well lately when I look into your eyes
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night
We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up
Setting me up to just knock-a knock-a knock-a me down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out
I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild
But lately girl you get your kicks from driving me down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down---Lyrics submitted by Akela.
