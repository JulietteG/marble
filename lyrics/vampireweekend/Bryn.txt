Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland, a feeling so startling
I don't what I should do

Oh Bryn! You see in the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know, it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

Lights by the ocean
A westerly motion that moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull
No Kansas-born beetle could ever come close to that free

Oh Bryn! You see in the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know, it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me---Lyrics submitted by ADE.
