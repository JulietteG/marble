oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh

this girl's wardrobe's
wrapped in baggy sweaters
tight neon tights, t-shirts and big letters

back at her house
was an Irish setter
with a heart shaped tag
hanging off its collar

through half the towns of arizona
i dream the dreams i have when i hold her
near palm springs we were struck by boulders
cause they look like skull in bones

oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh

questions i had
as i went through this
are our parents actually buddhist?
is the pool below me the bluest?
is the tv on?

through half the taquerias y fondas
half the health clubs, half of the saunas
half the bares, half of the rondas
is there something there?

oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh

this girl was smarter than television scripts
this girl wasn't damaged her jeans were just ripped
"this girl was the girl that the girls in your world thought about"
when the night was cold

how many times they've claimed that they know you
how many nations think that they own you
how many simple maps think the same sun don't shine on the sunglasses now

oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh
oh california oh california oh california oh---Lyrics submitted by Elise.
