Unsentimental, 
Driving around, 
Sure of myself,
Sure of it now,
You stand this close to me,
Like the future was suppose to be,
In the eyes of the Grocery,
In the block uptown,

I remember,
Remember well,
But if I forgotten,
Could you tell,

In the shadow of your first attack,
I was questioning and looking back,
You said baby we dont speak of that,
Like a real aristocrat,

Compound to compound,
Lazy and safe,
(Wanting leave it)?
(Born in two way)?
When the taxi door was open wide,
I pretended I was horrified,
By the uniform clothes outside,
Of the court yard gate,

Youre not a victim,
But neither am I,
Nostalgic for garbage,
Desperate for time,
I could blame it on your mothers head,
Or the colors that you father wears,
But I know that I was never fair,
You were always fine,

Unsentimental, 
Driving around, 
Sure of myself,
Sure of it now,
You stand this close to me,
Like the future was suppose to be,
In the eyes of the Grocery,
In the blocks uptown,

I remember,
Remember it well,
But if I forgotten,
Would you tell,

In the shadow of your first attack,
I was questioning and looking back,
You were standing on another track,
Like a real aristocrat,---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
