Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work

She said,
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could RUN

Worlds away from cars
And all the styles and bars
Where a little bit of competition means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch

I said,
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

Honey, with you
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two
But I really couldn't ever know

Honey, with you
And a little powered radio
We could try

So lead my feet away
Cuz all they'll do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised

She said,
"You know
There's nowhere left to go"
but we have found
It struck me that the two of us could run

Honey, with you
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two
But I really couldn't ever know

Honey, with you
And a battin radio
We could try---Lyrics submitted by Akela.
