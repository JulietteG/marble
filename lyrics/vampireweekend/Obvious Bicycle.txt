[Verse 1]
Mornings come, you've watched the red sun rise
The LED still flickers in your eyes
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no ones gonna spare their time for you
No ones gonna watch you as you go
From a house you didnt build and cant control
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no ones gonna spare their time for you
You ought to spare the world your labor
Its been twenty years and no ones told the truth

[Hook x2]
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Dont wait
Dont wait

[Verse 2]
So keep that list of who to thank in mind
And dont forget the rich ones who were kind
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no ones gonna spare their time for you
Why dont you spare their world a traitor
Take your wager back and leave before you lose

[Hook]

[Bridge]
So while the suns coming out
Cover ground, cover ground
And if you find some love for these clowns
Turn around, turn around
Ill be half asleep on the floor of a high school gym
Thinking of you and wondering if anyone else could begin

[Pre-Hook]
To listen
Listen
Dont wait
Dont wait

[Hook]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
