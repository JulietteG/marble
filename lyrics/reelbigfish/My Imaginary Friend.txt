I couldnt do it
So I asked for a helping hand
To get me through it
But I guess it wasn't in your plan

Oh maybe you were
Just too busy to make time for me
I always put you first
Expected me to figure out things
But they all kept getting worse
When I think about the way you let me down
I wonder if I'm supposed to count on you

How could you ignore me?!

My imaginary friend didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well I guess its just because
He was never there at all

I can't believe it
Now that I'm looking back
Why didn't I see it?
Well I guess I didnt even ask
Why you were never
Ever in the places I would go
You never showed yourself
All those heart-felt conversations
Were with me and no one else
When I called your name
You never answered 
am I insane?
If you saw me suffering

How could you ignore me?!

My imaginary friend didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well I guess its just because
He was never there at all

Its not hard to let him go
I dont know why I ever loved him so

Maybe there is something wrong with me
I dont see what they see
Used to fold my hands and close my eyes
And think you were with me
Now theres something wrong
It doesnt seem to make much sense
I just feel so stupid now

How could I believe it?!

My imaginary friend didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well I guess its just because
He was never there at all
My imaginary friend woah yeah (now I have to find a real one)
Didn't come through in the end woah no (cos he was never there at all)
He was never there at all---Lyrics submitted by TektapOfficial.
