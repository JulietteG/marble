I could be daydreaming but for a moment
And somehow theyre creeping back in
I could be sleeping and wake in a torrent
Somehow I get caught in their grips again

Here I am in my shame spiral
Im sucked into it again
I reach out for your benevolent opinion
And you bring the light back in

Dont leave me here with all these critical voices
Cuz they do their best to bring me down bring me down
When Im alone with all these negative voices
I will need your help to turn them down turn them round

I could be listening to a conversation
A story Im not even in
These voices have their way when I am unguarded
Suddenly I step in quicksand again

Once again in my shame spiral
I am glad that youve weighed in

Dont leave me here with all these critical voices
Cuz they do their best to bring me down bring me down
When Im alone with all these negative voices
I will need your help to turn them down turn them round

All these judgments so incisive
Voices left to their devices
This womans neuroses a desperate plea
For slack to be cut to mecut to me

Dont leave me here with all these critical voices
Cuz they do their best to bring me down bring me down
When Im alone with all these negative voices
I will need your help to turn them down turn them round---Lyrics submitted by lara.
