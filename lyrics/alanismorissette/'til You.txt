Ive been wasting time clawing my way to you
Taking no prisoners with my romantic crimes

Ive been holding out imagining glimpses of you
Holding my breath while you come down the pike

Spinning my wheels round, Im here dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground while Im dodging bullets til you

Ive been taking notes, nursing the thought of you
Research and develop as Im biding my time

Ive been holding up this magnet that calls to you
Entertaining myself with these consolation prizes

Spinning my wheels round, Im here dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground while Im dodging bullets til you

Theyve been plenty fun, but mere placeholders for you
They fill this dance card as you form in my mind

Spinning my wheels round, Im here dodging bullets til you
Ear to the ground Im here dodging bullets til you---Lyrics submitted by lara.
