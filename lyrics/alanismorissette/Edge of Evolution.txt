Here I leave my story I leave it in the dust
Although this psychologys been entertaining enough
Herein lies the witness objective with my stuff
But were ready to push envelopes into full-blown consciousness

So here we go out here on the edge of evolution
Numbers growing out here on the edge of evolution

I have had my glimpses with and without substances
I have had awakenings non-abiding for the most part

And here we go out here on the edge of evolution
Numbers growing out here on the edge of evolution

In this sacred duality
The highs and lows and the heres and theres
These aversions and these cravings
Push me beyond identity into pure awareness (were already here)

And here we are out here on the edge of evolution
We keep going out here on the edge of evolution
Here we are out here on the edge of evolution
We keep going out here on the edge of evolution---Lyrics submitted by lara.
