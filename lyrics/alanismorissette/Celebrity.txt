I have tasted stardom since before I breathed
My well-known hungry daddy modeled it for me
And I have never left this ambitious city
And Ive only known a lust for VIP

I have studied long and hard how to proceed
Nothing but my name in bright lights call to me
I display the perfect amount of ennui
Ill carve my face up if youll indulge me

Give me celebrity
My kingdom to be famous
Tell me who I have to be
Starving to be famous

Never wondered whos pulling strings above me
Cuz Im aware of wheels, heels and vintage Gucci
Im on my twentieth round of Vitamin V
Ill cut my weight in two if youll have me

Give me celebrity
My kingdom to be famous
Tell me who I have to be
Starving to be famous

Let me into this exclusive club
Ignore my not-so-hidden agenda

I am a tattooed sexy dancing monkey
Just aloof enough to get you to want me
Hoping my persona ingratiates me
Give my life for an opportunity

Give me celebrity
My kingdom to be famous
Tell me who I have to be
Starving to be famous---Lyrics submitted by lara.
