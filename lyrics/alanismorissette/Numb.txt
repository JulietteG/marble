I feel smothered, and encumbered and defeated and drawn
Disappointed over-extended and frustrated
And shaken

This over-giving, over-loving, this caretaking
Goes on
With no chance of intermission, Ill be checked out, Ill be gone

How to remove myself from
Sensation?

Here comes a feeling
I run from the feeling
And reach for the drug
Cant sit with this feeling
Id rather by flying
And comfortably numb

I feel anxious I am nervous I am bored
Im overwhelmed, rather be out of my gourd

How to remove myself from sensation?

Here comes a feeling
I run from the feeling
And reach for the drug
Cant sit with this feeling
Id rather by flying
And comfortably numb

I am lonely I feel hungry and unloved
I feel angry I am livid need a hug

Here comes a feeling
I run from the feeling
And reach for the drug
Cant sit with this feeling
Id rather by flying
And comfortably numb---Lyrics submitted by lara.
