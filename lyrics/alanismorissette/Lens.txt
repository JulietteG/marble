You and I
Are in the same room
We both think were fair
We both live for truth
But then how are we to define something so subjective
Living under the same roof

So here, these battles of wills
They beg for some proof of right versus wrong
Your approach seen as better than mine
Though its working for you
All I feel is disconnection

So now its your religion against my religion
My humble opinion gainst yoursthis does not feel like love
And its your conviction against my conviction
And Id like to know what wed see through the lens of love

And so now your grand assessment is that Im not in your group
That Im not your kind
And so were locked in a stalemate
With you in your corner, and me dismayed in mine

So now its your religion against my religion
My humble opinion gainst yours this does not feel like love
And its your conviction against my conviction
And Id like to know what wed see through the lens of love

And this stance keeps us locked and both in gloves
And this lie remains about us being separate

So now its your religion against my religion
My humble opinion gainst yours -this does not feel like love
And its your conviction against my conviction
And Id like to know what wed see through the lens of love---Lyrics submitted by lara.
