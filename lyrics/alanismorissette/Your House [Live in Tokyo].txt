I went to your house
Walked up the stairs
Opened the door without ringing the bell
Walked down the hall
Into your room where I could smell you
And I shouldn't be here
Without permission
Shouldn't be here...

Would you forgive me love if I danced in your shower
Would you forgive me love if I laid in your bed
Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?

I took off my clothes
put on your robe
went through your drawers
and I found your cologne
went down to the den
found your cd's
and I played your Joni
and I shouldn't stay long
you might be home soon
shouldn't stay long

Would you forgive me love if I danced in your shower
Would you forgive me love if I laid in your bed
Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?

I burned your incense
I ran a bath
I noticed a letter that sat on your desk
It said:
"Hello, love.
I love you so, love.
Meet me at midnight."
And no, it wasn't my writing
I'd better go soon
It wasn't my writing

So forgive me love If I cry in your shower
So forgive me love for the salt in your bed
So forgive me love If I cry all afternoon---Lyrics submitted by Roberto.
