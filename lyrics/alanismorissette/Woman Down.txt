First woman down was your mother
She did condone how you behave
All you could see was your father
His disrespect was in her face

Next woman down was your sister
Her silence did corroborate
She took her cues from the climate
And never knew another way

Who do you take me for

Calling all woman haters
Weve lowered the bar on the
Behavior that we will take come on now
Calling all lady haters
Why must you vilify us
Are you willing to clean the slate? woman down

Next woman down was your lover
She takes your spite at value face
Even her hair length and color
Gives you the impulse to repeat

Who do you take me for

Calling all woman haters
Weve lowered the bar on the
Behavior that we will takecome on now
Calling all lady haters
Why must you vilify us
Are you willing to clean the slate?woman down

Next woman down is your daughter
A stranger to being debased
She has a new lease and limit
On the abuse shell tolerate

Who do you take me for

Calling all woman haters
Weve lowered the bar on the
behavior that we will takecome on now
Calling all lady haters
Why must you vilify us
Are you willing to clean the slate?woman down---Lyrics submitted by lara.
