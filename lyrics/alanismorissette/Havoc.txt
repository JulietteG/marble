Just when I thought I had handles on this
I could soften my guard behind false confidence

Just when I found humble pie insipid
Exempt from this blind side and firmly in its grip

Cuz Im seduced by reaction
And under the influence

Im slipping again
Im up to old tricks off my wagon
I have no defense
Im wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence

I get reduced by my own willfulness
As I reach for my usual god replacements

Cuz I am rich with sanction
And lax in my steps

Im slipping again
Im up to old tricks off my wagon
I have no defense
Im wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence

If forgiveness is understanding
Then I offer mea culpa for the millionth time
From this toppling house of cards of mine

I am beaten by my impulsiveness
By this uncanny foreshadowing of regret

Cuz Im repulsed by restriction
At least thats my excuse

Im slipping again
Im up to old tricks off my wagon
I have no defense
Im wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence---Lyrics submitted by lara.
