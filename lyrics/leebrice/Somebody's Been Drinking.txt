It's three o'clock in the morning
I hear something buzzing
Over on that table beside the bed
Your name lighting up in red
Ain't no cars going down the street
Nobody would be calling' me
This time of night in their right mind

Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they ought just hang up
Somebody's gonna be knocking
Somebodys gonna be lettin somebody in
Saying 'hey can I stay, one more time, it's ok'
So here we go again
Somebodys been drinking

We know, no good together
But you only seem to remember
The good stuff, when you got a good buzz
You'll stop me after that first kiss
And say 'we gotta quit doing this'
But we don't, and we do but we wont
Cause we know how good it is

Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they oughta just hang up
Somebody's gonna be knocking
Somebody's gonna be letting somebody in
Saying 'hey can I stay, one more time, it's ok'
So here we go again
Somebody's been drinking

Somebody's been drinking

Well I don't know where you are
But I know where you're about to be
And I know you, and I know me

And somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they ought just hang up
Somebody's gonna be knocking
Somebody's gonna be letting somebody in
Saying 'hey can I stay, one more time, it's ok'
So here we go again
Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been drinking---
