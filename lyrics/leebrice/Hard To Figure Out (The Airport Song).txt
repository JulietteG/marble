Waiting in the security line
I was mad as hell that I might miss my plane
I've been on the road for weeks
Cheap hotels and I ain't had no sleep in days

That's when, I heard the lady behind me crying
Mascara running from her eyes
She'd just got the news
This morning her husband died in a head on wreck
I turned around to her and said "ma'am is there anything I can do?"

She said "just thank God
For everything you've got"
I felt so stupid being mad
After seeing her so sad
I need to check my heart
I need to watch my mouth
Have a little more faith
A little less doubt, it ain't that hard to figure out

I got more than a man can need
A job, a house, a family, alive and well
Friends that call me all the time
Looking at my life seeing her crying all by herself

I had to thank God
For everything I got
I felt so stupid being mad
After seeing her so sad
I need to check my heart
I need to watch my mouth
Have a little more faith
A little less doubt, it ain't that hard to figure out

Waiting in the security line
I was mad as hell that I might miss my plane---
