Ill never settle down,
Thats what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man,
just ask anyone

I dont dance, But here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It Aint my style, but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I dont dance

Loves never come my way,
Ive never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

No, I dont dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It aint my style, but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I dont dance
Ohhh
I dont dance

Ooh

I dont dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It aint my style, but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere

I dont dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It aint my style, but I dont care
Id do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I dont dance

Oh,
No..

Oooh ---
