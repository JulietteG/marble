I grew up on the edge of a cornfield
at the end of a long dirt road. 

Carolina ployboy
ain't had a free summer since 
I was 10 years old.

Momma made us pick our own switches
so we could feel the sting of doing wrong.
that set me straight on the road I'm still on.

I am who I am 
the product of a good woman
loved by a real good man.
I've learned what I've learned by finding
the right way in all of my wrong turns. 
I love what I love 
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm
damn sure man enough.
That's what you need to see to get a 
picture of me. 

I grew up on gospel
cause thats all my daddy did listen to.
I found my soul in rock and roll
and me and my first guitar were introduced.
Truth is I've only loved one woman
and she'da stayed but I made her leave.
She's still hauntin me in every song I sing.

I am who I am 
the product of a woman still loved
by a stubborn man.
I've learned what I've learned 
by finding the right way in all of my wrong turns. 
I love what I love 
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm
damn sure man enough.
That's what you need to see to get a 
picture of me. 

Like me or leave me.
Either way you'll know it the second you
shake my hand. 
I'm a long way from Jesus
but I know he knows 
I'm doing the best I can.

I am who I am
the product of the good lord 
loving a sinful man. 
I've learned what I've learned 
by finding the right way in all of my wrong turns. 
I love what I love 
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm
damn sure man enough.
That's what you need to see 
(that's what you need to see)
That's what you need to see to get a 
picture of me. 
A picture of me.---Lyrics submitted by Breanna.
