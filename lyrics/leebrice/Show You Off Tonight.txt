Damn girl lookin so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I wanna show you off

I know you like it
That I'm shy and kinda quiet
But tonight I
I kinda don't wanna be

The way you walked in
Painted red lips
The way that red dress
Is huggin up on your hips
I want the whole world to see

Damn girl lookin so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I wanna show you off
Tonight

Hey babe spend the night with me
Make the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
I wanna show you off
Tonight

I know a guy who
Owns a bar up
On a rooftop
Close to the stars yeah
He'll treat us like a king and queen

You know the band there
Plays some country
John Montgomery "Love the way you love me"
Aw but they could play anything
Long as you're dancing with me

Damn girl looking so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I wanna show you off
Tonight

Hey babe spend the night with me
Make the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
I wanna show you off
Tonight

Damn girl lookin so pretty
I wanna show you off
Tonight
Yeah

Hey babe spend the night with me
Make all the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
I wanna show you off
Tonight

Damn girl lookin so pretty
I wanna show you off
Tonight

Damn girl you're lookin so pretty
Alright
Just gotta show you off
Tonight---
