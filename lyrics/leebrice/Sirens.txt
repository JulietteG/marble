I just remember her tan legs standin' on the side of the road,
Honda with the hood up covered in smoke,
thumb in the air with somewhere to go in a hurry.

She didn't say a thing, she just jumped inside,
stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive.
I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie.

She kept lookin' back like somethin' was comin',
said we ain't slowin' down, ain't stoppin' for nothin',
my truck was shaking, my blood was pumpin',
but she was laughin'.

I 'bout hit the brakes when we came around the corner,
a mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed.
Whatever she had is what they wanted,
and it's all a little fuzzy after that.

All I remember is sirens,
blue lights flashin' and drivin',
dirt lane passin' and flyin',
tearin' through the red lights,
blowin' through the stop signs.
All I remember is sirens,
ringin' from the gun shots firin',
one curve away from dyin',
and all I remember is...
Sirens.

The man on the radio reported the chase,
and all about the beauty,
how she cleaned out the bank.
She was armed and dangerous,
she almost got away but they found her.
She was cussin' at choppers,
they were swirlin' around,
reloadin' her revolver every couple-a-rounds.
Shot off a couple shots,
but they wouldn't back down.

All I remember is sirens,
blue lights flashin' and drivin',
dirt lane passin' and flyin',
tearin' through the red lights,
blowin' through the stop signs.
All I remember is sirens,
ringin' from the gun shots firin',
one curve away from dyin',
baby all I remember is...
Sirens.

We were all outta road and I knew she could tell,
'cause she leaned across my lap and buckled my belt,
and kissed me on the cheek and said,
"Thanks for the help, and hold on boy."
Well she yanked the wheel and I held my breath,
we flipped so many times we shoulda been dead.
And that's all I got,
And I just woke up here and I said

All I remember is sirens,
blue lights flashin' and drivin',
dirt lane passin' and flyin',
tearin' through the red lights,
blowin' through the stop signs.
All I remember is sirens,
blue lights flashin' and smilin',
one curve away from dyin',
all I remember is...
Sirens.
Sirens.
And her blue eyes flashin'.
And those long legs standin' on the side of the road,
her Honda with the hood up covered in smoke,
thumb in the air, somewhere to go in a hurry.---
