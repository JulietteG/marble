We got some Hank on deck
Snoop Dogg pumpin
The bass behind the seats
Got my baby's butt jumpin

Somebody brought a jar
Got the whole party buzzin
The word on the street
Is everybody's comin
(Everybody's coming tonight babe. Come on.)

Well it don't get
No better than this
We got the sunshine on our face
Moonshine on our lips

Well around here
This is as good as it gets
We got the summertime with my friends
Everybody take a sip
Well it don't get
Yeah it don't get better than this

Well if your beer's gettin low
Go ahead and kill it
Got the Yeti in the back
Full of Bud Light chillin
(Aw that beer is gettin cold)

Well if it gets too hot
Take your girl to the river
Grab a rope swing knot
Backflip
Make her shiver
(Make her shiver now)

Well it don't get
No better than this
We got the sunshine on our face
Moonshine on our lips

Well around here
This is as good as it gets
We got the summertime with my friends
Everybody take a sip
Well it don't get
Yeah it don't get better than this
(Don't get better than this. Aww yeah.)

We can stay right here
Let the wind blow 'round
Stick our toes in the mud
Let the sun go down
Til the moonlight fades away

We can hop in my truck
And take a little ride
Hold your head out the window
Let your hair blowdry
Whatever you want to do girl
(It don't matter. Either way)

Well it don't get
No better than this
We got the sunshine on our face
Moonshine on our lips

Well around here
This is as good as it gets
We got the summertime with our friends
Everybody take a sip
Well it don't get

Well it don't get
No better than this
We got the sunshine on our face
Moonshine on our lips

Well around here
This is as good as it gets
We got the summertime with our friends
Everybody take a sip
Well it don't get
Yeah it don't get better than this
Aww it don't get better than this
(Yeah it don't get no better.)---
