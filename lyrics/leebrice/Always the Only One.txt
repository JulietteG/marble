Wish I could say, I could say I've been looking for you my whole life
But I never believed, I never dreamed, I never knew anything could feel this right
I got a past I couldn't get past, but it don't haunt me anymore
Cuz all my demons they ran like hell when my angel walked through my door

You were always the only one
You were always the only one
Yeah

If I had a chance, a chance to take it all back, God knows I would
Hide your heart away, hide you from the pain every second if I could
Well baby no matter what happens now, you can know I'm always yours
I ain't ever going nowhere, cuz I ain't never loved, no loved nobody more

You were always the only one
You were always the only one
Yeah

You were baby

If you never believe anything else I ever say
Every second, every moment, every day every day
If you never believe anything else I ever say
Every second, every moment, in every way

You were always the only one

You were always the only one
You were always the only one
Yeah baby---
