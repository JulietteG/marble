People say she's only in my head 
Gonna take time but I'll forget 
Say I need to get on with my life 
What they don't realize is when 

You're dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone 
Driving across town just to see if she's home 
Waking a friend in the dead of the night 
Just to hear him say it'll be alright 

When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she will be there in your dreams 
That's when she's more than a memory 

Took a match to everything she ever wrote 
Watched every word go up in smoke 
Tore all her pictures off the wall 
That ain't helping me at all 

'Cause when you're talking out loud to nothing but air 
You look like hell and you just don't care 
You're drinking more than you ever drank 
And sinking down lower than you've ever sank 

Then you find yourself falling on your knees 
Shaking your fist, begging please 
That's when she's more than a memory 
Yeah, woho, hmm, she's more, she's more 

People say she's only in my head 
Going to time but I'll forget 

But when she's in every minute of everyday 
Every thought I think, every breath I take 
She's everywhere and she's everything 
She's more than a memory---
