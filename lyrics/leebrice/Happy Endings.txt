Well I love her
and she's leavin'.
She met a man plays in a band, 
last weekend.
And he lives out on the west coast,
And she says she's gotta go.

But it's a long, long way
from Myrtle Beach to L.A.
Anything could change her mind.
One sunset, one regret
She could turn around,
come back and be mine.
Happy endings happen all the time.

She's almost finished packin'.
It's over two thousand miles,
a lot could happen.
There's gonna be days and days
of long stretches,
Maybe she'll come back to her senses.

'Cause it's a long, long way 
from Myrtle Beach to L.A.
Anything could change her mind
One sunset, one regret
She could turn around,
come back and be mine,
Happy endings happen all the time.

Well, I ain't waitin' on no phone call,
I ain't gettin' my hopes up at all,
I ain't settin' myself up for a fall.

But it's still a long, long way 
from Myrtle Beach to L.A.
Anything could change her mind.
One sunset, one regret
She could turn around, 
come back and be mine,
Then everything would be just fine,
Yeah, happy endings happen all the time.

It's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A.---Lyrics submitted by Rob.
