Looked in the mirror today
Found my first line on my face
You really don't know how to take
Watching your whiskers turnin' gray
So I closed my eyes
And thought about my life.

When the Whiskey used to burn
Oh when the Whiskey used to burn

High School and pick up trucks
Sneaking out with summer love
Yeah you know all those nights we just couldn't get enough
Coming home at 3am
From places we'd never been
Yeah we were just kids back then
We didn't know first times
It happened just one time

When the Whiskey used to burn
When the Whiskey used to burn
Back when I still could feel my broken heart
Sometimes I wish I could go back to the start
When the Whiskey used to burn

There ain't much I'd change
Sometimes I missed those days

When the Whiskey
Used to burn
When the Whiskey
Used to burn
Back when I could still feel my broken heart
Sometimes I wish I could go back
To the start
Yeah---
