Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you

I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Tin balls flashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do? Cause you don't sound like you anymore

Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Tin balls flashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do? Cause baby you don't sound like you anymore
Oh, anymore

That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you want to come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to

Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Tin balls flashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do? Cause you don't sound like you
Give me the girl I knew, cause you don't sound like you anymore
Mm, anymore

Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl---
