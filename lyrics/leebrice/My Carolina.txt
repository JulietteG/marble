Ten years ago I had to fly
Been living my dream trying to stay alive
I missed my buddies, I miss my home
Yea I do
I ain't seen my momma in way too long
Give me skinny cane pole and a hot bream bed
Catch me a little blue gill and a big flat head now
Some fresh boiled peanuts and shrimp and grits, mmm
Some jack in a barrel and a hog in the pit now
Need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
Some black water healing some time to kill
I'm doing pretty good man but I ain't lying
I'm just trying to get back to my Carolina, yeah

Give me some beagles barking down in a hole
Running a cotton till soothing my soul
I need a live oak tree and a soy bean field
I wish I could take it like a pill
Need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
Some black water healing some time to kill
I'm doing pretty good man but I ain't lying
I'm just trying to get back to my Carolina, yeah!

I need some dirty smoke and a jar of shine
Burn my tongue and ease my mind
I need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
Some black water healing some time to kill
I'm doing pretty good man but I ain't lying
I'm just trying to get back to
I'm just trying to get back to my Carolina

Ten years ago I had to fly
I've been living my dream trying to stay alive---
