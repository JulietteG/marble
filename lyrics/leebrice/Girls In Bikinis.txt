Girls in bikinis, bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)
Girls in bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)

Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
They do the shimmy out of them cutoffs
Lay a towel down, and they look around
They ride up, they pull em out
Don't try to act like you don't know what I'm talking about

Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue,
Highfive to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on their bellies, untied off their backs
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare

Tie-dyed or polka-dot, coconut, muffin top, there in the sand, with a beer in her hand
They pop out, they put em back in
Covered up just enough not to be a sin

Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue,
Highfive to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on her belly, untied off her back
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare

Jumping in the water (Haha)
Coming out the water (Hey boy)
Hey girl (What's up)
Um... (Uh oh it's getting cold in here)
Ow!
