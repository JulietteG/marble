Well, I remember Friday nights,
We were full of bull and natural light
Rock stars under the parking lot lights
Killin' time in a little town
Window's tinted up, tailgates down
Running our mouths, riding up and down
Just looking for a fight
We heard all our stories a thousand times
Somebody go on and tell 'em again, ain't nobody gonna mind

Here's to the good ole boy, the guitars that made the noise
And all the girls that we annoyed, and the ones we kissed goodnight,
To the trucks that drove us home, secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads that somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember and the friends we won't forget

Like I still smell the crawfish stand, diving head first in the morning drink
Standing in the lake watching water skis go by,
Got a pretty girl sitting on my shoulders and another pretty girl trying to push her over
My boys on the bank letting the horse shoes fly
Well, I can still see it now, all of us pilin' in our trucks and heading back into town

Here's to the good ole boy, the guitars that made the noise
And all the girls that we annoyed, and the ones we kissed goodnight,
And to trucks that drove us home, the secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads that somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember and the friends we won't forget

Here's to last call when we didn't care, holding' our shots up in the air
A bunch of reckless boys, man I swear, it's a wonder we survived
To the trucks that drove us home, the secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads that somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
Here's to the nights we don't remember and the friends we won't forget ---
