Have a drink,
Make believe, 
Tonight this lifes a party that they threw for you and me.
Place your hand
 round my arm
God protect the children and the fools like us from harm
Alleluia! to the sinners and the losers 
Glory in the highest, to the love that still blows.

See the lights,
On the pier 
Its a lovely world we live in when we make it disappear.
See the stars,
How they shine
They have blown a million miles, and they landed in your eyes
Holy, holy! Like a river we go rolling
Turning broken glass to diamonds,
Turning blood back to wine.

Now I,
Know that tonight, 
Wont be here tomorrow 
Ill be sorry, sad and sober
Ill still believe in you
When this dream is over.

Whats the price, 
I dont care 
I have thrown away my wallet or I left it God knows where.
I dont mind, 
Cause Im sure
I may lose my fortune but Ill only love you more.
Tonight the angels bring the bells 
And beat the devil
But the light of day will melt away 
Our City of Gold.

Now I,
I know that tonight
God help us tomorrow 
When we are sorry, sad and sober
Ill still believe in you
When this dream is over.
Ill still believe in you
When this dream is over.---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
