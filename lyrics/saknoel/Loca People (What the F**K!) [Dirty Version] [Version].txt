All day, all night [x8]
What the fuck!?

When I came to Spain and I saw people party
I told to myself: What the fuck!?
All day, all night
All day, all night
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's

I couldn't believe what I was living
So I called my friend Johnny
And I said to him: Johnny,
La gente esta muy loca,
What the fuck!?

Johnny, la gente esta muy loca,
What the fuck!?

When I came to Spain and I saw people party
I told to myself: What the fuck!?

All day, all night
All day, all night
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's
What the fuck!?
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's
What the fuck!?
Viva la fiesta [repeat]
Viva...[repeat]

I couldn't believe what I was living
So I called my friend Johnny
And I said to him: Johnny,
La gente esta muy loca,
What the fuck!?

Johnny, la gente esta muy loca,
What the fuck!?

What the fuck!? ---Lyrics submitted by sophia morlec.
