Going down the day is long 'till the setting sun
and I count the hours until you come
and I call your name in the twilight town
and I feel your kiss upon me

Night, you come to me so beautiful
got my hands across the valleys of your skin and that gift
you give to me the thing I need
and lay my body down until the morning sun awakens me 
I love her

Darkness, oh you touch my soul and you fill my heart
and you make me burn when we're apart
and I shed my clothes and I shed the day
and I thrust myself (F---!) into you

Night, you come to me so full of love
and steal my heat and steal my brain and all my body and my heart
you take from me the thing you need
and in it's place you leave a hunger growing deep inside of me
I love you---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
