Some say
I've waited for you all day
I've waited for you all day, my love.

So come, quick
I'm ready for you always
I'm ready for you always, my love.

Yoooooouuuuuuuu
Yoooooouuuuuuuu
Just you, just you, just you, just you.

Hear me out
Hear my feelings out loud
I'm runnin' over the clouds, to you.

Blue moon
It's shinin' there for us now
It's followin' us around, the room

Yooooooouuuuuuu
Yooooooouuuuuuu
Just you, just you, just you, just you

Yoooooouuuuuuuu
Yoooooouuuuuuuu
Just you, just you, just you, just you

Some say
I've waited for you all day
I've waited for you all day, my love---Lyrics submitted by Elena.
