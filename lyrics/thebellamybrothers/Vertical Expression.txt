When she asked me to dance I said 
No no I have two left feet
And then she took my hand and whispered a song so sweet
She said hold me as close as you can till my bodys on fire
Its just a vertical expression of horizontal desire

So we moved like water being poured over polished steel
And I really cant translate the way she made me feel
And the music played on and the mercury just went higher
Its just a vertical expression of horizontal desire

We did the Samba, the Rumba, the Tango, the Two Step
While we romanced and when the music got fast
We just held to each other and slow danced

I took nothing for granted but I wished I could stay all night
And as we walked into her place she reached out to down the light
She said dance with me darling till the moon and the stars retire
Its just a vertical expression of horizontal desire
Its just a vertical expression of horizontal desire---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
