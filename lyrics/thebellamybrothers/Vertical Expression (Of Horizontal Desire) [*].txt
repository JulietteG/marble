When she asked me to dance I said, "I have two left feet."
And the she took my hand and whispered a song so sweet
And she said, "Hold me as close as you can 'til my bodies on fire."
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire.

So we moved like water bein' poured over polished steel
And I really can't translate the way she made me feel
And the music played on and the mercury just went higher
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire.

We did the samba, the mambo
The tango, the two-step while we romanced
And when the music got fast
We just held to each other and slow danced.

--- Instrumental ---

I took nothing for granted but I wished I could stay all night
And as we walked in to her place she reached out to dim the light
She said, "Dance with me darlin' 'til the moon and the stars retire."
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire.

It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire...---Lyrics submitted by Jude.
