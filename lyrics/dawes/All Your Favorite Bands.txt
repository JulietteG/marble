Late night drives and hot french fries and friends around the country
From Charlottesville to good old Santa Fe
When I think of you, you still got on that hat that says lets party
I hope that thing is never thrown away

I hope that life without a chaperone is what you thought itd be
I hope your brothers El Camino runs forever
I hope the world sees the same person that youve always been to me
And may all your favorite bands stay together

Now Im just waking up and Im not thinking clearly so dont quote me
Of what I hope when Im writing you this song
Aint it funny how some people pop into your head so easily
I havent seen you in there for so long

I hope that life without a chaperone is what you thought itd be
I hope your brothers El Camino runs forever
I hope the world sees the same person that you always were to me
And may all your favorite bands stay together---
