You can send me a message if you dont want to talk
And make sure I dont interrupt
It might help you let it go
Its hard for you, I know
To act like youre not giving up

But dont send me away
Theres nowhere else Im going to
Dont send me away
I know thats what you want to do
Dont send me away
Dont send me away
Dont send me away

You can send me a picture of the room youre in
With your evening downtown view
The way the city spreads
When youre laying in your bed
You can send it so I know what I can stand to lose

But dont send me away
This is where Im supposed to be
Dont send me away
You dont know what you do to me
Dont send me away
Dont send me away
Dont send me away

Im getting on the freeway
Your jackets in my car
Your ash is in my ashtray
And Im there with you wherever you are

Dont send me away
Theres nowhere else Im going to
Dont send me away
I know thats what you want to do
Dont send me away
Dont send me away
Dont send me away---
