I need a silent true way to admire
Like you as a sunset and I as a wildfire
And I can't let the day go

I've locked up these words in fear I would say them wrong
Is it "love as a mountain" or "love as a simple song"?
And the moment that the two meet
And I lay myself at your feet

And love is not convienent 
It does not cease at your command
You may take and leave it 
But love is all I am.
Love is all I am.

I need a boundless soft wing to command
Like you as a temper and I as its tender end.
And however long your fears last
I will live within your shadow's cast.

And love is still your stranger
It does not respect how much you stare
You might be love's reminder
But love is all I am
Love is all I am.

I need a graceful proud way to let go
To smile and accept the things you don't know
The losses and the gains blured.
The weight of these last words.

And love is not excitement 
Its not kissing or holding hands
I'm not some excitement
No love is all I am 
Love is all I am (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Lara C.
