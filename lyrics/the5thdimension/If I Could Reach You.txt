Oh no, don't go
it's hours til dawn
and theres no one who'd rather be with you.

I know, you know
other girls like me
I let you take my love 
knowing you don't love me

Chorus:
But if I could you reach you someway
If I knew the magic it would take
to love you good enough on the outside
and make you feel it on the inside
maybe I could make you stay.

The dark is getting light
and you're dressed to go
and never said a word about tomorrow

Chorus:
But if I could reach you someway
If I knew the magic it would take
to love you good enough on the outside
and make you feel it on the inside
maybe I could make you stay

See ya next time
I'll see ya next time---Lyrics submitted by Pam.
