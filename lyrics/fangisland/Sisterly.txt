Sideways, want sideways... 
The side you see.. 
You've got the fire 
You've got the fire, sister! 
You've got the fire 
You've got it further, sister! 

so full of dreams... 
And I wanna hear the song right now 
And I want to feel it alright now 
And I wanna ride along right now 
And I wanna write the 
rhymes right now 

You've got the fire 
You've got the fire, sister! 
You've got the fire 
You've got it further, sister! 
Do you, do you feel you do 
A lot out here 
I guess, I guess I'll say this 
I've no idea! 

You've got the fire 
You've got the fire, sister! 
You've got the fire 
You've got it further, sister! 
Let me see that, I wanna see 
Let me see that, I wanna see 
Let me see that, I wanna see---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
