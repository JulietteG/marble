A coffee stain, dried and faint, covers up the day.
I want a picture that I found, in the attic on the ground, of your old place.

It's black and white, and in this light, it's hard to tell.
If the glasses on your face, were the same ones on the day, they buried you.

Oh oh oh, oh oh,
I long to see your face.
Oh oh oh, oh oh,
A picture in its place.

It's been a year, and now I fear the fade is on.
It's the slowly turning down, of the well equated sound, of your old voice.

The way you laugh, when others laugh, was welcoming.
It's the way I see you look, at whoever was the cure, in photographs.

Oh oh oh, oh oh,
I long to see your face.
Oh oh oh, oh oh,
A picture in its place.

Oh oh oh, oh oh,
I long to see your face.
Oh oh oh, oh oh.---Lyrics submitted by Joost.
