five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure, measure a year
in daylights, in sunsets, in midnights-in cups of coffee
in inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
in---five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how---do you measure, a year in the life

how about love.......
how about love.......
how about love.......
measure in love.....
seasons of love.......
seasons of love.......

(girls solo)
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan.......
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure the life of a woman or a man

(boys solo)
in truth that she learned, in times that he cried
in the bridges he burned, or the way that she died

it's time now, to sing out
though the story never ends
let's celebrate remember a year in the life of friends

remember the love.......
remember the love.......
remember the love.......
measure in love.....
seasons of love.......
seasons of love.......---Lyrics submitted by Valerie.
