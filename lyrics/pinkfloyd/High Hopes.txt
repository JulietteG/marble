Beyon the horizon in the place we lived when we were young.
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary.
The ringing of the Division bell had begun.

Along the Long Road on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the cut?

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps.
Running before time took our dreams away.
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass ws greener 
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green itwas on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwaling back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide.

At a hight altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world.

Eneumbered forever by desire and ambition
There s a hunger still unsatified
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road weve been so many times
The grass ws greener 
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever.---Lyrics submitted by Dave.
