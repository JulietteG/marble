come on my friends, lets make for the hills,
the safe for gold ,im looking for fills
you can get yur hands , i wont ever be found 
cuz im only coming along for the ride
when yu go your way i dont mind, i dont care if we get there on time
everybodys searching for something they say , 
ill get my kicks on the way
over the mountains across the sea, 
who knows what will be waiting for me
i can sail forever to strange telling names
faces of people and places dont change
all i have to do is just close my eyes
see the seagulls wheeling in the far distance skies
all i wanna tell you ,all i wanna say is count me in on the journey, dont expect me to stay.---Lyrics submitted by varun.
