----------
Even if I try to avoid you,
I cant find a place to hide
I cant even deny you, Im trapped by you
If it was love, if you really loved me
Dont do this to me
Her whisper is the Lucifer

If you tie me down and trap me
then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down, it cant grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
Ill fill you only, Ill completely fill you only

Your undeniable spell is the Lucifer
Your undeniable magic is the Lucifer
When I approach you, with your angelic face
You say that the reason you live is for me, you say

When I first saw you,
I stopped for a short time
As if someone was tightly
seizing my heart, not letting it go (still)
You took all, all, all, all, all, all
of my heart just like that
You make my heart burn out
when youre not here

If you tie me down and trap me
then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down, it cant grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
Ill fill you only, Ill completely fill you only

Loverhollic Robotronic Loverhollic Robotronic

The love stories I shared with you
You look towards the same places I do
When we feel that
we cant get any more perfect
Only stare at me, you want me
More, more, more, more, more, more
Only look at me, youre the center of
everything, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing

Since before
Something has been wrong, youve been weird
The people I knew left my side, one by one
All I have is you

If you tie me down and trap me
then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down, it cant grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
Ill fill you only, Ill completely fill you only

I feel like Ive become a clown trapped in a glass castle
I dance for you who will never be satisfied
You look into me openly, touching my brain,
I think Ive become a fool
I think Im only getting more and more attracted to you

Loverhollic Robotronic Loverhollic Robotronic

Its not that I hate you or that I dislike you
Its just that kind of stare is a burden is all
Im not going anywhere, Ive waited like this
by only looking at you

Your stare captures me
As the days went by, it became sharper
Im tired of your obsession
Ive been cut a lot, my heart is bleeding
When its about time for me to pass out,
she comes to me like an angel, saying I love you
Even though I knew it was really you
You really confused me

If you tie me down and trap me
Then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down, it cant grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
Ill fill you only, Ill completely fill you only

I feel like Ive become
a clown trapped in a glass castle
Leave me alone, when Im free,
Ill be able to truly love you
You look into me openly, touching my brain
I think Ive become a fool
Leave me alone, dont make me sick of you
So I can truly look at you

If you tie me down and trap me
Then love is also tied down
The future is also tied down, it cant grow anymore
