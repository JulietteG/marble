Your traces that my heart is filled with
makes me able to breathe
When the long night is colored by the moonlight,
will the inescapable wait all end?
I wish for a miracle and ask and answer myself

Oh, I cant tell you about me who wants to reach your heart,
like the starlight hidden behind the cold clouds
I love you, in the end, this painful confession
that lingers at the edge of my lips slides down in tears

The arrow that reached my heart
feels like part of my body now
Even though it hurts to death
I cant remove you, whos stuck in my heart
Because its love, because for me, its love

Even if I cant have you, even when my heart
Is blocked in the end by the wall of sad connection,
I love you, if its a place, where I can just watch you
Because youre my everything

I stay up for so many nights
when the starlight becomes rain
that doesnt stop like my tears
Remember that I loved you

Even if I cant have you, even when my heart
Is blocked in the end by the wall of sad connection,
I love you If its a place, where I can just watch you
Because youre my everything

Even if I cant have you, even when my heart
(I need you, Oh no~)
Is blocked in the end by the wall of sad connection,
(I am trying not to cry over you, baby)
(I love you) I love you,
(I love you) if its a place,
where I can just watch you
Because youre my everything

Its not tough, oh no
Because you have to be mine in order for you to be you,
even if it hurts, even if you make me cry, I love you---
