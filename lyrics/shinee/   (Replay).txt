Noona, youre so pretty
Boys wont leave you alone
Honestly, I know her wavering
heart

To her, love is just a feeling of one moment
But no matter what,
its my lifes everything

Maybe shes burdened about my young age
The way you look at me tells me
And I think Im gonna hate it girl
The coming of the end
Regardless of what others say,
Your heart will tell you

Noona, youre so pretty
(Looking at that girl, I go) Crazy
(But now Im tired)
Replay, replay, replay

Memories scratch at my heart
(My heart hurts, so now Ill) Mend it
(With the approaching farewell, I)
Replay, replay, replay

Noona, youre my M.V.P.
I was full of jealousy
My eyes were always focused
When Im with that girl, Im so cool
My promise to please never let go of our hands
I knew that at some time, it became a lie

Maybe my kind self
is not very fun for her
Your gestures towards me tell me
And I think Im gonna hate it girl
The coming of the end
My heart screams in front of this goodbye

Noona, youre so pretty
(Looking at that girl, I go) Crazy
(But now Im tired)
Make up, shake up, break up

Memories scratch at my heart
(My heart hurts, so now Ill) Mend it
(With the approaching farewell, I)
Make up, shake up, break up

That b-b-beautiful girl
S-S-Still hasnt had
A taste of sincere love with someone
Its obvious

I-I-Inconveniently, that girl
S-S-Still from my young self
Cant accept my heart of sincere love

Noona, youre so pretty
(Looking at that girl, I go) Crazy
(But now Im tired)
Replay, replay, replay

Noona, youre so pretty
(Looking at that girl, I go) Crazy
(Uh, that girl and my love)
(But now Im tired)
(Uh, I just go crazy cuz)
Replay, replay, replay

(I I I love you girl)
Memories scratch at my heart
(My heart hurts, so now Ill) Mend it
(Uh, because my heart hurts)
(With the approaching farewell, I)
(Yo, I wanna hold you girl)
Replay, replay, replay
(I I I love you)

Noona, youre so pretty (I keep thinking bout you)
Noona, youre pretty(I keep dreaming bout you)
A time when you tasted sincere love
Noona, youre so pretty (I keep thinking bout you)
Noona, youre pretty (I keep dreaming bout you)
My heart of sincere love---
