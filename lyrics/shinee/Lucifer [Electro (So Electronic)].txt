[Onew] 
Even if I try to avoid you, I can't find a place to hide

[Taemin] 
I'm trapped by you, who I can't even deny

[Jonghyun] 
If it was love, if you really loved me, don't do this to me
Her whisper is the Lucifer

[All] 
If you tie me down and trap me
Then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down
It can't grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
I'll fill you only, I'll completely fill you only

Your undeniable spell is the Lucifer
Your undeniable magic is the Lucifer
When I approach you
With your angelic face
Say the reason you live is for me
Say it

[Key] 
When I first saw you, I stopped for a short time
As if someone was tightly seizing my heart, not letting it go

[Taemin] 
(Still) You took all, all, all, all, all, all of my heart just like that

[Jonghyun] 
You make my heart burn out when you're not here

[All] 
If you tie me down and trap me
Then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down
It can't grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
I'll fill you only, I'll completely fill you only
Loverholic, robotronic, loverholic, robotronic

[Jonghyun] 
The love stories I shared with you

[Onew] 
You look towards the same places I do

[Jonghyun] 
When we feel that we can't get any more perfect

[Minho] 
Only stare at me, you want me more, more, more, more, more, more

[Taemin] 
Only look at me, you're the center of everything, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing

[Onew] 
Since before, something has been wrong, you've been weird

[Key] 
The love I knew left my side, one by one

[Jonghyun] 
All I have is you

[All] 
If you tie me down and trap me
Then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down
It can't grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
I'll fill you only, I'll completely fill you only

[Onew] 
I feel like I've become a clown trapped in a glass castle

[Taemin] 
I dance for you, who will never be satisfied

[Key] 
You look into me openly, touching my brain
I think I've become a fool

[Jonghyun] 
I think I'm only getting more and more attracted to you

[All] 
Loverholic, robotronic, loverholic, robotronic

[Onew] 
It's not that I hate you or that I dislike you
It's just that kind of stare is a burden is all

[Jonghyun] 
I'm not going anywhere
I've waited like this by only looking at you

[Minho] 
Your stare captures me
As the days went by, it became sharper
I'm tired of your obsession
I've been cut a lot, my heart is bleeding
When it's about time for me to pass out
She comes to me like an angel, saying "I love you"
Even though I knew it was really you
You really confused me

[All] 
If you tie me down and trap me
Then the love is also tied down
The future is also tied down
It can't grow anymore
Freely empty yourself and look at me
I'll fill you only, I'll completely fill you only

[Jonghyun] 
I feel like I've become a clown trapped in a glass castle

[Minho] 
Leave me alone, when I'm free, I'll be able to truly love you

[Jonghyun] 
Leave me alone, don't make me sick of you
[Key] So I can truly look at you

[All] 
If you tie me down and trap me
Then love is also tied down
The future is also tied down
It can't grow anymore
Loverholic, robotronic, loverholic, robotronic
Your undeniable spell is the Lucifer---Lyrics submitted by ~Krystal~.
