Heeeey Brother, theres an endless road to re-discover.
Heeeey Sister, no the water's sweet but blood is thicker.
Ooo if the sky comes falling down, for you, theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do.

Heeeey Brother, do you still believe in one another?
Heeeey Sister, do you still believe in love I wonder?
Ooo if the sky comes falling down, for you, theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do.

What if I'm far from home?
Oh Brother I will hear you call.
What if I lose it all?
Oh Sister I will help you out!
Ooo if the sky comes falling down, for you, theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do.

Heeeey Brother, theres an endless road to re-discover.
Heeeey Sister, do you still believe in love I wonder?
Ooo if the sky comes falling down, for you, theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do.

What if I fall from home?
Oh Brother I will hear you call.
What if I lose it all?
Oh Sister I will help you out!
Ooo if the sky comes falling down, for you, theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do.---Lyrics submitted by Easton DePew.
