I don't know just how it happened,
I let down my guard...
Swore I'd never fall in love again but I fell hard.
Guess I should have seen it coming,
caught me by suprise...
I wasnt looking where i was going,
I fell into your eyes.

You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing grace.
Before I knew what hit me baby you were flowing though my vains...

REFRN:
I'm addicted to you, 
Hooked on your love, 
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of, 
Lost in your eyes, 
Drowning in blue 
Outta control, 
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
When night blows in through the window, 
Dances round the room... 
Got me hipnotized, 
I'm getting high on the perfume.
I couldn't live without you now, 
Oh, I know I'd go insane, 
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!

REFRN:
I'm addicted to you! 
Hooked on your love, 
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of, 
Lost in your eyes, 
Drowning in blue 
Outta control, 
What can I do? 
I'm addicted to you!

... I'm addicted to you!
... I'm addicted to you!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
