Liar, liar! Why you on earth will not tell the truth?
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see light or true?

Follow you to dusk
Leaving footprints under clouds as we're walking home
I am hot so, I turn to rust
A bat sees I'm a daze on a diamond street
It speaks apocalypse 
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist, anymore
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

Well, we are, who we are, when we are, till we are empty
With new cars, brilliant lights, dream one life, it's just so empty

Liar, liar! Why you on earth will not tell the truth?
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see light or true?

All grows there in your head
Counting heart beats in the free lies we all have in common
While we're are so afraid to watch 
A sad greed that will rain over everything
It will lead us to apocalypse 
With the whispers of the sand and the sun eclipsed, forever more
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

Well, we are, who we are, when we are, till we are empty
With new cars, brilliant lights, dream one life, it's just so empty

Liar, liar! Why you on earth will not tell the truth?
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see light or true?

I just keep talking but I can hear them, no!
I just sit there and watch them come and go 
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find the love found down and down 
But at least I'll find the love found down and down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
