deep in the heart of every man 
lies a hidden dream or plan
to be a millionaire...life without a care

hey cool cat...does this apply to you?
oooh, don't you lie, YOU LIE, cuz you can't hide the truth

I can see what's behind those eyes,
tongue so twisted from tender lies
you might think you're stong
but.. you better not treat me wrong
or else i'll say "so long"

chorus
goodbye ..  i never wanna see u again
goodbye ..  i don't wanna be your friend
so long.. now we've reached the end. time for me to turn that bend
well, time has run away, and there's no need for me to stay and lose myself to you
and be abused by you 
I don't need the pain from your mind games, when you try them again i won't be there for them to work...anymoooooooore.

Now you're back and you're beggin' please..
crawlin on your hands and knees
you thought you were a sstar, but NOW here you are..
you haven't travelled far

chorus
goodbye ..  i never wanna see u again
goodbye ..  i don't wanna be your friend
so long.. now we've reached the end. time for me to turn that bend
well, time has run away, and there's no need for me to stay and lose myself to you
and be abused by you 
I don't need the pain from your mind games, when you try them again i won't be there for them to work...anymoooooooore.---Lyrics submitted by cristal.
