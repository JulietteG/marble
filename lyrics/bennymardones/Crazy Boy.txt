It's hard to live up to
What they say you are
The road to it all
Seems like some distant star
And people around you 
Are like shadows on the wall
Gone in an instant
If you should slip and fall
But you sacrifice
To your last pound of flesh
So satisfied that it's part of the test
Worshipping the ones that get
To where you want to be
Talking to no one 
And wishing it were me

And I know that I'm gonna be the one
This time I'm gonna be the one

He ha crazy boy
Looking for love, looking for joy
Finding what it's like to dream
Ha ha, crazy boy
Time is running out the door
Finding what it's like to dream

Everyone tells me that i'm such a fool
Taking my chances and breaking the rules
But baby you don't know 
That I don't care what they say
So don't let them hurt you cause this could be the day

And I know that I'm gonna be the one
This time I'm gonna be the one

He ha crazy boy
Looking for love, looking for joy
Finding what it's like to dream
Ha ha, crazy boy
Time is running out the door
Finding what it's like to dream---
