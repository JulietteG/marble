Everybody that knows me, thinks I'm doing alright 
 But they don't see me, when I'm alone everynight, and 
 it feels like, my hearts been severed up on a plate, 
 and everybody that knows me, knows that I can be strong 
 I'm hearing things I'm seeing things I knew, I knew,I knew along
 and it feels like there's nothing left for me. 

 If you loved me really loved me how was I to know it,
 If you need me really need me girl you never showed it.

 You've been playing with fire, I've been cooling out,
 little things that mean so much oooh that's what it's all about yeah, yeah, yeah 
 and it feels like your killing part of me. 

 If you loved me really loved me how was I to know it,
 If you need me really need me girl you never showed it,
 no, no, no, girl you never showed it, 
 No, no how was I to know it, no, no, no, girl you never showed it yeah, yeah.

 You would never listen, knew it right, 
 but if you don't get control more than our love's going to die, die, die
 and it feels like there's nothing left inside, 
 and it feels like this could be goodbye.

 If you loved me really loved me how was I to know it, 
 If you need me really need me girl you never showed it,
 Girl you never showed it oh, oh, oh, 
 how was I to know it, oh, oh, girl you never showed it.

 If you loved me really loved me how was I to know it,
 If you need me really need me girl you never showed it.

 If you loved me oh, really loved me how was I to know it, 
 If you need me really need me girl you never showed it.---
