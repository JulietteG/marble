Let's wade in the water,
Wade in the water,
Listen to me now, wade in the water.
I wanna know that you're mine,
Because your love is so fine.

C'mon let's wade in the water,
I mean, wade in the water,
Listen to me now, wade in the water
I wanna know that you're mine,
Because your love is so fine.

You know, baby, that you've got me uptight,
Because your brand of loving feels so right.
I'm like a ship in a stormy sea,
So wade in the water, daddy, and rescue me.
You know you got me sailing from midnight till dawn,
You even got me drifting all night long.
But you are the best fish that I have found
Let's wade in the water, daddy, don't let me drown.
I mean wade, c'mon and wade, listen to me now,
Wade in the water, I wanna know that you're mine,
'Cause your love is so fine.

When the water's calm and everything is right,
Ain't no catfish gonna make us fight.
Hold your sails to the wind, keep your ship in gear,
If we sail together we got nothing to fear.
You threw me your line, hey, and now I'm your bait,
You got me hooked and line and stickle, let them other fish wait.
Call me fin flappin' mama who's learnin to float,
So, hold on captain, you're rocking the boat!
I need your loving power, it's really outta sight,
C'mon, wade in the water, where everything is right.

Don't let our love sink, let it float like a tree,
Our love can be as great as the deep blue sea.
Folks don't understand what we've got going,
Don't let them make waves,
C'mon, let's keep the stream flowing.
I need a big ship, a yacht won't do.
I wanna wade in the water and be closer to you,
I mean, wade, yeah, listen to me daddy.

I mean wade in the water, wade in the water.
Wade in the water,
I wanna know that you're mine, 
Because your love is so fine.

Hey daddy, you really got me uptight,
Even though I love it, because you're so right.---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
