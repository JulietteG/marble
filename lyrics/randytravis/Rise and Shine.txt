A baby in a manger, the town of Bethlehem
The wise men had the heart to know He was the great I AM
They crossed the desert many miles to kneel down at his feet
The star that led them seemed to tell them what had come to be

The Son's gonna rise and shine
Make the lame walk, the deaf talk, and give sight back to the blind
Bring a light into the darkness no one can deny
As sure as there's a heaven, the Son's gonna rise and shine

At the age of 33, the prophecy fullfilled
On the cross at Calvery His blood for man was spilled
The sky was black as midnight, but 'neath the dark and gloom
Voices rang and angels sang dancing 'round the tomb

The Son's gonna rise and shine
He'll take the keys of death, the grave will loose its bind
Hell will be defeated in three days of time
On resurrection morning, the Son's gonna rise and shine

It's been two thousand years, but the story's still the same
For those who will believe in Him and call upon His name

The Son's gonna rise and shine
Heal the sick, raise the dead, the Saviour of mankind
The day will soon be dawning will be the end of time
King of kings, Lord of lords, the Son's gonna rise and shine

Jesus, Son of Glory will save your soul and mine
Brother are you ready, 
The Son's gonna rise and shine---Lyrics submitted by Shelli.
