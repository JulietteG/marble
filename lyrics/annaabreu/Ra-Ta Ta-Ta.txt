I don't know but I've been told
Come back here to check your phone
This is my update to Peru
I just made your head explode
I don't really care
Wrestling
We just want to have good time

Tonight I'm feeling music fill the air
I'm shredding my guitar tonight
I'm feeling peek while again
I'm banging my drums

Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta

I don't know but I've been told
I'm the propaganda radio
Be prepared for another episode
I yell my own talent show
I don't really care
We just want to have a good time

Tonight I'm feeling music fill the air
I'm shredding my guitar tonight
I'm feeling peek while again
I'm banging my drums

Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta

Eeeo-oo
Weeo-oo
Ooo-oo-o
Weeo-oo

Tonight
I'm feeling music fill the air
I'm shredding my guitar tonight
I'm feeling peek while again
I'm banging my drums

Drums drums drums drums drums drums

Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
Ra-ta ta-ta
