lonely the life, that once, i led
strange the paths, on which, we tread
led me to you, unlikely but true
sabra girl, clouding my view

rainy the day, the first time we met
deep was the talk, forever my debt
it didnt seem wrong, to sing a sad song
sabra girl, soon you'd be gone

early the morning, and sad the goodbye
with a wave of your hand and, a smile of your eye
so lately did meet, no sooner depart
sabra girl, homeward must start

rosy the lines that you wrote with your hand
reading between them to misunderstand
i made the mistake you said not to make...

yes reading your letters conviction did grow
i thought it a chance, i knew i must go
its hard to believe i could be so naive
sabra girl, flattered but deceived

now you just told me that friendship is all
im forced to repair the breach in my wall
illusions and dreams as usual it seems
sabra girl, they've been my downfall

lonely the life, and dismal the view
closed is the road, that leads to you
since better cant be, as friends we'll agree
sabra girl, time will cure thee---Lyrics submitted by misty.
