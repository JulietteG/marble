Love of mine when you're born I tell myself that you'll never die.
And I throw my arms around the girl who finds you,
Cause the world is rosier
through your eyes.

I don't suppose you caught her name.
Never mind I'll just name her after you, love of mine.
I'll fashion her into a sweet long legged icon making all praise holier.
Satisfied.

Oh, but she gave us to each other.
The only thing she's done for me that you could never do.
For that she'll always be remembered.
After she discovers I don't love her half as much as you.

Love of mine when she goes why can't you stay,
here with me.

Love of mine when you die I tell myself that you'll never live.
Even as I curse the girl who says she'll find someone worthier of the gift.
Someone who wants to share it with her,
far away from those who take you to have and to hold.
Now I'm stuck here trying to not remember,
for all these pretty words it wasn't her but love that I adored.
It's my love I adored.

Love of mine when you're born I tell myself that you'll never die. ---
