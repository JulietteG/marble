Well, it's time for me to live
The good life on the road.
And to forgive her
For the lies that she sold me.
We were falling in love and that's what you do.

I didn't know and I feel like a fool
Now watching her go.
'Cause I played by the rules
I guess we were above.
And that's what I get for trying my best

To believe in her,
To believe I could turn it around.
To keep bailing out the water while the ship went down.
To keep calling her name when we started to drown.

You can tell me I should have known better.
You can ask me why
I didn't see it coming
'Til it got inside me.
You can say it's all right.
You can think it's all wrong,
But you don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on.

So the road led to your door.
The good life ain't the good life anymore
If it doesn't include you,
If you send me away.
'Cause you dont believe I tried my best

To believe in her,
To believe I could turn it around.
To keep bailing out the water while the ship went down.
To keep calling her name when we started to drown.

You can tell me I should have known better.
You can ask me why
I didn't see it coming
'Til it got inside me.
You can think it's all wrong.
I can hope it's all right.
But I don't know what's going on.

I just know that I tried and I tried and I'll try for you
If you want me to,
If you can be the girl who

Believes in me.
Who believes I can turn it around.
Who keeps bailing out the water while the ship goes down.
Who keeps calling my name when we're starting to drown.

I'll never tell you you should have known better,
Never ask you why
You didn't see it coming
'Til it got inside you.
It can turn out all right.
Or it can turn out all wrong.
We just don't know what's going on.
I don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on.---
