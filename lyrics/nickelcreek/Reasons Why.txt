Where am I today I wish that I knew
Cause lookin round theres no sign of you
I dont remember one jump or one leap
Just quiet steps away from your lead

Im holding my heart out and clutching it too
The feeling is short of the love that we once knew
Were calling this home when its not even close
And playing the role with nerves left exposed

Standing on a darkened stage
Stumbling through the lines
Others have excuses
I have my reasons why

We get distracted by the dreams of our own
But nobodys happy while feeling alone
Knowing how hard it hurts when we fall
We lean another latter against the wrong wall

And climb high to the highest rung
To shake fists at the sky
Others have excuses
I have my reasons why (With so much deception)

Its hard not to wander away (hard not to wander away)
Its hard not to wander away---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
