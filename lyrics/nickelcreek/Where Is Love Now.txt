If I could wait here for you,
Without hope or knowing what to do
Watch the light fade away,
Without fear or knowing what to say
Cry the tears from my eyes.
Leave me here long enough to realize.

Where is love now?
Where is love now,
Out here in the dark?

If I should hold all my dreams,
Through the night of the way life sometimes seems
And if I can't see which way to go,
I'll stay lost in silence 'til I know.
Cry the tears from my eyes.
And leave me here long enough to realize.

Where is love now?
Where is love now,
Out here in the dark?

Cry the tears from my eyes.
Leave me here long enough to realize.

Where is love now?
Where is love now?
Where is love now?
Where is love now,
Out here in the dark?
Out here in the dark? ---
