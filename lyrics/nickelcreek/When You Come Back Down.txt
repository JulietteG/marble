You got to leave me now, you got to go alone 
You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own 
Before it slips away 
When you're flyin' high, take my heart along 
I'll be the harmony to every lonely song 
That you learn to play 

When you're soarin' through the air 
I'll be your solid ground 
Take every chance you dare 
I'll still be there 
When you come back down 
When you come back down 

I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return 
My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn 
And I won't feel your fire 
I'll be the other hand that always holds the line 
Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine 
I'm strung out on that wire 

And I'll be on the other end, To hear you when you call 
Angel, you were born to fly, If you get too high 
I'll catch you when you fall 
I'll catch you when you fall 

Bridge: 
Your memory's the sunshine every new day brings 
I know the sky is calling 
Angel, let me help you with your wings 

When you're soarin' through the air 
I'll be your solid ground 
Take every chance you dare 

I'll still be there 
When you come back down 
Take every chance you dare, 
I'll still be there 
When you come back down 
When you come back down---Lyrics submitted by Jenn.
