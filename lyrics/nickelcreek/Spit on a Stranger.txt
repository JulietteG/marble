However you feel, whatever it takes;
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me;
Whatever you need, however slight;
Whenever it's real, whenever it's right.
I've been thinkin' long and hard about the things you said to me.
Like a bitter stranger.
Now I see the long and short, the middle, and what's in between.
I could spit on a stranger. (Pull me out.)
You're a bitter stranger. (Pull me out.)

Whatever you feel, whatever it takes;
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me;
Whatever you need, however so slight;
Honey, I'm a prising door, I catch you, we're the perfect match.
Like two bitter strangers.
Now I see the long and short, and I can make it last.
I could spit on a stranger. (Pull me out.)
You're a bitter stranger. (Pull me out.)

I could spit on a stranger. (Pull me out.)
You're a bitter stranger. (Pull me out.)

I could spit on a stranger. (Pull me out.)
You're a bitter stranger. (Pull me out.)

See the sunshine eyes.
Try the things you never tried.
I'll be the one that leaves you high, high, high.---Lyrics submitted by Missa.
