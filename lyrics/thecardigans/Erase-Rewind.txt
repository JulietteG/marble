hey
what did you hear me say
do you know the difference it makes
what did you hear me say

yes
i said its fine before
but i dont think so nomore
i said its fine before

i 've changed my mind 
i take it back
erase and rewind
cause i 've been changing my mind 
erase and rewind
cause i change my mind 

so
where did you see me go
its not the right way you know
where did you see me go

no
its not that i dont know
i just dont want it to grow
its not that i dont know

i 've changed my mind 
i take it back
erase and rewind
cause i 've been changing my mind 
erase and rewind
cause i 've been changing my mind 

erase and rewind
cause i 've been changing my mind 
erase and rewind
cause i 've been changing my mind 

erase and rewind
erase and rewind 
i change my mind---Lyrics submitted by moataz.
