So we restore harmony, smooth the lines on the face of an old enemy
But there's no wood on the fire again
We can meet anyplace, you know where, I know when
To go

Skinned like on a stone on the water
Fall with no trace, to lie permanently 

Into the valley we roam, where we fumble around til we find our way home
Yet all we have is an old ball of string
Will it reach to the end of this dark labyrinth

Skinned like a stone on the water
Fall with no trace, to lie permanently---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca.
