He be playing you like you was a drive-thru
(Looking for that quick love to go)
I wonder when was the last time he held you
(I bet you don't even know)
He barely talks to you
Bet he don't even know your number
Got you on auto-dial
Still he ain't called in awhile

It's all about the clubs, his rides, his clothes, 
It's all about himself, that's how he rolls
Ain't like you need a reason to believe him
Well I got ten for you girl

chorus

One, because I'm grown and I'm sexy
Two, because I know much more
Three, you know I got whatcha missin'
(Unless you give me credit for my number four)
Five, cause I don't need your money
Six, I got a real good job
Seven, I got cash
Eight, I got a crib
(Even got a diamond if you're down for it)
Nine, is cause I know you better than you know yourself
Ten, is cause I'm grown and sexy (like nobody else)

How you affordably gettin that apartment
(When he don't even want a job)
The player don't amount to nothing
(He still living with his moms)
He only comes to you, whenever he be needing something
You know he's running game on you
Cause all that player do . . .
(Its all about his world, its all he knows)
(Its not about you girl, that's how he rolls)
Ain't like you need a reason to believe him
Well I got ten for you girl

chorus

One, because I'm grown and I'm sexy
Two, because I know much more
Three, you know I got whatcha missin'
(Unless you give me credit for my number four)
Five, cause I don't need your money
Six, I got a real good job
Seven, I got cash
Eight, I got a crib
(Even got a diamond if you're down for it)
Nine, is cause I know you better than you know yourself
Ten is cause I'm grown and sexy (like nobody else)

Bridge

Baby come and go with me
Come and share my world
(Share my world)
He can't give you half the things I can give you girl
Things like love, because I'm grown and I'm sexy
Or understanding, I do it all for you
You don't need reason to believe him
Girl, I got ten for you
