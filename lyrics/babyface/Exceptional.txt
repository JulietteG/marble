There are days when I'm so mystified
That you have chosen me, yes
That every night before I close my eyes
I think I that I'm here
To know that you love me,
To know that you care,
To know that you give up yourself
and yet still ask of nothing from me.

Your love is exceptional,
Worn of a heart of gold
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time, baby
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional,
So exceptional!

Every night when I lay next to you
I learn disbelief
That I'm worthy of deserving you
That I get to live this dream, babe
To know that you want me
Is to know that I'm here
To know that I live in your heart
Is to know that I'm blessed, and it's clear

Your love is exceptional,
Worn of a heart of gold
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time,
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional,
So exceptional!

You're my sunshine all day, all night
Always, for all times,
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional,
So exceptional!

Your love is exceptional,
Worn of a heart of gold
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time,
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional,
So exceptional!---
