I heard there was a secret chord 
David played, and it pleased the Lord 
But you don't really care for music, do ya? 
It goes like this 
The fourth, the fifth 
The minor fall andthe major lift 
The baffled king composing Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

Your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya 
She tied you 
To her kitchen chair 
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

Maybe there's a God above but all I've ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya 
Well it's not a cry that you hear at night 
it's not somebody who has seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 


Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

Hallelujah---Lyrics submitted by Makenizie.
