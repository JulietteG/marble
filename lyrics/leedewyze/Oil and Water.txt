Kiss me goodnight cause I'll be gone in the morning light
I just wanna tell you that I need you one more time
But every time the taxi comes I second guess myself at what my life's become
Gotta separate what I want and what needs to be done
So won't you...

Kiss me goodnight cause I'll be gone in the morning light
I just wanna tell you that I need you one more time
So let me one more time
So let me one more time

Kiss me goodnight cause I'll be gone with the morning light
I just wanna tell you that I love you one more time
And every time the sun goes down
Oh I'll be home to wrap my arms around you like oil and water
Like oil and water
Yeah
Oh like oil and water

So please don't forget cause I don't have the heart to let my mind regret
Like oil and water
Like oil and water

So kiss me goodnight cause I'll be gone in the morning light
I just wanna hear you say you need me one more time

Kiss me goodnight cause I'll be gone in the morning light
I just wanna tell you that I need you one more time
So kiss me goodnight cause I'll be gone in the morning light
I just wanna tell you that I need you one more time
So let me one more time

Let me one more time
Oh like oil and water
Oh we love like oil and water---
