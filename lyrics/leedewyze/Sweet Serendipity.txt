I aint got no car
And I've got one pair of jeans
Theyve been stretched too far
And now theyre weak at the seams
I cant say whats next
And I got nothin' up my sleeve
But I dont lose my head
Cause it aint really up to me

[chorus]
And Im doing just fine
Im always landing on my feet
In the nic of time
And by the skin of my teeth
I aint gonna stress
Cause the worst aint happened yet
Somethings watching over me
Like Sweet Serendipity
Sweet Serendipity

I dont ask for a lot
No nothing more than I need
Because I love what I got
Dont need to play the lottery
I just want to be strong
At the end of the road
I dont want to hold on
I want the strength to let go

[chorus]
And Im doing just fine
Im always landing on my feet
In the nic of time
And by the skin of my teeth
I aint gonna stress
Cause the worst aint happened yet
Somethings watching over me
Like Sweet Serendipity

And what will be will be
In the nic of time
And by the skin of my teeth
I aint gonna stress
Cause the worst aint happened yet
Somethings watching over me
Like Sweet Serendipity
Sweet Serendipity
Like Sweet Serendipity

Dont look fate can only find you
You cant choose for something to surprise you
Set sail without a destination
Just see where the wind will take you
You never know when you're gonna fall
But I'm not worried
No I'm not worried

[chorus]
And Im doing just fine
Im always landing on my feet
In the nic of time
And by the skin of my teeth
I aint gonna stress
Cause the worst aint happened yet
Somethings watching over me

And Im doing just fine
Im always landing on my feet
In the nic of time
And by the skin of my teeth
I aint gonna stress
Cause the worst aint happend yet
Somethings watching over me
Like Sweet Serendipity
Sweet Serendipity
Sweet Serendipity

Dont look fate can only find you
You cant choose for something to surprise you
Set sail without a destination

Sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet
Sweet Serendipity
Sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet
Sweet Serendipity
I don't know
Sweet Serendipity---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
