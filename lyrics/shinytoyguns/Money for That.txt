School bells ringing, 1994
Music's burning, running in my head
Gonna shout it out, in my head
How could I forget?

I'd give you money for that
Is there some way I could go back?
I'd give you money for that
If there's some way, I would
How could I forget?

Little choices, seem so pointless
No one near me, ever slowed me down
I was good to go, in my head
How could I forget?

I'd give you money for that
Is there some way I could go back?
I'd give you money for that
If there's some way, I would
How could I forget?

Pictures on written walls
All of the songs I know
It's like another time
Where did it go?
Where did it all go?

I'd give you money for that
Is there some way I could go back?
I'd give you money for that
If there's some way, I would
How could I forget?---Lyrics submitted by eric.
