V1
Hey down there Smile
Don't worry, for me.
Cuz I'm okay....
--you cared.

No more tears - - -
Cuz I'm far from lonely.
I'm far away...
. . You cared

Please don't think the world -
Has taken the best
Of you or me.
I know the love that's in your eyes
Was there when the sky--
Fell over me.

V2 
Leave me here....
Now I'm with the angels:)
And don't you say...
'It's not fair'

Bridge
I can't help but say
That I love you...that I love you
I'm not around, but . . .---Lyrics submitted by Figure.
