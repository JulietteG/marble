You know what we need more of around here?
We need more happy talk

Can you hear it?
Hey
There goes my favourite tree
Where's she going?
She's leavin' me
She found another
To take care of her

Birdy
Birdy birdy
I wish I was with you
In a helicopter
Flying over my old school
Where we were cooler than they ever knew

Slow walking
Sometimes we walk in the park
Most people walking
95% people walking

Birdy
I wish I was with you
Such an easy way to get around

Wake up sleepy tree
Get off that old birch knee
Get out of bed, you sleepy old tree
It's the first day of spring
Get up, get up!
Get up, you silly old tree
Sleeping in on me---Lyrics submitted by Victor.
