The sun is out, the sky is blue.
There's not a cloud,that spoils the
View.
But it's raining,
Raining in my heart.

The weatherman says: "Clear Today".
He doesn't know it's gone away.
But it's raining,
Raining in my heart.

CHORUS: 
Oh, misery, misery,
What's gonna become of me?
I tell my blues, they mustn't show,
But soon these tears, they're bound
To flow.
'Cause it's raining,
Raining in my heart.

Interlude.

And it's raining, raining in my heart.
And it's raining, raining in my
Heart.

REPEAT CHORUS:

Raining in my heart.
Raining in my heart.---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
