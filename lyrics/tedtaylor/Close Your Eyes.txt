Close your eyes
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
Close your eyes,
I will close mine.

Close your eyes,
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep
Close your eyes,
This is divine.

Music playin'
Something dreamy for dancin'
While we're here romancin'
It's loves holiday
and love 'll be our guide.

Close your eyes
When you open them dear I'll be near,
By your side
So close your eyes.

Close your eyes
When you open them dear I'll be near,
By your side
So close your eyes.
Ohhhhhhhhh close your eyes baby 
Ohhhhhhhhh close your eyes 
Please close your eyes
Honey you look so pretty, pretty
Close your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Dan Janssens.
