Oh no, Oh no
Here we go, here we go now
Oh no, Oh no
Here we go now

Got a crazy feelin' I don't understand
Gotta get away from here
Feelin' like I shoulda kept my feet on the ground
Waitin' for the sun to appear

Chorus: 
Mama's gonna worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use sayin' sorry
It's somethingthat I enjoy

'Cause you can't see what my eyes see
( I can see it, I can see it )
And you can't be inside of me 
Flying high again

I can see through mountains watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colors of the sound I hear
Am i just a crazy guy? you bet

Chorus:

Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again

Come on and join me

(Randy Rhoads Guitar Solo)

Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again

Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh no
Here we go now

Daddy think's I'm crazy he just don't understand
Never saw inside my head
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand
Never Heard a word I said 

Chorus:

Flyin' high again  
Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again
Flyin' high again

Come on and join me---Lyrics submitted by Tim.
