WELL I KNOW I COULD BE JUST ANOTHER STRANGER, BUT TO YOU I
GUESS I'M JUST ANOTHER FOOL. AND YOU SWEAR YOU LIKE TO LIVE
YOUR LIFE IN DANGER, THEN YOU HIDE BEHIND A WALL OF SILLY LIES.
NOBODY THINK THE WAY I DO, I GUESS THAT NOBODY CARES. YOUR
HEAD'S SO FULL OF THINGS, SO SET YOUR MIND FREE OF THEM, I'M
BREAKING THE RULES.
DID YOU KNOW THAT IN THE TRUTH, THERE'S NOTHING STRANGER. I
SUPPOSE YOU THINK I THINK I KNOW IT ALL.
NOBODY HEARS THE THINGS I SAY, I GUESS NOBODY CARES. MY
HEAD'S SO FULL OF THINGS I SET MY MIND FREE. I'M
BREAKING THE RULES, BREAKING ALL THE RULES, CAN'T YOU SEE THEY'RE
NOTHING WITHOUT YOU, EMPTY HEADS FULL OF FOOLS. NOW YOU SEE
I'M BREAKING ALL THE RULES, BREAKIN' ALL THE RULES.
WELL I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO GO TO HEAVEN BUT YOU
KNOW THAT YOU'RE JUST TOO AFRAID TO DIE. AND I KNOW THAT YOU
WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT TO YOU THE TRUTH IS JUST
ANOTHER LIE.
NOBODY HEARS THE THINGS I SAY, I GUESS NOBODY CARES. MY
HEAD'S SO FULL OF THINGS I SET MY MIND FREE OF THEM. I'M
BREAKING THE RULES, BREAKING ALL THE RULES, CAN'T YOU SEE THEY'RE
NOTHING WITHOUT YOU, EMPTY HEADS FULL OF FOOLS, NOW YOU SEE
I'M BREAKING ALL THE RULES, BREAKING ALL THE RULES.
BREAKING ALL THE RULES, WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM, BREAKING ALL
THE RULES, NOW COME ON, BREAKING ALL THE RULES,
WHY DON'T YOU GET IT ON, BREAKING ALL THE RULES.---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
