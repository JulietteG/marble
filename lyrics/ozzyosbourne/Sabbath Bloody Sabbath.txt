Youve seen life through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you dont want to know

Nobody will ever let you know when you ask for reasons why
They just tell you that youre on your own, fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you, you want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and theres just no return
Youre wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you dont care if you dont see again the light of day

Nobody will ever let you know when you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that youre on your own, fill your head all full of lies

You missed out!

Oh, where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow. Life is killing you.
Dreams turn to nightmares; heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion. Nothing more to tell, yeah

Oh, everything around you: Whats it coming to?
God knows as your dognose; bog blast all of you
Sabbath, bloody Sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Timothy.
