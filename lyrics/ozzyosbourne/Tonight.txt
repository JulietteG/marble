Now I'm back out on the streets again
It never rains unless it pours
Try to get back on my feet again
I hear the raging thunder as it roars
Tonight tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more.
I hear the questions surface my mind
Of the mistakes that I have made.
Times and places have left behind
And am I ever gonna make the grade.
Tonight tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more.
As I beat my head against the wall
Running around in circles in vain
I'm feeling three foot tall
You don't understand I'm fading away.
Don't want your pity or your sympathy
It isn't gonna prove a thing to me
Good intentions pave the way to hell
Don't worry when you hear me sing.
Tonight tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more.---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
