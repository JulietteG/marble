Ill pack up all my things, 
and Ill give you back your ring, 
if thatll make you love me.

And Ill hit the open road, 
just going, going, gone, 
if thatll make you love me.

You know Id rather stay tonight
and let you hold me tight and pray thats all it takes,
but if I have to,
Ill let my own heart break if thatll make you love me. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
.
I wont answer when you call, 
Ill let the spring become the fall, 
if thatll make you love me.

Ill let you be by yourself.
Ill let you find someone else, 
if thatll make you love me.

You know Id rather stay tonight
and let you hold me tight and pray thats all it takes,
but if I have to, 
Ill let my own heart break if thatll make you love me.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm. 

You know Id rather stay tonight but losing you just might,
be the last road left to take. 
So if I have to,
Ill let my own heart break if thatll make you love me. 

Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah. 
If thatll make you love me. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Mmmmm.---Lyrics submitted by Erica Venegas.
