There is a savior
I testify
His love redeems
His grace brings life
I can't be silent
And just stand by
I'll show there's hope
I'll shine the light

Lead me Lord to a place
Where your glory and your grace
Lifts the hearts of the people up to you
Take my hand where I stand
Lead me into distant lands
So that all may hear your love is true
I will go with you
I will go with you

This world is broken
It cannot cope
It's desperate for
The God of hope
These men of violence
They never cease
They need you now
Our prince of peace

Lead me Lord to a place
Where your glory and your grace
Lifts the hearts of the people up to you
Take my hand where I stand
Lead me into distant lands
So that all may hear your love is true
I will go with you
I will go with you

Into the darkest reaches
Lord I will sacrifice
Use me to reach the nations
Into the hostile places
No matter what the price
Use me to reach the nations
Lead me Lord to a place
Where your glory and your grace
Lifts the hearts of the people up to you
Take my hand where I stand
Lead me into distant lands
So that all may hear your love is true
I will go with you
I will go with you---Lyrics submitted by Joel Stacey.
