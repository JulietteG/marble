In South Louisiana, In the Attakapas wood
Where the river meets the levee
Planted in the cove is an old live oak
On the shore of Lake Bijou (jewel).

Amongst its leaves, in the tangle of the branches
The swallows return every spring
They find refuge in that old oak
On the shore of Lake Bijou (jewel).

Chorus:
Turn, turn in my arms
Hold me tight once again
Stay with me underneath the live oak tree
On the shore of Lake Bijou (jewel).

It was in 1957
The first time that I saw them.
The two together, building their nest
On the shore of Lake Bijou (jewel).

They would return when the winter was done
I called them Pierre and Marie
A big Monsieur  black as the night.
His lady by his side.

Chorus.

During Lent this last April
I saw him one last time
A lone bird, waiting on his branch
On the shore of Lake Bijou (jewel).

He was still, his heart breaking
Watching from morning until night
Until that Sunday when he was gone
From the shore of Lake Bijou (jewel).
