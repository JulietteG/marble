I'll always hold dear,
the time that I've spent here.
the streets are all caved in,
and it's so hard to steer.
so I run,
and I'm running as fast as I can.
when the time is right.

I want to hear your heart beating loud,
and I want to see you stand up proud.
as we go,
where sunlight is gold.

If the ending is near,
and we're not going far,
they put up a cement wall,
and tie a rope to a star,
so I climb.
and I'm climbing as fast as I can,
'cause I love you, I love you!

I want to hear your heart beating loud,
and I want to see you stand up proud,
as we go,
where sunlight is gold and warm,
where sunlight is gold and warm,
where sunlight is gold and warm.

I want to hear your heart beating loud,
and I want to see you stand up proud,
as we go where sunlight is gold...---Lyrics submitted by dylan.
