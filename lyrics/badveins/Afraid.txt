It's gettin' kind of late
I guess you should know
That if this sun sets
You don't get to go
I'm afraid
I'm afraid

The danger in the street
And the strangers that you meet
Though you're quiet on your feet
You look good enough to eat
I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Now I cannot reap
What I cannot sow
I'll never keep
what I can't get to grow
Now I can't be done
Cause I can't begin
I don't want you to be alone again
And I don't wanna be alone again

It's gettin kind of late
I guess you should know
That if this sun sets
You don't get to go
I'm afraid
I'm afraid

The danger in the street
And the strangers that you meet
Though you're quiet on your feet
You look good enough to eat
I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Now I cannot reap
What I cannot sow
I'll never keep
what I can't get to grow
Now I can't be done
Cause I can't begin
I don't want you to be alone again
And I don't wanna be alone again

It's gettin' kind of late
I guess you should know
That if this sun sets
You won't get to go
I'm afraid
I'm afraid---
