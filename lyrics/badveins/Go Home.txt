I'm having trouble trying to get my mind
to bend, around you. 
And I don't feel that I have a lot of time
to spend, searching for clues. 

So tell me all your secrets or go home. 
tell me all your secrets or go home. 
I'm sitting right here with you but I feel alone.
So tell me all your secrets or go home. 

I'm having trouble trying to get my heart
to beat, without you.
But I can't help feeling that we're bound to part
if we can't make it sound true.

So tell me all your secrets or go home, 
tell me all your secrets or go home.
I'm sitting right here with you but I feel alone.
So tell me all your secrets or go home. X2---Lyrics submitted by Courtney Beyer.
