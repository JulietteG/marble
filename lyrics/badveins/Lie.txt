Early in the morning 
When my mind's so far away
I begin to ask questions like I do everyday
But somebody's got to do it 
Does it have to be me?
If nobody really cares 
Is it still a mystery?

Driving on the morning
Sun is busy as I am
Through all the things I try to do 
And all the things I can't

I'm sneaking in under radar 
Driving into you
I'll do all of the things you want 
I'll do all of the things you do

Cuz sometimes 
Sometimes
to get by
I believe in the lie

Sometimes
Sometimes
to get by
I believe in the lie

Early in the morning 
When my mind's so far away
I begin to ask questions 
Like I do everyday
Somebody's got to do it
Does it have to be me?
If nobody really cares 
It's still a mystery

Cuz sometimes 
Sometimes
to get by
I believe in the lie (x6)---Lyrics submitted by dylan.
