Once in a lifetime love.Uh, uh, uh. uh.

Girl Ive been missing you..more than I should say.
But, right now isnt the time
For my pride to stand in my way..
Uuuu, Ive been thinking too
But how it used to be
Is knowing made a mistakes, they seem unimportant to be

Dont saythis is goodbye
Lets say, forgive it and try 
No one got lips than sweeter
No one that gives can be there
Once in a lifetime love.
No one is home stronger
Maybe we both belong to
Once in a lifetime love

Oh girl I wanted too
To show you how much I care
But Im not the boy that it can 
I got the, no care the word prepared

Dont saythis is goodbye
Lets say, forgive it and try 
No one got lips than sweeter
No one that gives can be there
Once in a lifetime love.
No one is home stronger
Maybe we both belong to
Once in a lifetime love

So come back to my arms to say.
The fact it will come, Ill wait only once in a lifetime

Once in a lifetime love.
No one is home stronger
Maybe we both belong to
Once in a lifetime love

No one got lips than sweeter
No one that gives can be there
Once in a lifetime love.
No one is home stronger
Maybe we both belong to
Once in a lifetime love
Uh, uh, uh, uh..---Lyrics submitted by Eduardo.
