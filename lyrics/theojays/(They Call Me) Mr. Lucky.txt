They call me Mr. Lucky (yeah)
They call me Mr. Lucky (yeah)
They call me Mr. Lucky (yeah)
Cause Im so glad that Ive got you (yeah)

When I was down and out
You came along and helped me out
Youre a blessing in disguise
You brought the sunshine
Back to my eyes

Lucky lucky me
I got sweet and wonderful you
Lucky lucky me (yeah)
Cause Im so glad that Ive got you (yeah)

Now I dont believe in lucky charms
But youre my lucky piece
Ill never let you go
Im going to keep you here forever with me

Lucky lucky lucky me
Baby baby I got you
Aha
Cause Im so glad that Ive got you (yeah)

I dont need nobody as long as its you
I dont want nobody else---Lyrics submitted by Muhammad X.
