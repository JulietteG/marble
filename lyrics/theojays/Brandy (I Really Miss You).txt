Sitting by the open fireplace in my favorite dungarees...
Played a few bars of a melody and it sounded sweet to me.
I thought I'd get up and take a look around but my feet got in the way.
Stumbled to the floor she was right in the door. I could see her face.
But how could it be? She ran away from me. 
My best friend's gone. I'm so all alone.

   CHORUS:
I kinda miss you, BRANDY. I'm so all alone. When are you coming back home? 
I really miss you, BRANDY. Missing you everyday. Are you coming home to stay?
Cuz I love you BRANDY! Oh yea, yea, yea

Sippin' on a cherry soda pop building houses made of sand.
Like a little child with a fantasy, just a fraction of a man.
But I was in love when they put her down on my doorstep in the rain.
I could feel the love coming to my heart through my window pain.
But how could I know she would just up and go? 
My best friend gone. I'm so all alone.

I really miss you, BRANDY. I'm so all alone. When are you coming back home?
I really miss you, BRANDY. Missing you everyday. Are you coming home to stay?

I kinda miss you, BRANDY. When are you coming back home? I'm so all alone.
I really miss you, BRANDY. Missing you everyday. Are you coming home to stay?
Oh I really miss you, BRANDY. I'm so all alone. When are you coming back home?
Oh i really miss you, BRANDY. Missing you everyday. Are you coming home to stay?
I really miss you, Oh BRANDY! when are you coming back home? I'm so all...alone!
I really miss you. BRANDY...---Lyrics submitted by BRANDY.
