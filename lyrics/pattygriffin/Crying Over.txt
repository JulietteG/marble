Light it up baby
Light up that fire
Dont know whats gonna save me 
From the cold now
And these sorrows
Im crying over
And these sorrows
Im crying over

Embrace me
Embrace me with your kind love
Its all Ive ever wanted
All Ive ever dreamed of

And all of this dreaming
Of silver and gold
Something to break this 
Winter so cold

And these sorrows
Im crying over
And these sorrows
Im crying over

We go straight for the thunder
Straight for the rain
Love leaves a mark and
Love leaves a strain
Back in the saddle
Again and again
Millions of eyes
And none of them friends
Better light it up baby
You better light up that fire
Cause I dont know whats gonna save me
From the cold now

And these sorrows
Im crying over
And these sorrows
Im crying over, crying over---Lyrics submitted by Celeste Chrapko.
