I know leaving me is killing you,
But I know it's something you have to do.
Remember I said I'd always be there.
I still feel the same, I ain't going anywhere.

'Til the 31st of April,
'Til it snows here in July,
'Til the seas take California,
And wash up on the Great Divide.
Even when that happens, if you're not back I know,
I'll still be waiting for you, on the Coast of Colorado.

I can't say goodbye to you for good,
And I know you would stay if you could.
There must be a part of you that you still need to find.
I'll be waiting for you if you ever change your mind.

'Tilt he 31st of April,
'Til it snows here in July,
'Til the seas take California,
And wash up on the Great Divide.
Even when that happens, if you're not back I know,
I'll still be waiting for you, on the Coast of Colorado.

Still be waiting for you, on the Coast of Colorado.---Lyrics submitted by Jeanne.
