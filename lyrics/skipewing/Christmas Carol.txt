I was playin' Santa Claus downtown on Christmas eve
When a little girl of three or four climbed up onto my knee
I could tell she had a Christmas wish behind those eyes of blue
So I asked her "What's your name, and what can Santa get for you?"

She said "My name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas day
I don't know who my daddy is, and mommy's gone away
All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home
Does anybody want a Christmas Carol of their own?"

Well all I could say was "Santa will do the best he could"
And I set her down and told her, "Now to remember to be good"
She said, "I will" then walked away, turned and waved goodbye
And I'm glad she wasn't close enough to see ole Santa cry

She said "My name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas day
I don't know who my daddy is, and mommy's gone away
All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home
Does anybody want a Christmas Carol of their own?"

Early Christmas morning I got up and dialed the phone
I made a few arrangements at the county children's home
And they told me it would be alright to pick her up today
Now my little Christmas Carol won't ever have to say

"My name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas day
I don't know who my daddy is, and mommy's gone away
All I want for Christmas is someone to take me home
Does anybody want a Christmas Carol of their own"

Well Merry Christmas, Carol
I love you, welcome home---Lyrics submitted by Vivian Mead.
