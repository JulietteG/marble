The Man is attracted to the Woman
And at the same time repelled
Like a sharp pain, that strikes in your teeth
Your heart is on fire with the starfish
Which are the symbols

Of Teeth Of Teeth Of Teeth Of Teeth
And the same teeth, are used for
Castration, Mastication, Titillation, Na na na na

The Woman is viewed on defensive
And the Man is pulled and repelled
Like a conflict on the beach
And you're face down in the sand
Feel the grit, in your mouth 
When you bite down, on your teeth
Taste the salt, in the blood 
That comes from the cuts 
And the pain

In your teeth In your teeth In your teeth In your teeth 
In your teeth In your teeth In your teeth In your teeth---Lyrics submitted by scaredrecords.
