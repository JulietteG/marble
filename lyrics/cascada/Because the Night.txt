Take me now baby here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand, come undercover
They can't hurt you now (x3)

Chorus---
Because the night belongs to lovers 
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

~~repeat chorus~~

Have I doubt baby when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our beds til the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command 
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now (x3)

~~Chorus 2x~~---Lyrics submitted by Corie.
