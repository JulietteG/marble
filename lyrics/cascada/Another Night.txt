you
i roll i can remember
after all we have been through
forever in my heart
known i'm true
and you just can remember
i can believe is true
to long we been apart

(chorus)
one more night
are wanna be with you
were are wanna hold your time 
i feel so right tonight
i live it up to you
and i take your time is right
stand up fight one more night

are wanna be with you 
were are wanna hold your time 
i feel so right tonight
i live it up you 
and i take your time is right
stand up fight.

why can true love be forever
i take my dream explode
the day you end aware
cause i 
i keep the still together
i wish you were all for
and girls entertain
