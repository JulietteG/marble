I was taking a trip on a plane the other day
Just wishing that I could get up
When the man next to me saw the book in my hand
And asked me what it was about
And so I sat back in my seat, " A best seller, " I said,
"A history and mystery in one."
Then I opened up the book and began to read
From Matthew, Mark, Luke & John.

Chorus: 
He was born of a Virgin, one Holy Night
In the little town of Bethlehem
Angels got around and underneath the stars
Singing praises to the Great I Am
He walked on the water, healed the lame
And made the blind to see again
And for the First time here on earth, we learned that God could be a Friend
And so He never ever did a single thing wrong
But the angry crowd chose Him
Then he walked up the road & died on the cross
And that was the End, of the Beginning.

"Thats not any book, thats the Bible, " he said
"And I've heard it all before,
I've tried religion, its shame & guilt and I dont need it anymore.
Its superstition made of tales, just to help the weak to survive."
"Oh let me read it again, " I said,
"But listen closely, this is gonna change your life!"

(repeat Chorus)

"In the end of the beginning," he said with a smile
"What more could there be, He's dead
You said they hung Him and put nails in His hands,
And a crown of thorns on His head."
I said, " I'll read it again, but this time there's more.
I believe this is true, 
His death wasn't the end, but the beginning of life
Thats completed in you,
Don't you see, He did all this for you."---Lyrics submitted by Rachael.
