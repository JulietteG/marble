My thirst for the things of this earth
Isn't quenched by diamonds or pearls.
One Man lived the life that I want
He's the One they said ruled the world.

Though He only wore a crown of thorns
And He never owned a thing.

Chorus

I want to live like a King.
I want to live like a King.
And my decree it will ring
"Love will rule everything".
I want to live like a King.

This King did the strangest of things;
He befriended the sick and the poor.
There was no one too wrong, too right, 
Too black, too white for Him to love.
He built no walls, left no unopened doors.
Well, now I could croon a million other tunes
There is just one I want to sing.

Chorus

I want to be stronger, I want to be wiser
I just want to make every move be the one He'd want to see from me
There's just such power, such healing power
In every word that He said, in every deed that He did.---Lyrics submitted by Clinton Josef.
