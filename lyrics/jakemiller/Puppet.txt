(Verse)
Lately I feel like a puppet, being pulled in 15 million different places
Girlfriends on the phone, the other line I got my agent
Like hey Jake, got good news, we just booked another tour
Yea thats good and all but that just means another civil war between me and my girl
What am I supposed to say?
Hey baby, how you doin? I missed you home
By the way Im bout to leave, ah good
Im going on a fall tour
But Ill be back before you know it, then Im all yours
Listen Jake, shell understand, this is more important
Oh really? You wanna tell her that?
Cuz if I ever did shed probably kill me
Look Im sorry Jake but its done deal, youre leavin Thursday
And youll be on the road during Christmas and your birthday
Great, my girls mad cuz I aint there a lot
And now I gotta spend my birthday in the courtyard marriott
Drinkin up your stress man, youve had a busy year
But this is what you sound good for, this is your career
This aint a shooting for the weak hearted, Jake I thought you knew
But you cant pursue your dream and have a normal life too
If you aint ready tell me now, I never said that it was easy
Otherwise Ill be in my office, you know where to reach me

(Hook)
Yea, Im feelin like a puppet
A goddamn puppet
Being pulled in a million different ways
Man I think Im bout to break
Im a puppet
A goddamn puppet
Sick of feeling like a puppet
Sometimes I wanna disappear, all these voices in my head
Im a Im a

(Verse)
Look, hang up with my agent, put my phone down on the table
Five seconds later get a call from my label
Like hey Jake, how you doin? Tell me hows the album comin?
We heard your last song and honestly we didnt love it
We dont think itll make the cut, couldve written better verses
Deadlines in a month and now we startin to get nervous
Stop getting so distracted, start pickin up the pen
You need more time in the studio, and less time with your friends
Cuz its crunch time, should be doing nothing but making music
We follow you on Instagram, see everything you doin
Yea we see you at the beach, at the gym, at the mall
To be honest, doesnt seem like youre working hard at all
How dare you say that I dont even have time to take a shit
Ive been working non-stop and Ill be honest, I admit
Sometimes I need a break, this life can drive a man crazy
Especially when your label keeps callin sayin youre lazy
Listen Jake, I know its hard
Sometimes it isnt fun
But if this album tanks, well your career could be done
If you aint ready tell us now, never said that it was easy
Otherwise Ill be in my office, you know where to reach me

(Hook)
Yea, Im feelin like a puppet
A goddamn puppet
Being pulled in a million different ways
Man I think Im bout to break
Im a puppet
A goddamn puppet
Sick of feeling like a puppet
Sometimes I wanna disappear, all these voices in my head
Im a---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
