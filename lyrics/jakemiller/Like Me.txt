(Papapapapa)
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
Ma-ma-manners take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
There is no one like me, like me

Lemme tell you all a story, everybody gather round
Once there was boy, he was the coolest kid in town
He knew he wasn't perfect just like everybody else
But he always knew the importance of stayin' true to himself
Cause all the other kids would hide behind a mask
So when they took attendance he the only one in class
Who could probably raise his hand when he heard his name
Never lost track of who he was or tried to change
Even through the peer pressure he was happy in his skin
While everyone around him was obsessed with fittin' in
He never let the words of others get in his way
Hey and that's what made him into the man he is today
Sing!

Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

Manners, you better reconsider (consider)
Cause you will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me, like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

Padapapapap padapapapa
There is no one like me
There is-

Now his friends were dressin' different, barely recognized 'em
Everyday was Halloween, costume had disguised 'em
Girls covered in make up to make up for the insecurities
Guys were actin tough to make up for their immaturity
Yeah but he always followed his heart
Once he almost gave in, but knew it wouldn't be smart
Cause it's hard to stay the same in a world that's always changing
He looked around to find he was the only one remaining
And in that moment, he never felt so proud
He knew he wasn't just another face in the crowd
He never let the thoughts of others get in his way
Hey and that's what made him into the man he is today
Sing!

Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

Manners, you better reconsider (consider)
Cause you will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me, like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

There ain't no one like me man
I hope that you can look in the mirror everyday
And say to yourself, there's no one like you
Yeah

Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

Manners, you better reconsider (consider)
Cause you will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me, like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)---Lyrics submitted by rodasey.
