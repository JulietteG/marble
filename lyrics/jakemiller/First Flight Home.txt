I'll be home in no time
I promise when I touch down it'll be like I never left
Singing, I'll be home in no time
By the way check your phone cause I just sent you a text saying

Hey, I've been gone forever, I'm coming home tonight
We'll be back together, this plane gon' fly
I can't predict the weather, but you should know that I
I'll be on the first flight home, I'll be on the first flight home
I'll be coming back tonight, keep your head up to the sky
Cause I'll be on the first flight home, I'll be on the first flight home...---
