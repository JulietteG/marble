I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change, I'm wild for the way you are
And when we touch, it makes me feel love in a stolen car
So I will never try to tame you
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart

They will never understand you and your lion heart
Yeah, I'm the only one who can love you the way you are
So tear me open, set me free
We'll run underneath the stars
I swear that I will never leave you
You and your lion heart

Yeah, girl you crazy, and I love it
These others dudes, they don't cut it
They can't handle the fact you walk your own path
But me, I can't get enough of it
'Cause you're wild, but me too
So what's good, just come through
I can show you the night of your life
Girl, we can turn our whole world into a zoo

Yeah, so baby, let me hear your roar
Come pounce on me like never before
You the queen of the jungle, I can be the king
I am right here, you ain't gotta worry about a thing
You will never go in hungry, I'll fight for you
Nothing will frighten you, 'cause every night for you
I could be your light, when the stars get dark
I love you and your lion heart

I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change, I'm wild for the way you are
And when we touch, it makes me feel
Love in a stolen car
So I will never try to tame you
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart

I would never try to tame you---
