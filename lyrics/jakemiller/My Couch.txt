She don't wanna go out, She'd rather chill at my house
All you're friends are partyin' while we down and in watchin' Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out, OOO
She just wanna come over, yeah 
You're friends are in the VIP but you don't need an ID 
To come and kick it on my couch

Yeah, Her friends are downtown while we at the pad chillin' home, 
Watchin' episodes of Breaking Bad
Man forget these other girls, We aint got nothing in common
I'd rather be with you up in the kitchen makin' ramen
You perfect type, you are
Not the type to hit the bar 
Her idea of goin' hard, slippin' through the DVR with the sweatpants, tank top, chillin' with no makeup on
Phone's blowin up,
Friends are begging you to tag along
I think they jealous if you ask me 
they'll probably go out and get drunk just like last week
Screw your friends, you can catch a break actually but you don't need the glitz and glamour while you have me
Cuz' you ain't got nothin' on but my tank and your undies
So get on the floor and just tackle me, rugby
You ain't like them other girls, no you ain't the same 
So baby come over, my couch is callin' your name

She don't wanna go out 
She's rather chill at my house 
All you're friends are partyin' while we down and in watchin' Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out, OOO
She just wanna come over, yeah
You're friends are in the VIP 
But you don't need an ID to come and kick it on my couch

Yeah, So what you say baby?
Put the recliner back 
High heels, Black dress, you could say Goodbye to that
Could be anywhere but girl you're right here with me
So during the commercial breaks, yeah we gettin' frisky
You know the key to my heart 
Ordering Chinese and playin' Mario Cart
You're worth more than the world to me, I ain't talkin' Forbes list
You don't need to dress up, you're drop dead gorgeous

So baby just come and hang with me
Phone on silent, tell em to let us be
You're girls are takin' shots in the VIP 
But here in my crib all the drinks are free 
So come lay in my arms, we could look up at the stars 
Got my furry, yep slippers and my bowl of lucky charms
You ain't like them other girls, haha you ain't the same 
So baby come over, my couch is callin' your name 

So don't wanna go out 
She'd rather chill at my house 
All you're friends are partyin' while we down and in watchin' Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out, OOO
She just wanna come over, yeah
You're friends are in the VIP but you don't need an ID 
To come and kick it on my couch 

You ain't like them other girls 
You ain't like them other girls 
You ain't like them girls 
So baby come over, my couch is callin' you're name 
You ain't like them other girls 
you ain't like them other girls 
You ain't like them girls 
So baby come over, my couch is callin' your name 

She don't wanna go out 
She'd rather chill at my house 
All you're friends are partyin' while we down and in watchin' Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out, OOO
She just wanna come over, yeah
You're friends are in the VIP but you don't need and ID to come and kick it on my couch
She don't wanna go out 
She'd rather chill at my house 
All you're friends are partying while we down and in watchin' Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out, OOO
She just wanna come over, Yeah
You're friends are in the VIP but you don't need an ID to come and kick it on my couch---Lyrics submitted by Aubri.
