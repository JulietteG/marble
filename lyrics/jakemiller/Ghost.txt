Im just a ghost, but Im not the only one
I guess Im not the only one

This ones for the kids that walk around with their hoodies up
No one to talk to, and on the verge of givin up
Same shit, different day, nothing seems to work out
Headphones on, always tryin to tune the world out
And this ones for the kids that get picked last
Yeah, so might as well just skip gym class
Why not? I bet no one would even notice
Cause no one really cares when youre down, feeling hopeless
And this ones for the kids that at lunch sit slone
So embarassed you pretendin that youre on the phone
But then you realize that it doesnt really help
Cause aint nobody on the line, youre just talking to yourself

And it stinks, right?! Yeah, I know
Sometimes it feels like youre on your own
Trust me, you were not the only one, life has only just begun
Just remember that youre not alone

Im just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
Theyre staring right at me, (right at me)
Looking right pass me, (right pass me)
Im just a ghost oh-hoo (yeah)
Who do I turn to (Who do I turn to)
When I feel see-through? (yeah, see-through, yeah)
Im just a ghost, but Im not the only one
I guess Im not the only one

Look, you feel invisible, but I can see you
Youre callin out, nobodys answering, but I can hear you
They dont like me, they dont get me, they dont feel my pain

But theres a million people out there who relate to you and feel the same
Yeah, so just smile and youll be alright
When youre feeling like a ghost floating through the air
Remember stars still shine in the darkest nights
Even when you cant see them, theyre always there
Yeah, so keep your eyes up to the sky
Were all in this together, we gonna make it if we try
Its hard when youre feeling like youre lost and forgotten
And you got no one around to dry your tears, when you cry

And it stinks, right?! Yeah, I know
Sometimes it feels like youre on your own
Trust me, you were not the only one, life has only just begun
Just remember that youre not alone

Im just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
Theyre staring right at me (right at me)
Looking right pass me (right pass me)
Im just a ghost oh-hoo (yeah)
Who do I turn to (Who do I turn to)
When I feel see-through (yeah, see-through, yeah)

So tonight, Ima fly up to the sky and let the whole world see me
And if youre feeling how Im feeling you should come along with me
Its the last time youll ever look pass me again
Im not a ghost, Im more alive than Ive ever been
Im let the whole world see me
And if youre feeling how Im feeling you should come along with me
Its the last time youll ever look pass me again
Im not a ghost, Im more alive than Ive ever been

Im just a ghost, oh-hoo
Theyre staring right at me
Looking right pass me
Im just a ghost, oh-hoo
Who do I turn to (yeah)
When I feel see-through (come on)

Im just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
Theyre staring right at me (right at me)
Looking right pass me (right pass me)
Im just a ghost (youre not a ghost)
Who do I turn to (so keep your head up)
When I feel see-through (and one day the whole worlds gonna see you, yeah)

Im just a ghost, but Im not the only one
I guess Im not the only one---
