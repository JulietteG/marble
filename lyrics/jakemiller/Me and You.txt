[x2:]
Me and you
Yea, we gon' burn this city down
And the only ones that'll make it out are
Me and you
Yea, it don't matter where we go
We'll leave behind all that we know

[x2:]
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you
Just doin' what we do now

Listen up girl, I could be your getaway
Loosen up girl, I can take your pain away
So tonight baby we can throw the deuces up
There's not much in this town for us anyway
Let's shake this city like an earthquake
I'll stand by you until my legs break
Burn the city down, we can ride around top down
Tell me how is that for a first date?

'Cause I've been up for days
Thinkin' bout escaping now
We can have it made
Fuck this place, we breaking out
So peace out 'cause we gone
Girl I know you nervous
But we can take 'em on
Us against them, the whole world versus...

Me and you
Yea, we're gon' burn this city down
And the only ones that'll make it out are
Me and you
Yea, it don't matter where we go
We'll leave behind all that we know

[x2:]
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you
Just doin' what we do now

Yea, you my partner in crime, like Bonnie & Clyde
Like Batman & Robin, I'll catch you when you're fallin'
Baby say the word, I'll come runnin' when you callin'
I got your back like a saddle, if you sink baby I can be your paddle
We like Harold & Kumar
One day I'm a make you a queen, put you in a White Castle

Baby I've been up for days
Thinkin' bout escaping now
We can have it made
Fuck this place, we breaking out
So peace out 'cause we gone
Girl I know you nervous
But we can take em on
Us against them, the whole world versus...

Me and you
Yea, we're gon' burn this city down
And the only ones that'll make it out are
Me and you
Yea, it don't matter where we go
We'll leave behind all that we know

[x2:]
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you
Just doin' what we do now

Us against them, the whole world versus...
Us against them, the whole world versus...

[x2:]
Me and you
Yea, we're gon' burn this city down
And the only ones that'll make it out are
Me and you
Yea, it don't matter where we go
We'll leave behind all that we know

[x2:]
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you (Just me and you)
Just me and you
Just doin' what we do now
Me and you ---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
