He got loved up on the seashore 
Kissing with a girl he never met before 
Food was sparse but the drink was plenty 
Jack was sixteen and Jill had just turned twenty 

Lying there on the midnight sand
He said he'd give her the sky if she held his hand 
she counted every star in the sky and said 
I, I don't want that I want you instead (x2) 

If you don't rearrange us (x3) 
If you don't rearrange 

She got loved up on the seashore 
Kissing with a boy she never met before 
Food was sparse, but the booze was plenty 
Jill was sixteen and Jack had just turned twenty 

Lying there on the midnight sand
He said he'd give her the sky if she held his hand 
She counted every star in the sky and said 
I, I don't want that I want you instead (x8) 

If you don't rearrange us (x3) 
If you don't rearrange 
we won't change (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Jade Black.
