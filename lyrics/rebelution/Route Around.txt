Lately I've tried to fall asleep but I struggle,
I tell you your the missing piece of my puzzle,
And four A.M. Has got me more or less troubled,
Ewhhh what I would what i would do with my lover,
And all day, I share the memories in soundwaves,
Across the country to where you lay,
Right on your side, no need to feel alone not tonight because,

We can try to find a route around, (a route around)
All my troubles fading out now,
Time to pick it up now,
Things are pickin up now,
We can try to find a route around, (a route around)
All my troubles fading out now,
Time to pick it up now,
Things are pickin up now.

Some people say to fight for everything you want,
But all I need is food, water, air, and love,
I share the four things we love so very much,
I show the world that less is enough,
Because always we'll stay grounded in our own way,
Control the temple till we're where we sway,
Right by my side, no need to feel alone not tonight because,

We can try to find a route around, (a route around)
All my troubles fading out now,
Time to pick it up now,
Things are pickin up now,
We can try to find a route around, (a route around)
All my troubles fading out now,
Time to pick it up now,
Things are pickin up now.

Things are pickin up now

We can try to find a route around, (a route around)
All my troubles fading out now,
Time to pick it up now,
Things are pickin up now,
We can try to find a route around, (a route around)
All my troubles fading out now,
Time to pick it up now,
Things are pickin up now. ---
