Let's sit back and relax and get comfortable
Now close your eyes, now make it right

Don't point your finger at me
Don't you know it's you why you're suffering?
You're why you're suffering

I've got my mind set at ease
Don't you know it's you why you're suffering?
You're why you're suffering

I've got my reasons to live
Don't you know it's you why you're suffering?
You're why you're suffering

I've got my mind set at ease
Don't you know it's you why you're suffering?
You're why you're suffering

You are your suffering
You're why you're suffering---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
