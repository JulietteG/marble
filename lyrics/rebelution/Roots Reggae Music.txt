(feat. Don Carlos)

Were grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music

Higher self-meditation
The music brings upon me
Mixed with the healing of the nation
Well now thats all I need
Cuz its the perfect combination
Were moving at our own speed
Were talking higher concentration
So keep it moving with me
Yeah let me tell you now

Were grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music

We wanna move we wanna groove
We wanna move we wanna play it non-stop
We wanna move we wanna groove
We wanna move we wanna play it non-stop
Because you cant stop this feeling
You cant stop this groove
Cant stop this music
You cant kill this mood
Music in the message
The message in the music
Never leave sight
In the right time
Itll give light
Well let me tell you now ---
