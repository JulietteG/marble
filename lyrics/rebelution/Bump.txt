So hear me how on the loud, It's a good time.
Pretend you want to smile not to frown unless you're all shut down and you might not sound, 
time flies by and you just found out, 
your almost to the point where you can't turn back. 
You got a level ten on a one way track, 
don't tell me there's an end to the road, your goals set I know,
don't think that you can go alone ok. 
But keep me up to date, I promise you I'll never lose the faith when you get up and wanna escape to a scary world.
The old cleche is true, you do what you gotta do
trying to put out something new, im always at the edge of my seat
constantly containing that kinetic energy
constantly im bringing in the sweet melody
