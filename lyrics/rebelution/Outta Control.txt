You think you know, but you don't.
Wish I could read your mind but I can't so I wont
I wish that I could say what it is I'd like to say
Instead I've got my tongue twisted up and tied away
I'm tryin to do my best
I guess I know that failure is a lesson
I've been guessin and stressin and tryin to make up my decision and
Ohthat's how life goes
Every time I want poetry, she wants crows, I'm too slow
Tryin to pick it up though
To me you're really it, ya know it's me you feel sorry for

This is out of control
Why can't I forget it though?
Damn, why can't I forget it though?
This is out of control
Why can't I forget it though?
Damn, well can I forget it though?

At least I got my brains
At least I got my wit
Watch me goin over see the conversation slip
I'm feelin kinda twisted also kinda sick
I try to counter and I wish that I could even never miss girl
Yeah you know them things ain't easy
I try to understand it believe me
I guess I want the real thing
Oh girl, I want the real thing baby

And this is out of control
Why can't I forget it though?
Damn, Why can't I forget it though?
This is out of control
Why can't I forget it though?
Damn, why can't I forget it though?---Lyrics submitted by Mason Thompson.
