When we come down, oh yeah yeah yeah
We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why
Baby, that's all I got

When we come down, oh yeah yeah yeah
We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why
Oh baby, that's all I got
Oh baby, that's all I got

Is this the kind of sound that you want to hear?
Is this the kind of vibe that you want to feel?
Well I'm the type of guy that you'll never fear
You can do your thing then come near
Maybe I'm, I'm caught up in the thing that you know I like
Or check it one time baby overnight
Or we could make a grand escape
Or we can roll high on our break
I'm all about the look that you're giving me
I'm all about the dance moves you're letting free
I'm all about a sweet sounding loving spree
So listen for my melody
And maybe I'm, I'm caught up in the thing that you know I like
So we can make time, baby overnight
Check it one time baby overnight
Or we can roll high by the way

And when we come down, oh yeah yeah yeah
We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why
Oh baby, that's all I got

When we come down, oh yeah yeah yeah
We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why
Oh baby, that's all I got
Oh baby, that's all I got

This is the kind of sound that I want to hear
This is the kind of vibe that I want to feel
And you're the type of girl baby on the real
Check it one time, what's the deal?
Maybe I'm, I'm caught up in the thing that you know I like
Or check it one time baby overnight
Or we could make a grand escape
Or we can roll high by the way

And when we come down, oh yeah yeah yeah
We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why
Oh baby, that's all I got

When we come down, oh yeah yeah yeah
We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why
Oh baby, that's all I got
Oh baby, that's all I got---
