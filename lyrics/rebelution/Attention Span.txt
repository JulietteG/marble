Whoa now whoaaa
woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

Who can this be?
This s stranger at my door.
Although I know Ive seen he once before.
come on,
Why cant I remember her name now?
But in a way it s best that I dont say.

Its a pleasuse to meet you.
Once again for the night.
I cannot promise my focus,
Is it me or is it my attention span?
Whoa now whoaaa
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

I see the way you stare at me oh girl
I like the way you sway your hair and twirl
God damn why cant I remember your name now
But in a way its best that I dont say

Its a pleasure to meet you.
Once again for the night.
I cannot promise my focus,
Is it me or is it my attention span?
Whoa now whoaaa
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

Is this more than just routine 
Weigh it down on me
Give me more than just my needs
Weigh it down on me
And we're still riding high
And we're still riding high

I see the way you stare at me oh girl
I like the way you sway your hair and twirl
God damn why cant I remember your name now
But in a way its best that I dont say

Its a pleasure to meet you.
Once again for the night.
I cannot promise my focus,
Is it me or is it my attention span?
Whoa now whoaaa
woah oh, woah oh, woah oh---Lyrics submitted by Symantha.
