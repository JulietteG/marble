What an education
Tell them how we tell it R way
What a situation
Tell them how we tell it R way
Oh yaa yaa
You down with Rebelution
Tell them how we tell it R way
Oh yaa yaa
Who makes the rules everyday
I say we tell them how we tell it R way
That's right

Hey you I'm talking about intelligent designs
Cause this should be the last time
You fooling people about the youth are on the rise
Rebels on the prowl in disguise
Question regulations my friend
Patriots long in and the sky's looking over lies
Let us fight lighten I
Now thank the children cause their lifes like a fragile mind
Flip the hook, catch the bait, separate, church and state

Oh at the end of their day
They lie awaken at that thinking that great
Tomorrow comes and they regret what they say
The youth they learn in the right way

Oh at the end of their day
They lie awaken at that thinking that great ya
Tomorrow comes and they regret what they say
The youth they learn in the right way

Oh yaa yaa yaa

What a revelation of how they say
What an aggrevation of how I say
Cause you know they shouldn't be learning about that in school ya
Well you say I'm the one but I know whos the fool

What an education
What a situation
You down with rebelution
Tell them how we tell it R way
Oh yaa yaa
Who makes the rules everyday
I say we tell them how we tell it R way
That's right

Hey you I'm talking about intelligent designs
Cause this should be the last time
You fooling people about the youth are on the rise
Rebels on the prowl in disguise
Question regulations my friend
Patriots long in and the sky's looking over lies
Let us fight lighten I
Now thank the children cause their lifes like a fragile mind
Flip the hook, catch the bait, separate, church and state

Oh at the end of their day
They lie awaken at that thinking that great
Tomorrow comes and they regret what they say
The youth they learn in the right way

Oh at the end of their day
They lie awaken at that thinking that great ya
Those politicians well they say what they say
The youth they learn in the right way

What a revelation of how they say
What an aggrevation of how I say
Cause you know they should'ntbe learning about that in school ya
Well you say I'm the one but I know who's the fool

Ya oohhh... wooaah yeahhh ---Lyrics submitted by ronald nallos.
