(feat. Collie Buddz)

I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Hate to be the one
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Because youre in a war zone
Get out now you dont know
I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya

Now let me tell you as a friend, my friend
I can see it happen all over again
Yeah let me tell you as a friend, my friend
Theres a theme going on and its a trend
Well take another look,
Shes the type of crook
Call it kiss and run,
The most devious of looks,
And she dont really care
Take take and now she took
But the men still stare
And theyre reaching for their books
So tell me why they say Im better than the rest
Shes a little beauty how much meaner can she get,
I love her pretty eyes and Im chasing for the tail
Devil in the detail, you should let her sail

Oh never can I fail oh no
Why? Because she said I love you boy
And love will prevail
Nothing that can ever go wrong
So how can I mess up?
In every single way

Friend
Dollars not cents
Thousands gone, and now shes off again
Can you believe it my friend?
Flash, gone
Gone with the wind to the next top dog
Well come on I dont want to be alone
She says she loves me, thats how I know
Love grows you know
I swear on my soul
Well thats why I can never let her go ---
