A heart like lion, burning like fire 
Waiting just to be set free 
A heart like a lion, burning like fire 
How can I bear captivity 
Some they tell me I'm a fool, a fool who walks this road alone 
So afraid of making changes, remember that nothing is carved in stone 
Oh tell me why we're so afraid of the secrets locked with in our souls 
Everything that we're made of is dying just to be exposed 

So don't turn your back on yourself, there's nowhere to run 
You know your life's not a practice run 
It's time to wake up you're mind 
For maybe tomorrow will never come or maybe it will but by then it's too late 
There's nothing left to do but cry 
So now you cry and you don't know why, and now you cry but you don't know why 

A heart like lion, burning like fire 
Waiting just to be set free 
A heart like a lion, burning like fire 
How can I bear captivity 
Some they tell me I'm a fool, a fool who walks this road alone 
So afraid of making changes, remember that nothing is carved in stone 
Oh tell me why we're so afraid of the secrets locked with in our souls 
Everything that we're made of is dying just to be exposed 

So what you want to be now well it's time to realize 
That everything you need now has been right in front of your eyes 
Don't point your fingers and blame, remember it's never too late to change 
Don't point your fingers and blame, remember it will be okay 

So don't turn your back on yourself, there's nowhere to run 
You know your life's not a practice run 
It's time to wake up you're mind 
For maybe tomorrow will never come or maybe it will but by then it's too late 
There's nothing left to do but cry 
So now you cry and you don't know why, and now you cry but you don't know why  

A heart like lion, burning like fire 
Waiting just to be set free 
A heart like a lion, burning like fire 
How can I bear captivity 
Some they tell me I'm a fool, a fool who walks this road alone 
So afraid of making changes, remember that nothing is carved in stone 
Oh tell me why we're so afraid of the secrets locked with in our souls 
Everything that we're made of is dying just to be exposed ---
