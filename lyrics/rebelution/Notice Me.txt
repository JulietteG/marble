If I had you by my side,
Day and night
Years Ive been waiting on you
Now Im on the day you arrived
All aligned
Emotions always add up to
Dont wanna be lonely
Everybodys saying
I could never live that way
Dont wanna be alone
Me, Myself and I
Baby did you notice me?

Well tell me
Tell me what youre thinking
I was only hoping that you noticed
Well even just for a second
I was only hoping that you noticed me
Tell me what youre feeling
I was only hoping that you know this
Well even just for a second
I was only hoping that you noticed me

Now as the days pass by
I cant deny it
Caught up in corner of time
I gotta give you a sign
Get your attention
Cant get you off my mind
Dont wanna be lonely
Everybodys saying
I could never live that way
Dont wanna be alone
Me, Myself and I
Baby did you notice me? ---
