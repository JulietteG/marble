Look straight ahead in the distance oh yeah there's a nightcrawler
You'd better move quick, don't you know she's a night stalker
Look straight ahead in the distance oh yeah there's a nightcrawler
Yeah you'd better move quick, don't you know she's a night stalker

She'll take away all the love that you feel, she'll want to suck up and steal
She wants to look around town with her wicked eye, but we'll love and come real
She'll try to cover herself in the underground, she thinks she's got it locked down
But take it from me she's so lonely


Look straight ahead in the distance
Yes there's a nightcrawler walking with her fist clenched, but raise up
And feed her some happiness
And before you know it she'll be smiling with some love
And yes, allright now let me tell you what we're trying to suggest:
Once again, Rebelution on a loving quest
Tell her to look at the ocean when the sun sets
And then put out our hands for the unfortunate
Allright pick up the slack from the wickedness
Straigh up clean up your manners and your etiquette


Look straight ahead in the distance, oh yeah there's a nightcrawler
Yeah you'd better move quick, don't you know she's a night stalker
Look straight ahead in the distance, oh yeah there's a nightcrawler
Yeah you'd better move quick, don't you know she's a night stalker


Late night, 3 in the morning yeah, you can hear her footsteps one after the other and...
Nobody ever seen her talk back, nobody ever seen her walking on the right track
Tell me do you know where your soul is?
You glitter but the gold's up in the night's mist, and it's crawling up on ya
How many people in this house tonight feelin' that sense of aggravation on a lonely night


Look straight ahead in the distance
Yes there's a nightcrawler walking with her fist clenched, now raise up
And feed her some happiness
And before you know it she'll be smiling with some love
And yes, allright now let me tell you what we're trying to suggest
Once again, Rebelution on a loving quest
Tell her to look at the ocean when the sun sets
And put out our hands for the unfortunate allright
And pick up the slack from the wickedness
Straigh up clean up your manners and your etiquette allright


Look straight ahead in the distance, oh yeah there's a nightcrawler
Yeah you'd better move quick, don't you know she's a night stalker
Look straight ahead in the distance, oh yeah there's a nightcrawler
Yeah you'd better move quick, don't you know she's a night stalker---Lyrics submitted by maije.
