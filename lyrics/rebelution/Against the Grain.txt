Look out, watch out
They come for trouble
You cant understand my struggle
So much to contain
Now its me against the grain
So call me by my name
I rise up
People chat and say
Well yeah the haters gonna hate
Now its me against the grain

Rise, rise
Come on and rise
Rise up to the top now
Try and never stop
Now rise

Look out, watch out
Theyre in for trouble
Yeah I power through my struggle
They say that Im insane
Well its me against the grain
They try and call me names
I rise up
Some people never change
Well I dont care for what they say
Now its me against the grain

Rise, rise
Come on and rise
Rise up to the top now
Try and never stop
Now rise

To power through and through its a constant struggle
But we got what takes to push on and survive
Through battles I remain
I rise up
Knowledge I retain
Well yeah they say Im out the game
Now its me against the grain ---
