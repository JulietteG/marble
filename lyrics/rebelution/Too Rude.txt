No time to deal with ya
I'm coming real with ya
Yes I'm gonna tell you how I feel
Cause I'm feeling the times like shorter than I thought
And your words might spark another fight
And that why I sing the situation
Now listen closely patience is the demonstration
Like why ya gotta be so tough and make a statement
You're too rude take note and no more hating

You're too rude
Yes you're too rude
I'm speaking to you yeah ya know you're too rude
Yes you're too rude
Why you gotta bring such attitude?

First thing I notice when you speak
You sound as if the world hates you that's why you seek
To punish everybody every face and everything
Yet nobody's mad at you learn some gratitude, yeah!
You wanna know the missing piece?
What you need is love with a two fold increase
And you can find that something that lies underneath
But you're too rude face the problem and see

That you're too rude
Yes you're too rude
Oh man I'm speaking to you ya you know you're too rude
Yes you're too rude
Why you gotta bring such attitude?

Why you come in and have a fit?
Control yourself you mean that much to me

Why you come in and have a fit?
Control yourself you mean that much to me ---
