Woke up this morning with my life on the line
Open my eyes and with a deepness I sigh
I dreamt my baby up and left me behind
But there she is beside me asleep lookin' fine

Whoah oh.. yeah!

I took a walk out on the streets in the night
With her in mind it's the finest of times
I'll give her lovin' till the day that I die
As long as she knows it and I know she's mine

Whoah oh.. yeah!

Thank God I got you by my side
I woke up empty now a new feelin' the resides
Oh I.. oh I
Thank God I got you by my side
I woke up empty now a new feelin' the resides
Oh I.. oh I

Whoah oh.. yeah!

Whoah oh.. yeah!---
