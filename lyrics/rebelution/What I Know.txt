Destination unknown but I had this vision 
In my minds eye 
this is my decision
Every single dream every single fantasy every single love every single enemy
Its all for me
Do you believe that you can change the world?
Do you believe that you can change the world? 

Freedom of speech freedom of truth your freedom to do
What the fuck you heart wants you to do its all for you 
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous 
Is it all a dream or can you obtain it
Everybody seems to be selling out their souls for the fame
We fucking love sex drugs and rock and roll
Maybe one day we will realize 
That the answers in our heart
But were killing our own lives
And it's tearing us apart
One life to live gonna make it positive
For this world that we live in 
This is my decision

Time for me to make to make it on my own now 
Here I go watch me go where I go now
I don't know what road I'm gonna go down 
All I know is what I know and what I know now


So I'm tired of the questions I'm tired of second guessing
Everyday of my life is just another lesson
Don't know what I'm destined for my life is a mess and
All I want to do is get out and fly
Now I sit and I trip fucking life wanna quit
But I can't and I won't here I am all alone
Another day another dollar 
No money in my pocket 
I walk over to the mic turn it on
Time to rock it
This is my version of a sermon 
Straight from my heart I will spill every word and
All I wanna do is live a life that's certain 
To find the love that I've been searching for

Time for me to make to make it on my own now 
Here I go watch me go where I go now
I don't know what road I'm gonna go down 
All I know is what I know and what I know now

Time for me to make to make it on my own now 
Here I go watch me go where I go now
I don't know what road I'm gonna go down 
All I know is what I know and what I know now 
Time for me......Time for me.....---Lyrics submitted by giselle.
