Girl I'm going crazy. Cus I can't get you off my mind. Seems like the only thing that I think about. Oh oh oh! Well is you all the time. I have no words to express the way I feel about you. I found my hearts desire. Baby it's you!!!

You give me everything that I want. You give me more than I need. What is a guy to give a girl who seems to have everything? Oh too much time is never enough time to be spent with you. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes its true.

You're no ordinary girl, yea you always speak your mind.
You're no ordinary girl, yea you're one of a kind.
You're no ordinary girl, well i can see it in your eyes.
You're no ordinary girl, oh yea thats all right!

I've been around here for sometime. Oh and yes I've seen some things. But not anything comes close to the love that you bring. You know exactly who you are. You know just who you wanna be. Oh i can't believe this love, oh it is happening to me. Oh so much fear to face to get me where I am. It's clear for me to see that this was never my plan. But here we are now girl, oh just me and you. I'm lovin every minute that I spend with you. WOAH OH OH YEAH YEAH YEAH!!

You're no ordinary girl, yea you always speak your mind. 
You're no ordinary girl, yea you're one of a kind. 
You're no ordinary girl, oh i can see it in your eyes.
You're no ordinary girl, oh yea that's all right! But oh yea that's all right!
