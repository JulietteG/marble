Now I gotta make my rounds
Where can I lay you down?
Im gonna miss your love tonight
You know I really love your sound
Where can I leave you now?
Im gonna miss your love tonight

Well I say hey
Count me in
Always
Thats all I wanted
Was to say
Always

Maybe in another life
You I tried to find
But all had been neglected
And youre so true to form
Nah you know I cant ignore
The way that we connected ---
