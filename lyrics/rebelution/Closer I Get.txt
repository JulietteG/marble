(feat. John Popper)

People say it just doesnt matter but,
The closer I get, Im giving in, I cant escape, damn what a shame.
Listen to me just for a minute,
I can be quick no gimmick.
Ive got a plan we should live it.
The closer I get, I can't relate,
This aint our place, let us go far far away.
Find a new home, rules of our own, you and me both are the same.
Try to be strong, baby come on now, come on.
Lie after lie, so many times, when I try to find a peace of mind.

Ive got love for you when the time gets rough
When all the stress adds up,
When you say Ive had enough.

Got love for, you when the time gets rough.
When all the stress adds up,
When you say Ive had enough.

Whatever happened to the good times?
We should create for ourselves, not rely on.
Theyll never get a hold of me.
Simple you see, simplicity.
Yeah, the closer I get, I can't relate, I cant escape, oh the pain.
Ive been lied all the time, when I'm tryin to find a peace of mind.

Ive got love for you when the time gets rough.
When all the stress adds up,
When you say Ive had enough.

Got love for, you when the time gets rough.
When all the stress adds up,
When you say Ive had enough.

Yes I found my own way out,
Im going all the way,
Until the people all find out,
They're going all the way down. ---
