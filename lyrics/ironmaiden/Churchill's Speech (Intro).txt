We shall go onto the end.
We shall fight in France,
We shall fight on the seas and oceans,
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strenght in the air,
We shall defend our island,
Wathever the cost may be,
We shall fight on the beach,
We shall fight on the landing ground,
We shall fight in field and in street,
We shall fight in hills,
We shall never surrender.---Lyrics submitted by Tristan.
