We shall go on to the end
We shall fight in France
We shall fight on the seas & oceans
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing the strength in the air
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be
We shall fight on the beaches
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the field and in the streets
We shall fight in the hills
We shall never surrender---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
