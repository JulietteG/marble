I met her in Amsterdam, year 2000.
Brown hair and blue eyes.
Ohh my god! Yess! She made me nervous.
And suddenly, a moment full of harmony.
she came over and asks: Do you want to dance?
And I said: Yes! 

I never thought that this could happen next to me
I've always felt secure.
But, she killed, like poison that you never can feel...
and I cry for more.
I was falling as all the flowers die,
And hope that you come...
One day, to find a place, where all the souls are lying.

What had I ever done to deserve this
My shadow gases up to the sky
I was falling
As all the flowers are dying,
and i hope that you come one day, and find the place
where all the souls are lying

I never thought that this could happen next to me
I've always felt secure.
But, she killed, like poison that you never can feel...
and I cry for more.
I was falling as all the flowers die,
And hope that you came...
One day, to find a place, where all the souls are lying---Lyrics submitted by Matt Labour.
