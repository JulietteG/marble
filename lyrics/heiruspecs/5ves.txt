o !!(1..2..3..4..5..1..2..3..4..5)
Its for the live shows, its for the beats and
Its for the woman who sleeps under my sheets so
Its for the energy which builds exponentially 
Its for my friends, who keep on reinventing me
Its for the live shows, its for the beats and
Its for the woman who sleeps under my sheets so
Its for the energy which builds exponentially 
Its for my friends, who keep on reinventing me

On my fifth day, my day off a month early,
the early work is the big bite by little birdie
the early bird is chased and caught by the cat
watch your back little bird,
because Im up from my nap
yes, I got a cable TV, and I got a cable mic
its only got (1) channel, but the reception is tight
Im flying by the seat of my pants, 
so at the end of the night, your records come alive
and beg for the daylight.
(5) miles away my brothers in his room
playing games like star craft 
burning other people to flames
and likewise, right here, right now
the show of aggression (5) fingers,
(1) My next lesson, the session gets deeper
follow me through, I brought my pen and pad
and just a little inspiration, to guide you with,
you can just listen and learn
itchin the burn, vision for the rhythm 
were given them to return  
sayin:

[Chorus]
Its for the live shows, its for the beats and
Its for the woman who sleeps under my sheets so
Its for the energy which builds exponentially 
Its for my friends, who keep on reinventing me
Its for the live shows, its for the beats and
Its for the woman who sleeps under my sheets so
Its for the energy which builds exponentially 
Its for my friends, who keep on reinventing me

Wake up, its early morning, get dressed, 
turn on my radio, another beautiful day,
in my neighbourhood,
since the mornings when Im mostly inspired,
though Im still a bit tired, I write, 
because Im feeling like the flavours good 
Saturday was yesterday, last week
and nothings open now except for coffee shops, 
which really aint my style
I smile as I writing, this world is still asleep
its just me and the sun, 
and were conversin for a while
now its (5) 50 (5), in the early on
the shadow, on my lawn become the midget welder
sun moves along
a little bit more hustle as I nod to my neighbours
they have no idea, they gon be in this song
theyre cool, still the dopest person out there
my mother, she accepts me for my rapping
as if rapping was my lover,
and she, she accepts me for my rappin of course
because Bart needs inspiration, needs a source
dont blink at (5) D M on this day
Im driving by and drivin away, tryin to say
that my throat hurts, Im all talk 
and really no work and 
everybodys at the writing callin feelings adjourn
so what doesnt make you wince now
can only make you better   
wed all be better swimmers if the world was really wetter
the moral of the story is to remain untold
it never really ends
it just twists and unfolds 
sayin:

[Chorus]
Its for the live shows, its for the beats and
Its for the woman who sleeps under my sheets so
Its for the energy which builds exponentially 
Its for my friends, who keep on reinventing me
