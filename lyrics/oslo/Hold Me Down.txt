Hurry up
I'm wasting my time
Don't care about us
We should be fine
Don't know yet
But we dance together
Sometimes I guess
I'm only dreaming forever

I've given up your chance
I liked you at one glance
We started up romance
Let's get up and come on

You stand around me
I stand alone
I don't belong here
Please set me down
You stand around me
I stand alone
I don't belong here
Oh help me hold me down
[x2]

You gave me up
Maybe for another
I don't care anymore
I'm down with her
And now we dance
Sitting here on the floor
My mind is blowing hard
Show me the exit door

I've given up your chance
I loved you at one glance
We started up romance
Let's get on and come one

You stand around me
I stand alone
I don't belong here
Please set me down
You stand around me
I stand alone
I don't belong here
Oh help me hold me down
[x2]

Let's get up and come one!

You stand around me
I stand alone
I don't belong here
Please set me down
You stand around me
I stand alone
I don't belong here
Oh help me hold me down
