Theres a village hidden deep in the valley, among the pine trees half forlorn,
And there on a sunny morning, little Jimmy Brown was born.

Boom, boom, boom, boom

All the chapel bells were ringing, in the little valley town,
And the songs that they were singing, was for baby Jimmy Brown.

And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above,
Lead us not into temptation, bless this hour of meditation, guide him with eternal love.

Theres a village hidden deep in the valley, beneath the mountains high above,
And there twenty years thereafter, Jimmy was to meet his love.

Boom, boom, boom, boom

All the chapel bells were ringing, twas a great day in his life.
Cause the songs that they were singing, was for Jimmy and his wife.

And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above,
Lead us not into temptation, bless o Lord this celebration, may their lives be filled with love.

From the village, hidden deep in the valley, one rainy morning dark and gray,
a sewing his way to heaven, Jimmy Brown had passed away.

Boom, boom, boom, boom

Just a lonely bell was ringing, in the little valley town.
Twas farewell that it was singing, to our good old Jimmy Brown.  Little Jimmy Brown.

And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above,
Lead us not into temptation, may his soul find the salvation, of thy great eternal love.---Lyrics submitted by Robert Dabe.
