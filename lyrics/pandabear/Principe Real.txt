Sheep dog
Been nipping at your heels all day
Sheep dog

Tsk tsk tsk

Leapfrog
Don't have a way to stay in line
And so you're mine

So close
As gentle as a sleeping baby boy

You can see a sheep where she lay
You can keep a temptress at bay
To break what's in the DNA
You should lead them to a new place
Cocoon a space to say so simply
Fool these ugly thoughts what are they

So you're mine

Good guy
Don't know you when you hide away
You stay inside

So close
As gentle as a sleeping baby boy

You can see a sheep where she lay
You can keep a temptress at bay
To break what's in the DNA
You should lead them to a new place
Cocoon a space to say so simply
Fool these ugly thoughts what are they

So you're mine---
