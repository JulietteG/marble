Ain't fate, just me
Come a cropper for the weak stuff that you stew
Ain't fate, just me
A cripple on his feet again you say
Stay there while I move
Stay scared while I improve
But it don't mean I'll do it like you want me to
But it do mean I'll do it like you need me to
But it don't mean I'll do it like you want me to
So good, so good
You got it so good
So good, so good
Damn it, so good
So good, it's so good, so good
Get it day to day
Day after day
So good

Day to day
Day after day
So good---
