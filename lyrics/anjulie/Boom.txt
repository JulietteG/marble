Im getting myself in something i dont wanna
Im getting caught up in him but i dont wanna
Im getting off track and i cant control a thing (thing)
Im telling myself its not a good idea
but the more i hesitate 
the more and more it feels
Im tryna erase his face from my memory

And then a boom shalocka 
Hes walking up a to me
Boom shalocka
He starts to the talking to me
Boom shalocka
My hearts skips a boom
Shalocka locka boom boom

The more I hang there the more I get wrapped up in him
Imagine myself in the chair I was sitting in
And every little thing he said coming back to me
To me
The more I get scared of losing 
Im afraid to say
Where can I go at the same time it excites me
Gotta get him outta my head
Get on with me

And then a boom shalocka 
Hes walking up a to me
Boom shalocka
He starts to the talking to me
Boom shalocka
My hearts skips a boom
Shalocka locka boom boom
Boom Shalocka
Eyes come in contact
Boom Shalocka
Staring me down 
Talk a
Boom Shalocka
My heart skips a boom
Shalocka locka aa

He make my head go
Boom boom
He make my breath go
Shooka looka
Wherever I go
Boom boom
And everything goes
Shooka looka

I tell myself
No Im not gonna do this
I promise myself
No Im not gonna do this
Doesnt matter what he says
I know hes no good for me
No no no no

And then a boom shalocka 
Hes walking up a to me
Boom shalocka
He starts to the talking to me
Boom shalocka
My hearts skips a boom
Shalocka locka boom boom
Boom Shalocka
Eyes come in contact
Boom Shalocka
Staring me down 
Talk a
Boom Shalocka
My heart skips a boom
Shalocka locka 

Ah ah

He make my heart go
my heart
my heart 
my heart---Lyrics submitted by Dira.
