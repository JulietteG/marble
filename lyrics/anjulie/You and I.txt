Last night
Woke up in a dream
Red and white
Couldnt stop screaming
Shadows
Comin in close to me
Yeah

But the
Suns out
Stinging in my eyes
Windows
Open up red sky
Breathe in
Smells like summer
Yeah

And the stars are out
Baby its a bad idea I know
But the stars are loud
If somebody told me thered be nobody else but
You and I
The nights gettin darker with you
You and I
My hearts gettin louder with you
You and I
My minds gettin dirty with you
You, you and I

And last week
You were with some chick
The same bed, barely sleepin
You didnt know
That soon youd be next to me
Yeah

In the
Purple sky
Head on my chest
Moonlight
Light up my vintage dress
Tangled up
In your back seat
Yeah

And the stars are out
Baby its a bad idea I know
But the stars are loud
If somebody told me thered be nobody else but
You and I
The nights gettin darker with you
You and I
My hearts gettin louder with you
You and I
My minds gettin dirty with you
You, you and I

You and I, I I I I
You and I, I I I I
You and I, I I I I
You and I, I I I I

And the stars are out
Baby its a bad idea I know
But the stars are loud
If somebody told me thered be nobody else but
You and I
The nights gettin darker with you
You and I
My hearts gettin louder with you
You and I
My minds gettin dirty with you
You, you and I

You and I, I I I I
You and I, I I I I---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
