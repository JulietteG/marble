Send it out to the boy in the front row
Singing his heart out
I've been there before
Elbow to elbow
Lost in a crowd of screams
He dreams and knows 
They'll steal every word straight from your mouth
Dare you to breathe, we'll dare you to drown
It's over, just wake me when it's over
I will thank you for hanging around this town

It's a long way back home from here
Just tell me what you want
'Cause I'm over and out, but I'm not done
Overreacting, 'cause I'm not acting like I'm somebody else
'Cause that's not me

Back it up to three long years ago
To a little town in north Jersey
Was a teenager back back then
Dreaming of a big dream - to make it
Put your hands on my heart
Come on, put your faith in me
Lay your life on the line and just believe

It's a long way back home from here
Just tell me what you want
'Cause I'm over and out, but I'm not done
Overreacting, 'cause I'm not acting like I'm somebody else
This is my inspiration
Yeah, I'll never meet your expectations coming down on me
Still I'm not giving in, no
It's getting hard to breathe
Under pressure I'm living
I'm ready to be
(Not turning back around)

We only get one chance
One true shot to make it
Hold the wind in your sails and take it
For a ride you can't turn back the time
Hold on tight

We'll make it now (we'll make it now) 
It's a long way back home from here
Just tell me what you want
'Cause I'm over and out
But I'm not done
Overreacting---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca.
