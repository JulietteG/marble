I love beach music
I always have and I always will
There ain't no other kind of music in the world that gives me quite the thrill
When I hear...
60 minute man, and walkin' up the one-way street
He's up on the roof, he's under the boardwalk
Summertime's a-callin' me
Ooh
Bom bom bom, bom bom bom wee-ooh, beach music
Bom bom bom, bom bom bom wee-ooh, beach music

I love beach music
'Cause born with it in my bones
I learned to shag on the beach, with the salt in the air, and the sand at my feet
Yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh Ms. Grace
39-21-46
What kind of fool do you think I am
When forever, and ever, it will stand, yes

I love beach music
Every single day of my life
I love beach music,
You know that I do

Doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

I love beach music
Every single day of my life
I love beach music,
You know that I do
Woah, woah, woah

I love beach music
I love beer-drinkin' music
Shaggin' kinda music like you hear those d's
I love beach music
I'm talkin' about music by The Towns, The Clovers, The Catalinas, The Embers!
I love beach music,
You know that I do!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
