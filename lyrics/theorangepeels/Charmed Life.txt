She knows she's a beautiful girl
But there's so many around these days
She used to have the world on a string
But it's changing in so many ways
And sometimes when she feels like a failure
In the heat of the moment, she can curse like a sailor
But she reserves all her wrath for the jailer
Who doesn't know what he did wrong

He knows he's an ordinary Joe
And he's playing the hand he was dealt
But he wishes there was more to this life
Than just always tightening the belt
He says he'd like to resume his education
But that train has sailed, and that boat has left the station
So he'll just wait until the next two week vacation
And just try to get along

'Cause it's a charmed life we're leading
But it cuts like a knife
And it never stops bleeding
Even for a charmed life

They know things will always be a struggle
But they'll manage somehow to get by
They'll take whatever life decides to throw them
'Cause theirs is not to question why
And there will always be those special times
When all the pieces fit and the planets align
And the jewel in the crown will forever shine
We'll raise them all up in song

'Cause it's a charmed life we're leading
But it cuts like a knife
And it never stops bleeding
Even for a charmed life

And there will always be those special times
When all the pieces fit and the planets align
And the jewel in the crown will forever shine
We'll raise them all up in song

'Cause it's a charmed life we're leading
But it cuts like a knife
And it never stops bleeding
Even for a charmed life

Well it's something to believe in
A little garden of Eden
This very charmed life we're leading---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Kin.
