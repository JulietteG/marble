Don't walk away
Won't you stay?
You know the way I love say things I could never
You're so clever I just had to let you know
You're such a joy to hang around
I love the way you put me down
I was under the weather
Now I'm better
Say you'll stay

So you say you're leaving 
I'm having a hard time believing 
that you could just walk out on it now
So you say you're going
Seems for a while you've been knowing
You would be leaving any day
Why can't you stay?
Hey

Don't walk away
Won't you stay?
You know the way I love say things I could never
You're so clever I just had to let you know
You're such a joy to hang around
I love the way you put me down
I was under the weather
Now I'm better
Say you'll stay

So I thought I knew you
But I've been looking right through you
You left me here standing in the rain
And so I hope you're alright
Everything seems so black and white 
I remember when everything was gray
Why can't you stay?
Hey

Don't walk away
Won't you stay?
You know the way I love say things I could never
You're so clever I just had to let you know
You're such a joy to hang around
I love the way you put me down
I was under the weather
Now I'm better
Say you'll stay (3x)---Lyrics submitted by Erin Carney.
