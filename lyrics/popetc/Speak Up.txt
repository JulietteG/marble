all my lovers surround me like virgins clean today
waste deep in the water pushing my body away
oh what lengths we go to putVIRGINS LYRICS the past away
how many drops will you squeeze out to explain what happened one day?

one of them stayed behind and trailed me from afar
i saw her eyes lit up like colors in the dark
but when our gazes met i was a half a world away
it still shortens my breath as i turn to sayICS

when we meet another way
you won't recognize my face
when we meet one way or another
you won't speak up, speak up, speak up

one day it soothes me the next it bleeds me dry
it plays out like a lifetime before the morning light
how beautiful it was to be anything at all
but somehow it strikes me the timing came a bit off

when we meet another way
you won't recognize my face
when we meet one way or another
you won't speak up, speak up, speak up---Lyrics submitted by John.
