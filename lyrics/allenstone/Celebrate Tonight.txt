Everybody's feeling the strain of the nine-to-five,
Forecast is calling for rain, but we're still alive, yes, we are,
You know the sun is peeking over the clouds, and the music's tight,
Drummer playing kick-drum proud as the bass takes flight, hey, hey,

Just celebrate tonight,
There's reason to feel right,
Everyone unite,
And just celebrate tonight,

Steady, child, don't get lost in your worried mind,
Doesn't matter what it costs, matters what you find, yeah,
Forget all of the pressure from all your dead lines, hey, hey,

Just celebrate tonight,
There's reason to feel right,
Everyone unite,
And just celebrate tonight,

Don't be afraid,
'Cause the sun's still warm in the shade,
You gotta keep your chin up,
And just celebrate this day,

Just celebrate tonight,
There's reason to feel right,
Everyone unite,
And just celebrate tonight,

Celebrate tonight, yeah,
There's reason to feel right,
Everyone unite,
And just celebrate tonight, yeah,
And just celebrate tonight, everybody,
Oh, we'll just celebrate tonight. ---
