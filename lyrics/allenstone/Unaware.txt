Every day the deficit grows, you spend more than you own 
Papa always said to me, keep a close eye on your authority 'cause 

You say that you care, I was unaware 
You say that you care, I was unaware 

All you do is push, pull, tear, we can't stretch it any farther 
All you do is push, pull, tear, we can't stretch it any farther 

Every day taxes increase, so is this our land or is this our lease? 
Papa says son, it's the land of the free, as he broke his back trying to 
make ends meet... 

You say that you care, I was unaware 
You say that you care, I was unaware 

All you do is push, pull, tear, we can't stretch this any farther 
All you do is push, pull, tear, we can't stretch this any farther 

You say that you care, I was unaware 
You say that you care, I was unaware 

All you do is push, pull, tear, we can't stretch this any farther 
All you do is push, pull, tear, we can't stretch this any farther---Lyrics submitted by Jacquelyn.
