Saw my reflection in the mirror, didn't recognize myself
I felt more distant and more useless than the dust upon the shelf
I tried to fix it but I only ended up hurting someone else
Oh lover can you hear me, I'm so scared and I need a little help

I've built so many bridges, then I sat and watched them burn
I had so many chances, never took the time to learn
If I could change the past, go back erase what I had done
I'd redo everything, youth is wasted on the young

Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young

Even the thought of me without you sends a shiver down my spine
I'd spend a lifetime on my knees for just the chance to keep you mine

And like a rocket I shot up and then I crashed and burned
I put the pieces back together as the seasons turned
If I could change the past, go back erase what I had done
Redo most everything, youth is wasted on the young

Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young

Wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young
Wasted on the young

Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young---
