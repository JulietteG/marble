Somebody pick up my pieces  
I'm scattered everywhere 
Help me put myself back together 
Put me somewhere way over there 
I wanna be taken out of contention 
I surrender my crown 
Somebody pick up my pieces
I think Im coming down

Well, I sure thought I had it 
But Lord it looks like it had me 
Coz the thing I thought was heaven 
Was just falling debris 
I may not be crazy 
But I sure got a hell of a start
Somebody come here and pick up my pieces 
I think I'm falling apart 

No don't follow my footsteps 
Step on over my trail 
Coz the road is too darn narrow 
An your footin could fail 
An the fall to the bottom 
It could tear you all apart 
And they'll be here pickin' up pieces
Of you and your heart 

Don't you follow my footsteps 
Step right on over my trail 
Coz the road is too darn narrow 
An your footin could fail 
An the faaawwwllll to the bottom 
It could tear you apart 
You'll be right back here pickin' up pieces
Of you and your heart 
They'll be here pickin' up pieces
Of you and your heart---Lyrics submitted by Richard.
