You can tell me that you want me
You can tell me that I`m fine
I don`t know what`;s up your sleeve
Bet I know what`s on your mindSooner or later
You`ll wanna get close to me
And then you`re gonna figure it out

Let the telephone ring ring
I`m breakin on the love thing
Breakin on the love thing
I`ve had enough of all that stuff
So I`m
Breakin on the love thing
I say goodbye
To all the sides of love

We can party on the weekend
We can hang out all night long
But we`re only gonna be friends
So don`t be getting me wrong

You can never say never
But I`ll never be that girl
Who never ever figures it out

So let the telephone ring ring
I`m breaking on the love thing
Breakin on the love thing
I`ve had enough of all that stuff
So I`m
Breakin on the love thing
I say goodbye
To all the sides of love

You`re driving me crazy
When you try so hard
Understand me baby
When I tell you these words
I swear you`ll never be happy again..---Lyrics submitted by Jamie Bennett.
