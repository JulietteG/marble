 My love's a weapon and I'm knocking 'em dead
I got a hear that's tough as leather
Get what I want and just forget 'em
Well this game you're playin' is a russian roulette
Just 'cause I'm sweet when we're together doesn't mean I'm yours forever

I never should have looked into your eyes
Now everybody's gonna see your appeal

Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my my bad reputation
Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we been makin'
'Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shining in my eyes
Ruinin', ruinin' my my bad reputation
Oh no, oh oh no, no, oh no
Oh oh, no no

Well I tell 'em tell 'em you're nothing to me
I tell 'em that you, you're just another
You're just like any other
Well I try to sell 'em but they ain't buyin' it
Baby they see me start to stutter when they ask if you're my lover

I'm losing sleep, what's gotten into me
I'm usually never this week baby

I have got to pull myself together but I can't control it
My lips they know what they want, everybody knows it
Once a girl controlled the world with words that piece the bone
Now I'm smiling like a lovesick puppet, everybody knows

'Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shining in my eyes
Ruinin', ruinin' my my bad reputation
Oh no---
