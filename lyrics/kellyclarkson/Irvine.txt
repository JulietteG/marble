Are you there?
Are you watching me?
As I lie here on this floor
They say you feel what I do
They say youre here every moment
Will you stay?
Stay till the darkness leaves
Stay here with me
I know youre busy, I know Im just one
But you might be the only one who sees me
The only one to save me

Why is it so hard?
Why cant you just take me?
I dont have much to go
Before I fade completely

Can you feel how cold I am?
Do you cry as I do?
Are you lonely up there all by yourself?
Like I have felt all my life
The only one to save mine

How are you so strong?
Whats it like to feel so free?
Your heart is really something
Your love, a complete mystery to me

Are you there watching me?
As I lie here on this floor
Do you cry, do you cry with me?
Cry with me tonight

Are you there?
Are you watching me?---Lyrics submitted by Paula.
