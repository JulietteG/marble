Just woke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line
You know that I've been thinking 'bout it for a while
Starting to think it's time I leave
Does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain,
 it's real,
 it's possible

[Chorus]
You say!
Can't change the winds
You say won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

Walking by myself I know
This lonely road's becoming my new home
But I don't stop 
I just keep moving on, and on
Ain't no need to dry my eyes
I haven't cried in quite some time
Everyday I fight it,
You know it's possible

[Chorus]
You say!
Can't change the winds
You say won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

Someone tell me why it's so hard taking chance
You draw the line and think that I won't ask for more
I will stumble and I'll make my own mistakes
But I won't worry about it anymore
It's impossible

[Chorus]
You say!
Can't change the winds
You say won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

It's impossible to you
Not impossible for me
Not impossible for me.....

Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

Just woke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line---Lyrics submitted by Dawn.
