If anyone asks
I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk

Whenever I see you
I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry? cry?

If anyone asks
I'll tell them we just grew apart
Yeah, what do I care
If they believe me or not (if they believe me or not)

Whenever I feel
Your memory is breakin' my heart
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry? cry?

I'm talkin' in circles
I'm lyin', they know it
Why won't this just stop for a while

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry? Cry?---Lyrics submitted by jen.
