I used to be a little bit shy
I kept my deepest feelings inside
Speaking up to you about my 
emotions has 
always been hard
But this just can't wait
Tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I wont let one more day 
pass without you 
explainin' what we are

This is gonna sound kinda silly
But I couldnt help but notice
the last time you kissed me 
you kept both eyes open 
Baby, can you tell me what does that mean?  
If you're looking over your shoulder
Then you dont need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you 
from doing what you wanna do
You dont wanna stick trust me it's cool
take no chance, get over you
No no 
Dont let me stop you, 
If you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that your into me
If it ain't true
No 
Don't let me stop you.

A lot of things I can take
Got a high thresh hold for pain.
but let's get one thing straight 
I'm not down to share you with anyone. 
If thats not what your looking for 
Nice knowing you but there's the door!! 
'cause I know I can find someone 
who'll give me what I want

This is gonna sound kind of silly
If you're looking over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
and I dont need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
you dont wanna stick
trust me it's cool
take no chance 
get over you
No no 
Don't let me stop you 
If you wanna leave
Baby you can leave
just don't pretend that your into me
If it ain't true, no,
don't let me stop you!!

Even if I end up broken hearted
I wont lie 
I don't wanna hear goodbye
But either way I'll be alright

Don't let me stop you 
from doing what you wanna do
you don't wanna stick trust me it's cool
take no chance
get over you
No no 
Don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just dont pretend that you're into me
If it aint true no,  
Don't let me stop you!!

Don't let me stop you 
from doing what you wanna do
you don't wanna stick trust me it's cool
take no chance
get over you (i'm over you!)
No no 
Don't let me stop you 
If you wanna leave baby you can leave (don't let me stop you)
Just dont pretend that you're into me (don't let me, don't let me!)
If it aint true no,  
Don't let me stop you!!---Lyrics submitted by Lacy.
