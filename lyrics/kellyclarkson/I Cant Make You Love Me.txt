Turn down the lights
Turn down the **
Turn down these voices
Inside my head

Lay down with me
Tell mi no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't petronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something it wont
Hearing the dark
And these final hours
I would lay down my heart
And I feel the power
But you wont
No you wont

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I close my eyes
And then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
When morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then
To give up this fight

And I would give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something it wont
Hearing the dark
And these final hours
I would lay down my heart
And I feel the power
But you wont
No you wont

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Penta.
