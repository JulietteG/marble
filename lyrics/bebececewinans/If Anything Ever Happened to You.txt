Sometimes I can't believe
How much you mean to me
I could never love anyone more

When I feel so empty inside
It's your love that helps keep me alive
You rescued this lonely heart
And I'd be so torn apart

If anything ever happened to you
How could I go on, tell me what would I do
Oh I'd have to be strong, find a way to get through
If anything ever happened to you

As I lay here sleeping at night
I pray God keeps you insight
The thought of losing you makes me cry
I don't think I could ever survive

If anything ever happened to you
How could I go on, tell me what would I do
Oh I'd have to be strong, find a way to get through
If anything ever happened to you

Cece you know
That I don't need possessions, oh babe
'Cause after all, all we really need
Is right here in our hearts
The love in our hearts is right here in my heart

I'd have to be strong
Don't make a way
If anything ever
If anything happened to you

If anything ever happened to you
How could I go on, tell me what would I do
Oh I'd have to be strong, find a way to get through
If anything ever happened to you---Lyrics submitted by Donna.
