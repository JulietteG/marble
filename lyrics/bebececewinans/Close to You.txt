I just wanna be close to you


VERSE:

Sunshine, moonlight, delight
Just a couple words describing who you are
Lovely (So lovely)
Want everyone to know why i'm in love with you

Patient and strong
Always no matter what I face you been there to bring me through
Just fine (right on) on time
It took awhile to see that your love was true


CHORUS:

Now no one can (undo)
Cuz I belong (to you)
until the end (of time)
Good to know (good to know your mind)
And all I want (to say)
Until my dying day
I just wanna be close to you


VERSE:

Honest and sweet
Heaven is where I wanna be where I am when i'm with you
Perfect (perfect) yes perfect
It took awhile to see that this love was true


CHORUS:


BRIDGE:

Now follow me sis

Say da da     
You say da da
I say da da
da da da da da da da da da da da da
da da  
da da
It took awhile to see, but now we know the truth


CHORUS:

How long will you stay

I just want to be close to you---Lyrics submitted by Vantresia.
