Ooh...ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...hoo...hoo...
Way higher, yeah
yeah
yeah

All I wanna do is just explain
Why that we feel the way we do {Ooh}
What a joy to share with you
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain
If anymore I need to say
The list goes on and on all day
I'll cherish that moment for life
And I know it might sound crazy
It's alright, take a seat, hold tight

Time to admit [Time we should admit it]
I'm so addicted, yeah
You see, He's taken my heart
And showed me the right way
No doubt about it [Doubt it, no doubt]
See, I'm lost without it, yeah
You see this love takes me higher
I didn't know why then
I found it was addictive love, yeah (Woo, hoo, yeah)

Now that we've evened up the score
Hey, what do you mean there's so much more
I need to tell why we adore
The reason why I smile when I, when I wake up
And also the reason why I dream {Reason why I dream}
My love, my joy, my everything
And I'll cherish that moment for life
And I know it might sound crazy {Crazy}
It's alright, take a seat, hold tight

Time to admit [Time we should admit it]
I'm so addicted, yeah
You see, He's taken my heart {Taken my heart, y'all}
And showed me the right way
There's no doubt about it, no [Doubt it, no doubt]
I'm lost without it, yeah
You see this love takes me higher {Yeah, yeah}
I didn't know why then
You see I found it was addictive love (Hey...yeah...yeah...)

So much love
He's given to me everything I longed for
Everything I need
That means I'm never alone, so glad
And everything I've dreamed and much more
(Much more, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) So much more
And I'll cherish (Cherish the moment) that moment for life
For the rest of my life, yeah, yeah
And I know it might sound crazy but {It's not crazy}, no
I'm not crazy
I've never known anyone to love me quite the way you do
And I tell you
It's hopeless, I've finally (Hopeless) noticed that
I'm just forever addicted, forever {Forever in love}, hey {Yeah, yeah, yeah}

Time to admit [Time we should admit it]
Hold tight
You see, He's taken my heart {Heart, y'all}
And showed me the right way [Showed me the way]
There's no doubt about it [Doubt it, no doubt] (Show me the right way)
See, I'm lost without it, yeah
You see this love takes me higher {Higher}
I didn't know why then {I didn't know why, I didn't know I was addicted}

Time to admit [Time we should admit it]
Hey, yes, I am
You see, He's taken my heart {My heart}
And showed me the right way [Showed me the way]
There's no doubt about it [Doubt it, no doubt]
See, I'm lost without it, yeah
You see this love takes me higher {A little bit higher}
I didn't know why then

Time to admit [Time we should admit it]
I'm so addicted, yeah
You see, He's taken my heart {Taken my heart, y'all}
And showed me the right way [Showed me the way]
There's no doubt about it [Doubt it, no doubt]
See, I'm lost without it, yeah
You see this love takes me higher
I didn't know why then---Lyrics submitted by Hiedy Eaton.
