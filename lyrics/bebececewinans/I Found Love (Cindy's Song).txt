Mmmmmm
When i found you...I found somebody who cares
When i found you...Found my most intimate prayer
When i found you...I found what every heart dreams of
When i found you...I found love

When I found you I found the rest of my life
When i found you i told all others good-bye
When i found you i saw my fears fly away like a dove
When I found you i found love (Mmmmmm)

I Know True love sounds crazy (Sounds Crazy)
But worth waiting for
You are the one...My only (My only)
Forever More

When I found you i found my fate in your arms
When i found you i found no cause for alarm
When I found you i knew this love was a gift from above
When i found love....yeah, yeah yeah

I Know True love sounds crazy (Sounds Crazy)
But worth waiting for
You are the one...My only (My only)
Forever More (Forever More)

When I found You I found the Skylar with style
When I found you...Found one more reason to smile
When I found you I knew I finally found enough
When I found You I Found Love 
When I found You I Found Love
When I found You I Found Love

I found Love 
I found Love---Lyrics submitted by Clay King.
