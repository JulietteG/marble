I called you brazen
called you whore right to your face
and watched you silently and publicly disgraced

I didn't notice
when you strengthened like a vice
but you were trembleing
and burned beneath the ice
ooh ooh____________

why dont you weep when i hurt you
why dont you weep when i cut you
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside
why dont you weep when i hurt you
why dont you weep when i cut you
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside

na na na na na
na na na na na
na na na na na

You said a prayer
and i betrayed you with a kiss
you never realised
that all had come to this
so keep your dignity
don't throw it all to waste
stronger feelings 
than you've ever had to face, ooh, ooh__________

why don't you weep when i hurt you
why don't you weep when i cut you
you don't bleed 
and the anger builds up inside
why dont you weep when i hurt you
why dont you weep when i cut you
you don't bleed 
and the anger builds up inside

na na na na na oh_______ ooh_________ oh

why don't you weep when i hurt you
why don't you weep when i cut you
you don't bleed 
and the anger builds up inside
why dont you weep when i hurt you
why dont you weep when i cut you
you dont bleed 
and the anger builds up inside
