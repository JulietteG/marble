I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING HAPPY NOW
I SEE YOU FEEL NO PAIN AT ALL IT SEEMS
I WONDER WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' NOW
I WONDER IF YOU THINK OF ME AT ALL
DO YOU STILL PLAY THE SAME MOVES NOW
OR ARE THOSE SPECIAL MOODS
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING HAPPY NOW

JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD
DOESN'T MAKE YOU RIGHT
JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD
STILL WANT YOU HERE TONIGHT

DOES LAUGHTER STILL DISCOVER YOU
I SEE THROUGH ALL THOSE SMILES
THAT LOOK SO RIGHT
DO YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME FRIENDS NOW
TO SMOKE AWAY YOU'RE PROBLEMS AND LIFE
OH HOW DO YOU REMEMBER ME THE ONE
THAT MADE YOU LAUGH UNTIL YOU CRIED
I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING HAPPY NOW

REPEAT CHORUS

I WONDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW
I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING HAPPY NOW (X2)---Lyrics submitted by chavez.
