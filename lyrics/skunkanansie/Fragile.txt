Survived tonight
I may be going down
'Cos everything goes round too
Tight, tonight
And as you watch me crawl
You stand for more

And your panic stricken blood
Will thicken up, tonight
'Cos I don't want you To forgive me 
You'll follow me down
You'll follow me down
You'll follow me down

Survive tonight
I see your head's exposed
So we shall kill cunstractive might
It so right
As your emotions fool you
My strong will rule

And your panic stricken blood
Will thicken up, tonight
'Cos I don't want you To forgive me 
You'll follow me down
You'll follow me down
You'll follow me down

And your panic stricken blood
Will thicken up, tonight
'Cos I don't want you To forgive me 
You'll follow me down
You'll follow me down
You'll follow me down---Lyrics submitted by einat.
