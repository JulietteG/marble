Lost in time I can't count the words
I said when I thought they went unheard
all of those harsh thoughts so unkind
'cos I wanted u
And now I sit here I'm all alone
so here sits a bloody mess, tears fly home
A circle of angels deep in war
'cos I wanted u

weak as I am, no tears for u[X2]
deep as I am, I'm no ones fool
weak as I am

So what am I now? I'm loves last hope
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
if I opened my heart, there'd be no space for air
'cos I wanted u

weak as I am, no tears for u[X2]
deep as I am, I'm no ones fool
weak as I am

In this tainted soul }
in this weak young heart } x 3
am I too much for u }

Weak as I am[x4] am, am
Weak as I am }
Am I too much for you } x3

Weak as I am---Lyrics submitted by daan.
