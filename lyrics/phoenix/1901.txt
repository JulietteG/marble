Counting all different ideas; drifting away
Past and present they dont matter
Now the futures sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think its not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute thought I couldnt tell how to fall out

Its twenty seconds till the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know its easy
Like we did it all summer long

And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Its not a miracle we needed
No I wouldnt let you think so
falling falling falling falling(2x) 

Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present 1855 -1901 
Watch them build a material tower
Think its not gonna stay anyway
Think its overrated
For a minute thought I couldnt tell how to fall out

Its twenty seconds till the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know its easy
Like we did it all summer long

And I'll be anything you ask and more
Youre going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Its not a miracle we needed
No I wouldnt let you think so

Falling falling falling falling (4x)---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
