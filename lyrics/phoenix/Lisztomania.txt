So sentimental
Not sentimental no
Romantic not disgusting yet
Darling I'm down and lonely
When the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
These days it comes it comes it comes
it comes it comes and goes

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
like a riot, like a riot, oh
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
(x2)

Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely 
Do let do let do let jugulate do let do let do

Lets go slowly, discouraged, 
We'll burn pictures instead
When it's all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days it comes it comes it comes
it comes it comes and goes

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
like a riot, like a riot, oh
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
(x2)

This is show time, this is show time, this is show time
This is show time, this is show time, this is show time
Time, time is your love, time is your love, yes time is your
Time, time is your love, time is your love, yes time is your

From the mess to the masses

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
like a riot, like a riot, oh
discuss discuss discuss 
discuss discuss discouraged.---Lyrics submitted by robert.
