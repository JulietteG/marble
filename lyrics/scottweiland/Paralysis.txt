Smoked my last cigarettes
Took a look at the bed
The one that we called home
Bought a ticket to somewhere, anywhere

Did you think of me blind?
'Cause I walked in circles
I know you thought of me unkind
But I tried to lead you through the minefield
Instead I led you to another

Pack my bags, walking in rain
Here them voices inseide my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing the place where I dream

Call my name, shout my name
Try to consume the place where I lay
Driving on the freeway passing up cars
Crashed my car, gotta get out of here

Had to rip up my heart
Had to patch up my head
At the hotel terrace
Had a drink at the bar
Stumbled up and away
Every piss and a girl is a ghost of you

Did you think of me blind?
'Cause I fly around in circles
I know you think of me unwise
But I try to lead you through the minefield
Instead I lead you to another

Pack my bags, walking in the rain
Here them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing the place where I dream

Call my name, shout my name
Try to consume the place where I lay
Driving on the freeway, passing up cars
Crashed my car, gotta get out of here

When you realize I'm blind
You lead me round in circles
For seven years I read your lies
But I still lead you through that minefield
Find my way back through another

Pack my bags, walking in rain
Hear them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing that place where I dream

Call my name, shout my name
Try to consume the place where I lay
Driving on the freeway, passing up cars
Crashed my car, gotta get out of here

Pack my bags, walking in rain
Hear them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing that place where I dream

Try to consume the people I pay
Flying on the freeway light speed ship, rocket ship
Trying to get out of here---Lyrics submitted by Shontay.
