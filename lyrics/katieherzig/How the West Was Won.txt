I dont know how the west was won
How the ocean let all the sailors come 
They came over one by one if only just to see

I dont know how happiness gets hidden in the wilderness
Im leaving in the morning with my paddle and my lime

I dont know how to find you when
All Ive been is a lighted window
Waiting for the dark to make its way back into light

And you will hold me in your arms
And you will hold me in your arms

Maybe Im just a pilgrim who is trying to make sense of you now
Pray the wind will take me where the space meets up with time
Where you will hold me in your arms---Lyrics submitted by Vincent A.
