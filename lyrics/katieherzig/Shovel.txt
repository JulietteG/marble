Hearts bend cause they cant break
When they cant take
All that is given to them

Glass eyes on your sad face
Its a sad story somebodys written on you
Love in my heart, right from the start
So please take me with you 

Birds sing out the window 
Sing out the window sing
Do you hear those birds
sing out the window
Sing out the window sing

Take me with your shovel
Well burry all your troubles
All your troubles

Oh the light is always on you
Always in the light
The light is always on you 
Always on you
Always in the light---Lyrics submitted by Vincent A.
