I'm gonna let you down
Gonna toss you around
Gonna make you want everything you haven't found
I'm gonna hold your hand
Then ask you to stand
Ten feet away

Oh it's just like you said
I live in my head
I'm saving up all that I have til I'm dead
It's always the same
And never the same way

But oh if you don't want me though
I'll only want you more
I fall in love with hard to get
You know you're just like me
A mystery with nothing more to see
A virtual reality

I'm in a love affair without a love song
I'm in the habit of having what I don't want
I'm just a hologram
You can see but don't touch me baby
Oh I bet you want me

I am taking up space I'm right out of place
I'm holding a half-hearted smile to your face
It's pretty enough but watch out it fades away
Time is ticking so fast
Does anything last
Soon I will be just apart of your past
I'll leave you with this
You hold on in blissful memories

Oh if you don't want me though
I'll only want you more
I fall in love with hard to get
You know you're just like me
A mystery with nothing more to see
A virtual reality

I'm in a love affair without a love song
I'm in the habit of having what I don't want
I'm just a hologram
You can see but don't touch me baby
Oh I bet you want me now

Now that you can see
I'm not, not what you make of me

I'm in a love affair without a love song
I'm in the habit of having what I don't want
I'm just a hologram
You can see but don't touch me baby
Oh I bet you want me now---Lyrics submitted by Vincent A.
