Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again, holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now, lord I remember how
Couldn't get enough of kissing, do you know how much you're missing
No you don't, but I do

The days like a slow train trickle by
And even the words that I write refuse to fly
All I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody out of my head, you see
Distractions I've been using, do you know how much you're losing
No you don't, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you
No you don't, but I do

I swore I'd never fall like this again
Fools like me never win, came to my knees again
Can't close the door on likelihood
Things might be just as good, always believe they would
Gotta let your love invite me, baby do you think it might be
No you don't, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you
No you don't, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you
No you don't, but I do
I know you don't, but I do
I know you don't, but I do---Lyrics submitted by Rhonda.
