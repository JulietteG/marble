Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
Your momma will be callin', that old rooster will crow
Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleeping a long time ago

There are certain things in life
that do not go the way we planned them
There are mysteries to love
you're too young to understand them
These are not tears, just smoke in my eyes
Smoke from the bridges I'm burnin' tonight

Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
Your momma will be callin', that old rooster will crow
Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleeping a long time ago

I guess it's time to say good night
I've sung you every song I know
Let me stand and watch you dream
One last time before I go
Tomorrow you'll wake and you'll wonder why
there's so many miles between you and I

Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
Your momma will be callin', that old rooster will crow
Close your eyes, you've got a long day comin'
You should have been sleepin' a long time ago---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
