Looking up the corner of her eye
And she seats alone and drinks her wine 
Very man just wants to pass her by
And hopes that he can catch her eye

Pre-Chorus:
That glow it's in her eye
Did your visions in your mind just from another states in time
That's when you know you're hypnotized, 
And her intoxicating will not be denied.

Oh, and when you touch her glow 
She didn't become your drug 
You found some deep in love that girl. 

Chorus:
It's too late, you're hypnotized, 
She's got Dorothy Dandridge Eyes
And you love her, you love her, you're loving girl.
It's too late, you're hypnotized, 
She's got Dorothy Dandridge Eyes
And you love her, you love that girl. 

And I go .. so no more name, 
That kind of view that study everything 
Every woman once is grace and style 
But no one who can replicate her smile
No no no no

Pre-Chorus:
That glow it's in her eye
Did your visions in your mind just from another states in time
That's when you know you're hypnotized, 
And her intoxicating will not be denied.

Oh, and when you touch her glow 
She didn't become your drug 
You found some deep in love that girl. 

Chorus:
It's too late, you're hypnotized, 
She's got Dorothy Dandridge Eyes
And you love her, you love her, you're loving girl.
It's too late, you're hypnotized, 
She's got Dorothy Dandridge Eyes
And you love her, you love that girl. 

All eyes and '
In your bed, in your .. 
All the men you love in the world 
All I know that the .. 

[Chorus:]

In your eyes we see the tiny .. mountains 
The purple blows distant stars, the blue shine reflect mirror 
Red rose to the sunny air, 
Orange clouds, pink moons and the tongue of the sun
Who knew heaven could keep us just like us.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
