VERSE 1:
Carry on Ghetto Woman
I see you working night to morning light yet no one cares
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Cause even though they laugh and talk about the clothes
You wear
I wish they could just realize
That all youve ever needed was someone to free your
Mind
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Cause even in your darkest hours I still see your light

[Chorus]
And when you cry dont you know that I am crying with
You?
When people put you down, yeah way down and you feel
Like youre alone
Let love be your guide
You were built to last through any weather
Oh Ghetto Woman hold on to your dreams
And all your great philosophies
Youre the reason I believe in me, for real

VERSE 2:
Carry on Ghetto Woman
When you doubt if youre a star, just know we still believe
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Even when the news portrays you less than you could be
I wish they could just realize
All you ever needed was someone to free your mind
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Youre the 7th wonder reigning over us at night

[Chorus]
When you cry, dont you know were right there crying with
You
People put you down, yeah way down and you feel like
Youre alone
Let love be your guide
You were built to last through any weather
Oh Ghetto Woman hold on to your dreams and all your
Great philosophies
Youre the reason I believe in me, for real

BRIDGE:
Some say this ghetto land will take you down and poison
You
Some say she can do all the things a man can do
Who said the ghettos just a place where queens dance
Naked on the moon?
We say a woman came to change the face of each and every room

VERSE 3 (RAP):
When I was just a baby my momma dropped out of school
It was only second semester the baby due
The doctor said December the first your due date
The daddy he was gone off to college he couldnt wait
Only just a teen with dreams to be on TV
And living with a mom and my grandma who used to feed
Me
We would move around in the city place to place
The landlord come for the rent face to face
Her eyes too heavy from working nights as a janitor
Shed keep it to herself and nobody could understand her
Even when she thought that she couldnt she carried on
She couldnt imagine both of her daughters here all alone
Before the tuxedos and black and white every day
Used to watch my momma get down on her knees and
Pray
Shes the reason that Im even writing this song
Ghetto Woman no it wont be long. Now sing along

CHANT:
Let it use you
Let it use you
When the love is strong
It wont let you be alone
Let it use you
Just let the spirit lead you---Lyrics submitted by Trevin Griffin.
