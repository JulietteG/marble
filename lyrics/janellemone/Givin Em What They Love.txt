[Verse 1: Janelle Monae]
I am sharper than a razor
Eyes made of lasers
Bolder than the truth
They want me locked up in the system
'Cause I'm on a mission
Blame it on my youth
Too long I've been out here on my own
Now I'm bout to bring it home
Like a rolling stone
I ain't never been afraid to die
Look a man in the eye

[Chorus: Janelle Monae]
I come to give you what you love...
It's time to give you what you love...
I'm a give you what you love...
Givin' you what you love...

[Verse 2:]
[Prince:]
I am sharper than a switchblade
First and last of what God made and that's the truth
But man, keep on tryna' hold me back
While another chicken head come home to roost
Too strong, tryna do me wrong
And the last one standing will order to my dance
Ohho... dance!
[Janelle Monae:]
Run tell your preacher and your teacher

[Chorus]

[Bridge: x2]
I say to take your time!
Take what you love
Baby, just enough
But never too much
Take your time!
Would you give me what you love!
Would you give me what you love!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro:]
Two dimes walked up in the building
Tall and concealing, wearing fancy things
Chopped up with a knife, hammered like a screw.
When they walked in the room we didn't know what to do
One looked at me and I looked back
She said, "Can you tell me where the party's at?"
She followed me back to the lobby
Yeah, she was looking at me for some undercover love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
