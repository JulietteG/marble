i love you
oh oh ooh oh ooh oh
i love you 
oh oh ooh oh ooh oh

aint not need to worry baby
cause i still love you boo
your the only one for me
no other kisses would do
you cant go away, no.
cause i got alot of lovin
i owe you, stay with me 
ill show you my lovin

i love you
oh oh ooh oh ooh oh
i love you 
oh oh ooh oh ooh oh

i know i've been spendin
alot of time away from home
i've been busy, now im free
here to please you 
(we were apart but it's the past)
find my heart torn in 2 pieces
put it together and youll find love
it aint worth us breaking up
(breaking up)
