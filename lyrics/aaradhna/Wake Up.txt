Verse 1
Empty pizza boxes on the floor
Empty liquor bottle from before
You'll find your comfort in between the sheets
Way to afraid to take it to the streets
Confidence just went out the window
So down can't get up can't move no more
Life is passing by and your poor soul is gone ooh

Chorus 2x
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up
Get Up
(Get Up)
Get out of bed.
Stop waisting time

Verse 2
Say that you'll do it the next day
Then in rolls the year 2008
Still procrastinating
Your work is overdue
Say that you'll buy a big house
But you ain't got sh!t right now
Disappointed cause you said that change was gonna
COME
COME
COME
OOOOOH

Chorus 2x
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up
Get Up
(Get Up)
Get out of bed.
Stop waisting time

Bridge
MMMMM

I SAID MMMMM
MMMMM
I've been trying to get to you
I've been trying to get through to you (oh ooh)
Tell me if you hear me
Tell me if you're listening
I've been trying to get to you
I've been trying to get through to you (oh ooh)
Tell me if you hear me
Tell me if you're listening oh
If you understand say...

Chorus 2x
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up

Get out of bed.
