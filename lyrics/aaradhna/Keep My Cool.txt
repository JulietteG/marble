See you coming my way (my way)
And I dont know what to do with myself (with myself)
I fell my heart is beating faster
As you make your way closer
No, no, no

Dont feel the butterflies
Theyre small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside

No, no, no, Dont feel the butterflies
Theyre small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside

I got to got to (got to got to)
I got to keep my cool now (cool now)
Oh oh oh oh..
Uh uh uh uh..
Im tryina keep my cool now now (now now)
Oh oh oh oh..

Im tryina make it look like I dont care (care care..)
But you are standing over there (over there)
Yea yea yea yea
Im laughing with my friends 
And showin up again like its nothing (like its nothing)
Oh oh oh oh oh

Dont feel the butterflies
Theyre small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside

No, no, no, Dont feel the butterflies
Theyre small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside

I got to got to (got to got to)
I got to keep my cool now (cool now)
Oh oh oh oh..
Uh uh uh uh..
Im tryina keep my cool now now (now now)
Oh oh oh oh..

You know that I want your love
Vicious mouth, cant get enough
Im sure in time Ill let you know
But til then Imma take it slow
Til then Imma take it slow
Take it slow..

You know that I want your love
Vicious mouth, cant get enough
Im sure in time Ill let you know
But til then Imma take it slow
Til then Imma take it slow

I got to got to (got to got to)
I got to keep my cool now (cool now)
Oh oh oh oh..
Uh uh uh uh..
Im tryina keep my cool now now (now now)
Oh oh oh oh..

No, no, Dont feel the butterflies---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
