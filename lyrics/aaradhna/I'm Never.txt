Close my eyes
Every time you hold me tight
Don't let go, no
Just hold me close

It feels so good 
Things that you do,
Boy I am
So in love with you
And I wanna let you know that
I'm never, I'm never

I'm never gonna say good bye 
I'm never gonna leave your side
I'm never,
No baby your with me
I'm never, I'm never

When you're not 'round
I can't go on,
I feel so down (whoa)
Lose control 
Hurts my soul

It feels so good 
Things that you do,
Thats why I'm 
So in love with you
And I wanna let you know that 
I'm never, I'm never

I'm never gonna say good bye 
I'm never gonna leave your side
I'm never,
No baby your with me
I'm never, I'm never

Because you put me first
No other man has put me first before

Because you care for me 
No other man has cared like this before

Because you treat me right 
No other man could ever treat me like you do.

Everything you do feels good
Thats why I'm gon' keep loving you
You...

Loving you .
Gon' keep loving you

I'm never gonna say good bye 
I'm never gonna leave your side
I'm never,
No baby your with me
I'm never, I'm never x2---Lyrics submitted by Lilo.
