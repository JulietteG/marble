Ive let you down (let you down)
Too many times (times times times times)
It breaks my heart (heart)
Cause when I look in your eyes I see the scars (I see the scars)
I hate myself every time I think about all the times I made you cry (made you cry)
And you deserve so much better
I dont know
But I just cant let you go

Hurt you never
I wont do it again
I swear (I swear)
Hurt you never
I wont do it again
I swear (I swear)

Got a good man (got a good man)
Better than good, hes great
Got a great man (got a great man)
And I dont wanna take that shit for granted

Got a good man (got a good man)
Better than good, hes great
Got a great man (got a great man)
And I dont wanna take that shit for granted

I know you try (know you try)
To forget the past and let it slide
Its my fault, my bad
But I know in my heart
Itll be alright
I just cant handle the thought of losing you
I would rather, Id rather die
So dont you leave, Ill make it better for you and me
Forever happily

Hurt you never
I wont do it again
I swear
Hurt you
I would never
Ever do it again
I swear

Got a good man (got a good man)
Better than good, hes great
Got a great man (got a great man)
And I dont wanna take that shit for granted

Got a good man (got a good man)
Better than good, hes great
Got a great man (got a great man)
And I dont wanna take that shit for granted

Got a good man (got a good man)
Better than good, hes great
Got a great man (got a great man)
And I dont wanna take that shit for granted

Got a good man (got a good man)
Better than good, hes great
Got a great man (got a great man)
And I dont wanna take that shit for granted

I dont wanna take that shit for granted ---
