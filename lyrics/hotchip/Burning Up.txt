Let's blast off
Let's fuck shit up
Let's go for a roller coaster ride
Even a shit roller coaster ride
Let's jam off
Synthesize this shower up
Let's treat 'em mean but keep 'em keen
Leave things dirty instead of clean
Let's make ourselves at house
Take our feet off, whisper nouns
Let's party hard but sleep longer late
Let's smash through lockdown, tear off the gates
Let's pretend, let's go all night
Maybe split the difference, baby
When you turn down the lights
Over the top or under the carpet
Roll out the red
We've already started

Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up

There was a time when I could explain
But now the words come with weight and blame
When I feel lighter, I might be drunk
Back to the bottom, my state has sunk
Let's make this run
We know the way but lost some light
On my phone there is a torch
Let me lead you to the source

Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up

Let me tell you how it is with me today
I can't see any other way
This does not come naturally
Burning up
I haven't seen you for ten days or so
And I've been counting
Like a child with a fever
And now I'm burning up
My ages say I'm an adult
But somedays my heart will not be told
Hearing teenage symphonies
Dancing through my head
The younger tones are on the phone
This is how you make me feel when I'm alone
I just can't get enough
Burning up---
