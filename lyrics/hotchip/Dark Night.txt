I'm calling for an angel
To bring me a dark night, to bind me
In my daydreams, darkness finds me
It takes me somewhere I need to be
If you can't see me
At least you can feel me

(The dark night)

Shutting down
Went to see you, now you're gone
Closer now
Have you been waiting here long?
Don't say a word
I don't think they'd understand

I'm calling for an angel
To bring me a dark night, to bind me
In my daydreams, darkness finds me
It takes me somewhere I need to be
If you can't see me
At least you can feel me

(The dark night)

You're my daydream
Twilight finds me every time
Under the sun
I can't help feeling this is wrong
Don't say a word
I don't think they'd understand

I'm calling for an angel
To bring me a dark night, to bind me
In my daydreams, darkness finds me
It takes me somewhere I need to be
If you can't see me
At least you can feel me

If I don't get to see you
At least I can feel you---
