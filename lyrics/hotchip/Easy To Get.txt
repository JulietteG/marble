First it comes on
As quickly, it starts to fade
Slowly I shiver
Then we start the masquerade
I meet you at midnight
Wearing something fine
In cotton rhapsody
We're caught intertwined

He said
"You know, you need a new coat"
Something to take off
I'd do it with my eyes
But it feels too remote

From the moment I saw you
There is something about you

Now that they're gone
Let's find some place of our own
Why don't you take a rest
Talking something we've outgrown
Now that they're gone
Let's find a place of our own
Take a seat, darling
I've made you a new throne

I hid my face from you (No more)
I hid my face from you (No more)
I hid my face from you
Hid my face from you

From the moment I saw you
From the note you first wept
There is something about you
I will never forget
Take a look in the mirror
Wipe away your regret
Look for me on the dance floor
Playing easy to get
Easy to get

No fear
Fear doesn't live here anymore
Yes it's clear
Right here
I am yours, my dear
(I'm playing easy to get)

No fear
Fear doesn't live here anymore
(I'm playing easy to get)
Right here
I am yours, my dear
No, no, no

From the moment I saw you
From the note you first wept
There is something about you
Left on my cigarette (No no no)
Take a look in the mirror
Wipe away your regret
Look for me in the morning
Playing easy to get
Easy to get

You might think, you might think
I'm easy to get
You might think, you might think

No, no, no
I am yours

No fear
Fear doesn't live here anymore
No, no, no
No fear
I am yours, my dear
(Playing easy to get)

No fear
Fear doesn't live here anymore
Yes it's clear, right here
I am yours, my dear
(Playing easy to get)---
