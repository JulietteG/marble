I had a feeling I'd run into you
It had to happen I just hoped not this soon
All I wanted was to speak your name
And maybe not start breakin' down again
I hoped you'd see me with somebody new
And think that I was fine
But now it ain't no use there's nothing left to hide
You said I'd get over it You said it only takes time
That soon I'd be on my feet again
And over my cryin'
I fought every memory
I conquered a few
But what I can't get over is getting over losing you
So much for being strong and nonchalant
But you're the only girl I ever wanted
And if I ever tried to slow you dwon
I was only tryin' to keep you safe and sound
Someday you'll want someone to stand by you
And never let you down
When that day comes darlin'
You'll know the hurt I've found
You said I'd get over it
You said it only takes times
That soon I'd be on my feet again
And over my cryin'
I fought every memory
I conquered a few
But what I can't get over is getting over losing you
Don't turn away
Darling I pray stay with me now
Stay with me now
Don't throw away
Something we've paid so dearly for
You said I'd get over it
You said it only takes time
That soon I'd be on my feet again
And over my cryin'
I swear I fought every memory
I conquered a few
But what I can't get over is getting over losing you
No what I can't get over is getting over losing you---
