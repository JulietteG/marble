Walking alone in the rain
Water in my shoes
All I can feel is this pain in my heart
And these Muddy Water Blues

River weep for me,
Nothing left to loose,
Under the weeping willow tree
With these Muddy Water Blues (Sing it now)

Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Uh, turns me to loose

Please give me some shelter
That's something I can use
Way down here in the Delta
With these Muddy Water Blues

Women and Whiskey will frame you
It's no good looking for clues
You got them, who can blame you?
Muddy Water Blues

Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Uh, turns me to loose

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Try to get free from you, Baby
Oh, but I'm stuck like glue
Try to get free from you, Baby
And these Muddy Water Blues

Uh, uh, uh, Muddy Water Blues 
Uh, uh, uh, Muddy Water Blues
Uh, uh, uh, Muddy Water Blues---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
