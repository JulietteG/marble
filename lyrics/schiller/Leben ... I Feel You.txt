(feat. Peter Heppner)

I feel You...
In every stone
In every leaf of every tree
youre ever grown
(That you ever might have grown)

I feel you...
In every thing
In every river that might flow
In every seed you might have sown

I feel you...
In every rain
In every beating of my heart
Each breath i take
(In every breath ill ever take)

I feel you...
Anyway...
In every tear that i might shed
In every word ive never said

I feel you...---Lyrics submitted by ziba.
