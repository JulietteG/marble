[Intro- Lil Jon] 
Stop! It's the mothufucking remix! 

[Lil Jon over Mase] 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
Eminem nigga! 
Lil Jon nigga! 
Mase and Bethem! 
That is yours! 

[Mase] 
Uh Ya Harlem is back 
Who in the world want a probem wit that 
For real I heard Harlem is back 
Who in the world want a problem wit that 
Uh ya real Harlem is back 
Who in the world want a problem wit that 
Uh I heard Harlem is back 
Who in the world want a problem wit that 

[Chorus x2- Fat Joe] 
I said my niggas don't dance and
We just pull up our pants 
And do the roc-a-way fuckers!!!!
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 

[Verse 1- Mase] 
Yo we goin Deja Vu 
And the day ya'll due 
It'll be the day ya'll bleed 
Wrist minus eighty degrees 
King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave 
Who else could take five years off 
Cold turkey, come back, and fly lids off 
Cats front leave 'em leanin' like smirnoff 
If haters wanna hate then its their loss 
Come up in the rucka wit all my jigs on 
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on 
People hear Mase gone 
When they get they Mase on 
You a hot 16, I'm a very great song 
If beatin on the DJ before the Mase song 
He play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on 
Plenty rooms, mansion many rooms 
My neckless, two X's, and three Benny Boom's (lean back) 

[Chorus x2- Fat Joe] 
I said my niggas don't dance 
We just pull up our pants 
And do the roc-a-way 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 

[Lil Jon] 
Eminem whats up! 

[Verse 2- Eminem] 
You don't want no problems with Harlem 
You don't want no problems wit da boogy down Bronxton 
You don't want no drama wit da blonde bomber 
Original don gotta of the blonde bottle, the model 
For white america, then Joe, 
the spokesperson for the Latino 
Then we got Mase back to represent 
everything else in between 
Includin the percentages of the rest, we dope 
The best from each coast, the mid west to the dirty dirty! 
Even further to Miami, 
all the way back to Californ I A 
It'll prolly be best right now if I warn Dre 
And get on the horn wit him tell him 
bout the storm comin all our way 
So tell a pal grab a gal, right now get on the floor why wait 
Shake that ass a lil more my way but baby I dont dance 
Not that I can, there's a pistol in my pants 

[Chorus x2- Fat Joe] 
I said my niggas don't dance 
We just pull up our pants 
And do the rock-away 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 

[Verse 3- Fat Joe] 
No Judas, or cowardice or Caine's brother
Able is able to stop me nigga not me!
Got the streets askin damn who could top Pete 
Summer Jam, killed it man did it all with one beat 
I guess I'm bi-coastal now, took a 
down south brother to bring your boy out
As the wheel keep spinnin I can hear 
niggas thinkin crack i got one hit benny out 
Nope Joey bring them semi's out of 
course you and yours pour a lil henny out 
So much rappers actin in the game, 
I have to tell him put the mic away 
and run and go and get your emmies out 
Lean back mothafuckas, this here's a three piece
we back at the rucka 
Its joe crack preachin to your brother, 
the mic more rap, impeachin you mothafuckers

[Chorus x2- Fat Joe] 
I said my niggas don't dance 
We just pull up our pants 
And do the roc-a-way 
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 

[Lil Jon] 
Say my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats 
And blow your block away 
fuck nigga lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
Say my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats 
And blow your block away
bitch niggas lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
