Say god, Amen
Without regard for its meaning, say god,
Prior to interpretation say god,
remember to say god and say god,
Say god continually without interruption, 
if interrupted, begin anew, and say god,
say god with each breath, each footstep, each blink, each eye blink
say god with out anxiety or strain 
say god like a river of god sayings
while living in an evil time or region say god,
in throws of mounting bliss say god
en guard before the mirror, say god amen
may the lovers pact simply be to say god,
sealed, unsealed, say god,
between certainty and doubt, say god
when confronted by elaborate systems, say god,
facing beautiful simplicities, say god
let the interjection of awe and wonder remain god,
repeatedly say god, yet be though not obsessed,
to say god, is to sing god
to sing to god, is to draw near to god
to the nearness that is god
'say god' is the only increment
say god now.
say god despite that which would prevent one from saying god
say god and know it to be so
say god until reality is consumed with god sayings 
say god as if pouring water from one vessel into another
say god in secret
say god and conceal it from ones self
say god
it is miraculous to have said god, to have attained to that orientation
whereupon one must utter the word god
say god and welcome the inevitable 
say god to sustain co mutual clairaudience throughout the christ realm saying god,
say god as u know u have been born
say god as a holy bible read aloud and all scriptures spring from a single sound
say god in the name of the inutterable name, say god amen
say god when u need the help of christ jesus to help u say god
to say god is to copulate for millions of years amen
this you and i of sound god sayings  
to say god is to continue knowing it to be so amen
say god and the hearts eye hears the, amen
say god and tend the true cross, planted in the centre most soil of your heart, amen
say god and know that u have always been saying god
parallel to all god seems or seems not amen
the body is a god saying instrument amen
the mind is a god saying habitat amen

the soul is patient in its heart-robe
the silence that frames the sound amen
to say god is to walk with god in silence
say god before and after having being distracted from saying god
that is, frame the lack of saying with the abundance of saying, frame it in time, amen
to say god is to awake and say god amen
say god when saying there has never been any falsehood of any kind
and ones own god saying form rises up from fundamental slime as it falls from undifferentiated chasm
coalescing the most transparent verse into a mountain of singing fire administered to your larynx by armored humming birds of vibrating script,
laying open the occult by closing away the revealed 
into every flame of song combined 
quavering just prior to the destruction of this present moment amen
this moment that is the present covering of the true moment of total revelation amen
the complete teaching instantaneous amen
the spontaneous uprising of eons of devotion amen
in a nearness that is a living intelligence
and countered in the joy itself of continuos spiritual labor 
preserved along a delicate chain of enlarged and present instances, amen
eternities attenuated through time amen
time bodies forever forming amen
to say god is there present shaping amen
say god and fold this cosmic ebb into a fervently small thing
say god and say the swaddling bands of the enshrouding chrysalis
say god and say the interior vastnesses of the heart region exceed cosmos amen
and there in the shepherds fold doth freely migrate amen
and i, even you and i are perfect components of an expression of divine limitlessness amen
which is to say truly, trull the larynx is a delicate nest of names amen
which is to say truly, truly our animal manifestations form the elegant scaffold of a roving ind mighty temple amen
which is to say truly, truly revelation is to be bestowed upon those who wish to receive it as it is, that is to become the revealed, amen
be free from all that is said and say god,
say god with a heart full of lust throughout the refracted rigors of piat 
and say this, lord god hear this my sacrifice, and except my stumblings across your luminous shadow,
say god and say she who is he, and say the proximity of the kingdom the atom of holiness a regimented cloud-swarm of holly atoms, amen
say the seem of symmetry, absolute and un-malleableness and the origin of blasphemy amen
say god and say that which passes through itself interpenetrated, auto-pervaded, amen
say the constellator girdled by trillions of lives,
say god the inialation of curiosity 
the supremely erotic, gnasher of souls, the murmur in the stone, that which is suffered and enjoyed 
that which goads and coaxes, that which welcomes and exiles, amen
say god a soothing disturbance, a mirrored countenance bedecked with realties, amen
say the evaporation of knowledge, say god against the god sayers
to say god is to love god that is to intone god though all aspects of ones being 
say god.---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
