You thought that you were a smart little tart
When you threw me over for Shortie McKay
You thought that I would take it like a white man
Squeeze your hand as we said goodbye

Now the police are out there draggin the river
Lookin for a body five foot two
Thereve been complaints about the drinking water
So were draggin the river for you

I spent a fortune keepin you quiet
And you found a nice way to pay me back
Now how does the future look without me
From the inside of a sack

Now the police are out there draggin the river
Lookin for a bone in an Irish stew
God help the whales and God help the fishes
Theyre draggin the river for you

All my life Ive been a coward
You know I never had the courage to fend for myself
Killing you was the best thing I ever did
You worked wonders for my mental health

Now the police are out there draggin the river
Lookin for a body five foot two
The divers are down and the beaters are out
And theyre draggin the river for you---Lyrics submitted by John Intorcio.
