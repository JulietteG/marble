So many times there was a man, he met a girl, took her hand 
Told her, "Never will I leave you my love" 
But just as soon as he gone again she's flapping in the wind wondering what she must have been thinking of 
She's a darling 
I've been in and out so many doors 
And I've always tried to keep my head 
With all the men I've known before 
I've seen plenty places 
That I'll never see again 
I've seen a 100,000 faces 
And only called a few my friend 

But it's a mystery 
Just how you came right in 
And stole my heart away 
And left me there again 

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness) 
To my happiness 
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness) 

Now if you think that's a thing that only evil men can bring 
Let me skin this cat another way 
There was a man who had a plan to settle down with Mary Ann 
He said "Darling (darling) 
I've been in and out so many door 
And I've always tried to keep my head 
With all the girls I've known before 
I've seen plenty places 
That I'll never see again 
I've seen a 100,000 faces 
And only called a few my friend 

But it's a mystery 
Just how you came right in 
And stole my heart away 
And left me there again 
I'm feeling 

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness) 
To my happiness 
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness) 
Feeling like a stranger 

I'm feelin' (feelin') 
I'm feelin' (feelin') 
I'm feelin' (feelin') 
I feel like 
A stranger 
I feel like 
A stranger to my happiness 
To my happiness 
I've seen pretty faces 
I've been to a lot of places 
I'm feelin' 
Yeah I'm feelin'---Lyrics submitted by deadlindy.
