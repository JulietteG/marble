[Music by Eddie Vinson; lyrics by Bill Loughborough]

There's not one boy for me I must have two or three I need four
First the man whos the type to like slippers and pipe at the door
Then, if at all possible, I'd like the kind
Who's not very boss-able, but knows his mind.

If you add to these few, one that knows how to woo, dog that style
Then this man of my world will be spangled and pearled with his smile
And though its incredible Ive found its true
That my four-in-one boys nobody else but you.---Lyrics submitted by JStarshine.
