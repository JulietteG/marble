You broke my heart, broke in two
Some days I just don't know what I'm suppose to do
And when I see you, trouble ain't far behind

You made me cry a million tears
They say that it gets better with the passing of the years
But when I think of you, trouble ain't far behind

I want to tell you what I'm feeling
But the words won't come out right
You left me crying there's no denying
Turned my sunshine to the darkest nights

Some day I'll find some body new
Then you will know exactly what you put me through
Untill that day, trouble ain't far behind
Untill that day, trouble ain't far behind. ---
