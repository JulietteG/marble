I want to annoy
and I'm going to enjoy it
maybe cause we're bored
maybe because were bored
cause all you do is hope
your all f**king hopeless
and it's the lord of the flies all over again
its the lord of the flies all over again

-chorus-
Now who hosts the show will be caesar
you can even have it written on your t-shirt (2)
king of the homeless
will fall
(were  gonna knock down the walls)
sing in the caesar
will fall
(were gonna knock down his doors)

I've heard it all before
and i chose to ignore it
there's some one at your door
there's somebody at your door
prepare for the test
we'll all get infested
and it's the mil gram device all over again (2)

-chorus-

hey caesar
yo coco
oh geezer
hey mamma
can you fly?
yep
I got Robyn can fly
baby

-chorus- (2)---Lyrics submitted by Janice.
