Prestame tu piel
Tu mundo sin vecinos
El mundo esta perdido amor
Dejame saber
La vida no explica el por que
No le importa si tan frio
Just to let you know

This is wrong
And I can't go on
nos quemara
Cubre tus llamas
Ya tus rosas de sangre hermosa
La eternidad quema

Eyes
That look away in pain
Will never see the shame
Lies
That cover up the sound
Have never screamed so loud

Tu cuerpo es una parte
Tan sierto es tu escape
Tu mente ya no sabe a donde ir
Y por que tan obscuro que te vistes
Complejos que resisten
Just to let this go

This is wrong
And I can't go on
nos quemara
Cubre tus llamas
Ya tus rosas de sangre hermosa
La eternidad quema

Eyes
That look away in pain
Will never see the shame
Lies
That cover up the sound
Have never screamed so loud

Don't you just pity me
Light that has given way
When I see her face
And I can't stop this rain
As everything falls on me
Would you just sit here with me
This is the day to pay for all her pain

Eyes
That look away in pain
Will never see the shame
Lies
That cover up the sound
Have never screamed so loud---
