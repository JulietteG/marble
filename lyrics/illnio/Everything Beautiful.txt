We are not the same.
I am not to blame.
Cause you've rearranged the truth.
You just suffocate.
While I medicate.
When I wipe the slate I'm done with you.

Run for shelter.
Dig for wealth but.
All the treasures live within you.
Bless your maker.
Take the stems.
Surrender your arms to a tree.

And I'm breaking away.
From everything beautiful.
And all I am.
Is fading I'm restless.
And lying awake.
And nothing is obvious.
And all I am.
Is fading and wasting away.

I am not afraid.
Y salvando me.
(and saving me)
This is mistake you made too soon.
Y que vas hacer?
(and what are you going to do)
Quien te va creer?
(who's going to believe you)
Well you make this bed to lie for you.

Its time to wake up.
Contemplate but.
Something's missing non-existing.
Corre el tiempo.
(time is running)
Estas sufriendo.
(You suffer)
Tu eres dueaa de todo.
(You're the boss of everything)

And I'm breaking away.
From everything beautiful
And all I am.
Is fading I'm restless.
And lying awake.
And nothing is obvious.
And all I am.
Is fading and wasting away.

Tus labios have taken
(your lips)
Las palabras de dolor.
(The words of pain)
In your eyes.
Que me quitan.
(That takes from me)
Lo que estoy pensando yo.
(What I'm thinking of)

And I'm breaking away.
From everything beautiful.
And all I am.
Is fading I'm restless.
And lying awake.
And nothing is obvious.
And all I am.
Is fading and wasting away.

And I'm breaking away.
From everything beautiful.
And all I am.
Is fading I'm restless.
And lying awake.
And nothing is obvious.
And all I am.
Is fading and wasting away.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
