Dining alone
Sipping his wine
Watching the door
Checking the time
Is that her?
What to do
False alarm

One more glass till she shows
Or perhaps someone else he knows
Might try her
Maybe not
Just cant speak

Passing the salt
Without a word
All eyes lowered
Avoiding looks
Faces in books

Through the door
Is it true?
Yes, its her
What to do
Politely smile
Turn away
What to say

[Instrumental]

Passing time takes its toll
Nothing said
Time to go
What to do
Try and joke
Tongue tied!

Thinking next day
Its been too long
Eating elsewhere
More friendly types
Trying again
Might make friends

Have a drink
Maybe smile
At someone nice across the aisle
Someday, perhaps
Who knows?

[Instrumental]

Dining alone
Sipping his wine
Watching the door
Playing for time
No one comes
Lights turn low
Time to go
[sigh]---Lyrics submitted by Shelley Hershey.
