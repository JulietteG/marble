You and me
 We're like the fire in the trees
 We're like the pollen in the breeze,
 Summer with a freeze
 You and me...
 You and me
 We're like the fire in the trees
 We're like the pollen in the breeze,
 Summer with a freeze
 You and me...


There is something you should know
 Something you should think about
 Where you wanna go?
 Do you want me in or want me out?
 I got stuff to do that's got nothing to do with you
 I want to let you know, i'm really very tired of...
 You and me
 (i want you to come close)
 We're like the fire in the trees
 (i want you to come close)
 We're like the pollen in the breeze,
 Summer with a freeze
 You and me... (i want you to come close)

There is something you should know
 Something you should think about
 Where you wanna go?
 Do you want me in or want me out?
 I got stuff to do that's got nothing to do with you
 I want to let you know, i'm really very tired of...
 You and me
 (i want you to come close)
 We're like the fire in the trees
 (i want you to come close)
 We're like the pollen in the breeze,
 Summer with a freeze
 You and me... (i want you to come close)

I know that yesterday is over
 Today i gotta deal with
 How tomorrow might suck
 Suck if you don't understand the way it oughtta be
 It's got a lot to do with me
 I want to let you know i'm really very tired of...

You and me
 (i want you to come close)
 We're like the fire in the trees
 (i want you to come close)
 We're like the pollen in the breeze,
 Summer with a freeze
 You and me... (i want you)

You, me, i want you to come close
 We're like a cracker without cheese
 I can never get close enough to you---Lyrics submitted by Jenn Smith.
