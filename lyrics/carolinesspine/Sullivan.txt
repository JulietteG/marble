Its not hard to reach back to the day 
Underneath that Iowa sun
Running to the tower of Waterloo looking for the Sullivan train to come
And these five boys would run to the top 
And as soon as he went by
Frist we wave hello then we wave goodbye, goodbye

Its not hard to reach back to the days after the attack on pearl
And over then my buddies turned into men 
Running out of time for games and grils
And the Sullivan boys were not over looked 
Uncle Sam were callin each by name
The very next day they left on a mystery train

So say goodbye, bye, bye, Mrs. Sullivan
And dont you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,

We regret to inform you
The navys taken your sons away
All five, five, five, five, 
So put your blue star in the window
The window

Its not hard to reach back to her smile
When she received the letter
And the letters they sounded generally the same
And said they couldnt be home
At least they were together on a 
Mighty fighting battle ship
Somewhere in the south pacific
The letters never got much more specific

So say goodbye, bye, bye, Mrs. Sullivan
And dont you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, 

We regret to inform you 
The navys keeping your sons away
Well, all five, five, five, five, 
So keep your blue star in the window
In the window

Its not hard to reach back to the day
When the war finally came home
Uncle Sam will send you a telegram
So he doesnt have to tell you over the phone 
I heard she cracked up when they out what the war had cost 
When all five of her boys were lost

They were, they were, they were
Oh they goodbye, bye, bye, Mrs. Sullivan
Go ahead and cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,

We regret to inform you that all your sons have past away
Well, all five, five, five, five,
So change your blue star to gold
Blue star to gold, blue star to gold
Blue stars, change them to gold---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
