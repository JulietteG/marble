I woke up this morning with my mind (my mind it was)
stayed on freedom, (Oh well I)
woke up this morning with my mind
stayed on freedom (Oh well I)
woke up this morning with my mind (my mind it was)
stay on freedom,

Hal le lu,
ha le lu,
ha le lu,
ha le lu
ha le lu
jah!

A well a walk walk walk walk walk walk
with my mind on freedom
walk walk walk walk walk walk
well now Ah
You gotta walk walk walk walk

I'm walking and talking with my mind...

I'm preaching and teaching with my mind...

I'm singing and shoutin' with my mind...

You gotta walk, walk...

You gotta talk, talk...

Ain't no harm to keep your mind... ---
