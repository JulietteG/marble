Me and Kid Sensation and that home away from home--
In the Black Benz Limo, with the cellular phone--
I'm callin' up the posse, it's time to get rippin'--
The freaks a need a sunroof, to keep you sucka's trippin'--
Everybody's lookin, if your jealous turn around--
The AMG kick keeps us closer to the ground--
we're gettin' good grip from the 50 series tires--
the Alpine's bumpin', but I need the volume higher--
cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb--
we're rollin' Rainier, and the jealous wanna get some--
Every time we do, the sucka M.C.'s wanna battle--
I'm the man they love to hate, the J.R. Ewing of Seattle--
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson--
headed for the strip, yes we're lookin' for some action--
the limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leanin' back--
Maharaji's watchin' T.V. with two girlies on his lap--
On Martin Luther King.....the set looks kinda dead--

we need a new street so posse move ahead--
we all look kinda' SWASS the crew you can't forget--
the Mix-a-lot posse co' rippen' up the set--

My Posse's on Broadway........

UhhhRrrollin' with my posse we're gettin' kinda' bored--
there's not another posse with more points scored--
we don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas--
my homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa'--
Maharaji's on the def side dancin' like a freak--
the girlies see his booty and their knees get weak--
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny --
a real estate investa' who makes a lot of money--
Clockin' lots of dollas' we all got gold--
cruzin' in the Benz ain't got no place to go--
wheelin' 23rd we saw nuthin' but thugs--
the girlies was too skinny from smokin' all them drugs--
cause the rock man got 'em and their butts just dropped--
the freaks looked depressed 'cause the Benz won't stop--
at 23rd and Union the driver broke left--
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def--
my girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best--
she's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress--
the closer that we get, the crazier that I feel--
the posse's on Broadway it's time to get ill--

My Posse's on Broadway.........

Cruzin' Broadway and my wheels spin slow--
rollin with my posse is the only way to go --
the girlies by the college was lookin for a ride--
we tried to pick them up but we had no room inside--
we put them on the trunk, we put them on the hood--
some sat up with the driver they made him feel good--
the posse's gettin' bigger, there's much too many freaks--
the muffler's draggin', my suspension's gettin' weak--
Now the posse's gettin' hungry, and Mix-a-Lot's treatin'--
we stopped at Taco Bell, for some Mexican eatin'--
but Taco Bell was closed, and the girls was on my tip--
they said, "Go back the other way, we'll stop and eat at Dick's"--
Dick's is the place where the crew hang out--
the SWASS like to play, and the rich flaunt clout--
posse to the burger stand, so big we walk in two's--
we're gettin' dirty looks, from those other sucka crews--
Kid Sensation dropped a $20, and didn't even miss it--
skeeza from anotha' crew, she picked it up and kissed it--
her boyfriend's illin', he went to slap her face--
My homeboy P.L.B. co' sprayed the boy with mace--
'Cause I never liked a punk, who beat up on his girl--
if you don't have game, then let her leave your world--
We took the girl with usssssss....with him she rode the busssss....
she gave the boy the finga', and the sucka starts to cussssss....
boy I gotta def posse, you gotta bunch of dudes--
you're broke co' cryin' bout the rock-man blues--
you beat up on your girl, and now you're all upset--
she's with the Mix-a-Lot posse, on the Broadway set--

My posse's on Broadway.............---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
