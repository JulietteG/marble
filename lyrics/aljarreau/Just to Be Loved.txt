I was down to the bone I was lonely only yesterday
Didn't know I was throwin' my chances away
Then you came along just long enough to see
Far beyond the fool that I have come to be

Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something, I've never seen
You made me something, I have never been before
Never before

I was always the one who would never give anything away
If all your feeling is cool there's not much to say
When the silence got too loud for me to bear
You brought me love and taught me how to care

Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something, I've never seen
You made me something, I have never been before
Never before

Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something, I've never seen
You made me something, I have never been before
Never before

Cherish love when you use it
It's never gone they say
When you have it
It's only love, only love

Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something, I've never seen
You made me something, I have never been before
Never before

Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something, I've never seen
You made me something, I have never been before
Never before---Lyrics submitted by Heidi.
