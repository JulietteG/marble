Ohhh baby
Gotta have your love
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Give a little more lovin'
Just a little more lovin'

Tonight, we can make emotions grow
Oh hold me 
And I, can take you where the oceans flow
Oh baby
Love is right here tonight
We can make it come alive
Just

[Chorus]

Tonight, we can make the spirit move
baby, please don't fight it
'Cause we are among the chosen few
To find it
feelings grow when you know
It's all or nothin'
Me and you baby

[Chorus]

Don't stop
When you find romance
You've got, you've got to take a chance

[Instrumental]

feelings grow when you know
It's all or nothin'
Me and you, wow

[Chorus]
(Repeat chorus 4x's)---Lyrics submitted by James Jarrett.
