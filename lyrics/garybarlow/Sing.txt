(with The Commonwealth Band)

Some words they cant be spoken only sung,
So hear a thousand voices shouting love.
Theres a place, theres a time in this life when you sing what you are feeling,
Find your feet, stand your ground, dont you see right now the world is listening to what we say?

Sing it louder, sing it clearer, knowing everyone will hear you,
Make some noise, find your voice tonight.
Sing it stronger, sing together, make this moment last forever,
Old and young shouting love tonight.

To sing weve had a lifetime to wait (wait, wait, wait)
And see a thousand faces celebrate (together celebrate)
You brought hope, you brought life, conquer fear, no it wasnt always easy,
Stood your ground, kept your faith, dont you see right now the world is listening to what we say?

Sing it louder, sing it clearer, knowing everyone will hear you,
Make some noise, find your voice tonight.
Sing it stronger, sing together, make this moment last forever,
Old and young shouting love tonight.

Some words they cant be spoken only sung,
To hear a thousand voices shouting love and life and hope.

Just sing; just sing; just sing; just sing.

Sing it louder, sing it clearer, knowing everyone will hear you,
Make some noise, find your voice tonight.
Sing it stronger, sing together, make this moment last forever,
Old and young shouting love tonight.

Hear a thousand voices shouting love.---Lyrics submitted by E Pope.
