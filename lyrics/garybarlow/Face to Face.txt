(Verse)
Its a true sign of a soldier
Taking care of the hearts around us
And the whole world loves a hero
A leader and a shoulder to cry on

(Pre-Chorus)
Thats what you are to me
Everyone around can see yeah

(Chorus)
When were face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When were face to face

(Verse)
You can measure the strength of a human
By the weight of the love around them
One sweet light in the darkness
Guided us all like a pilot

(Pre-Chorus)
Thats that you are to me
Everyone around believes yeah

(Chorus)
When were face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When were face to face

(Bridge)
When you live your life with a passion
Taking nothing for granted
You made me believe if you give love, you will find it
You, you are the world to me yeah
A heart as wide as the ocean
You aim to climb every mountain
And the unknown you understand it /
Yea, you do

(Chorus x2)
When were face to face oh I
When the music plays oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When were face to face---
