[Big L]
I drive up and down Harlem blocks, iced out watch
Knots in my socks, cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over too see if I'm drunk
but I'm sober they wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride 
You're just mad cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talkin bout where the gun at, I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm stayin legit
I love to see cars come cruisin bye and playin my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pist-al, my whole click's wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks I'm makin hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breakin laws
I don't sell coke anymore, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes'll do whatever it takes
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that

[Chorus: Big L]

Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be callin it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

[Fat Joe]
Aiyyo enough's enough, federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga sewed, but they know 
Big Joey Crack ain't never rat a cat that he know
Fo' sho', death before dishonor; I left the streets alone
since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doin what I'm doin
Pursuin my dream til there enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witness that you claim to have, sayin that I'm takin half
Extortin New York and not payin tax
I'm layin back, playin the role, playin the low
But it's the same ol Joe so don't get K.O.d
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

[Chorus x2]

"What would you do..
if the vicious enemy suddenly started comin at you..
armed to the teeth, and ready to kill you?"---Lyrics submitted by mike.
