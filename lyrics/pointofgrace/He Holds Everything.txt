Waiting for that other shoe to drop
And you swear this world's gonna come to a stop
Drowning on dry land and can't come up for air
Your knees are so weak and you look at that mountain
Say there's no way over and no way around it
And it feels like you're so far from home
Even God's not there
But

Chorus:
Oh but every single sparrow flying
And even broken soul that's crying
He can see yeah you're in His reach
If He can hold an ocean back with one little shove
Then what's all this worry and doubting for
Oh I beleive He holds everything

When it's late at night and you're staring at the stack of bills
It don't add up and you don't know how it will
Clinging to your mother's faith with a half-hearted prayer
But you still don't know
When the anchor man breaks in on your tv
And says these times they won't be easy
And fear sets in and you wanna give in
Just let it go
Oh let it go

Chorus:
Every single sparrow flying
And every broken soul that's crying
He can see yeah you're in His reach
If He can hold an ocean back with one little shove
Then what's all this worry and doubting for
Oh I believe, yeah I believe He holds everything, he hlds everything---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Hough.
