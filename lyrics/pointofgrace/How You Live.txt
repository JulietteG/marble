Wake up to the sunlight with your windows open
Don't hold in your anger or leave things unspoken
Wear your red dress ; Use your good dishes
Make a big mess and make lots of wishes
Have what you want but want what you have
And don't spend your life looking back

Turn up the music ; turn it up loud
Take a few chances ; let it all out
Cause you won't regret it
Lookin' back from where you have been
Cause it's not who you knew and it's not what you did
It's how you live

So go to the ballgames and go to the ballet
Go see your folks more than just on the holidays
Kiss all your children ; dance with your wife
Tell your husband you love him every night
Don't run from the truth cause you can't get away
Just face it and you'll be okay

Turn up the music ; turn it up loud
Take a few chances ; let it all out
Cause you won't regret it
Lookin' back from where you have been
Cause it's not who you knew and it's not what you did
It's how you live

Wherever you are and wherever you've been
Now is the time to begin

So give to the needy and pray for the grieving
Even when you don't think that you can
Cause all that you do is bound to come back to you
So think of your fellow man
Make peace with God and make peace with yourself
Cause in the end, there's nobody else

Turn up the music ; turn it up loud
Take a few chances ; let it all out
Cause you won't regret it
Lookin' back from where you have been
Cause it's not who you knew and it's not what you did
It's how you live   

Cause it's not who you knew and it's not what you did
It's how you live---Lyrics submitted by Erin.
