You're not hearing the answers
You've been praying for
You try and try
Can't find an open door

You're not seeing the miracles
Not a one in sight
And the way you feel
You sure need one tonight

Your faith is crumbling
Your feet are stumbling
It's so hard to believe in Him
But He believes in you

When you're at your weakest
And hope's still burning through the night
But you can't see it
You know in your heart He loves you
But at those moments when you can't believe it's true
He believes in you

Chin deep in the water
You tried walking on
And you reach for Him
And you think He's gone

He's still there beside you
With His stubborn love
No He never left
And He won't give up

He will protect you
Until you're rescued
Oh there's nothing that He can't do
'Cause He believes in you

When you're at your weakest
And hope's still burning through the night
But you can't see it
You know in your heart He loves you
But at those moments when you can't believe it's true
He believes in you
You know in your heart He loves you
But at those moments when you can't believe it's true
He believes in you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
