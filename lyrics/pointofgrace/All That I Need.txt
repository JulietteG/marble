Sometimes I know, You can read my mind
Deep down inside where my fears are hiding
Whisper so tender the way that You do
There's a love that's forever I've found in You
I know sometimes, I ask You for the moon
Reach for a star and I long to hold You
How could this love be so simple for You
Then You reach out and touch me
And suddenly I see 
(Chorus)
All that I need is You
Always forever with You
I feel Your love and I realize
All I ever needed was You
Just You
You're all I ever needed
Once in a while a dream will come true
A moment in time created by You
Things less important start falling away
There's a truth down inside me
And I hear my heart say
(Repeat Chorus)
I remember a time 
Love was so hard to find
I was never really satisfied needing what I just denied
Oh, but now I see
So suddenly 
(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Kimber.
