Not that far from Bethlehem
Underneath the stars 
Just a simple man and wife 
Somewhere in the dark 
His words cut the silent night 
Take my hand, for the child 
That you carry is God's own 
And though it seems the road is long 

We're not that far from Bethlehem 
Where all our hope and joy begins 
For in our arms we'll cherish him 
We're not that far from Bethlehem
Let us celebrate 
As the Christmases go by 
Learn to live our days 
With our hearts near to the child 
Ever drawn, ever close 
To the only love that lasts 
And though 2000 years have passed 

We're not that far from Bethlehem 
Where all our hope and joy began 
For when our hearts still cherish him 
We're not that far 
We're not that far from Bethlehem 
Where all our hope and joy began 
For when our hearts still cherish him 
We're not that far, we're not that far 
From Bethlehem---Lyrics submitted by Vincent Phang.
