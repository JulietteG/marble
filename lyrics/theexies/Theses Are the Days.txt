The more I talk the less I say
When the words get in the way
Loneliness is so hard
Loneliness is so hard
Ordinary I confess
Living under house arrest
Maybe I belong here
Maybe I belong

Suddenly there's beauty in
The way my heart is caving in
And every scar reminds me how
I can't deny

These are the days that last forever
A time in my life I won't surrender
For better or worse, these are the days
In my life I've loved no other
We all have pain, we all have suffered
For better or worse, these are the days
I will remember

The more I learn, the less I know
The final act of letting go
Of everything that life takes
The reason why my heart breaks

Suddenly there's comfort in
The way the world comes crashing in
And every tear reminds me I'm alive
Tonight

These are the days that last forever
A time in my life I won't surrender
For better or worse, these are the days
In my life I've loved no other
We all have pain, we all have suffered
For better or worse, these are the days
I will remember

The more I talk, the less I say
When the words get in the way
Loneliness is so hard
Loneliness is so hard
Ordinary I confess
Living under house arrest
Maybe I belong here
Maybe I belong

These are the days that last forever
A time in my life I won't surrender
For better or worse, these are the days
In my life I've loved no other
We all have pain, we all have suffered
For better or worse, these are the days
I will remember
I will remember
I will remember---Lyrics submitted by Lupe.
