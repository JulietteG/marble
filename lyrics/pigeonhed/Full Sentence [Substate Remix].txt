Gonna make me fly
Guaranteed it gets much brighter
You never know until you stop
Yeah Yeah

And I will never be the one
To carry out the full sentence
I didnt mean someone else
Yeah Yeah

And I cannot understand
Where this could happen
Over and over again
So hard again
Yeah

I can never let this secret fly
Open your eyes and let me slide away

So carry on
I cannot wait any longer
Without you coming here
I cannot wait any longer
Yeah
So carry on
I cannot wait any longer
Without you coming here

(You and me)

I cannot wait any longer
I cannot wait any longer
I cannot wait any longer

Yeah
Gonna make me cry
Ooh Im coming to you, remember
Never know until you stop
Yeah yeah

I cannot understand
Whether this could happen over and over again
So hard again

Just carry on
I cannot wait any longer
Without you coming here
I cannot wait any longer
No, say it again
So carry on
I cannot wait any longer
Without you coming here
(darling) I cannot wait  any longer
(yeah) I cannot wait any longer
(darling) I cannot wait any longer

One day youll find
Theres nobody like me

So carry on
I cannot wait any longer
Without you coming here
I cannot wait any longer
Yeah, say it again.
So carry on
I cannot wait any longer
Without you coming here
Near me---Lyrics submitted by Scott Cairns.
