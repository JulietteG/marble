Is this the end of the moment?
Or just a beautiful unfolding?
Of a love that will never be
Or maybe, 
Be everything that I never thought could happen
Or ever come to passing
I wonder, if maybe
Maybe I could be all you ever dream

'Cause you are beautiful inside
So lovely and I
Can't see why I'd do anything without you
You are, and when I'm not with you
I know that it's true
that I'd rather be anywhere but here without you..
(anywhere but here)

Is this a natural feeling?
Or is it just me bleeding all my thoughts and dreams
In hope that you would be with me 
Or is this a moment to remember?
Or just a cold day in december?
I wonder, if maybe
Oh maybe I could be all you ever dream..

'Cause you are, you're beautiful inside
So lovely and I
Can't see why I'd do anything without you
You are, and when I'm not with you
I know that it's true
that I'd rather be anywhere but here without you..
(anywhere but here x2)

Is this the end of the moment?
Or just a beautiful unfolding?
Of a love that will never be
For you and me...

'Cause you are, you're beautiful inside
You're so lovely and I
Can't see why I'd do anything without you
You are, and when I'm not with you
Yeah I know that it's true
that I'd rather be anywhere but here without you..---Lyrics submitted by Miles.
