Sometimes the edge serves as more than a friend then you thought it would be
And the pages you write in your journal each night are your only release
And the mask you put on it's like words in a song but there's more to be seen
And the failures you see, don't seem failures to me here at all

Oh I'm begging you no, there's more life left to go
Oh I'm begging you please, cause I don't want you to leave

Alone as you walk through a crowd and it's awkward like nobody sees
And you can't help but wonder would anyone come after you if you'd leave
So a pain grows inside and a fear comes alive like you'll never be free
But there's no pain you feel that I know love can't heal here at all

Oh I'm begging you no, there's more life left to go
Oh I'm begging you please, cause I don't want you to leave me
To leave me here on my own, there's nothing to run from
Oh there's nothing but fear inside you
Oh I just hope I can find you
And tell you that I know you'll smile again

Oh I'm begging you no, there's more life left to go
Oh I'm begging you please, cause I don't want you to leave---Lyrics submitted by Alanna.
