This is my love song to you
Let every woman know Im yours
So you can fall asleep each night, babe
And know Im dreaming of you more

Youre always hoping that we make it
You always want to keep my gaze
Well youre the only one I see
And thats the one thing that wont change

Ill never stop trying
Ill never stop watching as you leave
Ill never stop losing my breath
Every time I see you looking back at me
Ill never stop holding your hand
Ill never stop opening your door
Ill never stop choosing you babe
Ill never get used to you

And with this love song to you
Its not a momentary phase
You are my life, I dont deserve you
But you love me just the same
And as the mirror says were older
I will not look the other way
You are my life, my love, my only
And thats the one thing that wont change

Ill never stop trying
Ill never stop watching as you leave
Ill never stop losing my breath
Every time I see you looking back at me
Ill never stop holding your hand
Ill never stop opening your door
Ill never stop choosing you babe
Ill never get used to you

Still get my heart racing (you)
Still get my heart racing (for you)
Still get my heart racing (you)
Still get my heart racing (for you)

Ill never stop trying
Ill never stop watching as you leave
Ill never stop losing my breath
Every time I see you looking back at me
Ill never stop holding your hand
Ill never stop opening your door
Ill never stop choosing you babe
Ill never get used to you

Still get my heart racing (you)
Still get my heart racing (for you)
Still get my heart racing (you)
Still get my heart racing (for you)

Still get my heart racing (you)
Still get my heart racing (for you)
Still get my heart racing (you)
Still get my heart racing (for you)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
