I am on your side, beginning to the end you know
Beginning to the end you know
So I am never going to leave you aside
It doesn't matter where you go
It doesn't matter where you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

There's gonna be times, when you feel lonely
When you feel scared, and streets are cold and the world is empty
There's gonna be times
There's gonna be times you know

There's gonna be times, you feel your losing
Like you could be somebody you just need the chance to prove it
There's gonna be times,
There's gonna be times you know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know

I am on your side, beginning to the end you know
Beginning to the end you know
So I am never going to leave you aside
It doesn't matter where you go
It doesn't matter where you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

And in those times when you feel lonely,
And the feeling that you want is not the feeling that you need
I will pray for you, I will shelter you.
And when the tide pulls you under, I'll be the one who rescues you
And when they come and try to take over
I'm going to knock off every demon that lands on your shoulder
I'll be for you everywhere you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I am on your side, beginning to the end you know
Beginning to the end you know
So I am never going to leave you aside
It doesn't matter where you go
It doesn't matter where you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

All your fears, come out here
Throw them all in the fire to burn
Let all your tears, run down your face
I'm gonna be there to wipe your eyes
I'm gonna stay with you through the night

There's gonna be a light
There's gonna be a light
It's gonna get here soon
There's gonna be a light
There's gonna be a light
It's gonna get here soon
But until then
Oh until then

I am on your side, beginning to the end you know
Beginning to the end you know
So I am never going to leave you aside
It doesn't matter where you go
It doesn't matter where you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I am on your side, beginning to the end you know
Beginning to the end you know
So I am never going to leave you aside
It doesn't matter where you go
It doesn't matter where you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
