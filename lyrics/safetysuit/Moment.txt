From when I wake in the morning
Til I go and, and I fall asleep each night
I fight, to hold on to a love that is inside
Because my past is like a nightmare
That I never can escape
And I can't wait til I wake up so I can fall back asleep.

And I don't understand what happened between me and you, but
You will probably end up with someone half as good as me, so
I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
You were blind to me now I'm blind to you, no

So now I wait for a moment 
when I know that there is no one left to see
all the hurt that's inside me and the reason that I need
I need to let go of the things I see that have always let me fall
And I can't find my way home no cause I'm already home

And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
You will probably end up with someone half as good as me, so
I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
You were blind to me now I'm blind to you, no

..blind to me, blind to you..

And I don't know what you need
But I know you're listening now
And I don't care what you think
Because you didn't think to care about me (x2)

And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
You will probably end up with someone you know that is half as good, so
I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
You were blind to me now I'm blind to you, no

You were blind to me now I'm blind to you...---Lyrics submitted by Miles.
