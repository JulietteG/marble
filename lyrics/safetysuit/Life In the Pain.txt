Now you don't have a purpose
Don't let anybody in
You don't understand why she don't love you
But you don't understand yourself

Now you're out there with no target
So you're friends become your aim
But there is no one left around you
So there is no one left to blame

And what you don't know
It won't hurt you
And what you don't know will save you from some pain
But if i could choose I'd let it hurt you
Cause there's something 'bout the life in the pain

Now there's something inside you stirrin'
Like there's a fight coming your way
But there'll be no fists you'll be throwing
Just some words you got to say

And you'll scream for our repentance
Or you'll hide behind what's fake
But there ain't nothing to forgiveness
And you give as freely as you take

And what you dont know
It won't hurt you
And what you don't know will save you from some pain
But if i could choose I'd let it hurt you
Cause there's something 'bout the life in the pain

And I don't need to know your stories
Don't need to understand your pain
Cause I've been here since the beginning
And I'll be here the rest of the way
and I'll be here the rest of the way

Now you've tried your hand at running
But don't you try your hand at fate
Cause there's a moment to be taken
But it is right before you break

And what you dont know
It won't hurt you
And what you don't know will save you from some pain
But if i could choose I'd let it hurt you
Cause there's something 'bout the life in the pain
Yeah there's something 'bout the life in the pain
Yeah there's something 'bout the life in the pain---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
