You know that time changes, rips right through all our pages
And there ain't no going back
We've run through all these stages, sent here from many places
And I'm still coming back

I've watched you stand, oh I've watched you fall
Wouldn't change nothing at all, yeah, yeah
But if I'm still your man and we've been through it all
To me that's beautiful

And when tide changes you can see me fall
They'll just go masquerade themselves and never bleed for you at all
But if you lift your arms up now cause the lion's off your back
Your blood is pumping so damn fast, now I'ma bring you back

Well, I've watched you stand, oh I've watched you fall
Wouldn't change nothing at all, yeah, yeah
But if I'm still your man and we've been through it all
To me that's beautiful, yeah

When them bullies gone and the wine goes through
And all those hungry ladies have slept all their life about you, yeah
Oh, when you're empty and so tired, you can't seem to find you mind
Well, the sun is on your back my friend, now time to take what's mine

Well, I've watched you stand, oh I've watched you fall
Wouldn't change nothing at all, yeah, yeah
But if I'm still your man and we've been through it all
To me that's beautiful, yeah

But if you lift your arms up now cause the lion's off your back
Your blood is pumping so damn fast, now I'ma bring you back

Well, I've watched you stand, oh I've watched you fall
Wouldn't change nothing at all, yeah, yeah
But if I'm still your man and we've been through it all
To me that's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Yeah to me, yeah that's beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
