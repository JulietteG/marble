Look at me baby am i a little blurry
Now your tears have obstructed your view
This is only crazy, if you think it's crazy and
Of course it's always up to you
Now there's so much to say, you won't give away
Don't think you'll ever decide
To leave it up to me
To say what we both mean
I'm sorry but I'm over the ride

(chorus)
Because the last time
We had a nice time
Baby it was so long ago
Oh it was the right time
But now i think that I am ready for me
To let you go

So why do you care....Anymore
Why do you care
Why do you care....Anymore

All this time that you think
I would be here for your sake
I hope you've got a bottle of wine
And if it's a drinking problem
I'll be laughing at the bottom
Because i already finished mine
But there's so much to say
It's a giveaway, what you really feel inside
So you leave it up to me
To say what we both mean
I'm sorry but i'm over the ride

(chorus)
Because the last time we had a nice time
Baby it was so long ago
Oh it was the right time, but now i think that i am ready for me
To let you go
Oh and now the last time we had a nice time
Baby it was so long ago
And you could meet me right here or i could meet you right there
You could keep me right here how could you just not care

And i know
Feeling like a sun
When the night is done
So just let me shine

(chorus)
And the last time we had a nice time
Baby it was so long ago
Oh it was the right time, but now i think that i am ready for me
To let you go
Oh because the last time we had a nice time
Baby it was so long ago
Baby cause the last time we had a nice time baby
The last time baby, was so long ago---Lyrics submitted by mike.
