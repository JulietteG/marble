If you let me have a taste, I'll probably keep this world from falling down
I'm pulling on my E-brake, and when I turned around you were gone
You made me fall in love again, I know it's no ones fault but my own
I'm blinded by my reasons, well I guess that's why I'm all alone

(Chorus)
And that's what I wanted, and that's what I found, I
I could never change your mind, I could never reach you in time
All is lost, and is that all that I want yah

take those glasses off your face, can't you see your sun is going down
Can't believe you live that way, you're holding all your breathe for someone else
All I made was one mistake, almost seems like you were counting on more
Do I disappoint you, or did I do something more

(Chorus)
And that's what I wanted, and that's what I found, I
I could never change your mind, I could never reach you in time
All is lost, and is that all that I want yah

Well I was way too young, and I was way to shy
But I remember you, remember you
I must have asked myself, about a million times if

(chorus)
That's what I wanted, and that's what I found, I
I could never change your mind, I could never reach you in time
And that's what I wanted, and that's what I found, I
I could never change your mind, I could never reach you in time
All is lost, and is that all I want yah---Lyrics submitted by katelyn.
