There comes a moment when my heart must stand alone
On this lonely path I've chosen
Like a house thats not a home
Sometimes when I feel I've had enough
And I feel like giving up
You willed me to be all I can be
Now nothing can stop me

I believe in the power that comes
From a world brought together as one
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I

This is the moment we have dreamt of all our lives
We'll be the change we wish from others
We'll stand tall for what is right
And in my heart there'll be no doubt
The arms of the world will come reaching out
And embrace me to be all I can be
Now nothing can stop me

I believe in the power that comes
From a world brought together as one
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I

I believe the time is right now
Stand tall and make the world proud
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I
I believe in the power of you and I

I believe, I believe, I believe in..
I believe, I believe in..
[3x]
I believe, I believe, I believe in you..

I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I

I believe the time is right now
Stand tall and make the world proud
I beleive together we'll fly
I believe in the power...

I believe in the power that comes
From a world brought together as one
(Of you and I)
I believe together we'll fly
I believe in the power of you and I
(Power)
I believe the time is right now
(Oh you and I)
Stand tall and make the world proud
I believe together well fly
(Together we'll fly)
I believe in the power of you and I
(I believe in the power of you and I)---Lyrics submitted by Emilia.
