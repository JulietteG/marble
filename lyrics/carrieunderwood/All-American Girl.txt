Since the day they got married
He'd been prayin for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy

He could already see him holdin that trophy
Takin his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was fallin for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was droppin passes
Skippin practice just to spend more time with her

The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
And daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye"
but
now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want?"
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American"

Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl, all-American girl---
