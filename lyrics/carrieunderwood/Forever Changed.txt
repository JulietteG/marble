She remembers the nights hed come calling
His yellow-silk tie
In love she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride

[Chorus:]
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever changed

She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then

[Chorus:]
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever child,
Forever changed

Somedays shell talk about aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when shes coming over
And why she hasnt called
Somedays I just hold her fragile hand
As Tom crawls across the floor
Somedays it just kills me
To watch her memories slip away a little more

[Outro:]
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever child,
Forever loved,
Forever changed.---
