I would bet my life
like i bet my heart
that you were the one baby,
i've never been so sure
of anything before
you're driving my heart crazy
i can't hold out
i can't hold back now
like i've done before

darlin, look at me
i've fallin like a fool for you
darlin, can't you see
i'd do anything you want me to
i tell myself
i'm in too deep
then i fall a little farther
everytime you look at me

how do you do that babe
make me feel like i'm
the only girl alive for you
i dont know what it is
that makes me fall like this
first time in your arms i knew
the way you held me
i knew that this could be
what i've been waiting to find

darlin, look at me
ive fallin like a fool for you
darlin, cant you see
id do anything you want me to
i tell myself
gettin in too deep
then i fall a little farther
everytime you look at me

Everytime you look at me---Lyrics submitted by Briannah.
