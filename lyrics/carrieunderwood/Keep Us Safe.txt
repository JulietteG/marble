Deserts grow cold
Rivers run dry
We give up on each other without thinking twice
Hope gets lost
Cant see the dawn
When the storm just wont let up, give us the faith to carry on
When we get scared
Let this be our prayer

God keep us safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe

We walk a thousand steps in the wrong direction
Broken and bruised, wearing tattered shoes
Asking Him a thousand questions
But we go on
Trying to get back home
Through the struggles and the troubles I know we dont walk alone
Even when we get lost through the valleys we crossed

God keep us safe, safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
God keep us safe

Oh God keep us safe
Unafraid
And keep our eyes on the heavens and give us grace
Send us an army of angels
To make us brave
Keep us strong and unafraid
Keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
Keep us safe---
