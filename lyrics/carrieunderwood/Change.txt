what's ya gonna do with the 36 cents sticky with coke on your floor board
when a woman on the street is huddled in the cold on a sidewalk vent 
trying to keep warm.
do you call her over hand her the change
ask her her story ask her her name
or do you tell yourself

chorus:
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world

what's ya gonna do when your watching tv and an ad comes on
yeah you know the kind flashing the pictures of a child in need
for a dime a day you could save a life
do you call the number reach out a hand or do you change the 
channel call it a scam or
do you tell yourself

chorus: 
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
don't listen to it when they say
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
oh the smallest thing can make all the difference
love is alot don't listen to it when they say
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world


the world's so big it can break your heart and you just want to help not sure where to start
so you close your eyes send up a prayer into the dark


chorus: 
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
don't listen to it when they say
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
oh the smallest thing can make all the difference
love is alot don't  you listen to when they say
you're just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world---Lyrics submitted by Aimee.
