You know, I am a dreamer 
but my heart is gold 
I had to run away high 
so I wouldn't come home low 
Just when things went right 
Doesn't mean they were always wrong 
Just take this song 
And you'll never feel left all alone 
Take me to your heart 
Feel me in your bones 
Just one more night 
And I'm coming off this long winding road 

I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 

Tonight , Tonight 

I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 

You know that I seen 
too many romantic dreams 
Up in lights 
Fallin' off the silver screen 
My heart's like an open book 
For the whole world to read 
Sometimes nothing ,keeps me 
Together at the seams 

I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 

Tonight , Tonight 
I'm on my way 
just set me free 
Home sweet home 

Ooooo 

I'm on my way 
I'm on my way 
Home sweet home 

Yeaa 

I'm on my way 
just set me free 
Home sweet home

ooooooooooooo
oooooooooooo
