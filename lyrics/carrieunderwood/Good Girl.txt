Hey, good girl 
With your head in the clouds 
I bet you I can tell you 
What youre thinkin' about 
You'll see a good boy 
Gonna give you the world 
But hes gonna leave you cryin' 
With your heart in the dirt 

His lips are dripping honey 
But hell sting you like a bee 
So lock up all your loving 
Go and throw away the key 

Hey good girl 
Get out while you can 
I know you think you got a good man 

Why, why you gotta be so blind? 
Wont you open your eyes? 
Its just a matter of time 'till you find 
Hes no good, girl 
No good for you 
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go... 
Better listen to me 
Hes low, low, low... 

Hey, good girl 
You got a heart of gold 
You want a white wedding 
And a hand you can hold 
Just like you should, girl 
Like every good girl does 
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love 

But hes really good at lying girl 
Yeah, hell leave you in the dust 
'Cause when he says forever 
Well, it dont mean much 
Hey good girl 
So good for him 
Better back away honey 
You dont know where hes been 

Why, why you gotta be so blind? 
Wont you open your eyes? 
Its just a matter of time 'till you find 
Hes no good, girl 
No good for you 
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go... 
Yeah yeah yeah, hes low 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Hes no good, girl 
Why cant you see? 
Hell take your heart and break it 
Listen to me, yeah 

Why, why you gotta be so blind? 
Wont you open your eyes? 
Its just a matter of time 'till you find 
Hes no good, hes no good 

Wont you open up your eyes? 
Its just a matter of time 'till you find 
Hes no good, girl 
Hes no good for you 
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes---
