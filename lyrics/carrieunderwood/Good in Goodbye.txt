I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Times been sweet to you

[Chorus:]
As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didnt get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When youre holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday youll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes, theres good in goodbye

I dont regret it
The time we had together
I wont forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah Im happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day Ill see you on the street
And itd be bittersweet

[Chorus:]
As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didnt get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When youre holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday youll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes, theres good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah

[Outro:]
As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didnt get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When youre holding on to someone that you got to let go
Someday youll see the reason why
Yeah someday youll see the reason why
Theres good in goodbye, yeah
Theres good in goodbye ---
