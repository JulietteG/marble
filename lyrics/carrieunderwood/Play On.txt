What'cha gonna do when the show is over
What'cha gonna sing when the song ends
How you gonna cope when there is no closure
Where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher
How you gonna make it through
When you think you lost your chance

Play on
When you're losing the game
Play on
Cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth a sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on
Play on

Even when the flood gates swing wide open
Never let the current sink you down, no
Even when you're not sure when you're going
Swimmin' through a mess and you can't get out
Just going through the motions, trying not to drown

Play on
When you're losing the game
Play on
Cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth a sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on
Play on

Even through a storm on the darkest night
Don't you ever give up the fight
Even when you feel you're all alone

Play on
Play on
Play on
When you're losing the game
Play on
Cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth a sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on
Play on
Play on---Lyrics submitted by rian.
