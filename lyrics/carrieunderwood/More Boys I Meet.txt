This boy here wants to move too fast
He sees my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so, I don't think so

That boy there well he's playing a fool
He think it's funny and he thinks it's cool
Well, I don't think so, I don't think so

Cheap date, bad taste
Another night gone to waste talkin about nothin in so many words 
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I give anyone a shot once

[Chorus}
I close my eyes and 
I kiss that frog
Each time finding the more boys I meet
The more I love my dog

Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so, I don't think so

Cage fights,playstation, X- Games, rated nation
Over sized pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm bot trying
'Cause I give anyone a shot once

{Chorus}

Why can't they be like the ones
That mean everything to me
Warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not trying
"Cause I give anyone a shot once

I close my eyes and
I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more i love my dog
The more I love my dog---Lyrics submitted by faith.
