You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running
You're tired
You're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse
He's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out
But he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a good-time cowboy casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearin' what I say
So I'll say it again
'Cause I've been where you've been
And I know how it ends
You can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothin' but lies
And you wanna believe
But you won't be deceived
If you listen to me
And take my advice

He's a good-time cowboy casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

Run run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you want to hear
He'll break your heart
It's just a matter of time
But just remember

He's a good-time cowboy casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

Oh you better run for your life

Oh you better run for your life---
