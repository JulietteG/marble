Last night I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night I did things I'm not proud of and I got a little crazy
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor and I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where are you from?"
And then it turned in, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name

And we left the club about around 3 o'clock in the morning
His Pinto is sittin there in the parkin lot when it shouldve been a warnin
And I had no clue what I was gettin into so I blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where are you from?"
And then it turned in, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name, here we go!

Today I woke up thinkin' bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas, I'm not sure
How I got here or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
Outta nowhere, I gotta go, I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here stays here, all of this'll disappear
theres just one little problem

I don't even know my last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where are you from?"
And then it turned in, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done? What have I done? What have I done?
Oh, what have I done? I don't even know my last name
When it turned in, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

It started off, "Hey cutie, where are you from?"
And then it turned in, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name, oh yeah---
