Dry lightning cracks across the skies 
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes 
Her daddy was a mean old mister 
Mama was an angel in the ground 
The weather man called for a twister 
She prayed blow it down 

Theres not enough rain in Oklahoma 
To wash the sins out of that house 
Theres not enough wind in Oklahoma 
To rip the nails out of the past 

Shatter every window 'til its all blown away, 
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away 
'til theres nothing left standing, 
Nothing left of yesterday 
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away, 
Blown away 

She heard those sirens screaming out 
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch 
She locked herself in the cellar 
Listened to the screaming of the wind 
Some people called it taking shelter 
She called it sweet revenge 

Shatter every window 'til its all blown away, 
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away 
'til theres nothing left standing, 
Nothing left of yesterday 
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away, 
Blown away 

Theres not enough rain in Oklahoma 
To wash the sins out of that house 
Theres not enough wind in Oklahoma 
To rip the nails out of the past 

Shatter every window 'til its all blown away (blown away) 
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away (blown away) 
'til theres nothing left standing, 
Nothing left of yesterday (blown away) 
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away, 

Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away---
