He tells me hes working late
He tells me he cant stay too long
So I turn the lights off
I fall asleep before hes home
Tomorrow Ill wake up alone
Feeling that familiar low
My heart screaming no

But every time I think Ive had enough
He comes around and wraps me up in love
And I wind up giving in
Cause he gives me just enough
To make me think that theres still hope for us
In the end its only me
Wishing I could be
Wishing I still was
Enough

He thinks it's best to tell me lies
He don't even try to hide the truth
So he won't hurt me
He made a promise me he can't keep
He can't promise anything
That half a mil he gives to me
Will never be enough---
