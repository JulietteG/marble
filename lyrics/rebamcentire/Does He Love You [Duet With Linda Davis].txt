I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me, he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be

But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I'll never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytime
And sometimes, I have his nights

But does he love you
(Does he love you)
Like he loves me?
(Like he loves me?)
Does he think of you
(Does he think of you)
When he's holding me?

And does he whisper
(Does he whisper)
All of his fantasies
Does he love you
(Does he love you)
Like he's been lovin' me?

But when he's with me
He says he needs me
And that he wants me
That he believes in me

And when I'm with his arms
Oh, he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me
Or am I deceiving myself

But does he love you
(Does he love you)
Like he loves me?
(Like he loves me?)
Does he think of you
(Does he think of you)
When he's holding me?

And does he whisper
(Does he whisper_
All of his fantasies
Does he love you
(Does he love you)
Like he's been lovin me?

Oh, should I not lose my temper
(Should I not be ashamed)
'Cause I have everything to lose
(And I, I have nothing to gain)

But does he love you
(Does he love you)
Like he loves me?
(Like he loves me?)
Does he think of you
(Does he think of you)
When he's holding me?

And does he whisper
(Does he whisper)
All of his fantasies
Does he love you
(Does he love you)
Like he's been lovin me?
Oh, does he love you?---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
