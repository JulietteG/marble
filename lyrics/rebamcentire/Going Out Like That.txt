Its been awhile since she put that red dress on
And slipped into those high heels
Shes got a couple new guys blowing up her phone
And she loves the way that that feels
Youd never know she was going through a break-up
There aint a single tear messing up her makeup

He thought shed be sitting home crying
She aint going out like that
Shes had enough of feeling like dying
She aint going out like that

Everybody, here comes the life of the party
Yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she aint going out like that

Shes got her hands up, dancing like the floors on fire
Yeah, shes the hottest thing in here
Guess she finally got tired of being sick and tired
Now shes looking like she dont care
She was hurting, well she must have forgot
cause shes smiling while shes throwing back shots

Everybody, here comes the life of the party
Yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she aint going out like that

Everybody, here comes the life of the party
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she aint going out like that, going out like that

Everybody, here comes the life of the party
Everybody, here comes the life of the party
Yeah, she is---
