The sign says, "Families welcome"
At the Oaks Retirement Home
But mostly, no one comes
'Cept on the weekends

Ruby Wilson lives in 303
Where she spends most her time
But it's almost noon on Sunday
And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine

She's all dressed up in her best
Hat and gloves
She's all dressed up
She's watching and waiting but nobody comes

Some days sure are lonely days
And time can move so slow
When you're all dressed up 
With nowhere to go

As Ruby watches all the tohers
Leaving with their families
The nurse tells her
It's time to come to dinner

She says, she's expecting company
They're just running late
But the nuse knows the truth too well
She just sighs and walks away

She's all dress up in her best hat and gloves
She's all dressed up 
Watching and waiting but nobody comes
Some days sure are lonely days

And time can move so slow
When you're all dressed up
With nowhere to go
With nowhere to go---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl.
