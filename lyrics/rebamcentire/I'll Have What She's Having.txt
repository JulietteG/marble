No I don't want no Jack and Coke
Please sit me where there ain't no smoke
Don't want nothin' couding up my eyes
You see that girl over tehre
Dancing like she's on thin air
There's got to be a secret to her smile
Well i think that i just found it
And he's twirling her around
I'd like to place my order
You might want to write this down

I'll have what she's having
I want what she's got
Someone sweet as he can be
Any by the way
That hot
A tall order I suppose
But if you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's having

Well, I like the way he looks at her
It's plain to see he knows the word
That makes her shine from forty feet away
If there's any justice in this world
He's got a twin who wants a girl
Who looks like me
Excuse me while I pray
So if you could slip my number in that pocket on his hip
It would be appreciated 
And reflected in your tip

I'll have what she's having
I want what she's got
Someone sweet as he can be
And by the way
That hot
A tall order I suppose
But if you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's having

A tall order I suppose 
But if you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's having
I know it's wrong to covet
But why should she have all of it
I'll have what she's having
Oh, I'll have what she's having---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
