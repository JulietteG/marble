when the ground beneath you starts to shaking.. shaking
and you forget the place we came from... came from
when you're lost and looking for a way home, your way home to me
i'll come out and find you

when the world around you starts to moving... moving
and you should wonder if i still love you... love you
if you feel the darkness coming, rising inside
i'll make a light to guide you back home

and after all the sky has fallen down
and after all the water's washed away
my love's the only promise that remains

when your doubts have got you thinking... thingking
and nothing's ever really sacred... sacred
and you're afraid you might believe it
believe ini me and i'll give you a reason

'cause the world around us keeps on moving... moving
and there's no doubt that i still love you... love you
so when you feel darkness coming, rising inside
i'll make a light to guide you back home

and after all the sky has fallen down
and after all the water's washed away
my love's the only promise that remains
my love's the only promise that remains
my love's the only promise that remains

and after all the sky has fallen down
(and after all the sky has fallen down)
and after all the water's washed away
(and after all the water's washed away)
my love's the only promise that remains---Lyrics submitted by aRa.
