(Reba)
the sound of your voice
the touch of your skin
if we go there it will start all over again
so dont even call
theres no need for checkin in
if its really over
let it just be over
(chorus)(both)
no we wont be shareing coffee
or having lunch from time to time
i wont ask about your family
please dont ask me about mine
this is never what i wanted
and its killing me to say
it just has to be this way

(vince)
we gave all we could
we fought the good fight
but no matter how we loved we just couldnt get it right
(reba)
it hurts to let go
(vince)
but its harder hanging on
(reba)
i dont want it to be over
(vince)
we know that its over

(repeat chorus)

(reba)
and even if i change my mind
ohh let me hug you one more time
(both)
stay away from me
be as cold as you can be

(repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
