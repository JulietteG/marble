So promise me something, right here and now
You'll never lose me in a sea of a faceless crowd
Scream it from mountains, love me out loud
In quiet whispers you'll remind me what you found

And I swear not to give up on you
I swear that I'll always be your truth
I swear to bring you light in the darkest nights

Come, we will always be loved
It's scary, it's freeing, it's twirling in meaning
It's hiding from all you can and can't see
Romance and love, romance and love

Two roads approaching, which way do we turn?
Doesn't much matter cause we've lived and let go and we've learned
Without the map, it's just you and me
Leading each other in a world that'll always believe

Promise me, promise me love---
