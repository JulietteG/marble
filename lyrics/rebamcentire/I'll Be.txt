When darkness falls upon your heart & soul
Ill be the light that shines for you
When you forget how beautiful you are
Ill be there to remind you

When you cant find your way 
Ill find my way to you
When troubles come around
I will come to you 

Chorus

Ill be your shoulder
When you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter when you need someone to see you through
Ill be there to carry you
Ill be there

Ill be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain fallin down
When theres nobody else around
Ill be


And when youre there with no there to hold
Ill be the arms that reach for you
And when you feel your faith is running low
Ill be there to believe in you

When all you find are lies
Ill be the truth you need
When you need someone to run to
You can run to me

Chorus

Ill be the sun when your hearts filled with rain
Ill be the one to chase the rain away

Chorus

Ill be---Lyrics submitted by Tina.
