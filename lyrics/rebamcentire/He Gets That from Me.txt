his early mornin attitude
you have to drag him outta bed
only frosted flakes will do
he gets that from me
yeah, he gets that from me

his curly hair and his nobby knees
the waythe sun brings those freckles out
talk and talk never miss a beat
yeah he gets that from me
gets that from me

he looks at me with those big brown eyes
hes got me in the palm of his hand
and i swear sometimes 
its just like your here again
he smiles that little crooked smile
theres no denieing hes your child
without him i dont know what id do
he gets that from you
oh he gets that from you

he loves your old guitar 
he tought himself to play
he melts my heart
tells me he loves me everyday
and cracks a joke at the perfect time
makes me lauge when i wanna cry
that boy is everything to me
he gets that from you
he gets that from you

last night i heard him pray
lord, help me and momma make it through
and tell daddy we'll be ok
he said he sure misses you
he sure misses you
he really misses you
he gets that from me---Lyrics submitted by victoria.
