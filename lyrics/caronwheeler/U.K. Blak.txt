Many moons ago
We were told the streets were paved with gold
So our people came by air and sea
To earn a money they could keep
Then fly back home
Sadly this never came to be
When we learned we had just been invited
To clean up after the war
Back in '49 never intended to stay here
Who could afford to leave these shores

UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about

Born and raised this way
Is a different way biculturally
Fresh direction, new ideas
Opening our eyes and ears
Allowing us to save our day
No more frustration
Pushed back in isolation
Positive creativity
Finding ourselves
Aching to be set free

UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about
UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about

In society you can find me
If you stop living life so blindly
Daddy says we'll never change things
But I have faith in the African aboard, yes

UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about
UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about

UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about
UK Blak, ending the silence now
UK Blak, letting you know that we're about---Lyrics submitted by melanie.
