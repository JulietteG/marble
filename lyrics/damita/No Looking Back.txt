Verse 1
Im leaving this place now 
Letting go of all my fears
Saying goodbye to the memories I hold dear
I can finally breathe again
Its a new day fails I'll pass
As I close this chapter 
Im set free at last

CHORUS
Oooh oooh I say 
I made up my mind 
Theres no turning back
The past is behind me
Theres no looking back
Im looking forward not behind
I made the decision to give you my life
Ooh
And theres no looking back 
OOH I
And theres no looking back
And theres no look yeaaaa back

Verse 2
Every Step I take is new
I found courage to go on 
Though its rough sometimes 
I stil have to be strong
I may have to walk alone
But the one who lives inside 
Me is always there to comfort 
And to guide

And I wanna say

CHORUS

Verse 3 
I can see the sun breaking through the clouds 
Lift my hands causes Im alright right now
I can shout about it
I can laugh about it
I can talk about it

No looking back, said there's no looking back yeah
