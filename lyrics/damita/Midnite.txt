Hey
Da da da di da da
Mmmmm
da di da yeah da di da yeah

(Verse 1)
Looks like shadows fill the room
And you don't know what to do
You feel like you can't breathe
Will you ever find relief?

(Bridge)
But listen
You can wait a little longer
I know you're weak 
But you'll get stronger
This is just a test you're in
I know the sun will shine again

(Chorus)
Don't cry
It's alright
Joy comes in the morning light
Hold on
Just right now it's midnite
Look up to the sky
You'll understand it by and by
Hold on 
Just right now it's midnite

(Verse 2)
You feel depression in the room
Overwhelmed and misconstrued
You say all hope is lost
Your debt is too much to pay the cost

(Bridge)
(Chorus)

Whoa (Oh Ohhh)
Oh wipe the tears from your eyes (Ohhh)
'Cause everything is gonna be alright
Yeah
Joy comes in the morning time 
Oh yes it does
Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh

(Chorus)
Don't cry
It's alright (its alright)
Joy comes in the morning light
Hold on
Just right now it's midnite (look up)
Look up to the sky (to the sky)
You'll understand it by and by
Hold on 
Just right now it's midnite

Your answer is on the way
All you have to do is pray

When you feel all hope is gone
All you have to do is hold on---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
