The first time I saw you
Down by the blue ocean
You were talkin' like a fighter
Independently.
you were hanging on to a dream.
That's what I remember.
But the wildness in you
I can't explain.

Then one day on the street
comes the beautiful stranger
from such a casual thing
a great change has come.
And if he could have loved you more
still there'd be no reason
to go down that road
where love's in vein.

And now I think I know your heart
when love carried you away.
I heard you returned to half moon bay
To half moon bay.

And it's a cold cold night.
You can almost hear the sea wind blow
as though on a radio
a lonesome sound.
And he wonders where you are tonight
and what are you thinking.
You're lost when he repeats your name.

And you turn on the headlights
as the raging moon rises.
You go deeper and deeper 
in the familiar dark.
And as the fog is creeping in
down in the valley
you're high on a hill
you're still going home.

And now I think I know your heart
when love carried you away.
I heard you returned to half moon bay.

And now I think I know your heart
when love carried you away.
I heard you returned to half moon bay
To half moon bay
To half moon bay---Lyrics submitted by bobradar.
