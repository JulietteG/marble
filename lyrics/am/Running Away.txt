Did I tell you I knew your name
But it seems that I've lost it
Did I tell you it's my own game
This is not your problem

I don't know if I'm gonna change
Wasting time and another day
I don't know if I'm gonna change
Wasting time and another day

I keep running away
Even from the good things

Did I tell you it's not that bad
Sitting over here dreaming
Did I tell you I'm right on track
This time I mean it

I don't know if I'm gonna change
Wasting time and another day

I keep running away
Even from the good things
I keep running away
Even from the good things

I keep running away
Even from the good things---Lyrics submitted by PhoebeAllisan.
