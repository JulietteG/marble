I know its late baby
i've been dialing your number all day, i'v been missing you like crazy
Your acting like you hate me
Yes i know, i was wrong, i just want you back just say you'll take me!
it just cant be over
You took away your phone calls and visits
I thought that we were closer
Your giving me the cold shoulder
When i want your warm hugs and kisses
Thats what i need the most

(Chorus) 
Its like Bonnie with no Clyde 
Without you by my side
Its like a part of me died away
(since you've been gone)
If i spent some time without you, thought i'd be ok
I cant replace you, i tried, it didnt work that way
So tell me where will you go, and tell me whos gonna love you like i do
Since you been gone
( gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Since you been gone

I cant respect your feelings
So tell me when you thought about it, did you think of me at all
You dont seem to be affected
Im trying to correct it
You shoot me down, how could you watch me fall
I make mistakes that dont mean that i dont love you 
I learn to love you more, watever, just let me know
I feel so empty 'cause you've taken your love out of my life
I'll keep you happy darling dont let me go

(Chorus)
Its like Bonnie with no Clyde 
without you by my side
Its like a part of me died away
( since you been gone)
If i spend some time without thought i'd be ok
I tried to replace you, i tried, it didnt work that way
So tell me where will you go, and tell me whos gonna love you like i do
Since you been gone
( gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
since you been gone

This time ill say i love you everytime we speak
make you my priority
be your stength when you are weak
This time whenever you call me ill be there
No matter what im doing i will come no matter where
This time i will give you all the lovin that i got
Say the right things, i dont want to lose what i got 
I dont want to hurt no more, let your guard down baby open up the door and let me in

(Chorus)
Its like Bonnie with no Clyde
without you by my side
its like a part of me died away
(since you been gone)
If i spend some time without you thought i'd be ok
I tried to replace you, i tried, it didnt work that way
So tell me where will you go, and tell me whos gonna love you like i do
since you been gone
( gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Since you been gone

Since you been gone
( gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Oh since you been gone
Since you been gone
(gone, gone,gone, gone,gone,gone)
Its like Bonnie with no Clyde
Without you by my side 
its like a part of me diead away
(since you been gone)
If i spend some time without you thought i'd be ok
I tried to replace you, i tried, it didnt work that way
So tell me where will you go, and tell me whos gonna love you like i do
Since you been gone 
( gone, gone, gone. gone, gone. gone)
Since you been gone---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
