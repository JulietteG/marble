You are made of sugar, milk and molasses
Oh, little darlin' you'll attract all the bees
You are the gazer, you are the attraction
Takes a little vanity to know what it means

I know it 'cause you wrote it down a hundred times
But you say that you're doin' just fine

Say there's something better
But today there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, tonight you're givin' up

I asked a question, gimme an answer
You'll say the word and I will disappear

You're runnin' fast, but you can run faster
Heels to the dirt, gonna make it clear

I know it 'cause you wrote it down a hundred times
But you say that you're doin' just fine

Say there's something better
But today there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, you know you'll never find it

Say there's something better
But today there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, tonight you're givin'...

Darkness, you can't hear me
I will try to draw you near me
But in the morning, you will wake up alone
When your body breaks
Even the humming birds will feel the earthquake
You'll sing a song of your heart's complaint

Sing it loud
Sing it clear
Oh, sing so I can hear you, then
Sing it soft in my ear

Take it off
Oh, take care
Put me down
In the grass
I'll go anywhere with you

Say there's something better
You don't see it
You won't find it

Say there's something better
You're behind it
But you won't get it

La da da dada da
La da da dada da

Say there's something better
But today there is a cold moon rising
And you wanted something better
But tonight, you know you'll never find it

La da da dada da
La da da dada da

Say there's something better
You don't see it
You won't find it

Say there's something better
You're behind it
But you won't get it---Lyrics submitted by Christin.
