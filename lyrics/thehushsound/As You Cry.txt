I'm a half-hearted fool
With a heart that's broke in two
A quarter and a kiss
Is all I should be worth to you.

I must be the last of my kind
'Cause you treasure me despite all the signs
Your love is disappearing
Darlin', you shouldn't even try

After every fight we always wonder what we're fighting for
Mint me up and mark me yeah you stole me but I am not yours

[Chorus]
As you cry, I wanna lie
Say I love you so, Darling, even though I don't
There's no easy way to ease the pain
(Whoa)
The roses and the tulips have withered away
They had their day, and so it's time to say goodnight and goodbye

You're so bright that you shine right through
All the problems that I always try to lay on you
Won't you take me off, darling, and get some air in this room?

I can't believe in what I cannot hold inside of my hand
Won't let nobody in who might decide to mess up the plan
I'd be a liar if I told you that we would work out

After every fight we always wonder what we're fighting for
Mint me up and mark me yeah you stole me but I am not yours

[Chorus]

Nobody's singing about you anymore
You thought you heard it well you must'a heard wrong
It's my business and that's alright
Don't you see that?

As you cry, I wanna lie
Say I love you so, Darling, even though I don't
There's no easy way to ease the pain
(Whoa)
The roses and the tulips have withered away
They had their day, and so it's time to say goodnight and goodbye
(Goodbye)---Lyrics submitted by Christin.
