Rain falls, quickly wetting my hair and clothes
My cries fall upon her deaf ears more tears
Let me in, please it's cold I'm freezing out here, I miss you my dear
You're all his and I'm all yours, like it or not, I'm all you've got

Everyone will make mistakes
Without the sour the sweet wouldn't taste and...

Sweet tangerine, will you please come back to me?
Cause I don't think that these feelings are gonna leave

Light cuts through the clouds and haunts me, like bad dreams
Outside lookin' in I'm feeling lost and cold as a sin
A shred of hope a little bit of sweetness - anything please, except for defeat
If I could I'd lock you up and toss out the key, it's just you and me

Everyone will make mistakes (and I know I have)
Without the sour the sweet wouldn't taste and...

Sweet tangerine, will you please come back to me?
Cause I don't think that these feelings are gonna leave (yeah, yeah)
Sweet melody, you'll be singing in your sleep
But this time you're not listening to a word I say

Crept through the curtains, as quick as the cold wind
Slowly exploring the room where you sleep
The stare of your portrait, the passing of your scent
Left me no choice but to stay

I will dissolve into the dark beneath your bed
My hands will wait for a taste of your skin

Sweet tangerine, will you please come back to me?
Cause I don't think that these feelings are gonna leave (yeah, yeah)
Sweet melody, you'll be singing in your sleep
But this time you're not listening to a word I say
A word I say---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlin.
