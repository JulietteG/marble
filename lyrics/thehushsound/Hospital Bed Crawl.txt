In the backseat of a car
In the corner of a room
In the shadows where I hide from you

Do the hospital bed crawl
And the terminal yell
And the violently alone I feel

                   [Chorus]
Well, hey  your the only thing I wouldn't change 
In this place, it's strange to say
You're the only angel I ever gave away

In the alleyway way downtown
There's a lurker making rounds
Keeping track and keeping tabs on you
And he likes the taste of blood
And he loves the way you love 
And thats just what he wants from you 

              [Chorus]

I don't want your shining eyes
Darling don't you be polite
I'm just like all the other boys
I won't take a no
I'm soaking in your cinnamon
I've taken more then I can give
Without you I'm alone
So I'll never let you go!

              [Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Niki.
