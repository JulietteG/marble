This is a drought
Living without the one this that I require
What a mess
Passionless
Somewhere I lost the fire
Oh my, my
Where has it gone?
Can someone turn this beat back on?
My heart is fast asleep
Dreaming it could be
For something that's real
A desperate appeal
God I'm getting tired of the way I feel
When I would rather be alive

I want to wake up
I want to restart
Put the drumbeat back in my heart
I need to be revived
Bring me back to life

Coming on slow head to toe
The pulse is back again
Its grace in my veins - replacing the pain
Bringing me back from the dead
Oh my my now I can see
You heard me cry "emergency"
Screaming out for help
You saved me from myself
The fires returned Im letting it burn
Theres nothing better in the whole wide world
It feels so good to be alive 

(2x)
I want to wake up
I want to restart
Put the drumbeat back in my heart
I need to be revived
Bring me back to life

(2x)
It feels so good to be alive
It feels so good

Bring me back to live---Lyrics submitted by Larry.
