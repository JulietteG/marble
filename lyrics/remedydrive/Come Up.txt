Fallen short
falling into line
you're falling apart again
missed the mark
missing out this time
you're missing the point again

come up come up Ill show you worlds to come
come up come up
we can outlive the sun

such a fall
its hard to find out why
you're living but not alive
not alive
barely getting by
so barely you're hanging on

come up come up Ill show you worlds to come
come up come up
we can outlive the sun---Lyrics submitted by jayden.
