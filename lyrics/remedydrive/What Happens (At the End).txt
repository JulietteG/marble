What happens when the song i sing doesn's seem to mean a thing,
and everyhting i have to bring is borrowed and rehearsed
what happens when the music ends i'm to tired too pretend
that who i am and who i've been can ever get along
nows the time for letting go
chorus:
i surrender all- can you hear my call?
when i'm at the end of myself
is this where you begin when i'm caving in
when i'm at the end of myself

what happens when the motion stop-staring at a broken clock
when what i am and what i'm not are perfectly reversed
nows the time for letting go---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey.
