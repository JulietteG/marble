Has everyone you've counted on 
Left you right here with no warning
Have your dreams become invisable
Wait with me dear till the morning
Light will make the night burn out

Hold on - Daylight is coming
To break the dawn
Daylight is coming

The brightest stars are falling down
Is hope lost in the black skies
The darkness must precede the dawn
Wait with me here till the sunrise
Wait your night will soon fade out---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
