Some ones wear their heart on their sleeve.
Me, I've got to have it on hand,
or I can't sleep.

I keep it under my thumb
in the palm of my hand.

Some ones show the world what they've got.
I keep it under wraps,
I tie a lover's knot.
From around my wrist
to my fingertips:

I've got a love like a glove
got a grip on me
I've got a push and a shove
like machinery

When it gets too big
it will shrink to fit
I've got a love like a glove
and I'm wearing it.

Some ones wear their heart on their sleeve.
Me, I've got to have it on hand
or I can't sleep.

I keep it under my thumb
in the palm of my hand.

I've got a love like a glove
got a grip on me
I've got a push and a shove
like machinery

When it gets too big
it will shrink to fit
I've got a love like a glove
and I'm wearing it.

Some ones show the world what they've got.
I keep it under wraps
I tie a lover's knot.

You've got to fight to keep it
loose and legal.
Love don't leave it
keep it hand to hand.

I've got a love like a glove
got a grip on me.
I've got a push and a shove
like machinery.

When it gets too big
it'll shrink to fit.
I've got a love like a glove
and I'm wearing it.---Lyrics submitted by Crystal Shepard.
