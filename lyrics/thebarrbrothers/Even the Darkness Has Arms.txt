I was holding my breath
When the tightrope walker slipped into the moon glow
Saying all my children, follow me
Maybe it's time to go

You can be cruel when you're wise
You can be wise when you're blue
And baby, if I have
Then I have for you

Bribing the jury to keep me in jail
Singing tea for the tiller man
And although I lie fantastically
This woman knows of my history
It's a miracle I can see

You can be wrong when you're right
Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight
Then I die for you

All I know is they call me son
Great grandson and grandson
Great uncles and some relatives
That judge what I have done

Gonna make it right by you
Even if it's all I do
And if it's all I do
Then I do it for you

People have raised a whole lotta hell
About the water in the windmill
And although I stab chaotically
It hurts no one but me

Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
And baby, I have it
And I have you, too

And the light in the window
To pass the night through
Maybe so uncertain
But what can I do

Keeping it on
Keeping it on
And I know I like it
But what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you

I bring to you with reverent hand
All the books and the lullabies
The kind woman that my passion wore
Like the shoreline wears the tides

Maybe the water went dry
Keeping an eye on you
And with an eye on you
It could drown me, too

People have raised a whole lotta hell
About the water in the windmill
And although I stab chaotically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see

Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
And baby, I have it
And I have you, too

And the light in the window
To pass the night through
Maybe so uncertain
But what can I do

Keeping it on
Keeping it on
And I know I like it
But what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you---
