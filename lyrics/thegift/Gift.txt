Chorus:

this is what i bought you, this you may keep
this is what i bought you, may forget me,
i promise to depart, just promise one thing
kiss my eyes and lthis is what i bought you, this you can keep,

i dropping the game to rain like rain drops sustain the fame,
the name you cant stop, its Traphik, so put this tape in and blast it,
since the age of 5 my flows been jurassic, bring back the track, 
and feel the flashback, my mind is abstract, immune to whack raps,
leagl home wraps attacked, i clap back, dreams of main stream but keep
my back-pack,  im still a civilian out to make millions,
so pussy on wax,and  rip like brazilians, i bring this gift to lift up the movement,
bust up in your crib to give home improvement, outside the box got these worms on lock , i dont stop the show, i cause time to stop i bring this presence
my gift is the essence of hip-hop, the future its me in your presence.

chorus:

this is what i bought you, this you can keep,
this is what i bought you, may forget me,
i promise you my heart, just promise to
sing kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep.

now stop pause, and rewind it back its the young crouching tiger
with the flying attack, i dont crumb, but im here to throw some rice on the track,
and i dont came from the bay, but im so nice in the sack,
i spit with a gold, rip souls in slow motion, street corners, syphers types of free motion,
slap ashy-ass and cease with no lotion, im smooth in the booth,
straight coz, and co-motion,  abstract flow made my
nasdack grow,  and a black lack slow, with a ass fat hoe,
lip smack the track, with off the top magic, im in hot spaztics, spitting out plastic,
destined im blessed to go platinum, my ink marks MC's for life tattinum
so take a break sleep these wrods you may keep, 
and rememberthis face, the face of TRAPHIK

ohx6
(oh) kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep
this is the part you'd be me
this isare the thoughts that make me nieve
i promise you my heart, you promised
to sing kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep---Lyrics submitted by joel.
