You are to me
What poetry tries to say with a word
You are a song
All the music my heart ever heard

I can't escape
The air that I breathe even speaks of you
And I'm not ashamed to say
That I feel this way

I will stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love, with, with you
(So in love, ooh, hoo)

Words can't express
What I confess with each beat of my heart
I'm overwhelmed
With a passionate affair from the start, oh

Our love will grow
As the years come and go, I will be by your side, oh yes, I will
There isn't anything
That I would deny

I will stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow 
I am so in love, I am so in love with you

I promise to honor and cherish you
For better of for worse
I'll be there for you

For richer or for poorer
In sickness and in health
Till death do us part

(And I will)

From this day on and forever

I will stand before God
(I will)
Give You all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
(I will promise you)
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love, I am so in love
(I am so in love)

I am so in love with you
(Ooh, ooh )
I am so in love 
(With you)---Lyrics submitted by Antoinette.
