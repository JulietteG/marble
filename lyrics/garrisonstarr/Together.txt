I don't know how to tell you
That I've been wrong
And I've known the same old thing
For so long

Been trying so hard
To put it all together
And how can I
Put it all together?

In time with you
The days run into days
And everything is new
I wanna stay with you

I've been trying so hard
To keep it all together
And how will I
Keep it all together?

I can't stand the shape I'm in
I'm gonna lose my way again
And I can feel ya come in
Don't wanna hurt forever

I'm gonna need some help
To get it all together
And I'm gonna need some help
How will I?

Keep it all together
Keep it all together
Keep it all together, hey, yeah---Lyrics submitted by kitty larson.
