Oh, baby, I found heaven when I found you
And this heaven is somethin I dont wanna lose
I only that if you ever said goodbye, I couldnt stand the pain
These eyes would cry, cry, cry like the rain

And the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky
Baby, please
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no

Cause this world would stop turnin, I know
And Id lose my whole world if you go
Baby, dont
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no

Oh, baby, I saw forever when I saw you
And if you left me, I cant imagine what Id do
Now that Ive gone and built my world around your love, I wouldnt let you go
Dont ever say goodbye, no, dont, dont, dont ever go

Cause the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky
Baby, please
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no

'Cause this world would stop turnin, I know (Yes, I know)
And Id lose my whole world if you go (If you go)
Baby, please
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no

Cause you might as well take away my life from me
What good would a life without you be anyway (Anyway)
If you go away 

Well, the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky (From the sky)
Baby, please
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no

Cause this world would stop turnin, I know (Yes, I know)
And Id lose my whole world if you go (If you go)
Baby, dont, no
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no
Dont take away my heaven, dont take away your love
Dont take away my world cause baby I need your touch
Baby, dont
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no

Please dont take away my heaven
Please
Baby, dont, oh, no
Dont take away my heaven, oh

Dont take away my heaven, dont take away your love
Dont take away my world cause baby I need your touch
Baby, dont, oh
Dont take away my heaven, oh, no---Lyrics submitted by Judy.
