My love, been such a long, long time
One day I always knew Id hear from you again
But Im sorry to find youre havin such hard times
But you thought of me in your time of need, so I say

Build me a road, dear, and I will come runnin
No matter how long or how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me
I promise Ill be there whenever you need

Who thought it would ever come to this
One last letter with no one last kiss
As the seasons go by, every day youre on my mind, baby
Thank you for using Top40db.com.
I long one day to be with you, so I say

Build me a road, dear (Oh, yes), and I will come runnin (Ill come runnin)
No matter how long or (How) how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me
(I promise) I promise (Ill be there) Ill be there whenever you need

You promised me, I promised you
The love for one another was true
But somewhere in time we went on with our lives
Now were, oh, so far apart, too far to make a start
Too long to make it end, I must see you again

Build me a road, dear, and I will come runnin
No matter how long (No matter) or how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me
I promise Ill be there (Hey...) whenever you need

Where ever you are
Where ever you are, mmm...yeah
Where ever you are
Where ever you are, mmm

Hoo....hmm...
Hoo...hoo...ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...yeah
Hoo...ooh...
