[ALISSA:]
All the lights go down as I crawl into the spaces
If I died on the screens
Life tearing at the seams

Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare

If it falls apart I would surely wake it
Bright lights turn me clean
This is worse than it seems

Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare

[TOM:]
They'll get through
They'll get you
In the place that you feel it the most
When you're cornered
When it's forming
In the place that you wish was a ghost

[ALISSA:]
Wo-oah
Wo-oah
Wo-oah, wo-oah
Wo-oah
Wo-oah
Wo-oah, wo-oah

Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare
Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever wanna be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare ---
