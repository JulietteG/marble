Verse 1:
Orders in to risen lines
Were alone but side by side
We hate to dream, we hate to dream
Nothing here is what it seems

Theres an animal inside
Theres a fear that wont subside
Of all the things Ill never do
Will I ever follow through
Theres an animal inside
Theres an animal inside

Chorus:
Half awake and almost there
 if be better still
We aim to be
We aim to be
All the time and energy

A-ah-ah silence
A-ah-ah silence

Verse 2:
Could we try to reinvent
Feed the head, the common sense
Through the streets and avenues
Climbing up the walls with you
Climbing up the walls with you

Chorus:
Half awake and almost there
 if be better still
We aim to be
We aim to be
All the time and energy

A-ah-ah silence
A-ah-ah silence

Verse 3:
Leave this place behind in silence
And the way we find silence
Leave me to the edge of night
To the dawn the end of time
Till the fire blazing light
Shines again within our eyes
Half awake and almost there
Even if the angels swear
We aim to be
We aim to be
All the time and energy

Chorus:
Half awake and almost there
 if be better still
We aim to be
We aim to be
All the time and energy---
