When the wind blows 
Through the window 
And the sun goes down 
All over the city 

Over rooflops 
On the next stops 
Through the subway down 
Where everythings gritty 

When the nights comes round 
How I love this city 

When it all comes down 
I love this city 

When it all comes down 
This city was made for me 
City go high 
I love this city 

When the wind blows 
Lights like rainbows 
And the coulors splash 
All over the city 

Queuing door lines 
VIPS & invites 
When the girls come out 
And you look so pretty 

When the streets glow 
Put me front row 

When it all comes down 
I love this city 

When it all comes down 
This city was made for me 
City go high 
I love this city 

When that wind blows 
Put me front row 

When it all comes down 
I love this city 

When it all comes down 
I love this city 

When it all comes down 
I love this city 

When the wind blows 
Put me front row 
Take me all night long---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
