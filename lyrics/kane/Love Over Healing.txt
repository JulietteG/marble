Woman come see me
Woman come hear me now
I didn't mean it
Woman come hear me out

All that I seek is, 
All that is seek is out
Woman believe it
Love over healing now

When you say, what you say what you do to me
Ohohohohohohooooh
I didn't know what to do
I just wanna stay close to you

Woman come see me
Woman come hear me out
It's time to release it
All that we have is now

When you say, what you say what you do to me
Ohohohohohohooooh
I didn't know what to do
I just wanna stay close to you

When you say, what you say what you do to me
Yeahyeahyeah, yeahyeahyeah
I didn't know what to do
I just wanna stay close to you

Love over healing
Love over healing now
Time to believe it
All that we have is now

When you say, what you say what you do to me
Ohohohohohohooooh
I didn't know what to do
I just wanna stay close to you, oh

When you say, what you say what you do to me
Yeahyeahyeah, yeahyeahyeah
I didn't know what to do
I just wanna stay close to you

Ohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohoh
I just wanna stay close, close

When you say, what you say, what you do to me
Yeahyeahyeah, yeahyeahyeah
I didn't know what to do
I just wanna stay close to you

Madam come see me
Woman come hear me out---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
