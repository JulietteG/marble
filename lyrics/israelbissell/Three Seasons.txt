I sit alone, though you sit beside me. 
Two hearts that beat as one. 
Now marching to different drummers.

What have I done? What have you done? 
Weve created a world with three seasons. 
Three seasons lacking a summer.

Have we run out of words for each other? 
Have we run, out of places to hide together? 
Has rust taken hold to brittle shared souls? 
Or can we once again change the weather?

If we were to meet unknown to each other, 
could I create some distraction? 
To gain once more a hope of attraction from you.

Is this how it is? A silent retreat. By two who were one 
for so many seasons. Should we try for the sake of love, 
to return to the days of unified reason?

What can I do? What can you do? 
To restore our heart beat once more. 
Two sitting as one, silent alone, together behind a closed door.

If we were to meet unknown to each other, 
could I create some distraction? 
To gain once more a hope of attraction from you.

What have I done? What have you done? 
Weve created a world with three seasons. 
Three seasons lacking a summer.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
