When Edgar dreams he screams and screams and his 
neighbors are getting concerned. 
His shuttered glass, cracked by a ravens beak. 
Brave little children dare to peek into what they could become.

When Edgar shops he stops and talks, 
his friends just love a good tell. Of his plunge into private hell. 
Even strong hearted cringe at the thoughts from his mind.

Perhaps a punishment hes taken on for 
someones past lifes sins.
But he gets his slumber. Entombed six feet under 
so you can enjoy a good fright.

When Edgar dreams he screams and screams and his 
neighbors think it good business. 
Hes good for a showing, round hearth fires glowing 
for an October evenings jack-a-lanterns grin.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
