Another winters evening. Cant count the snow flakes falling. 
Perfect time for a cup of coffee, keep the phone close case youre calling. 
Chilly bones in a comfy chair. The fire cracks the icy air. 
Another day of forgotten wishes. Hopeful answers join the piling dishes

STEPPING QUICKLY ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR. 
I MISS THE CARPET SPREADING TO THE DOOR. 
SO DELIGHTFUL ON A SUMMERS DAY, BUT WOOD SEEMS FRIGID 
WHEN I MAKE MY WAY TO AN EMPTY BED AND 
DREAMS OF HARDWOOD FLOORS.

Touch the frost on the window pane, trace two hearts with my finger. 
Watch them slowly fade away. Condensation, they never linger.
Pull the robe tight to my shoulders. Fires burning but it burns much colder. Waiting for the ice storm thaw. Whipping wind finds the chinks to explore.

STEPPING QUICKLY ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR. 
I MISS THE CARPET SPREADING TO THE DOOR. 
SO DELIGHTFUL ON A SUMMERS DAY, BUT WOOD SEEMS FRIGID 
WHEN I MAKE MY WAY TO AN EMPTY BED AND 
DREAMS OF HARDWOOD FLOORS.

Guess Ill turn the lights down low, let the snowflakes build. 
Try to muster up the courage to push away from the window sill. 
Let the phone rest till tomorrow. A telemarketers silent sorrow. 
Icy sheets for my nights companion, theyll warm up soon 
with the understanding.

In the morning cross the hardwood floor. Empty mailbox outside the door. 
A frosty carpet spreading out before me. Bright white in the misty glory. 
Take my seat by the window and stare at the hardwood floor.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
