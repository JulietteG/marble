I'm looking for a strong and steady heart
For a love that won't fall apart
At the first sign of trouble, near or far
I'm looking through eyes that have shed some tears
And I'm looking for that one who's gonna face my fears
Without thinking he must erase each scar

I'm gonna find you baby, wherever you are
Wherever you are love won't leave you stranded
Wherever you are love won't let you hide
Wherever you are, one of these days
We'll be walking side by side
All it takes is some time and destiny
A little courage for those days when all we see
Is a cold lonely rain coming down hard

I'm gonna find you baby, wherever you are
Wherever you are love won't leave you stranded
Wherever you are love won't let you hide
Wherever you are, one of these days
We'll be walking side by side
I'm looking for a love that's meant for me
I can't be bothered with some wannabe
Just like the light from heaven's stars
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you baby, wherever you are ---Lyrics submitted by Johanna Grisoli.
