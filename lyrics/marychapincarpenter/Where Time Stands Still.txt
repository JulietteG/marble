Baby where's that place where time stands still 
I remember like a lover can 
But I forget it like a leaver will 
It's no place you can get to by yourself 
You've got to love someone and they love you 
Time will stop for nothing else 
And memory plays tricks on us, the more we cling, 
The less we trust 
And the less we trust the more we hurt 
And as time goes on it just gets worse 
So baby where's that place where time stood still 
It is under glass inside a frame 
Was it over when you had your fill

And here we are with nothing but
But this emptiness inside of us 
Your smile a fitting, final gesture 
Wish I could have loved you better

Baby where's that place where time stands still 
I remember like a lover can 
But I forget it like a leaver will 
It's the first time that you held my had 
It's the smell and the taste and the fear and the thrill 
It's everything I understand 
And all the things I never will---Lyrics submitted by Lesli.
