She makes his coffee, she makes his bed
she does the laundry, she keeps him fed
when she was 21 she wore her mother's lace
she said forever with a smile upon her face

she does the car pools, she PTA's
doctors and dentists, she drives all day
when she was 29 she delivered number three
and every Christmas card showed a perfect family

Everything runs right on time,
years of practice and design,
spit and polish til it shines,
he thinks he'll keep her.
everything is so benign,
safest place you'll ever find,
God forbid you change your mind
he thinks he'll keep her.

she packs his suitcase, she sits and waits
with no expression, upon her face
when she was 36 she met him at their door
she said I'm sorry I don't love you anymore

Everything runs right on time,
years of practice and design,
spit and polish til it shines,
he thinks he'll keep her.
everything is so benign,
safest place you'll ever find,
God forbid you change your mind
he thinks he'll keep her.

for 15 years she had a job and not one raise in pay
now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage

Everything runs right on time,
years of practice and design,
spit and polish til it shines,
he thinks he'll keep her.
everything is so benign,
safest place you'll ever find,
AT least until you change your mind
he thinks he'll keep her.
