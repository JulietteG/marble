Stack shot Billy in the back of the head
Stack made sure Billy Lyons was dead
.45 pistol down in Stacks right hand
Sent him away to the promise land

Stack shot Billy
.45
Stack shot Billy
Billy laid down and died

Stack Lee had himself an evil brain
Loved his gun and his sweet cocaine
But Stack got quite when shadows fell
He knew soon enough hed burn in hell

Stack shot Billy
.45
Stack shot Billy
Billy laid down and died

Stack shot Billy in the back of the head
Stack made sure Billy Lyons was dead
.45 pistol down in Stacks right hand
Sent him away to the promise land

Stack shot Billy
.45
Stack shot Billy
Billy laid down and died---Lyrics submitted by Ed.
