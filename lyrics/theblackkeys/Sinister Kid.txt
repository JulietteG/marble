Well the crooks are out
And the streets are grey
You know I wouldn't have it any other way (Yeah)
Your mother's words
They're--they're ringin' still
But your mother don't pay our bills (Yeah)

Chorus
A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A-time gets split from the day he's born
Straight into his Maker's arms
That's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
And that's me, that's me
The Devil won't let me be

I got a tortured mind
And my blade is sharp
A bad combination
In the dark
If I killed a man
In the first degree
Baby would ya, would ya flee with me?

(Chorus - Repeat 2x)---Lyrics submitted by Braden.
