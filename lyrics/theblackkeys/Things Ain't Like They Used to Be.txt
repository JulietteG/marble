i went around the way for you
did all those things you asked me to
i thought it was the perfect day
till you just opened up to say

chorus
it doesnt mean a thing to me

it doesnt mean a thing to me
and its about time you see
things aint like they used to be

i headed out to lester hill
but that just made me weaker still
shes got the kind of love i need
the kind thats never good on me

repeat chorus

i walked into the battle blind

it happens almost all the time
the yard is kinds over grown
and all those happy times are gone---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
