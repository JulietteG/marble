Nah nah, nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah (x2)
Wo oh oh (x2)

So long
Why you waiting so long?
After every single word is said
I'm feeling dead and gone

Along
Don't you drag me along
If you do, you know I'll follow you
Until the truth is gone

I'll go anywhere you go (x2)
oh oh oh (x2)
All the way, all the way
I'll go anywhere you go (x2)
All the way...

So long
why'd it take you so long
Every time I hear the whistle blow
I'm down below, you're gone

Don't call me, I'll call you
With what you say, I'll obey
a cheer tonight, or eatin' right
I need to say, gotta say

I'll go anywhere you go (x2)
oh oh oh (x2)
together
All the way, all the way---Lyrics submitted by SLeepdepD.
