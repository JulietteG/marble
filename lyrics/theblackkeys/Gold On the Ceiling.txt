Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind cant take much more
I could never drown in

They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I aint blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
Its alright
Aint no guard in my house

Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just cant go without
I could never drown in

They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I aint blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
Its alright
Aint no guard in my house

They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I aint blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
Its alright
Aint no guard in my house---
