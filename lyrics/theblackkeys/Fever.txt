Fever, where'd you run to? 
Fever, where'd you run to? 
Acting right is so routine 
Fever, let me live a dream 

Fever, I'm a slave to 
No one misbehaved too 
Fever, they're misunderstood 
Wouldn't leave you if I could 
Fever 

Fever cuz I'm breaking 
Fever got me aching 
Fever, why don't you explain? 
Break it down again 

Fever got me guilty 
Just go ahead and kill me 
Fever, why don't you explain? 
Break it down again 

Fever, can you hear me? 
Fever, can you hear me? 
You shook me like I've never been 
Now show me how to live again 

Ya used to be a blessing 
But fever's got me stressing 
Realize I have been played 
But fever let me play the game 
Fever 

Fever, cuz I'm breaking 
Fever got me aching 
Fever, why don't you explain 
Break it down again 

Fever got me guilty 
Just go ahead and kill me 
Fever, why don't you explain 
Break it down again 

Now if the cold pale light in your eyes 
Reaches those horizon lines 
You know not to leave her 
Fever---
