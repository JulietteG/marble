I`ll admit it, I`ve done a few things that I shouldn`t be proud of
I got no remorse, no regrets, never happy endings on this dark sense
And if you wanna get down, I can go down as low as you wanna get
I wouldnt try to push me, it will only leave you with regret
Dont test me!

Ref:
I can rip you off and steal all your cash. Sucker-punch you in the face, stand back and laugh.
Leave you stranded as fast as a heart-attack. All day I think bad thoughts!
I can break your heart at the drop of a hat. Stab you in the back in two minutes flat,
Screw your girl in the back of my Cadillac.
I think bad thoughts!

Take this to the street, finish it, flush it down the toilet like you`re taking a piss.
It should be good to see, for a change just a day how the other half lives
And when I take you out Ill stare you down, make sure you`re getting nervous
You won`t understand, thats how it is as a knight in Satan`s service.

I can rip you off and steal all your cash. Sucker-punch you in the face, stand back and laugh.
Leave you stranded as fast as a heart-attack. All day I think bad thoughts!
I can break your heart at the drop of a hat. Stab you in the back in two minutes flat,
Screw your girl in the back of my Cadillac.
I think bad thoughts!
I think bad thoughts, all day and all night long! I think bad thoughts!
Dont care what you thinks wrong!

If you wanna judge my lifestyle, I`d love see how you live.
 Feel free to cast your stones. Dont cry when you`re down bleeding

In a heartbeat I turn you white as a sheet, begging for mercy on your goddamn knees
It`ll be hard to keep from laughing, watching you cry will make my week
Just test me, please test me! Push a button, pull a leaver, trick or treat!
Im asking: Do you have the stuff to find out if I can fuck you up?

I can rip you off and steal all your cash. Sucker-punch you in the face, stand back and laugh.
Leave you stranded as fast as a heart-attack. 
I think bad thoughts, all day and all night long! I think bad thoughts!
Dont care what you thinks wrong!

I can tell them lies `till you`re left in disgrace, kick you when you`re down and spit in your face
Lead you on `till you`re lost without a trace. 

I think bad thoughts, all day and all night long! I think bad thoughts!
Dont care what you think`s wrong!

I can break your heart at the drop of a hat. Stab you in the back and doing a slap
Screw your girl in the back of my Cadillac.
I think bad thoughts!---Lyrics submitted by thomas wynn.
