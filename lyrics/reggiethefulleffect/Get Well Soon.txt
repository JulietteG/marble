You've got alot to learn before I let you go
Theres things you need to see and things you need to know

They say,
We wont,
Make it.
What do they know?
They say,
We can't,
Do it,
But I've got to know..

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
and is it getting better now?
and is it getting better now?

You've got alot to do before I let you stay
Theres things you need to see and things you need to say

They say,
We wont,
Make it.
What do they know?
They say,
We can't,
Do it,
But I've got to know..

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
and is it getting better now?
and is it getting better now?

You always talk too much, too little, too late, too much, too little, too late for me to figure out
You always talk too much, too little, too late, too much, too little, too late for me to figure out
(and) i still can't figure out..

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
and is it getting better now?
and is it getting better now?---Lyrics submitted by elyse.
