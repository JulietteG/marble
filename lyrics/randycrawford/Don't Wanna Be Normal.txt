See that nine to five
She's alive but she'll never see
She's lost in what she does
Just because of what she has to be
Time just passes by
She don't try
She just carries on
Her dreams are only dreams in the night
Come the light, they're gone

Trapped into spaces where we no longer breathe
Pushed into places that we really don't wanna be

We only got a short time to grab a little glory
I wanna have a good life, not a sad story
To stay within the boundaries, seems so formal  
If that's what life is, I don't wanna be normal

No...

Chances that we take become mistakes that I could rather flee
I don't see how I could live my life any other way
The best and the worst of us often times stumble and fall
We're trapped by the choices that we make
We just can't know it all

We only got a short time to grab a little glory
I wanna have a good life, not a sad story
To stay within the boundaries, seems so formal
If that's what life is, I don't wanna be normal

I don't wanna be...I don't wanna be normal---Lyrics submitted by Lynningness.
