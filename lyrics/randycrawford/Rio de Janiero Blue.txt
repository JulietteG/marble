The clouds come on creepin' and you got me weepin' this moment
I can't believe you're really gonna leave this town
Everyone knows, I can't make a move with you
You're turnin' my whole world, upside down
And I get a feelin' that I've seen the last of you
Rio de Janeior blue

The salty air, your wind blown hair, reflections on a dream
Thoughts of you with who knows who, flowin' through me like a stream
Brazilian serenades, linger on, on
Help me lose my soul, in your song
And I get a feelin', that I've seen the last of you
Rio de Janeiro Blue, Rio de Janeiro blue

Months go by, I wounder why, I'm left here on my own
Could it be my destiny, is to live this life alone
These dark and rainy days have turned me cold
Long and sleepless nights, gettin' on
And I get a feelin' that I've seen the last of you
Rio de Janeiro Blue, Rio de Janeiro blue

Rio, Rio de Janeiro blue
Long and sleepless nights
Rio, Rio---Lyrics submitted by Robert Schuen.
