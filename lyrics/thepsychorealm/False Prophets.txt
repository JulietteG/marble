[B Real]
"I came here to help you
with your spirituality
in the path to find your soul to Me
I wanna set you free from negativity
and all the pain you received"
have faith, believe
in your Maker, your Master, Creator
God's Kingdom is at hand
from sea to the sand
in the desert with spirituality
your origin begins,
follow me to the Heavens
your spirit is capable of much more
than whores and liquor
and drugs to kill you quicker
than your Master (how it was) >intended<

[Big Duke]
() >intended<
loved above all
but my envy of your kind was my downfall
"by those weak in the mind:
destroy one by one, mankind
am I emperor, leader?
livin' in your city like Che
viva!
turn to rich residents,
crooked generals,
politicians, and country presidents
everybody welcome to the presence
end of all innocence"
and everything makes no sense

[Chorus]
"'who are you, a devil or an angel:
just another stranger bringin' danger?'"
temptation is the root of evil
"'what you conceal I reveal to all people:
false prophets will burn to dust
in the fire, bringin' down your whole empire

[B Real]
I gave you My Son in Moses
with the power to part the Red Sea
to flee from Egypt to be free
but many of you have turned your backs
wanna stray
worship idols in your blasphemous ways
you lost faith,
your lack in belief is your grief
caused by the mischievous deceiver the beast
tormenting your mind and soul
it's not too late
before I have to have to turn My back
and close the gates of My Kingdom'"
and all the wicked burn
"'hear the trumpets in Heaven
when My Son will return'"

[Big Duke]
"I took your faith"
Underworld Lord bring death's traits
everyday lies and temptations bring bittersweet taste
"come in to live in my misery space"
lack of morale touched the soul of the whole human race
"memories of evil in the mind don't erase
you can't escape, all your actions are traced
written down like stories attached to your face
accounts of your long and winding road"
listen to the truths of the world and destinies i hold

[Chorus]
"'Who are you, a devil or an angel:
Just another stranger bringin' danger?'"
temptation is the root of evil
"'what you conceal I reveal to all people:
false prophets will burn to dust
in the fire, bringin' down your whole empire'"---Lyrics submitted by Ben Meade.
