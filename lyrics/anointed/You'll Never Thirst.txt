You'll Never Find Her Story In A Fairytale
Cause she wasn't like the other women at the well
Her life was full of pain, hurt, rejection
Her loneliness she didn't wanna show
But Jesus saw the desert in her soul...

Chorus:)
Drink from his water
Drink from his water
and you will never, you will never thirst again
Drink from his water, drink from his water and you will never..
you will never thirst again

We all search for something
To fill us up inside
but its only an allusion
you know a true loves hard to find
but im here to tell you theres one place 
your thirst is quenched forever more
you will never leave empty disappointed
you'll find what you are looking for

Chorus:)
Drink from his water
Drink from his water
and you will never, you will never thirst again
Drink from his water, drink from his water and you will never..
you will never thirst again

Repeat )

I Know Jesus will meet you
at the place of every need 
and only he can make the wounded whole
and make the blind man see!

Chorus:)
Drink from his water
Drink from his water
and you will never, you will never thirst again
Drink from his water, drink from his water and you will never..
you will never thirst again

Repeat 2x's)---
