Uh huh oh yes Honey
Due to the fact that her thighs spread just like
P nah P nah P Nah

Gota walk through that door

High high heels on a hardwood floor
They all coming back for more
Back back for more
Get it right this time

Never gonna stop till the beat is mine
Rupaul
Come round if you so inclined
Ru paul paul paul
Must be jelly cos jam dont shake
Must be jelly cos jam dont shake
Must be jelly cos jam dont shake
Spread that jelly spread it good
Peanut butter here
Kiss my grits
Your Mommas in the kitchen but the ovens on the fritz
Youre Daddys in jail raising hell
And your sister on the corner
Sister on the corner

Working your feet ah
Jumping all around like youre catching a seizure

Must be jelly cos jam dont shake

Youre daddys in jail
