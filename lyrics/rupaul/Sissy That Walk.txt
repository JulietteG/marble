Pick myself up,
Turn the world on its head.
Don't forget what,
Don't forget what my mama said.
People talking,
Since the beginning of time.
Unless they paying your bills, pay them bitches no mind.

And If I fly or if I fall,
At least I can say I gave it all.
And If I fly or if i fall,
I'm on my way; I'm on my way.

Fly, fly, fly, fly. Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh. [x4]
Uh-oh. 
Now sissy that walk.

Better beware
Ain't no T, ain't no shade.
But at the same time,
Bitches better get outta my way.
I'm a fem queen,
Mother of the House of No Shame.
My pussy is on fire, 
Now kiss the flame. 

And If I fly or if I fall,
I can say I gave it all.
And If I fly or if i fall,
I'm on my way; I'm on my way.

Fly, fly, fly, fly. Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh. [x4]
Uh-oh.
Now sissy that walk. 

And If I fly or if I fall,
I can say I gave it all.
And If I fly or if I fall,
I'm on my way; I'm on my way.

Fly, fly, fly, fly. Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh. [x8]
Uh-oh.
Now sissy that walk. ---
