Once upon a time, there was a little black girl
In the brust of project of Detroit,Michigan
At fifteen, she was spotted by an Ebony Fashion Fair Talent Scout
And her modeling career took off, You Better Work

You Better Work,cover girl,work it girl,give us a twirl
Do you thing on the runway
Work, Supermodel, you better work it, girl of the world
Wet your lips and make it love to the camera

Work, turn to the left, now turn to the right
Work, sachey chantey
Work, turn to the left, now turn to the right
Work, sachey chantey

It don---Lyrics submitted by David.
