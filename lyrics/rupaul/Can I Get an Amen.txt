(feat. Martha Wash)

Giving all you could to the relationship
Like a full-time job
Now you find you gotta work it, work it.
Like the best of you has yet to arrive
All the love inside is all the love you've ever needed, needed.

All the dreams you had, all the things you wanted
Don't turn your back it's not too late
You better love yourself before you love somebody, love somebody.

Can I get an amen, can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself how the hell you're gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen, can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself how the hell you're gonna love somebody else?
A-Amen

Say hello-goodbye, maybe another try
After while you find history repeating-peating
Do you realize your love is alive?
All the love inside is all the love you've ever needed, needed.

All the dreams you had, all the things you wanted
Don't turn your back it's not too late
You better love yourself before you love somebody, love somebody

Can I get an amen, can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself how the hell you're gonna, love somebody else?
Can I get an amen, can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself how the hell you're gonna, love somebody else?
A-Amen

There's a fork in the road, which way will you go
You standing still or will you step into the great unknown,
Is yours to decide, this is your life, this is your life!

Can I get an amen, can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself how the hell you're gonna, love somebody else?
Can I get an amen, can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself how the hell you're gonna, love somebody else?
A-Amen---
