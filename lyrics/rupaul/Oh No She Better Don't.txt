Oh no she better don't (8x)

Joyslyn: 
My name is Joslyn and I'm the fox
Heads turn necks break when this bitch walks
Always keep my nose clean
But for me the boys fine
Try me bitch I'm a mother fishin' drag queen

BenDaLaCrem: 
When you pull up to the crib
I'm the fatal fem
But I got the candy cope
So they call me Crem-i-nem
That's straight on for say
When four fly ladies are comin' your way

Trinity: 
Check it
It takes a second to see how this goes
Rhinestones,big hair, gown to the flo'
Tonight I'm making history
So don't even try to come for me
The girls are just a mystery
But I'm your girl TKC

Milk: 
Better than the in-girl since she came out
With the shutters in her utters were the easy way out
If your lookin' for a dude or in the preggers mood
Hookers in the house and them other bitches RUDE

Oh no she better don't (8x)
OH NO PANTY HOES

LaGanjaStranga: 
Records on the track y'all can't handle me
Bustin' through that door and smokin' on that tree
Panty hos and control top D
Givin' you 5D you all livin' for me

Darian: 
Big girl while you all in man-field
Walkin' down the dirty city street
Keep your shoes on honey
Tell em' make that money
Your toenails draggin
And it sure ain't funny

Bianca: 
My name is Bianca
I'm from the deep south
You bitches cant handle my sassy ass mouth
I like to say it fast, I like to say it quick
I'm gon' call yo ass shimy cause you look like a brick

Adore: 
My name says it all ain't no need to try to force it
Look at my body in this brand new corset
Men turn around pants comin' down
Go home hoes where my drag race crown

Courtny: 
Walk like Glyendal and
Talk like Nyomie
Dressing up as me and you don't even know me
Looking like this ain't no got damn stunt
All you other bitches better lick my FOOT!

Oh no she better don't (8x)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
