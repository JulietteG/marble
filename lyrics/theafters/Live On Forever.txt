Dark days are gonna go away
They won't have final say
These mourns are always gonna say
'Cuz we were made for an another place
Moment we have our final breathe
When all the fear are put to rest
Every tear will disappear
Heaven is real
We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever
We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever... ever, ever...

we are now believer in Lord
we have hope
We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever... ever, ever...

Breathing air ...
... never seen
Every sound like symphony
Rising up is an angel sing
Arms of grace are open wide
They say some love before our eyes
Every tear will disappear
Heaven is real ...
We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever
We gonna live on Forever... Forever... live forever... ever,ever...

we are now believer in Lord
we have hope
We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever... ever, ever...

My heart is been set in motion
For something more for something more
Then we could ever imagine
There is so much more there is so much more
My heart is been set in motion
For something more for something more
Then we could ever imagine
There is so much more there is so much more
Whoo whooo... whoooo...
Forever... ever,ever...

We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever
We gonna live on Forever... Forever... live forever... ever,ever...

we are now believer in Lord
we have hope
We gonna live on forever... forever... live forever... ever, ever...

Whoo whooo... whoooo...
Forever... ever, ever...---
