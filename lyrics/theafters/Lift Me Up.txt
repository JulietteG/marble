You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up

Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the day
Waiting for a sign I'm where you want me to be
You know my heart is heavy 
And the hurt is deep
But when I feel like giving up
You're reminding me
That we all fall down sometimes
When I hit the ground

You lift me up when I am weak,
Your arms wrap around me,
Your love catches me so I'm letting go
You lift me up, When I can't see
Your heart is all that I need
Your love carries me so I'm letting go

You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up

I know I'm not perfect
I know I make mistakes
I know that I have let you down
But you love me the same
And when I'm surrounded
When I lose my way
When Im crying out and falling down 
You are here to 

Lift me up when I am weak
Your arms wrap around me
Your love catches me so I'm letting go
You lift me up when I can't see
Your heart is all that I need
Your love carries me so Im letting go

I can see the dawn is breaking
I am feeling overtaken with your love
With your love
I don't know what I can offer
In this moment I surrender to your love
To your love

You lift me up when I am weak
Your arms wrap around me
Your love catches me so I'm letting go

You lift me up when I am weak
Your arms wrap around me
Your love catches me so I'm letting go
You lift me up when I can't see
Your heart is all that I need
Your love carries me so I'm letting go

I can see the dawn is breaking 
I am feeling overtaken with your love
With your love

You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up (with your love)
You lift me up---Lyrics submitted by Krystina.
