Hey there dream girl, 
why did I fall 
You dont even see me at all
I'm all alone cause it seems
You're only mine in my dreams
Hey there dream girl
you sure are fine
You're so good looking 
I wish you were mine
but if i never win your love
you'll always be my dream girl
In the crowds
you sure stand out
and you said every {heart on world}-indistinguishable
If im lucky maybe some day
youll  be my dream girl
Hey there dream girl 
what did you say
just for a moment
you looked my way
Could it be that you've been 
dreamin' too
Oh you'll always be my dream girl
Dream girl    (dream girl)---Lyrics submitted by mike.
