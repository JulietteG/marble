One day, I Will Return 
to my home, to my mother's arms
One day, I'll board a plane 
And fly away from the I made.

One day, I will turn
from the life of sin, that I have learned
one day, I will understand
how to love with broken hands

One day, I will see a Lord
and my chains will fall, with just one word
And that one word, is the sweetest sound
Saving grace falling down

One day, I will be free
from this heart, lie against the sea (????)

One day, I will understand
how to love, with broken hands---Lyrics submitted by David Tucker.
