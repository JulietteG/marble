Don`t sigh a sigh for me 
Don`t ever cry for me 
This is goodbye for me 
I know were through,Im losing you 
Love sang its song for me 
Then things went wrong for me 
Nights are too long for me 
because I`m losing you 

Our love and our devotion 
was deep as any ocean 
Then one day like the tide 
you began to change 
and you became the perfect stranger 

Someone is holding you 
sharing the lips I knew 
I can`t believe it`s true 
that Im losing you 

Our love and... 

Someone is holding you... 

That I am losing you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
