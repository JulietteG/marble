Everythin is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day she sends
Everything is free

I use to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make mistakes
When I was Mary's Prayer

Suddenly the heavens roared
And suddenly the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew

So when you find somebody you'll keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's Prayer

And if I say, "Save me..save me"
Be the light in my eye
And if I say, "Ten hail Mary's"
Leave a light on in heaven for me

Blessed is the one who shares
Your power and your beauty, Mary
Blessed is the millionaire
Who shares your wedding day

So when you find somebody you'll keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake 
When I was Mary's Prayer

And if I say, "Save me..save me"
Be the light in my eye
And if I say, "Take Hail Mary's"
Leave a light on in heaven for me

If you want the fruit to fall
You'll have the give the tree a shake
And if you shake the tree too hard
The bough is gonna break

And if I can't reach the top of the tree
Mary you can hold me up there

What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's Prayer

So if I say, "Save me..save me" 
Be the light in my eye
And if I say, "Take hell Mary's" 
Leave a light on in heaven

Save me..save me 
Be the light in my eye
And if I say, Ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in heaven

Save me..same me
Be the light in my eye

What I would give to be
When I was Mary's Prayer
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's Prayer

Save me...when I was Mary's Prayer---Lyrics submitted by jose.
