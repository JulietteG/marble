You Stole My Heart Away
You Stole My Heart Away

Oo Baby, Let Me Show Ya...

Let Me Tell You Now
All That's On My Mind
For A Love Like Yours
Is Oh, So Very Hard To Find

Look Inside Myself
Now I'm Very Sure
There Can Only Be, You For Me
I Need You More And More

Chorus:
You, Turned Me Inside Out
And Showed Me What Life Was About
Only You
The Only One That Stole My Heart Away
I Want To Do All I Can Just To Show You
Make You Understand
Only You
The Only One That Stole My Heart Away

When You're In My Dreams
When I'm Close To You
There's A Magic In Your Touch That Just Comes Shining Through
Want You Every Day, Want You Every Night
There Can Only Be, You For Me
You Make It Seem So Right
Oh Girl 'cause...

Chorus

Baby..
You Stole My Heart Away

In My Mind There's No Other Love
You're The Only Girl My Heart And Soul Is Thinking Of
Only You
Only Me
There Can Never Ever Be A Love That Understands The Way That I Feel Inside

Girl You, Turn Me Inside Out
And You Showed Me What Life Was About
Only You
The Only One That Stole My Heart Away

Girl You Turn Me Inside Out
And You Showed Me What Life Was About
Only You
The Only One That Stole My Heart Away

You Stole My Heart Away
You Stole My Heart Away
You, The Only One That Stole My Heart Away---Lyrics submitted by rendellou.
