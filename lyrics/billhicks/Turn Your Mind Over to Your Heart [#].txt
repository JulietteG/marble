Climbed out of the ocean
 Learned to walk upright
 Now not one of us who can take flight
 Gonna live on the moon someday
 Hope its not because we blew the earth away 
Turn your mind over to your heart
Turn your mind over to your heart
Always known it
 Its just a matter of remembering
 Weve known it from the start
 Now its just so simple
Turn your mind over to your heart
Turn your mind over to your heart
 No more lonely people
 No more dying in the streets
 No more tragic lovers
 Unable to meet
 Nothing can stop us now
 Nothing can keep us apart 
Turn your mind over to your heart
Turn your mind over to your heart
Turn your mind over to your heart
Turn your mind over to your heart---Lyrics submitted by Rahul Chomal.
