True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who was your friend
Don't be sad I know you will
But don't give up until 
True love will find you in the end

This is a promise with a catch
Only if you're looking can it find you
Cuz true love is searching too
But how can it recognize you
Unless you step out into the light, the light

Dont' be sad I know you will
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end---Lyrics submitted by Mark Johnson.
