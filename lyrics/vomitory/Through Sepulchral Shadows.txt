The sombre massive clouds heals the scars burnt of the sun
Where a last forsaken light slowly withers through
An eclipsed night has emerged when all that haunts shall be revealed
Thoughts now reaches through to barriers towards where
spirits rest

The session brings forth forgotten epochs through the dark
Silence slowly ceases and changes into monotone words
Silhouettes seems to fall filtered out of thin air
A passage has reopened towards eyes who seek the never seen

Now thoughts befog the moon to link into the ceased
To vanish into levitation through sepulchral shadows

Coldsweat, a sudden freezing wind
A sinister feeling comes breathing down my neck
Vibration, a stench fills the air
The sHadows seems to grip me as they upon my skin

Convulsions, time is turning backwards
I feel the light being removed from my eyes
Levitation, the utter step of death
Only flesh is left to bury when I have stalked into the past

The session brings forth forgotten epochs through the dark
Silence slowly ceases and changes into monotone words
Silhouettes seems to fall filtered out of thin air
A passage has reopened towards eyes who seek the never seen

Now thoughts befog the moon to link into the ceased
To vanish into levitation through sepulchral shadows

Through sepulchral shadows---
