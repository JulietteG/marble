A deathlike horizon frozen in black
Shall rise in the clouds from the burnt out atmosphere
The sun shall vanish in a layer of dust
Enshrouding the earth an everlasting solitude

The holocaust bean at night, bombers filled the skies
Storming flames came through the dark, burned mile after mile
Those who feld in panic died blasted to the ground
Now the dead and wounded all lies scattered across the land

Into winter when the skies are filled with dust
No sun forevermore
Through sorrow the spared ones mourn the weak
Who lies buried in the frost

A few ones strong enough to live shall slowly bleed to death
Amogn their true beloved ones all dead and torn apart
Pain now keeps their thoughts awake enough to feel the loss
Dead and wounded side by side covered in blood and frost

Into winter when the skies are filled with dust
No sun forevermore
Through sorrow the spared ones mourn the weak
Who lies buried in the frost

A vast lifeless nowhere, all burnt out and dead
Where blood lies in pure frost, frozen in the nuclear winter
The bodytemperature slowly drops, breath and puls grows weak
The cold air shall coagulate the bloodstreams from their wounds
Limb by limb all senses die, desperate eyes shall close
Forever shall the stained sky dim towards winter through sorrow---
