Perdition, collapsing in the flames, a chaos of deafening screams
When the spared ones rose the weak was buried helpless in the dust

Increasing warmth, desperate screams, the wounded die as flies
Intensive heat grips their skin and mummifies them all alive

Perdition

Buried, crushed in the dust, too painful to even breathe
Open wounds in the weak flesh dries up under the burning sun

Crawling naked on barescraped knees, staring blind in desperation
As the burnt out human strenght leaves forevermore
Defeated by the heat
Withering throat, bleeding breath

Dried up skins breaks apart
The wounds spreads with each breath
No hope for time to heal
Intense pain towards death

Increasing warmth, feverous thoughts, pure hyperventilation
Intensive heat brands the skin as the last breath is burnt out.---
