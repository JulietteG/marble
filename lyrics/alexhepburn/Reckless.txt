I am different
Driving on the right side
Stopping at the stop sign 
And that's you beside me baby
Whispering those words 
The ones I don't deserve

It's not easy, for me nooo
To belong here.

Wanna be reckless, 
Wanna destroy this, 
Don't wanna regret this, 
Like I've done before, 

Wanna be out there
In the middle of nowhere, 
Lost forever, 
Like I was before
Like I was before you came.

I am learning yeah
To go against my nature
It feel like I'm a stranger to myself
And it's frightening baby
Don't know where i'm heading
But wake me when i've get there

It's not easy for me noooo
To belong here 
To belong here 

Wanna be reckless (Reckless), 
Wanna destroy this (Destroy this), 
Won't wanna regret this (Regret this), 
Like i've done before, 

Wanna be out there (Out there),
In the middle of nowhere (nowhere), 
Lost forever (forever), 
Like I was before
Like I was before you came.

Don't feel like her,
Is she is myself
I've done my time 
I made a promise to myself
So my mind is there.

Be reckless
Oh yeah I promise
You won't regret this
Like it' done before

Wanna be reckless, 
Wanna destroy this, 
Don't wanna regret this, 
Like I've done before, 

Wanna be out there
In the middle of nowhere, 
Lost forever, 
Like I was before
Like I was before you came.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
