Dont bury me
Dont let me down
Dont say its over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Dont say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder 
Only you can send me under, under, under

I die everytime you walk away 
Dont leave me alone with me
See, Im afraid 
Of the darkness and my demons 
And the voices, say nothings gonna be okay, Heeyyy
I feel it in my heart, soul, mind that Im losing
You, me, youre abusing
Every reason that Ive left to live.

Dont bury me
Dont let me down
Dont say its over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Dont say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder 
Only you can send me under, under, under

Lost trust, 21 grams of soul
All the sanity Ive ever owned gone
But Im still breathing
Through the thunder, and the fire, and the madness
Just to let you shoot me down again
But Im still breathing!
I feel it in my veins, skin, bones that Im losing
You, me, youre confusing every reason that Ive left to live

Dont bury me
Dont let me down
Dont say its over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Dont say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder 
Only you can send me under, under, under.
Chasing you but you dont look back
Words are through and I cant take back
Reaching out but I cant hold on to you, no
Chasing you but you dont look back
Words are through and I cant take back
Reaching out but I cant hold on to you

Dont bury me
Dont let me down
Dont say its over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Dont say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder 
Only you can send me under, under, under.

Ooooh only you can send me under, yeaaaah.
Under.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
