Here For You Now

Fall down
Yeah, you're falling on your knees
And you're begging me please to help you
The sound of your screaming on the ground
'Cause the demons on your head have found you

I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna fix you
I know I can make it right again
I want you to see me
I need you to feel me
That's all that I wanted in the end

Hey you, take a look around
I'm beside you
I'm right here for you now
Hey you, it's hard enough to be what you want to
I'm right here for you now
Right here for you now

Stand back getting closer to the edge
Just turn around and walk away now
Come back stop putting on the act
Can't I have ya just the way that I found ya?

You don't wanna hurt me
You gotta believe me
I know I can make it right again
I'll always look after
Don't care that I have to
That's all that I wanted in the end

Hey you, take a look around
I'm beside you
I'm right here for you now
Hey you, it's hard enough to be what you want to
I'm right here for you now
Right here for you now

(ah ah)
'Cause I remember you
(ah ah)
And how you used to be
(ah ah)
Do you want to waste it all for them?

Hey, hey you, hey you
Take a look around
I'm beside you
I'm right here for you now
Hey you
It's hard enough to be what you want to
I'm right here for you now
Hey you
Take a look around
I'm beside you
I'm right here for you now
Hey you
It's hard enough to be what you want to
I'm right here for you now
Right here for you now---Lyrics submitted by jasmine.
