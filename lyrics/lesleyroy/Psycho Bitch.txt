is it fair to say you played me for a fool
is it fair to say you said you used me that's the truth
you've been lyin all the time and now im mad
you drove me to the vodka shots and knock them back
yeah

CHORUS
i bet you never thought that i would be a basket case im going crazy cause your hooked on someone and that someone isn't me
bet you never thought that i would be a psycho bitch like the kind of girl thats gonna smash your headlights no that someone isn't me

is it fair to say you went and hit the lock
do you think that i should say it to the cops
when they ask me where i was the seventeenth
should i be like you and say it wasnt me
yeah

CHORUS
i bet you never thought i would be a basket case im going crazy cause your hooked on someone and that someone isn't me
i bet you never thought that i would be a psycho bitch like the kinda girl that's gonna to smash your headlights no that someone isn't me
does she do what i dont is she beautiful or will she go where i wont go
na na na (54x's)
i bet you never thought i would be a basket case im going crazy cause your hooked on someone and that someone isn't me
i bet you never thought that i would be a physcho bitch like the kinda girl thats gonna smashe your head lights no that someone isn't me (4 x's)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
