Oh no, it's bad
Got me feeling so weak
When you're holding my hand
You smile, I die
Cause I don't wanna feel
What I'm feeling inside
It's too much, it's too late
I'm so into you

I'd be crushed
If you walked away
I'd be lost
I'd be drowning in grey
I'd be rooted beyond repair
If you weren't there

I'd be crushed

I swore I'd be in control of myself
What have you done to me?
Your lips, my skin
I don't know where you end and where I begin
I hate you but I love you
So don't ever leave

I'd be crushed
If you walked away
I'd be lost
I'd be drowning in grey
I'd be rooted beyond repair
If you weren't there

You got me falling
And I never wanted to feel like I do
I'm so into you

Oh no, it's bad

Crushed
If you walked away
I'd be lost
I'd be drowning in gray
I'd be rooted beyond repair
If you weren't there

Crushed
I'd be lost
I'd be drowning in grey
I'd be rooted beyond repair
If you weren't there

I'd be crushed
Oh no, oh no---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
