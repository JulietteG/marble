Come To Your Senses

So this is how it is 
This is how it goes, I know 
That there's not a single word I can say 
You'll go your own way 

It's you and you alone 
I need to feel you close 
To me 
I long to hold your face in my hands 
The heart is hard to understand 

Love is a mystery 
The truth of it hard to see 
O yeah 
I'm counting on destiny 
To bring you to your senses 
I'm counting on destiny 

Come to your senses 

Words cannot explain 
What it's like without 
You here 
And the never-ending rain, how it falls 
Drowning me, drowning me 

Love is a mystery 
The truth of it hard to see 
O yeah 
I'm counting on destiny 
To bring you to your senses 
I'm counting on destiny 

Come to your senses 
Come to your senses 

'Cause theres nothing I can do 
Nothing I can say 
To break your defences 
Come to your senses 

Love is a mystery 
The truth of it hard to see 
O yeah 
I'm counting on destiny 
To bring you to your senses 

Love is a mystery 
The truth of it hard to see 
O yeah 
I'm counting on destiny 
To bring you to your senses 

I'm counting on destiny 

If this is how it ends, if this is how it goes 
I know---Lyrics submitted by jasmine.
