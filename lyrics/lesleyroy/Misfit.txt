You never close your eyes
You never sleep at night
You are an emotional nightmare
You are a misfit
You like to hurt yourself
And you don't know why
You're trapped inside your own hell
No one else knows your pain

See the misfit in the mirror
See the freak that lives inside
See the misfit in the mirror cry
See the one nobody wanted,
Shattered by a world of lies
See the misfit in the mirror die

You always crash your car,
You're like a permanent scar,
You're just a walking disaster
You are the opposite of moving faster
When you've pushed around,
When all your walls fall down
And when they call you misfit it's so hard to stop the rage

See the misfit in the mirror
See the freak that lives inside
See the misfit in the mirror cry
See the one nobody wanted,
Shattered by a world of lies
See the misfit in the mirror die

I see you and I see everything that I hate
Darkness all around me, makes me suffocate

See the misfit in the mirror
See the freak that lives inside
See the misfit in the mirror cry
See the one nobody wanted,
Shattered by a world of lies
See the misfit in the mirror die---Lyrics submitted by NiKi.
