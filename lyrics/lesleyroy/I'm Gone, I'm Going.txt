So sick of hearing your words
All I can hear you say
Is how you want me to live
My life a different way
I'm gonna pack up my things
I'm gonna do it just
Watch me, watch me

I'm like a rat in a cage
About to lose it all
And I ain't gonna give up until I'm standing tall
I'm gonna throw it all in
Just get it over with
Watch me, watch me

Cuz life is way too short
And I can't wait no more

Here I go
I'm gone, I'm going
I'm so over you, and I dont care
And I won't go back
Cuz I know if I do, I won't make it
Forgive me, I can't take it anymore

So sick of falling apart and crawling back again
So sick of playing the games that I can never win
I really had it, just so so sick of it
Watch me, just watch me

Cuz life is just way too short
And I can't wait anymore

Here I go
I'm gone, I'm going
I'm so over you, and I dont care
And I won't go back
Cuz I know if I do, I won't make it
Forgive me, I can't take it anymore

I won't look back
I won't look back no more
Hey (x2)

So here I go
I'm gone, I'm going
I'm so over you, and I dont care
And I won't go back
Cuz I know if I do, I won't make it
Forgive me, I can't take it anymore---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
