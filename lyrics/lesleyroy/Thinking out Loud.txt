I've been losing my mind 
I've been living a lie,i've been running away for so long,
I try to put on a face and cover my heart 
But im needing it now, so bad 

I don't know how I feel
Maybe i'm mad or maybe im proud
Can't find the truth, can't speak my mind
Don't know what i'll say i'm just thinking out loud (thinking out loud)

No, no i can't explain what's happend to me
i feel like i'm right and wrong.
Inside everything's upside down
Everything spinning around and it's freaking me out

i don't know how I feel
Maybe i'm mad or maybe i'm proud
Can't find the truth,can't speak my mind
I don't know what i'll say i'm just thinking out loud 

If only for a day i could be free
I bet you feel the same, if you were me
I'm gonna spit it out 
JUST LET GO!

I've been losing my mind, 
I've been living a lie, I've been running away for so long

I don't know how i feel
Maybe i'm mad or maybe i'm proud 
Can't find the truth, can't speak my mind
I don't know what I'll say I'm just thinking out loud 

Yeah I'm thinking out loud, thinking out loud 
Can't find the truth, can't speak my mind, 
I don't know what I'll say, I'm just thinking out loud---
