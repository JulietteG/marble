Well it finally had to end this bitter way
We had no more left to give
No matter what we said
'Cause I worried every night and slept all day
I was lying to myself
Pretending to be someone else

You left me so
But it's over
Just let me go
We're going nowhere
I feel like I'm dead, but breathing
I know because my heart was beating
Just let me go
'Cause it's over

So you try to work it out and get some help
You'd been fooling everyone
But I know what's going on
I can't hold your hand through this again
We keep lying to ourselves
Pretending to be something else

You left me so
But it's over
Just let me go
We're going nowhere
I feel like I'm dead, but breathing
I know because my heart is beating
Just let me go

I'm sorry that I couldn't stay
To fill your empty space
It's alright
You'll be fine
I know that you'll be better off
In a different place
It's alright
You'll be fine

You left me so
But it's over
Just let me go

I feel like I'm dead, but breathing
I know because my heart is beating

You left me so
But it's over
Just let me go
We're going under
I feel like I'm dead, but breathing
I know because my heart is beating
Just let me go
'Cause it's over---Lyrics submitted by jasmine.
