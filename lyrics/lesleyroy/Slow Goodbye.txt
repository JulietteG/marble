I can read the lines on your face
And they're telling me everything I already know, yeah
I hold you in my arms but you're light years away from me
Slowly sinking under alone, yeah

So I act cool on the outside
But it's eating me alive

Cause when it comes to you there's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in you're eyes, all the compromise
I can't take another slow goodbye

Sitting in the park after dark, smoking cigarets 
Bitting on the black of my nails
Cause all I ever wanted was what you took away from me
Try to make it right but it's too late

I'm a hopeless case, on the inside
And it's eating me alive

Cause when it comes to you there's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in you're eyes, all the compromise
I can't take another slow goodbye

No, I die a million times every time you look me in the eyes
I, cause I heard it all before
The same game, going round and around 
But I still with nothing but hurting

Cause when it comes to you there's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in you're eyes, all the compromise
I can't take another slow goodbye

No, there's nothing I can do (nothing I can do)
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in your eyes, all the compromise 
I can't take another slow goodbye---
