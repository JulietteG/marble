Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can have anything I got
All of me right on the spot
Na, na, na
You can have anything I own
Work my fingers all the way to the bone

Now baby I don't wanna be fictitious
Saying that I can get you anything is ridiculous
But anything you ask if its anywhere near
My grasp it's yours, oh yeah

Now I don't got fancy cars or diamond rings
Lord knows I will if I make it with this singing thing
Hold on, have faith in me
'Cause anything I have is yours, baby

You can have anything I got
All of me right on the spot
Na, na, na
You can have anything I own
Work my fingers all the way to the bone
Na, na, na

Girl I know you wanna roll a Lexus
A Lexus with a mansion down in Texas
It's more like apartment 8, cellular is prepaid
But baby it's all okay

I can't do all the things I wanna do
But I can love you and I can stay true
I'll give you my last dime, spend all my time
It's yours whatever is mine, anything you want

You can have anything I got
All of me right on the spot
Na, na, na
You can have anything I own
Work my fingers all the way to the bone
Na, na, na

Now I don't have no LS to drive
But I'm a man with a whole lot of plans
And a lot of love inside
Just believe and pray, hold on to me and say stay
I can't handle you leaving me

Just dream, dream with Jaheim
I'll work overtime anytime just to give you peace of mind
Please just believe, everything and anything
All of me baby, baby, baby, baby

You can have anything I got
All of me right on the spot
Na, na, na
You can have anything I own
Work my fingers all the way to the bone
Na, na, na

You can have anything you want
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything I have baby girl just ask
Anything you want, anything you need---
