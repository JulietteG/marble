Today is your day
I surely hope you're ready
Baby baby baby baby

You didn't have to give it to me baby but you did so
Let me show you my appreciation
Today's a celebration
Something like a holiday
So here's the black card keys to the cars, splurge
Go on and scoop your girls and run up in the mall
Ball, max it out, meet me later, let me smash it out

For the thrill of it, the scent of it, the taste
I lit a candle on top of a cake, oh

Today is a special day baby
And you're the guest of honor
I get you whatever you want.

[Chorus:]
So warm it, so soft, it's so tight, it's the greatest
So I laid in it, played in it,
Stayed there 'til daybreak
And then I tasted it, amazing like crispy cream glazed it
So baby you can have it your way
It's pussy appreciation day.

I didn't have to lick it baby how was I to know that
I'd end up acting like a kitty cat over your milk
I'm fiending for that, baby bring it back,
'Cause most don't appreciate what you've been blessed with
Thy probly ain't had enough of it, that ricky lake,
Have a shopping spree, Baby you know me
For the feel of it, the scent of it, the taste
I lit a candle on top of the cake.

Today is a special day baby
And you're the guest of honor
I get you whatever you want.

[Chorus:]
So warm it, so soft, it's so tight, it's the greatest
So I laid in it, played in it,
Stayed there 'til daybreak
And then I tasted it, amazing like crispy cream glazed it
So baby you can have it your way
It's pussy appreciation day

Let me trick off on you, treat you girl
Cause I just wanna tell you things
For the love you give to me, so up under the tree
You'll see the keys
It ain't your birthday neither, Valentines, Mother's Day or Easter
Today's a holiday, to show you I appreciate ya

[Chorus:]
So warm it, so soft, it's so tight, it's the greatest
So I laid in it, played in it,
Stayed there 'til daybreak
And then I tasted it, amazing like crispy cream glazed it
So baby you can have it your way
It's pussy appreciation day.

I wanna thank you baby, for what, for what you've given me
So tonight I'm cherishing this love
Dedicate the stars above
There's nothing left to say but I'm so grateful, so thankful
To you

[Chorus:]
So warm it, so soft, it's so tight, it's the greatest
So I laid in it, played in it,
Stayed there 'til daybreak
And then I tasted it, amazing like crispy cream glazed it... ---Lyrics submitted by Delores Ellis.
