Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Think of how we made love almost anywhere
Haven't I taken you almost everywhere?
Think of all the things that, huh, that we shared
Then imagine me not there

Giving you more carrots than a rabbit, got you living lavish
Anything I've got, you can have it, baby I'll do magic
I'll do all I can, to keep you satisfied
So just in case I don't make it home tonight, baby

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Haven't I made you feel so special?
As your man I've held your hand, never letting go
Let you hold the keys to the Lex, huh to drive
Gave you all you need and more as long as I'm alive

Even from the heavens up above, I'll shine out our love
Too much is never enough, ooh,. you're all I want
Even when I'm gone, your love will carry on
It's just that strong, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Baby, you know I love you
More than anything in this whole world
You're my anything, my everything, my wife, my queen
So if something happens to me, there's something you need to know

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case---
