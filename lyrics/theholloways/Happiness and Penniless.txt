Well he's watching all the wealthy folk on his way to work
Saturday's so far away theres so much shit to shirk
He's gotta keep his chin up, he's gotta keep his nerve
But just wants to skin up
And sit down
And flaming well sod those who he serves

Cus what's the use of money of you got no time to use it?
He don't want to sell his life to you
You know he'd rather have his time than a Bob or two

But you can't find the money for the rent
or repay the loans you lent
You better turn to god cus you're up shit creek
And you're sailing into hell
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo men

Now he's unemployed he lives on milk and bread
His graduate account is so far in the red
He listened to his heart when he should have used his head
He suffers for his art
He's so Skint
His tenancy is hanging by a thread

Now he's got the time
He hasn't got the money
To do this things' that people do
But still he'd rather have his time than a bob or two

But you can't find the money for the rent
or repay the loans you lent
You better turn to god cus you're up shit creek
And you're sailing into hell
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo men

All of his money is gone
(All of his money has gone)
What did he spend it all on
(What did he spend it all on)
He's never had so much fun
(He's never had so much fun)
All of his money is gone
(...has gone)

Oh no
Now our last penny has been spent
Still our life is heaven sent
As i got my friends to help me through this time
I'll repay you in the end, don't you worry
I promise you i'll pay you back this time

Find the money for the rent
or repay the loans you lent
You better turn to god cus you're up shit creek
And you're sailing into hell
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo men

Find the money for the rent, Find the money for the rent
(All of his money is gone)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
