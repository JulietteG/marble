How can I tell you how you caught me off guard with your heart, 
I need a little time to believe in love.
Some of these thoughts dont add up to rational black and white, 
Wishing right now to erase them and start again.
See, I need you, I need us, and to believe in love, I need truth, and not just the hard answer, I need to and I need to tell you the things Im afraid to.
So dont leave me far in the distance, measuring time isnt right, the cause and effect of what you did when you walked in my life.
Only spells danger to be vulnerable, and I wonder if your wounds will heal mine, 
But just in case I may need a little time.
I need you, I need us, and to believe in love, I need truth, and not just, the hard answer, and I need to, I need to tell you the things Im afraid to.
Oh..well Tell me that youll stay; tell me you wont walk away, even if I take awhile. 
Also tell me that youll be there, tell me that you need me
Even if this is hard to do...
Coz I I need you, I need us and to believe in love, I need truth, not just a hard answer,
I need to, I need to tell you things Im afraid to, because falling again isnt easy and baby this may take a little time.---Lyrics submitted by aNU.
