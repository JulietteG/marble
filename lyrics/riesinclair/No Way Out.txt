You turn the room a shade heaven
And learn my name
The world asleep
While stone and sand keep shifting
Were the heart made of brass?
O I a bird inside a cage?
Waiting, unfolded, hue and clay
Giving into your refrain and melody
The very thought unbinding me

No one ever will love me better than
Your everlasting love
I found only one way in and no way out

Will time illuminate the stains
And stop the pain
The night you held me under a spell
You know I cannot hide
Youre the very thing unwinding me

No one ever will love me better than
Your everlasting love
I found only one way in and no way out

Tear my soul like paper
Carefully breaking off
A bitter tonic of lies
You cut me deeper inside
Only to sew me back up

You turn the room a shade heaven
You know my name

No one ever will love me better than
Your everlasting love
I found only one way in and no way out ---Lyrics submitted by aNU.
