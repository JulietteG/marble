Meet me in the blue bed, I'll be drying out your flaws
And clawing out to cause my knees to tremble
Meet me in the back shed, I'll be hanging up the knives
Humming melodies that rhyme, building castles out of shovels
Hang my head about as if we never had the time
To draw it on the walls, what's all the trouble?
Push my mind around as if it's warming up your hand
As if it's softer than the land, all silked and supple

Don't be afraid if it's a little bit close
I built a kingdom of your throats, I'm seeing double
Don't be afraid if there's no wind in my hair
There's a stillness left in there, I'm seeing double

I'm seeing double, I, oh
I'm seeing double, double
Ah-ah, uh-oh
I'm seeing double, double

Dry it out for days and then I'll beckon every ray
I'll hover like a frame or push the crowd out
Meet me in the back shed, throw the wind and he'll not pass
Hold up what's cast to listen close to how my knees pray

I'll pry the door from its bolts
I've hiding out for days and nothing's growing
There's a breath left in there, all I would say
Wait for the start, take it away, I'm seeing double

I built a kingdom of your throats (don't be afraid)
But it's a little bit close (if it's a little bit close)
There is a stillness in our woes (don't be afraid)
If it's a little bit cold (if it's a little bit cold)---
