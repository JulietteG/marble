She lost her voice down by the river
Screamin' for courage, take oceans and her
She read your mind and called it her terror
Misplacin' her sleep to keep the world nearer

Don't forget the way she pushed the water inside
Waded through the spirits like a flood on the floor
Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget
Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget

I'll miss keepin' you
I hope you're sleepin' too

I hope you're
I hope you're

She took your face and called it a choir
Knitted lace out of lashes, battered with ashes
She held her hands and told you to wonder
How you'd fit in the land if the waves held you under

I'll take you out and up in light
I'll bury you good and straight and right
I'll take you out and up in light
I'll bury you good and straight and right
I'll take you out and up in light
I'll bury you good and straight and right
If you ask an answer
Don't forget, forget, don't forget

Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget
Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget ---
