I came down over the sleeping mountains 
where our white tones into weeping shelter
Tear our skin up from the bottom
Leaves our ankles bear
Don't just wander back and forth and leave it 
Build it into pinnacles and shrines of some
Ghastly predicament in mind 
You'll find 
Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs
We'll be all coiled up near the bottom
With my chest unburied
Obedear the sky is low 
Gather up it's harm in lies with grateful lies 
Obedear the sky is low
Gather up it's harm in lies with grateful lies 
Obedear the sky is low, watch 
Fluids seem and rid their rudders so they'll 
grace it with their wind arrows 
'Tis in the feathers that, that
They branch below, low

Oh my dreams,
Come back to me, back to me
Back to...
All my wrinkles,
Build on me, build on me
Build on...

Obedear, the sky is low
Gather up its harm and gods
With grateful arms
Obedear, the sky is low
Gather up its harm and gods
With grateful arms---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin Johnson.
