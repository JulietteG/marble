Begin again 
Begin again 
Begin again 

I've been watching your kindness keep 
A lonely company 
Look at the fire and think of me 
I've been watching you creep 
Around my wandering feet 
Trying for years to flee 

I need not one thing more 
O wrap the ground around 
Your gentle winding mind 
O guard the pounding sound 
Breathe in your fiery air 
O wrap the ground around 
Give back an hungrier stare 
O guard the pounding sound 

You be the moon I'll be the earth 
And when we burst 
Star over o darling 
Begin again 
Begin again 
Begin again

My moon o my moon 
Not even into 
Another eternity 
Will you stop your lovely orbiting 
I had held it a world away 
Until my body 'gan to say---
