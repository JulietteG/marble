I was on your porch, 
The smoke sank it into my skin,
so I came inside to be with you.
We talked all night, 
about everything you could imagine.
Cause come the mornin' I'll be gone, 
and as our eyes start to close, I turn to you and I let you know,
That I love you.

Well, my dad was sick
My mom she cared for him, he loving nursed him back to life.
And me I ran, I couldn't even look at him, 
For fear I'd have to say goodbye.
And as I leave, he grabs me by the shoulder and tells me,
What's left to lose? You've done enough,
And if you fail well then you fail but not to us.
Cause these last three years, I know they've been hard,
But now it's time to get out of the desert, and into the sun.
Even if it's alone.

Now here I sit, in a hotel off of Sunset,
My thought's bounce off of Sam's guitar.
And thats the way it's been, ever scince we were kids,
but now.
Now we've got somthing to prove,
And I, I can see there eyes,
But tell me somthing, can they see mine?
What's left to lose? I've done enough,
And if I fail well then I fail but I gave it a shot.
And these last three years, I know they've been hard,
But now it's time to get out of the desert, and into the sun.
Even if it's alone.
(Even if it's alone.)
Even if it's alone.

I was on your porch last night, 
The smoke it sank into my skin.---Lyrics submitted by Brandy Davis.
