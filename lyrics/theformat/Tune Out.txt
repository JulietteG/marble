It's your bed
Please choose a side
I'll take the one closest to the door
and you start to speak
the words you try to justify do far more wrong than anything you do
so grab the coat, the keys
the tension speaks  
and we're singing it
I'll tap the break and you crack the window
the smell of smoke is making my lungs explode
the 51 is backed up and too slow
let's tune out by turning on the radio 
And this town
is dead
we've been caught in these sheets way too long
let's just see who's up on the screen
no one I know is more depressing than me
or should I say the two of us
'cause after all we're all we've and
tension speaks 
but we're singing it
I'll tap the break while you crack the window
the smell of smoke is making my lungs explode
the 51 is backed up and too slow
let's tune out by turning on the radio 
and oh my love, you're all I need
backed behind the frequency 
they played this song an hour ago
but let's tune out by turning on the radio
haven't we heard this song
about a thousand times before
oh well
after awhile it all sounds the same
I guess it's better than silence 
and better than shame
I'll tap the brake while you crack the window
the smell of smoke is making my lungs explode
the 51 is backed up and too slow
let's tune out by turning on the radio 
I'll tap the brake while you crack the window
the smell of smoke is making my lungs explode
the 51 is backed up and too slow
let's tune out by turning on the radio  
and oh my love, you're all I need
backed behind the frequency they played this song an hour ago
so let's tune out
let's tune out
let's tune out by turning on the radio---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca Lewis.
