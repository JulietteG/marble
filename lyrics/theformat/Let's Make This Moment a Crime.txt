Weve just got to take our time its like nothing really matters, so lets make this moment a crime I know, I know youre left
Behind but I'll do my best to feel broke down its been a minute, a second, I'll wait for you to come around but I know, I
Know youre taking time maybe its just too late, ive got to get away when everything feels the same, ive got to get away tell
Me its not too late

[chorus]
On and on and on you wait and oh the days they fade away and all the nights theyve never felt
The same if I was wrong then I was wrong and on and on and on and on the things we do are never going to change well you
Havent got a lot to say but you never want to stop you always want to feel this way I know I know youre taking time

[pre chorus]

[chorus]

We wait forever, if ever and youre too hip to saying never I'll never get it, oh I shouldnt sweat it not
Like it matters, its over, yeah at least till you come over so much for shutters, we're living under covers

[pre chorus]

[chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca Lewis.
