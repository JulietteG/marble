Hold on, there's a hole in my heart 
everyone can see right through me 
it goes all the way to the waves 
where my love she tried to wash it away 

see we break for the summers 
so she can find lovers 
she treats them like a bottle of wine 
they make you dinner 
and they sing you to sleep 
but by the morning find the bottle is empty 

'cause she never gives it the time 
every bottle she finds 
they don't compare 
to the ones she left behind 
there is never a note 
so she waits for me to come back home 

I'm looking for a dead end song 
you wish that smoke 
could change its color 
I love it when you talk so much 
and act like nothing went wrong 
I'm looking for a dead end song 
while we sit and find flaws in everyone 
I want to keep you by my side 
holding off tidal waves 

"mint car" is keeping us warm 
she lays crossed upon the bed 
we are puzzles making shapes 
with our hands 
I take my finger, turn into a pen 

then i run my hand down your spine 
you guess i wrote something profound 
something like: 
"our love will last 'til we die" 
I say "you're good at this game" 
but what I really wrote is 
"how I've yet to be saved"---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
