Be not so nervous, be not so frail
Someone watches you, you will not fail
Be not so nervous, be not so frail
Be not so nervous, be not so frail

Be not so sorry for what you've done
You must forget them now, it's done
And when you wake up you will find you can run
Be not so sorry for what you've done

Be not so fearful, be not so pale
Someone watches you, you will not leave the rails
Be not so fearful, be not so pale
Be not so fearful, be not so pale

Be not so sorry for what you've done
You must forget them now, it's done
And when you wake up you will find you can run
Be not so sorry for what you've done ---
