(feat. T-Pain)

Come and get some of this sex love and rock and roll
Come on, baby, get out of control
Baby, I was made to be a legend, legend
Baby, just roll the dice, the lucky seven, seven
Tonight Imma take you all the way to heaven, heaven
Baby just stick with me, stick with me
Im what you need, Im your VIP-o

Baby Im your VIP
Sex, love rock and roll
Tonight Im gonna make you scream
Sex  love  rock and roll

I got the keys to the city, wherever you wanna go
Baby, please, stay with me
Dont worry bout a thang cause perfectly you bid me
Im so, I think this love force just bit me
Baby, you know that Im a legend, legend
Baby, just roll the dice, the lucky seven, seven
Tonight Imma take you all the way to heaven, heaven
Baby just stick with me, stick with me
Im what you need, Im your VIP-o

Baby Im your VIP
Sex, love rock and roll
Tonight Im gonna make you scream
Sex  love  rock and roll---
