Kandi, kandi , lumidee, in del ro asileh ( this heart is original)
begoo, begoo, sedat be del mishineh (tell me, tel me , your voice is sweet)
kalak ,kalak , baba bia nazdiktaram (trickster , trickster , just come closer to me)
gooleyeh namak ( a pack of salt)

Ooh baby, u know what I like
The way you make me feeling tight
Ooh baby, give me a drive
Promise that you gon' be alright

Ooh baby, you're damn too right
We'll be going all through the night
Ooh baby, stay by my side
Promise that you gon' be alright
