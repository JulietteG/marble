Look were we are falling apart
And nothing seams to mend
This state of you, this state of me, mmh

Who do you think you're fooling now?
I guess we'll never find it out.
Who do you think you fooling now, now?
If only you, if only you, could see that I'm burning, if only you, would know how I'm hurting
All for you, if only you

I guess it's all right I keep my head high
You'll never see me cry
Confused over you, better by me, yeah

Who do you think you're fooling now?
I guess we'll never find it out.
Who do you think you fooling now, now?
If only you, if only you, could see that I'm burning, if only you, would know how I'm hurting, all for you, If only you

If only you, would know me better
If only you would listen better
If only you would see me better
If only you would hear me better
Set me free, before you press delete

If only you, could see that I'm burning, if only you would know how I'm hurting, all for you

If only you, if only you---Lyrics submitted by peny.
