Why you calling me again?
Youre tryin' to act all innocent.
I ripped your pictures all to shreds.
You said that it was over,
You said that it was over.

I can't unforget you if I tried. 
I threw it all away it's too late,
I can't let you back inside,
Not this time.
You walked out and you left me,
What was I supposed to do? 

Can't unforget you, 
Goodbye, goodbye,  goodbye.
Can't unforget you,
Goodbye.

Don't wanna lead you on.
There was a time when you were all I ever wanted,
Until now. 
The windows closed forever. 
And I finally got over,
Yeah I finally got over.
I can't unforget you if I tried.
I threw it all away it's too late,
I can't let you back inside,
Not this time.
You walked out and you left me,
So what was I supposed to do?

Can't unforget you, 
Goodbye goodbye, goodbye.
You're feeling desperate,
You want me to take you back, no.
Don't think I'll fall for it,
You only want what you can't have.

No no no,
I can't unforget you if I tried.
I threw it all away it's too late,
I can't let you back inside. 
Not this time.
You walked out and you left me,
What was I supposed to do?

Can't unforget you,
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Can't unforget you,
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Unforget you,
Goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by Kris.
