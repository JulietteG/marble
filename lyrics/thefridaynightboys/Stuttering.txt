You walk into the room and I
I, I-I, I, I, I-I, I.
I wanna tell ya, tell ya, but I just can't speak.
This shouldn't be so difficult.
Why-y. why-y-y-y-y-y, 
Tell me why I see you and I just can't breathe.

You're like a bullet, girl, to my heart, 
You're like a very far shooting star, 
The very thing that I need, 
Look at how you get to me

I can never be myself, 
How can I when I'm stuck in hell?
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing
Wanna tell you how I feel inside
But every time I go and try
Mutterin, mutterin, muttereh-ing
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing 

Don't leave, 
I know I effed it up, 
That's my luck, 
That's just my luh uh uck.
Here I go, Here I go and do it again

You're tut-, 
And I'm just so tongue tuh-ied.
Why-y-y, why can't I get it right?
The words just wont come out, 
They wanna take down
But I'm still around

You're like a bullet, girl, to my heart
Your like a very far shooting star, 
The very thing that I need
Look at how you get to me... 

I can never be myself, 
How can I when I'm stuck in hell?
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing
Wanna tell you how I feel inside
But every time I go and try
Mutterin, mutterin, muttereh-ing
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing

You're like a bullet, girl, to my heart
Your like a very far shooting star, 
The very thing that I need
Look at how you get to me   [x2] 

I can never be myself, 
How can I when I'm stuck in hell?
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing
Wanna tell you how I feel inside
But every time I go and try
Mutterin, mutterin, muttereh-ing
Stutterin, stutterin, stuttereh-ing

Muttereh-ing.
Stuttereh, stuttered, Stuttereh-ing---Lyrics submitted by Kris.
