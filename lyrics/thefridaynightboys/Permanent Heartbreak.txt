Face down on the bathroom floor.
Did you know you left me hanging out, to dry?
Can you see me in the ICU?
Do you even care, I'm fighting for my life?

Wrapped in confusion.
Were you only using me to try to get him back?
You set me up, and that was my mistake.
And all I got was permanent heartbreak,
Damaged beyond repair.
I was, I was much better off
Before I met you.
And your with him
It pisses me off that your A-Okay.
And all that I got was permanent heartbreak.

Flat lining in my bed.
It's killing me that
Youre next to him, not me.
I wish, I wasn't stuck with
This, stupid tattoo of you, on me.

Wrapped in confusion.
Were you only using me to try to him back?
You set me up, and that was my mistake.
And all I got was permanent heartbreak.
Damaged beyond repair.
I was, I was much better off,
Before I met you.
And youre with him
It pisses me off that your A-Okay.
And all that I got was permanent heartbreak.

Can you see me in the ICU?
Do you even care, I'm dyin?

You set me up and that was my mistake.
And all I got was permanent heartbreak.
Damaged beyond repair.
I was, I was much better off,
Before I met you.
And youre with him
It pisses me off that your A-Okay
Woah-oh, I hate that your A-okay!
And all that I got was permanent heartbreak.---Lyrics submitted by Kris.
