Now there's only one thing that money can't buy
True love - that will never die....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten.

Carefree lovers down country lane
Don't know my grief, can't feel the pain....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten.

But it's too late, my love - too late - but never mind....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten.

Now there's one more thing that troubles my mind,
My love has gone - left me behind....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten.

But it's too late, my love - too late - but never mind....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten.
All my sorrows - soon forgotten.
All my sorrows - soon forgotten (fade out)---Lyrics submitted by Anson Ong.
