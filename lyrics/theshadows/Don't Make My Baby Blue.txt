I know that I can't keep her,
Now she's in love with you,
But I just wanna see, I won't be far away,
So don't make my baby blue.

I know your reputation,
They say you can be true,
But I'll be standing by, so you just better try and
Don't make my baby blue.

That little girl's an angel,
And it hurts me to set her free,
So you'd better take good care of her
'Cause she still means a world to me.........

I'm gonna step aside now,
just like she wants me to,
But even though I'm gone, I'll still be looking on, so
Don't make my baby blue......

(Instrumental Segue)

But even though I'm gone, I'll still be looking on, so
Don't make my baby blue......
Don't make my baby blue......
Don't make my baby blue......---Lyrics submitted by Anson Ong.
