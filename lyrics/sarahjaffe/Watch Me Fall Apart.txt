You said once you were sad
but I don't believe you
you're too simple in the head
for pain to please you
there are days when you feel good
and days when you feel nothing at all

But there is no inbetween
and is that, that kills you
cause you don't know what to do
which page to thumb through
on all of my failures I've leaned
but with God as my witness I fall

Oh one by one they watch me fall apart
oh one by one they watch me fall apart

Forgive me I'm empty
and I want you to need me
your assurance is a game
and I'm always bluffing
like suburban nature
I've separated myself

But I'll kindly grip my teeth
swallow and bury it
unsettled and anxious
and now I'm careless
and I'm swearing in my sleep
cursing as the day, as it goes by

Oh one by one they watch me fall apart
oh one by one they watch me fall apart---Lyrics submitted by Esme.
