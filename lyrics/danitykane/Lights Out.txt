I'm so hot when i walk, I leave smoke in my tracks 
don't leave your man with me 'cause he won't come back.
I'm dangerous
It's when the lights go out. 
I'm a girl that's not afraid of the dark
when the lights go out I get what i want
I'm so easy
when the lights go out. 

Chorus 
I don't know what you want to do 
But I want to get you up in my room 
I like your swagger, gotta have it, gotta have ya
So won't you come along?
Turn out the lights, into the dark, dark

Hook 
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never ever had nothing better when the lights go out.

I'm a dig in my bag and see what i pull out
I got a lot of tricks so let me start out
with my number
when the lights go out.
I'm a change your good boy status 
Break all your good habits 
Momma gon' to make you an addict 
when the lights go out.

I'm gunna make you a new man
Have you talking to all of your friends
Baby, you ain't seen nothing 
when the lights go out.
I'm the type of girl that always get what i want 
So be sure before you come walk in the dark
'Cause you about to see
When the lights go out.

Chorus 

Hook

You ain't never ever, never ever seen a girl like me 
D-A-N-I-T-Y-K-A-N-E
You ain't never had nothing, boy
You ain't never had nothing, boy 
So won't you come on and turn the lights out?
