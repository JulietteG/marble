[Aundrea] 
Ooooo 
Yeah, yeah, here we go 

[Aundrea] 
I know we got everybody waiting 
To see just how we do 
I'm tellin' you we going hard 
Mix it up with some old school and a little new 

[Aubrey] 
We'll make you jump right out of your seat 
Make you lose your mind when you feel that beat 
It's just begun 
And we ain't going nowhere, going nowhere, oh 

[Day26 and Danity Kane and Donnie Klang] 
Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before 
We're gonna have you wanting more 
Like it is when you're with your girl 
Or ladies with your man 
This is our chance to make you move 
Ooh, we'll be right there, right there 

[Willie](Q) 
I know you feel it (Feel it) 
[(And it's making you not wanna stop]) 


[Mike] 
You might as well lose yourself 
Let it go, cause we gonna just keep giving you what you want 

[Robert and D. Woods] 
This is not a game, turn the music up and let it play our song 
And we ain't goin' nowhere, goin' nowhere 

[Day26 and Danity Kane and Donnie Klang] 
Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before 
We're gonna have you wanting more 
Like it is when you're with your girl 
Or ladies with your man 
This is our chance to make you move 
Ooh, we'll be right there, right there 

Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before 
We're gonna have you wanting more 
Like it is when you're with your girl 
Or ladies with your man 
This is our chance to make you move 
Ooh, we'll be right there, right there 

[Day26 and Dawn] 
Hold up, we about to make it official 
Put your drinks in the air and take 'em straight to the dance floor 

[Shannon and Q] 
Lose yourself and let the music control you 
You owe yourself to let go 
We've got everything you need, what you're looking for 

[Donnie](Mike) 
You don't have to look no more 
(You don't have to look no more) 

[Day26 and Danity Kane and Donnie Klang] 
Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before 
We're gonna have you wanting more 
Like it is when you're with your girl 
Or ladies with your man 
This is our chance to make you move 
Ooh, we'll be right there, right there---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
