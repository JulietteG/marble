[Aubrey] (Dawn) 
Oh 
Oh 
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, oh, oh) 
You got me feeling crazy 
It's like... just listen 

[Shannon] 
What I got, couldn't feel any worse 
It's like I'm possessed, under some kind of curse 
Temperature on rise, I can't close my eyes 
(I can't sleep at night and you're the reason why) 

[Dawn] 
Got my heart out in the cold (Breaker, breaker) 
I'm afraid of getting broke (Operator, 'rator) 

[D. Woods] 
S-O-S, I'm overboard (Cause you threw me in the sea) 
Please get the medic, somebody rescue me (Got that fever from you) 

[DK] (Aubrey) 
Boy, can't breathe, bones are shaking (Ah) 
Heavy spinning cause you make me (What?) 
Boy, you make, see you make me 
Ooh, you make me 
You make me sick 
Got the shivers when I'm near you 
Call the doctor cause you make me, oh 
Boy, you make, see you make me 
Ooh, you make me 
You make me sick 

[Aubrey] 
(Ha-choo) I'm allergic to your face 
(So queasy even when I hear your name) 
Dead on arrival from my self-denial 
(I can't even breathe) Boy what you do to me 

D.Woods(Dawn) 
Got my heart out in the cold (Breaker, breaker) 
Ooh, I'm afraid of getting broke, yeah (Operator, 'rator) 

[Dawn] 
S-O-S, I'm overboard (Cause you threw me in the sea) 
Please get the medic, somebody rescue me (Got that fever from you)

[Aundrea] 
Mama said don't hate but your bitter pill 
I can't get well cause you're keeping me ill 
(I need a check-up or maybe some pills) 
Cause I'm sick of your shit 
So sick of you here

Ah, ah, ah... 
Queasy, shaky-shaky, got me spinning cause you make me sick 
Ah, ah, ah... 
Got that fever from you
