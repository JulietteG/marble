[Chorus (x2):]
Can't take it when you put your loving on me
You make me say ooh when you're touching on me
Don't know what to do when you give it to me
You make me say ooh ahh ooh ahh

[Aundrea:]
Hush for a minute
Touch for a minute
Move for a minute
Just a minute
Hot in the middle
Dance for a little
Kiss for a little
Just a little

[Bridge:]
Ooh when I need it
I can't get enough
When you give it
Want you more and more
It's something that you do
I can't take it from you

[Chorus x2]
Can't take it when you put your loving on me
You make me say ooh when you're touching on me
Don't know what to do when you give it to me
You make me say ooh ahh ooh ahh

[Aubrey:]
Meant when I said it
You're gonna get it
Loved when we did it
Wrapped up in it
Holding me steady
Hooked and I'm ready
Breathin' is heavy
Come and get me

[Bridge + Chorus x2]
Ooh when I need it
I can't get enough
When you give it
Want you more and more
It's something that you do
I can't take it from you

Can't take it when you put your loving on me
You make me say ooh when you're touching on me
Don't know what to do when you give it to me
You make me say ooh ahh ooh ahh

[Hook w/ Andrea and Dawn vocals:]
When I am in need you're right on time (right on time)
You make me say ooh ahh ooh ahh
Take away my pain and my mind
You make me say ooh ahh ooh ahh
Ooh I can't take it when you put your love all on me

[Chorus x4]
Can't take it when you put your loving on me
Don't know what to do when you give it to me
Can't take it when you put your loving on me
Don't know what to do when you give it to me
Ooh Ahh---Lyrics submitted by yonna.
