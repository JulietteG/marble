You say you can love better than anyone else can..
Only if there's a spell played off then you would be a better man
Why couldn't you have done it when you held my heart in your hand?
Back then, you were too busy making other plans..!
Now you're walking tellin' me things you think I wanna hear
But I've already turned the page, and now your senses see..

How can I believe you?
How can I believe you?
When everything you said has been a lie?
Now you say it's different.. 
Tell me why should i listen..?
When everything you said has been a lie..

Don't you remember when you wouldn't eve hold my hand?
I guess that you never felt proud to be my man!
I haven't forgotten all the the times that you let me down..
There's nothing you can say to turn the past around!

Now you're walking tellin' me things you think i wanna hear
But I've already turned the page, and now your senses see..

How can I believe you?
How can I believe you?
When everything you said has been a lie?
Now you say it's different.. 
Tell me why should i listen..?
When everything you said has been a lie..

Has been a lie...!---Lyrics submitted by Mariam Bieber.
