Junior Johnson was a moonershiner 
He ran that shine all over north carolina
In his supercharged
1947 chevrolet
Raising hell and getting paid

Well Juniors new wife was a beautiful sight
Shed get upset when she stayed out all night
These were hard times, and they lived in a hard way
She wasnt happy when he drank all day


Chorus.
=Shed say
Turn me loose
Give up the booze,
Its me or the hooch, honey.
You gotta choose
Hed say I love you but there aint no choice, 
I cant turn my back on the bottle.
Hed say I cant turn m back on the bottle.=


Freddy was an alcoholic tax agent
Hed be burned by junior time and again.
It was a sad truth
Oh in times he was in hot pursuit.
Not once did he catch that supped up coupe.

Well junior took his skills to the race track.
He found another way to get a paycheck
The national association of stock car auto racing, 
He became a man worth chasing.

Chorus.

Freddy got a tip from dirty beth.
Junior was up guarding his papas still and they boxed him in.
They locked him up and threw the book at him.
Yeah freddy was happy with his revenge.
Well Junior was released in 58.

He quickly proved he was born to race.
He had fifty fix.
When he retired in 66.
That champagne always did the trick.
