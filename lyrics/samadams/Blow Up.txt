Been workin all night, man
Whats a young kid gotta do to blow up
This lifes becoming somethin I cant stand
Tell those people go home I dont wanna grow up
I drank too much again last night, damn
Woke up with a hangover time to roll up
Been workin so hard cant they understand,
So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up,
Blow up, blow up
Yeah, we just wanna blow up

I just wanna prove a teacher wrong
Tell them that my own degree didnt help me write a song
Only payin attention of the girl with the thong, and the skirt so short
Its like she barely has a lawn
And uh, sick of hearin bout my alcohol abuses and makin up extravagent
Excuses, theyre useless
So deuces to the classroom, welcome to your dreams that made you without a
Major, homie, welcome to the team

Ive been workin all night, man
Whats a young kid gotta do to blow up
This lifes becoming somethin I cant stand
Tell those people go home I dont wanna grow up
I drank too much again last night, damn
Woke up with a hangover time to roll up
Been workin so hard cant they understand,
So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up,
Blow up, blow up
Yeah, we just wanna blow up
Waking up, weights become a trend
I roll over in the morning, random girl up in my bed
And I swear she was a cutie, she was lookin like a ten
But the proof is in the puddin I was obviously there
Obviously put it on a rich girls dad
Just tryna make money like a rich girl dad
So deuces to the school life, fucking with a game
What made ya without a major, homie, look what i became

Ive been workin all night, man
Whats a young kid gotta do to blow up
This lifes becoming something I cant stand
Tell those people go home I dont wanna grow up
I drank too much again last night, damn
Woke up with a hangover time to roll up

So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up,
Blow up, blow up
