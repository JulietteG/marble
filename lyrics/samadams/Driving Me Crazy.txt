im walking on, walking on
broken glass
got a problem too many girls in class
wanna run a show but they just cant rap the idea around they head that the kid could rap
fact: i kill stages all places
nantucket n ack city so they could taste it
but im real late no way imma make it
back to my classes the clock impatient
well, apologize to the teach for me
cause anything she speaks aint doing shit for me
and my bad cant read notes
still amazing like a chick with a deep throat
treading water since the very thin ice broke
now im neck deep in contracts, psycho
im iight tho, or i will be, shake your ass ma, if you feel me

baby you been driving me crazy
can you be my lady
can you be my baby, baby,
driving me crazy

just feel good, just feel right, rock this crowd all damn night
cameras flash, shouting right, zoning out, taking flight
grab your girl and drink your hand
dj spinning all my shit
cause Sammy Adams what is what they like

yeah and i can party with the best of em
at school but still cant touch them son
aint dc but flying in the rest of them
you aint there imma get her num-ber,
and take her to the hotel room
walking on walking on something new
you and the whole damn rap gang too
and i know got one life,
like you girl , please no wife
blow weed in the club, no white
we like females got no bite
cant see Sammy got no sight
going twelve rounds, yeah come fight
get blessed by the kid Jesus Christ
and the beat stop sleep tight

baby you been driving me crazy
can you be my lady
can you be my baby, baby,
driving me crazy

just feel good, just feel right, rock this crowd all damn night
cameras flash, shouting right, zoning out, taking flight
grab your girl and drink your hand
dj spinning all my shit
cause Sammy Adams what is what they like

Being a man it only makes you better off
aint a rock band no my shits never soft
i look at girls and they always wanna talk
i move around girl, so you better walk
no tony hawk but last night give her the whole thing, no half pipe,
got em jumping in the club and in the club like
Sammy Adams damn he do it so right

baby you been driving me crazy
