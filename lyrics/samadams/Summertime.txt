I love summertime cuz I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm lookin' for somebody

I just need a dime and some sunshine
A little magic a cut above the average
Everybody movin' in I told 'em that's what happened
Cut above the records who the hell you think they blastin'
Kiss the hand of the new boss all jazzed up I ain't ever been to Utah
Packed up read for the journey got my UHaul
Game's over sunk the 8 followed by the cue ball, cue ball, cue ball

Tapes pop Panama to Cuba Jack's chasin' everything I chew on
Life is just a party and you missin' every nuance
Keep your comments cut 'em out the picture with your coupons, coupons

You are everything I'm lookin' for 
Fireworks every time that I'm lookin' towards
Everything I do I do I promise Ima do it to the best of my ability
I prove it

I love summertime cuz I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm lookin' for somebody

We gon' live it up feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime

I just need a pretty girl one time
No commitments down to get it in quick
I'm just tryna drink a few
Soak up all the sunshine
Not a damn thing running through my young mind

Thank god for the new hits 
Walking down the beach and hearing my own music
Couldn't feel better
Cutie on my right bad as ever
And my homie told me I could never get her, get her, get her, get her
Yup I can't even explain the feeling doing nothing
But just chilling with your gang

Things up the road and I seen up on the place
Can't compare to bein with the homies
Somethings never change
Its summer love some number gon' exchange
I left a couple hearts bleedin'
Its part of the game
And I, know I, know I gotta lot of work to do
But Ima keep on workin' for the music

I love summertime cuz I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm lookin' for somebody

We gon' live it up feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime
Summertime

We gon' live it up feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime
Summertime
Summertime....---Lyrics submitted by Tanner Thomas.
