And I'm okay baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back and close my eyes
I can't see the ground 'cause I'm so high
I'm so, I'm so...
I'm so high

That's just the way it goes rock bottom,
watchin' my inspiration fold.
Thrown in the game now warm up, but I ain't cold.
Transition from ice cold to luke warm,
wanna feel my story hommie come here and put my shoes on.

Yeah, 'cause since the beginnin', people been hatin' when I see 'em I'm just grinnin'.
Grew up in the city blowin' Ls while we winnin', know I'm goin' just as hard in the night feelin' as the first.
Thanks Boston, for raisin' me, it's all clear with its flash and complacency, Sammy Adams, the prey of the agency.

And I'm okay baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back and close my eyes
I can't see the ground 'cause I'm so high
I'm so, I'm so...

So high dodgin' jet straight great flow, no pipe dreams, gettin' paid so, but I'd rather get love get base sold, tracks on repeat girls askin' who makes those...
give a damn if your boys don't like me, I'm on track now like Nikes, all mighty.
If you got money just tend to it politely, if you got balls beatin' me is unlikely.

Always had a chance, you never had a glance, I'm the cool kid in the meeting while the others piss their pants, head up in the clouds, sophisticated stance, while my body's in the office, supplyin' their demands, and every hour in the booth that I'm gettin' pain for wonder
why it's dark outside and where'd today go?
'Cause it's easy to get your name known, when everythin' you're recording is straight fuego.

And I'm okay baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back and close my eyes
I can't see the ground 'cause I'm so high
I'm so, I'm so...
I'm so high!

Yeah! ...Started at ground zero... comin' up...---Lyrics submitted by Natalie Garcia.
