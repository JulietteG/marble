I feel alive beside you
And all at once I am whole again
We fall into each other
Your atmosphere is all I'm breathing in
And in this rush
We are crushed

Carry me down
Rolling in your arms
Cause I can't remember
Ever falling this hard
Tell me tonight
All that we have been
Was it nothin' more
Than noise inside my head
Crashing down
Crashing down
In your avalanche
In your avalanche

These scars we wear remind u
The more we change the more we're all the same
Swept up in this emotion
We fumble through and make the same mistakes
Cause we are led
To the edge

Carry me down
Rolling in your arms
Cause I can't remember
Ever falling this hard
Tell me tonight
All that we have been
Was it nothin' more
Than noise inside my head
Crashing down
Crashing down
In your avalanche

Crashing down
Crashing down
Carry me down
Rolling in your arms
Cause I can't remember
Ever falling this hard
Tell me tonight
All that we have been
Was it nothin' more
Than noise inside my head
Carry me down
Rolling in your arms
Cause I can't remember
Ever falling this hard
Tell me tonight
All that we have been
Was it nothin' more
Than noise inside our heads
Crashing down
Crashing down
Was it nothin' more
Than noise inside our heads
Crashing down
Crashing down

I feel alive beside you
Then all at once I am whole again---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
