I've got questions for you
You've got answers untrue
I can walk these circles all night long
Take a pill and sleep off
Everything you can think of
Walking all these circles to a song
Could you play me something new?

So take a minute just to breathe
And think of everything you wanted
And what you got instead
Is it a labor just to see
Around the left, the right, over my head
To straight ahead

Find a new way to feel right
Between this time a fistfight
I can read the circles 'round your eyes
This is life, this is no rhyme
Find a beat, find the right time
To organize the circles to a song
Could you play me something new?

So take a minute just to breathe
And think of everything you wanted
And what you got instead
Is it a labor just to see
Around the left, the right, over my head
To straight ahead, yeah

So take a minute just to breathe
And think of everything you wanted
And what you got instead

So take a minute just to breathe
And think of everything you wanted
And what you got instead (what you got instead)
Is it a labor just to see
Around the left, the right, over my head
To straight ahead, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
