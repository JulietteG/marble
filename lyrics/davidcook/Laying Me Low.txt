[Verse 1]
I remember when you lit my flame
A bit of pressure with a pinch of pain
You left me praying for a single drop of rain, oh
But now the fires burning out of control
Beause Im never gonna let you go
So bring the gasoline and we can start the show, oh

[Bridge]
You got under my skin and I cant begin
To think of all the trouble you keep getting me in
So Ill just hold on and try to be strong

[Chorus]
And I fall apart when Im with you
I cry when I kiss you
I know youre really no good
You got my heart in your hand
No, Ill never understand and it shows
You get me high but youre laying me low
Oh whoa oh oh (x3)

[Verse 2]
Well I remember every broken line
Im just the victim of the perfect crime
You keep running while I keep on doing time, oh
So give me something just to keep me sane
I only wanna hear you say my name
Now I know Im never gonna win this game
But I play anyway

[Bridge]
You got under my skin and I cant begin
To think of all the trouble you keep getting me in
So Ill just hold on and try to be strong

[Chorus]
But I fall apart when Im with you
I cry when I kiss you
I know youre really no good
You got my heart in your hand
No, Ill never understand and it shows
You get me high but youre laying me low

Oh whoa oh oh (x3)

[Chorus]
And I fall apart when Im with you
I cry when I kiss you
I know youre really no good
You got my heart in your hand
No, Ill never understand and it shows
You get me high but youre laying me low

Oh oh whoa oh oh (x3)
(Laying me low)
Oh oh whoa oh oh (x2)

You get me high but youre laying me low---
