All I feel now is the weight of the day
I need you with me to push it away
When we disappear into each other
Our colors appear and bleed into one

Fade into me, fade into you
The two of us melting together
Until we become something new
And we can escape
And watch the world chasing to find us
Both of us hidden from view
If you fade into me
Fade into me

When I'm broken you're the one thing I need
Like an ocean I feel you crash over me
When we disappear into each other
Our colors appear and bleed into one

Fade into me, fade into you
The two of us melting together
Until we become something new
And we can escape
And watch the world chasing to find us
Both of us hidden from view
If you fade into me

Let go, fall in
Drown in the moment with me
Sinking 'til we start to break

Fade into me, fade into you
The two of us melting together
Until we become something new
And we can escape
And watch the world chasing to find us

Oh fade into me, fade into you
The two of us melting together
Until we become something new
And we can escape
And watch the world chasing to find us
Both of us hidden from view
If you fade into me
Fade into me
Fade into me---Lyrics submitted by Nancy Pittman.
