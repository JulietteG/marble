We've been here before
We'll be here again so go on and rest your head
Before you lose it again
We're leaning on each other
Or at least I can pretend
That we didn't lose it all again
It could have been different
It could have all been the same
But now I'm standing at your front door, singing,

When everything's the same
And nothing ever changes
Will you fall back into me, oh
You see, everything's estranged
A million empty faces
So will you fall back into me?

Congratulations
You left me a little jaded and rejected
And so I lost it again
You chew me up, you throw away
As I continue to pretend
That we didn't lose it all again
I guess it's never different
I guess it's all the same
So now I'm bloodied by my fist, clenched, swinging

When everything's the same
And nothing ever changes
Will you fall back into me, oh
You see, everything's estranged
A million empty faces
So will you fall back into me?

I was a name across your lips
It's time to spin me out
I play the game when my heart rips
It's time to hear out
(Never do without)

When everything's the same
And nothing ever changes
Will you fall back into me
See, everything's estranged
A million empty faces
So will you fall back into me?

(Will you fall
We'll be here again
So go on and rest your head
Before you lose it again)

We're leaning on each other
Or at least I can pretend
That we didn't lose it all again, all again
Lose it all again---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
