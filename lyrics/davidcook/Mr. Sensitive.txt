Day in and day out
Watch him scream
Watch him shout through the silence
Through the silence
Give him ears
Give him eyes
Give some point to the cries and the violence
Oh, the violence
Hear him scream your name

I would like to introduce Mr. Sensitive
The words, he'll never let the words
Get the best of him
Get the best of him

This city feels low
Against the gleam and the glow
Of his diligence
To their elegance
Just feel anger, feel pain
Feel the sun and the rain
Just feel something
Oh, feel something
Hear him scream your name

I would like to introduce Mr. Sensitive
The words, the words
He'll never let the words
Get the best of him
Take all the stones
The bricks, the bones
He didn't stand a chance they said
A little boy but ignorance is bliss---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
