We can wear a sinner
Longing in relief
You've been watching
As disaster steals another piece

Of all that you held so close
What you love the most
But you can never keep

And hope seems like a promise
Just out of reach
You'd die to feel alive again
You long to be set free

And love comes down
When your heart is lost
When you seen your whole world shattered
And your dreams just fall apart
So lift up your voice
Let Him hear your cry
When you've got nothing left to hold onto
That's when love comes down
Love comes down

If you could only know who loves you
Who feels your every pain
If you could only hear Him speaking
With the voice as sweet as rain
You know that He counts your tears
He holds a mirror
No one will go to waste
And the sorrow that weighs you down
Will float away

And love comes down
When your heart is lost
When you seen your whole world shattered
And your dreams just fall apart
So lift up your voice
Let Him hear your cry
When you've got nothing left to hold onto
That's when love comes down
Love comes down

That's when love is stronger
Than any heart break
And you know every broken piece
Will be made whole

Love comes down
When you need it most
When you see your world get shattered
Without love it all falls apart

So lift up your voice
Let Him hear your cry
When you've got nothing left to hold onto
That's when love comes down
When love comes down
When love comes down

When you've got nothing left to hold onto 
That's when love comes down---
