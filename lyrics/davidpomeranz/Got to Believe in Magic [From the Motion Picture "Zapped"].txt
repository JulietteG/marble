Take me to you heart
Show me where to start
Let me play the part of your first love
All the stars are right
Every wish is ours tonight my love

Pity those who wait
Trust in love to faith
Findin' out to late that they've lost it
Never letting go
They will never know the ways of love.

Got to believe in magic
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers
You've got to believe in magic
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love.

I may never know
Why I need you so
All I need to know is this feeling
Handle it with care
We were born to share this dream, my love

Got to believe in magic
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers
You've got to believe in magic
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love

Got to believe in magic
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers
You've got to believe in magic
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love---Lyrics submitted by mitchelle mae.
