Here we stand today
Like we always dreamed
Starting out our live together
Night is in your eyes
Love is in our hearts
I can't believe you really mine forever

(Bridge)
I feel rehearse in for this moment in all my life
So don't act surprise
If the feelings start to carry me away

(Chorus)
On this day
I promise forever
On this day
I surrendered my heart
Here I stand take my hand
And I will follow every word that i say 
On this day 

Not so long ago 
This heart is just a fill of golden lonely space 
Without you 
Now everything's all right 
Now everything's refill 
And the story of my life 
Is all about YOU 

So if you feel the cold winds
blowing through your nights 
I will shelter you and forever
here that tears your fear away

Repeat Chorus---Lyrics submitted by tugob.
