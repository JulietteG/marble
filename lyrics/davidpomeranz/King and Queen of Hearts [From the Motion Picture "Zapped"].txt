We're the king annd queen of hearts
Hold me when the music starts
All my dreams come true
When i dance with you

Promise me your mine tongiht
I will wait in line tonight
While the lights are low
I'll never let you go

Chorus:

Did i dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that i prayed would never end
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love is here at the coronation
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts

Time will pass and tears will fall
But someday we'll both recall
Moments made of this Golden Memories

INSTRUMENTAL BREAK

Did i dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that i prayed would never end?(ohh)
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love is here at the coronation
I'm the king and your the queen(you're the queen)
In a once and future dream
Where the dances never seem to start

Did i dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that i prayed would never end?(ohh)
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love is here at the coronation
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts(yeah)

Did i dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that i prayed would never end?(ohh)
No it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love is here at the coronation
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts
(yeah yeah yeah yeah.......)---Lyrics submitted by Nicko.
