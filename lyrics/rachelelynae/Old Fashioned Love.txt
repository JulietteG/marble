Changing out the pictures on the wall 
Its funny you were
Nothing I was looking for at all
And now I see how

Too many times Ive settled for
So much less than so much more
Dont think Im dreaming, Im just wondering

Is there anyone out there
Who would throw a pebble at my window
To steal one kiss
Cause he just cant resist
Im not asking for the world
Or the stars up above
Just someone strong enough
With an honest touch
Whatever happened
To that old fashioned kind of love

I dont need a half to make me whole
But itd sure be nice if 
I could find a hand Id like to hold
That certain kind of 

Man just as strong as my father was
Who knows how to fight and never give up
Im not dreaming, Im just wondering

Love, that could shake the ocean
That could set my heart in motion
The kind of love that wont leave me wondering---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
