Roll those wheels around
Head 'em over to my house
The day is done but its not gone
And we're still young
So Let's go waste some time and
Paint that city limit sign
I don't care what we do
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you


Woh, oh, oh
We've got forever
Let's take it for a ride
Woh, oh, oh 
When we're together
Baby we can fly
And touch the stars tonight 

Hangin with our friends
Build a bonfire in the sand
Watch the sparks like fireflies
Light up your eyes
And you can steal a kiss
Take my heart and run and with it
Its love I want to fall into
When I'm with you
When I'm with you


Tonight Tonight we can fly yah
Tonight Tonight we'll touch the stars yah
Tonight Tonight we can fly 
Tonight Tonight

We've got forever
When we're together---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
