So this is it
This is what it feels like in the end
When done is done

So thats the sound
Of all the words you swore youd never say
Done is done

Youre just not coming back
Theres nothing left for me to tell you
Maybe you werent meant to be the one
There is no try again
And I cant break the walls around you
So these two hearts have nowhere left to run
Whats done is done

So here it comes
The doubting, the questions, the blame
Done is done

So thats the taste
The way your goodbye lingers on my lips
Done is done

Youre just not coming back
Theres nothing left for me to tell you
Maybe you werent meant to be the one
There is no try again
And I cant break the walls around you
So these two hearts have nowhere left to run
Whats done is done

Swallow back the hope
Try so hard to know

I can be alone
I dont need your arms around me
Im strong enough to make it on my own---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
