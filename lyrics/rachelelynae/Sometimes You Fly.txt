No warning signs
Im lost in your eyes
You make me crazy

I cant catch my breathe
You pull me in
And I am taken

My walls keep breaking
My heart is racing

Could this be me, falling in love
Letting my guard down, dropping my gloves
Thinking just one time maybe
You could be the one to save me
Could you be just another regret
Or maybe my best thing yet
I wont know if I dont try
Sometimes you fall
Sometimes you fly

Im taking extra time
Putting on the heals tonight
I know you like it

You keep me up all night
You do the dumbest things
To keep me laughing

Im standing on the edge and Im
Thinking bout jumping

Youve got me doing things Ive never done before
Youve got me wanting so much more---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
