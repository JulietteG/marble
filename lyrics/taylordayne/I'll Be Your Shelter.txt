When there's clouds hangin' in your sky,
and they're not lettin' any light in,
and you feel like you'd like to give in, 
don't you give up so soon.
What you need is a friend to count on,
what you got baby you got someone,
who will stay when the rain is fallin',
and won't let it fall on you.

I'll see you through, 
I'll cover you,
with a love so deep and warm and true,
I will be there, oh.....

(Chorus)
Honey I'll be your shelter,
I'll be the one to take you through the night.
Whenever you need shelter,
I'll make everything alright, 
make everything alright,
yeah, na na na na na na,
na na na na na na,
na na na na na na,
na na na na na na.

I got arms strong enough to hold you,
get you through anything you go through,
anything that you need you know it's only a touch away.
When your heart needs a heart beside it,
should be mine that it's keepin' time with,
Cuz I got so much love inside it,
it beats for you everyday.
I'll be the one,
to give you love,
when it seems like there's just not enough, 
mine will be there, oh.....

Chorus

I'll see you through,
I'll cover you,
with a love so deep and warm and true,
I will be there, oh.....
