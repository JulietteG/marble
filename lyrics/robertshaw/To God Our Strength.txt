To God our strength, shout joyfully: 
To Jacob's God shout triumphing.
 Take up a psalm and timbrel bring: 
The pleasant harp with psaltery.

Blow up the trumpet at new moon: 
In set time at day of our feast. 
For it to Israel is an heast [ordinance]: 
To Jacob's God due to be doon [done].

Jehovah, God of thee I am;
Which thee ascending up did guide 
from land of Egypt: Open wide
thy mouth and I will feel the same---Lyrics submitted by Nick Staffa.
