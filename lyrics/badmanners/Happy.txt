I don't want you anymore
Doesn't matter what's the score
I'm lying here on the floor and I feel so happy
I, I cheated and i lied
The echoes in my eyes
The silence in my side
Makes me feel so happy
So happy, I feel so happy, I'm so happy.

I'm, I'm lying here on the floor
I've been down here before
Don't ask me what's the score, 'cause I feel so happy
So happy, I feel so happy, I'm so happy.
Nanananananananana

And if I see you when you're talkin' to my friends
I have to turn away and wait until it ends.

I can't believe that was the way I used to be,
This tears of love, do not from love that i conceal?

I've been down here before
Don't ask me what's the score
The echoes in my eyes
I'm lying here on the floor
Doesn't matter what's the score
The silence in my side
I cheated and I lied
Now I feel so, happy
So happy
I feel so happy
I'm so happy.

[and now I don't want you anymore and I feel so happy
I don't need you, that's for sure and I feel so happy] (x2)
