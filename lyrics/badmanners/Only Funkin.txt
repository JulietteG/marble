When you go out can you pull a bird every week
You whisper gently and you kiss them upon the beak
Are you nervous when you get back to her pad
How do you compare with the last one she had

It's only funkin, it's only funkin, it's only funkin
it's only funkin, it's only funkin with you.........
on the floor, on the floor 

Put on your make up, sit behind that mirror for hours
Put on the stuff that makes your privates smell of flowers
Do you look the way you see yourself in your dreams 
Just like the centrefold in glossy magazines

It's only funkin, it's only funkin, it's only funkin anyway
It's only funkin, it's only funkin, it's only funkin anyway
It's only funkin, it's only funkin, it's only funkin anyway
It's only funkin, it's only funkin, it's only funkin anyway

Are you man enough and can you measure up
Are you frightened to admit your size of cup 
All the worries that get heaped upon your back
What's the difference when you get into the sack

It's only funkin, it's only funkin, it's only funkin
It's only funkin, it's only funkin with you.............
On the floor,
All night long,
On the floor,
All night long---Lyrics submitted by Mikey Boy.
