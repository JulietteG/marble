When you going to San Francisco
You should wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're sure to find some gentle people there

when you going to San Francisco
you should wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're sure to find some gentle people there

The children singing
The bells are ringing 
Youll find some laughter
Yeaaaah

When you going to San Francisco
You should wear some flowers in your hair
When you come to San Francisco
You're sure to find some gentle people there

Oh, how sweet to love somebody
Some ______ and never be of a thrill
Live a lifetime and yet love no body
It would of been better if they had not be born---Lyrics submitted by Josef.
