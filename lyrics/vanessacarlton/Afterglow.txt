Just when the waves are washing over
Just when you think you're goin' down
Just when the chill makes you colder
The sun comes out for you

And if you could see what's come over me
then you would know
Cause I'm walking free
the wind at my back
Bathed in afterglow

And as I sit here in this dark room
All I seem to feel is light
And I see color
I see the the ruin
Of the blood in this life that's ours

And if you could see what's come over me
then you would know
Cause I'm walking free
the wind at my back
Bathed in afterglow

Hold me now and see the sun fill the sky
Let me down and see the day has gone by

And if you could see what's come over me
then you would know
Cause I'm walking free
the wind at my back
Bathed in afterglow---Lyrics submitted by rachel.
