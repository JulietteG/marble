First saw you at the video exchange
I know my heart
and, it will never change
this temp-work would be alright
if you'd call me,
you'd call me
I lie awake at night for you,
and I pray

We'd cross the deepest ocean,
cargo across the sea
and if you dont believe me,
just put your hands on me
and all the constellations
shine down for us to see
and if you dont believe me,
just put your hands on me

ooh...

The subway radiates with heat
we barley met, and still i cross the street
to your door

We'd cross the deepest ocean,
cargo across the sea
and if you dont believe me,
just put your on me
and all the costellations,
shine down for us to see
and if you dont believe me,
just put your hands on me

Someday when our stories are told,
they'll tell of a love like this
when our descendants are growing old
a thousand years and we'll be singing
na na na na na na na na na

We climbed the Tibetan mountains,
where we can barley breath
I see the Dalai lama,
I feel him blessing me
and all the constellations,
shine down on us to see
and if you dont believe me,
just put your hands on me

(hands on me)
Hands on me
(hands on me)
na na na na na na na na na
(hands on me)
Hands on me
(hands on me)
Your hands on me
(hands on me)
na na na na na na na na na

I first saw you at the video exchange---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
