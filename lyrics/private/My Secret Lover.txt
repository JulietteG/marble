You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

I met you at the club no further comment 
I said baby let's go back to your apartment 
And girl take off your dress let's make this place a mess 
It feels so good, so tell me why should i confess? 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

Man, i'm a man machine 
Check out my style cause i'm going real wild 
I'm plugging in keyboards one at the time 
And then i gotta song, gotta a song in no time 

I can't wait for you to turn the lights off 
This is something that i don't want to get out of 
And i keep thinking of the love that we could share 
So what's a boy like me supposed to do without you 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

hello? are you gonna be a man? because you better act like it 
(but you're so fresh) fresh? I wanna be the man 
I don't have time for this shit 
(I'm comming after you) 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

You're undercover 
My secret lover 
You're what I need 
My bullet's in the gun 

Man, i'm a man machine 
Check out my style cause i'm going real wild 
I'm plugging in keyboards one at the time 
And then i gotta song, gotta a song in no time---Lyrics submitted by Ricardo.
