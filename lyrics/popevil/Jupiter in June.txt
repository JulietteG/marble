Jupiter in June, I saw your eyes
Like the moon stole the sky, I swear you were mine
This beautiful prison walls, alone in my mind
Was it all a miracle or
Just a waste of time

Wherever you are, your so far away
Wherever you go, I follow
We made our mistakes, this price that we paid
I find a way to get over you.

Jupiter in June
When the words become lies
Winter turns to spring
Guess I saw my goodbye
Was it all just a crying shame
No more miracles, no more wasted time!

Wherever you are, your so far away
Wherever you go, I follow
We made our mistakes, this past that we paved
I find a way to get over you.

My world is caving in, I PROMISE
Things will be better on the other side
Your all I ever wanted, but this all falls back on you

Wherever you are, your so far away
Wherever you go, I follow
We made our mistakes, this past that we paved.
But, I find a way to get over

Wherever you are, your so far away
Wherever you go, I follow
We made our mistakes, this past that we paved.
But, I find a way to get over, you.---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
