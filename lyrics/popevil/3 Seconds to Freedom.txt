Your everything I hate
Your everything i love
When everything thats right 
Comes falling from above
You wish you could erase
The walls that hold you down
Every second that is lost
Another moment that is found

Chorus

Dont let it slip away
Just save yourself tonight 
Stop the fight cuz everything is over, 
Ya think you got what it takes
Then get up, get up, get up
If you want it, then I want it more
C'mon 3, 2, 1, we got 3 seconds to freedom

Im the one who's singled out
Your the reason Im up in arms
And there's no turning back 
Then show me where to start 
Cuz you're still everything I hate 
Your everything I love 
Now who will save you now

Dont let it slip away 
Just save yourself tonight
Stop the fight 
Cuz everything is over
Ya think you got what it takes 
Then get up, get up, get up
If you want it, then i want it more 
C'mon 3, 2, 1, we got three seconds to
Picked no better time to hate then right now
Dont let it slip away before the walls come down
Save yourself tonight, we only got one shot
We got 3 seconds to freedom

Just save yourself tonight 
Stop the fight cuz everything is over
Ya think you got what it takes 
Then get up, get up, get up
If you want it, then i want it more
C'mon 3, 2, 1, we got 3 seconds to
3, 2, 1, we got 3 seconds to freedom---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
