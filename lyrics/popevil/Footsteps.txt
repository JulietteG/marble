I've been counting all my steps
All my no's just turned to yes
Silently I must confess
My troubled history
That's washed away all my sins
Starting over once again
This is where it all begins
It's right in front of me
Down is not where I belong
This aching heart won't turn to stone
There's a fire inside these bones
It was meant to be
I see the world still full of light
How could I ever be so blind
I still haven't lost my fight
That haunts me in my sleep

I feel like waking up
I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps
Go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mile
Wore down this lonely soul
I'll take these footsteps
Go higher, go higher
(Woohoooo woohoooo woohoooo...)
Higher, go higher
(Woohoooo woohoooo woohoooo...)
Higher, higher

I know only time will tell
If all the cards will treat me well
Cause this hand that I been dealt
Keeps me wondering
So now here I turn the page
I've learned to silence all my rage
Tell me who can really say
What will tomorrow bring

I feel like waking up
I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps
Go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mile
Wore down this lonely soul
I'll take these footsteps
Go higher, go higher
(Woohoooo woohoooo woohoooo...)
Higher, go higher
(Woohoooo woohoooo woohoooo...)
Higher, higher

I'll find you
So far away
I'll find you
After all
I'll find you
So far away
I'll find you
After all

(I'll find you) I feel like waking up
(So far away) I've had this dream before
(I'll find you) I'll take these footsteps
(After all) Go higher, go higher
(I'll find you) I've walked an empty mile (I'll find you)
(So far away) Wore down this lonely soul (So far away)
(I'll find you) I'll take these footsteps
(After all) Go higher, go higher

(I'll find you) I feel like waking up
(So far away) I've had this dream before
(I'll find you) I'll take these footsteps
(After all) Go higher, go higher
(I'll find you) I've walked an empty mile (I'll find you)
(So far away) Wore down this lonely soul (So far away)
(I'll find you) I'll take these footsteps
(After all) Go higher, go higher

I feel like waking up
I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps
Go higher, higher---
