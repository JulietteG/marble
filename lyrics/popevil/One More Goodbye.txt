I thought you'd always be there, 
Always be there waiting.
Everything we sacrificed, you threw away.
Now I'm prepared to walk, 
Too tired, too numb to talk.
Every step I take, can't hid the pain.
What we had, it's over.

I don't wanna see - I don't wanna speak, 
I don't wanna hear - Your lies.
I don't understand and I don't even care, 
Cuz it's over.
I send you.

One more goodbye.
(This is our last goodbye.)
This is the last letter I write.
One more goodbye.
You can forget about it.
You can just forget about
What we had.

As I lay here in this candle lit room, 
Reminiscing about those what could have beens
And will never b's now.
I am tattered, torn, and bruised - Alone, 
Heart broke, and used.
But you'll never bury me with your shattered
Dreams and your never afters.

I don't wanna see - I don't wanna speak, 
I don't wanna hear - Your lies.
I don't understand and I don't even care, 
Cuz it's over.
I send you.

One more goodbye.
(This is our last goodbye.)
This is the last letter I write.
One more goodbye.
You can forget about it.
You can just forget about it.

Let me tell you a story about a man
Who's falling down.
And how he fell form glory on his own.
Let me tell you a story about a man who's in between.
In the end, we stand alone.

One more goodbye.
One more goodbye.
(This is our last goodbye.)
This is the last letter I write.
One more goodbye.
You can forget about it.
You can just forget about... 

One more goodbye.
(This is our last goodbye.)
One more goodbye.
(This is our last goodbye.)
One more goodbye.
You can forget about it.
You can just forget about what we had.---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
