Turn back on the broken heartache
Somethings are just meant to be
I still believe that we got a chance
Still believe that we got a chance to be

To much is never enough
An too little is never enough
Full speed got me looking out my rearveiw
I can't go back

Goin 100 in a 55 and I don't know why
I'm still alive but I do what I can
But I know I can't take anymore

I still believe in this Rock 'n Roll
And I pray the music gonna save my soul
But til then I still believe 
Somethings are just meant to be

Its messed up but I got this mission
Drunk again wont remember anyway
She said its just a game boy
Dont be gone, dont be gone for long

10 years I've been doing this forever
Its all I know, baby, please dont turn away
I know you dont believe in me
But I do believe in you

Go 100 in a 55 and I don't know why
I'm still alive but I do what I can
but I know I can't take anymore

I still believe in this Rock 'n Roll
And I pray the music gonna save my soul
But til then I still believe 
Somethings are just meant to be

Im still fallen away from here
Away from here, I'm still fallen
The weight is fallen off
I can't go back, I'm in to deep

Goin' 100 in a 55 and I don't know why
I'm still alive but I do what I can 
But I know I can't take anymore

I still believe in this Rock 'n Roll
And I pray the music gonna save my soul
But til then I still believe 
Somethings...

Go 100 in a 55 and I don't know why
I'm still alive but I do what I can
But I know I can't take anymore
I can't take no more

I still believe in this Rock 'n Roll
And I pray the music gonna save my soul
But til then I still believe 
Somethings are just meant to be

And I still believe somethings are just meant to be

I still believe somethings are just meant to be

I still believe somethings are just meant to be---Lyrics submitted by April.
