It was a relic of another time
plundered from an ancient tomb
wrought by forgotten arts
inscribed with cryptic runes

They called us fierce marauders
Warp riders and guns for hire
before the sky cried tears of fire

Looking out across the void
we beheld a fearsome sight
Two armadas arrayed before us
preparing to unleash their might

The Lady kept her promise
We heard the sound of a cosmic choir
the night the sky cried tears of fire

This is the hour of the Phoenix
when all must be reborn in flame
and though they did not know it
nothing could remain the same

The captain has his vengeance
aw we drift through a sea of pyres
The stars will always remember
when the sky cried tears of fire---Lyrics submitted by Dan.
