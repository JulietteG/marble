Goodnight soldier wherever you may be,
My hearts lonely without you,
Goodnight soldier perhaps our reveille,
Find's me dreaming about you.

Someday skies will change to blue,
Smiles will lighten sorrow,
Goodnight soldier angels walk with you,
Keep you through each tomorrow.

Goodnight soldier wherever you may be,
My hearts lonely without you,
Goodnight soldier perhaps our reveille,
Find's me dreaming about you.

Someday skies will change to blue,
Smiles will lighten sorrow,
Goodnight soldier angels walk with you,
Keep you through each tomorrow.

Goodnight.---Lyrics submitted by Jud.
