I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
I wanna learn to rope and ride
I wanna ride through the
plains and the desert
Out west of the Great Divide

I wanna hear the coyotes singing
As the sun sets in the west
I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life I love the best

I wanna ride a paint move it at a run
I wanna feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles away from all
Movin' in the cowman's face

I wanna lay my head beneath the open sky
As the sun sets in the west
I wanna strum my guitar and yodel-le-hee
That's the life I love the best---Lyrics submitted by ginger.
