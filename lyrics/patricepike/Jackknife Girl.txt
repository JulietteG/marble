They were a hopeful couple in a broke down world
He was a gentleman boy she was a jackknife girl
He held her hand like it'd never go away
She made love like molasses on a hot summer day

Pre-chorus
They hopeful cry when love is lost
It's damage done like fire
Cause we fight like children
And we leave like the wind
Burning in this thing desire

Save my soul
I've been waiting (x2)

London, England in the Camden Lock
A man selling Memphis from a sidewalk shop
He held his head winking and the jackknife girl
What's a girl to do in this broke down world

Pre-chorus

Save my soul
I've been waiting
Save my soul,
Save my soul

Bridge
What the girl don't know
What the boy can't say
Now she's a photograph from a long past day
When the hearts were young, and they almost did
Well you'll be the same, honey I almost did

Save my soul (x4)

They were a hopeful couple in a broke down world
He was a gentleman boy she was a jackknife girl---Lyrics submitted by Katy Kephart.
