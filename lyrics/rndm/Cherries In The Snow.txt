Did I thank you
For coming here to visit me
I've been lonely
Up all night
Every night

You're my witness
Everything I've ever owned
It's in boxes
It's all done
Just skin and bones

My favorite lipstick
It's called cherries in the snow
There will be footprints
Everywhere
You'll ever go

This is over when the Saints
Are gone
And they tell me that I'm late
Coming home
So look at me when the fades
Are throwing stones
And I talk to you
From the cherries in the snow
From the cherries in the snow

I wasn't a singer
I could sing with you right now
I'll be wait you
Every chance
Every chance

You're my witness
Everything I've ever owned
It's in boxes
It's all done
Just skin and bones

This is over when the Saints
Are gone
And they tell me that I'm late
Coming home
There will be footprints
Everywhere
You'll ever go
I'll be talking to you
From the cherries in the snow
From the cherries in the snow
From the cherries in the snow---Lyrics submitted by Antonio Cola.
