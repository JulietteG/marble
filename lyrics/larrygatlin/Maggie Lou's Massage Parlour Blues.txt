He sweeps up the butts, and the beer cans
And old newspapers, where his name just ain't makin' headlines anymore
Into the dustpan, then into the trashcan
That sits outside Maggie Lou's massage parlor door
He was once the Lonestar Cowboy, the leader of the Stardust Cowboy Band 
But the big time got to him, 'cause everybody tried to screw him
So he traded his guitar in for a broom
And an old cowboy starred dustpan

Just one who paid his dues, but couldn't win for losing
Chapter One in Maggie Lou's massage parlor blues

hmmm mmmm mmmm

The cowboy says hi to the rich man
With diamond rings on both hands
Who'se walking through Maggie Lou's massage parlor door
To get someone to rub his body, and God he would be if heaven was money
But all his money don't mean much anymore
He's got a purty young wife with no life,
No love left in her for him, so now he's chasing something he'll never find
Just hoping that those two gentle hands
Rubbing on his body, will rub away the pains in his heart
And the fear that's creeping in his mind

Paying his dues wasn't very hard, 'cause he paid them all back Americard
Chapter Two in Maggie Lou's massage parlor blues

hmmm mmmm mmmm

The rich man says hi to Suzi, whose sitting there on the sofa
With her hair dyed black as midnight, and her lips dyed red as wine
He couldn't tell by looking, after all her years of hookin'
But she was once sweet as a berry, just now picked from the vine
She was once real big in Vegas, now she's big in all the wrong places
So she's turned to doing other things, to brighten up a feller's day
She'll give you added pleasure, if the dollars at your leisure
By tryin' awful hard to rub you, the right way

Oh she's always made a living, by lovin' if the money was givin'
