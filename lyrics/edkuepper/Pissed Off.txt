It sure looks like a change has come,
Everything I loved is gone, just taken away,
I'm walking backwards, can't you see,
Just trying to get the things back that I didn't mean,
Your house burned down, no friend around,
You confidence shook to the ground, shook to the ground.

After all that's left to say, wasn't I pissed off today?
After all that's left to say, wasn't I pissed off today?

I said...

Perfect love you'd like to be, 
But if a mind is sure to see where I went wrong,
But am I human, you ask me, 
Sensitive to questions that you ask of me,
But there's one thing now my baby child, 
I'll never be afraid to cry, afraid to cry.

After all that's left to say, wasn't I pissed off today?
After all that's left to say, wasn't I pissed off today?

I said...

Sure looks like a change has come,
Everything I loved is gone, just taken away,
I'm walking backwards, can't you see,
Just trying to get the things back that I didn't mean
Your house burned down, no friend around,
You confidence shook to the ground, shook to the ground

After all that's left to say, wasn't I pissed off today?
After all that's left to say, wasn't I pissed off today?---Lyrics submitted by Bruce.
