Tammy:
Before things got to such a delicate place
Before those sad reflections on your face
I always thought that when it was over
You'd be kind enough to let me know

Joe:
Well I'll admit that there's a distance
And we're both afraid to let it show

Tammy:
But you've had a lifetime coming to me
And I'm not about to let you go

Both:
Two people living in glass houses
We can't hide what we;re going through
Some of the things that we've been clinging to 
Tammy: Aren't what they're supposed to be
Two people living in glass houses
We've got a fragile world at stake
It only takes one careless word to break it into a million memories

Joe:
We used to lock our worries inside
Somehow we took it all in stride
But all the walls we built around us 
Couldn't keep us from drifting apart
Seems like everywhere we turn now
Somehow there's something in our way

Both:
Two people living in glass houses
We can't hide what we're going through
Some of the things that we've been clinging to 
Tammy: Are there for all the world to see
Two people living in glass houses
We've got a fragile world at stake
It only takes one careless word to break it into a million memories---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
