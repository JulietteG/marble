Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me

Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be going away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E-double L for me
Oh I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E

Watch him smile he thinks it's christmas or his fifth birthday
and he think C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurting words 
And turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek

Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be going away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E-double L for me
Oh I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
