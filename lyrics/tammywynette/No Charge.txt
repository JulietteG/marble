My Little girl came up to me  in the kitchen this evening,
while I was fixin supper, and she handed me a piece of paper
she had been writing on and 
after wiping my hands on my apron, I read it
and this is what it said,

For mowing the yard $5
For making my own bed this week  $1
For going to the store .50cents
For playing with  lil sister while you went to the store .25cents
For taking out the trash $1.
getting a good report card $5.
and for raking the yard $2.
A total of $ 14.75

Well,  I looked at her standing there expectantly, 
and a thousand memories flashed through my mind,
and so I picked up a pin and turning the paper over,
this is what I wrote,

For the 9 months I carried you, growing inside me, NO CHARGE
For the nights I spent I'd spent up with  you, doctored you,  prayed for you NO CHARGE
and for the toys, food and clothes, and for wiping your nose, there's NO CHARGE
When you add it all up, the full cost of my love is
NO CHARGE

Well, when she finished reading, she had great big ole tears in her eyes,  and she looked up at me and said,
Mommie, I sure do love you 
then she took the pin and in great big  letters she wrote,  Pain In Full,
When You Add It All Up, 
The cost of real love is NO CHARGE---Lyrics submitted by Tammy.
