Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doin'
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
For I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house
It makes my mommy cry
Cause when she played house my Daddy said good-bye

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house my Daddy said good-bye---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
