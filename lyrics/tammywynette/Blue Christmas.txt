I'll have a blue christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinkin' about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not hear with me

I'll have a blue christmas That's certain
and when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
