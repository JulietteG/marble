Wish that I was on old Rocky Top 
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky top
Ain't no telephone bills

Once I had a man on Rocky Top
Half bear, the other half cat
Wild as mink, but sweet as soda pop
And I still dream about that

Rocky Top you will always be home sweet home to me
Good Ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top Tennessee
Aiyee

Once two strangers climbed Ole Rocky Top
A-Looking for a moonshine still
They ain't ever left Ole Rocky Top
I bet they never will

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
The dirts too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Gets their corn from jars

Rocky Top you will always be home sweet home to me
Good Ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top Tennessee---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
