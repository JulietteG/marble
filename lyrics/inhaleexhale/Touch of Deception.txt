So let's be honest for one moment.
Pretend that everything went smooth as planned. 
"deciever," "stabbed me in the back," can't seem to find my words. 
Where will this lead to?
End in hate?
The feelings of the past and everything attached. 

Far beyond here.
The touch of deception.
Always remember the reason you live and there's someone who's watching your back. 

Whatch your Back (Whispers) You'll Never Make It

He taught us to forgive but we forget to let things go.
Attached to everything we know.
This thrill to leave it all behind.
A place where joy was as rare as gold and doubt then stalked my heart. 
And passion followed close behind, scared stiff of failure alone. 


Far beyond here.
The touch of deception.
Always remember the reason you live and there's someone who's watching your back. 

Far beyond here.
The touch of deception.
Always remember the reason you live and there's someone who's watching your back.
