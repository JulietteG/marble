I know i'm still young
But I know how I feel
I might not have too much experience
But I know when love is real
By the way my heart starts pounding
When i look into your eyes
I might look a little silly
Standing with my arms streched open wide

(Chorus)
I love you this big
Eyes have never seen.. This big
No ones ever dreamed.. This big
And i'll spend the rest of my life
explaining what words cannont desrcibe, but i'll try.
I love you this big

I'll love you to the moon and back
I'll love you all the time
Deeper than the ocean
And higher then the pines
Cause girl you do something to me
Deep down in my heart
I know I look a little crazy 
standing with my arms streched all apart

(Chorus)
I love you this big
Eyes have never seen.. This big
No ones ever dreamed.. This big
And i'll spend the rest of my life
explaining what words cannont desrcibe, but i'll try.
I love you this big

So much bigger
Then I ever dreamed
My heart ever would
I love you this big

And I'd write your name in stars 
across the sky if I could
I would

(Chorus)
I love you this big
Oh eyes have never seen.. This big
No ones ever dreamed.. This big
And i'll spend the rest of my life
explaining what words cannont desrcibe, but i'll try.
I love you this big

(Chorus)
I love you this big
Oh eyes have never seen.. This big
No ones ever dreamed.. This big
And i'll spend the rest of my life
explaining what words cannont desrcibe, but i'll try.
I love you this big---Lyrics submitted by Michaela.
