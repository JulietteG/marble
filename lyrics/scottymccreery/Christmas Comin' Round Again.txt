Two brothers not speaking for two years now
Can't even remember what they're fighting about
It might be the snow falling or the glow of those lights
But they both say "I'm sorry" and end up talking all night

Hallelujah! There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah! It's time to let go and let the love in
Christmas is comin' 'round again

There's a mom and a daddy, split up last July
Two houses, three kids now they're splitting up time
Comes over for dinner, ends up sticking around
Round the table they're laughing
Hey, they might work it out

Hallelujah! There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah! It's time to let go and let the love in
Christmas is comin' 'round again

Oh there's something 'bout this time of year
 It makes you wanna start living right now, right here

He opens the door and walks inside
The choir is singing "Silent Night" 
Hadn't been in this place since he turned 18 
Heard the story of a baby, born a king
Sent here to save us from everything
It hit him straight in his heart and he fell to his knees

Hallelujah! There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah! It's time to let go and let the love in

Hallelujah! There's forgiveness in the wind
Hallelujah! It's time to let go and let the love in 
Christmas is comin' 'round again 
Christmas is comin' 'round again---Lyrics submitted by Jacquelyn.
