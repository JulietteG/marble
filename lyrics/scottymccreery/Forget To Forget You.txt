If you see my number on your phone when you pick it up
Or get a good morning text when you're wakin' up
Or see my truck drivin' by at the end of the day
If you get a letter in the mail from me now and then
Or find a note on your door from me checkin' in
If I send you a rose or a whole bouquet
Well, pay no mind
I just forget to forget you sometimes

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a habit, I can break it
I can shake it, I can make it on my own
Ain't like I really care or I miss you
Or it matters or I wish you weren't gone
Don't think I'm that God
I gotta get you back
Probably never gonna get over you kind
I just forget to forget you sometimes

I wish you would've caught me out rockin' last night
Instead of catchin' me sittin' through this green light
Baby, I was on a roll 'til I heard that song
It ain't nothin' but a ghost then it's gone again
Ain't like I'm still stuck in what could 'a been
Every part of me wants to be movin' on
Except the back of my mind
It just forgets to forget you sometimes

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a habit, I can break it
I can shake it, I can make it on my own
Ain't like I really care or I miss you
Or it matters or I wish you weren't gone
Don't think I'm that God
I gotta get you back
Probably never gonna get over you kind
I just forget to forget you sometimes
Sometimes

It ain't nothin' but a habit, I can break it
I can shake it, I can make it on my own
It ain't like I really care or I miss you
Or it matters or I wish you weren't gone
Don't think I'm that so lost without you
Every thought's about you
Holdin' onto somethin'
That's never gonna happen
God, I gotta get you back
Probably never gonna get over you kind
No, it's just that I
Forget to forget you sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, I forget to forget you sometimes---
