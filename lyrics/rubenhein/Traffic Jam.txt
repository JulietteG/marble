Funny how I cannot get a grip
Why there is a traffic jam in my head?
Not much to do
Even the sun comes through
My mum will say better stay in bed

You had at hello
And you make my world go slow
Thou it can't be you causing all this delay
I know road work is ahead but I close my eyes instead
Dreaming is not you, cause you are way
You are way

So funny how I cannot get a grip, why?
I've got a traffic jam in my head

There's a road block and all traffic stops x2

I know road work is ahead but I close my eyes instead
Dreaming is not you, cause you are way
You are way

So funny how I cannot get a grip, why?
There is a traffic jam in my head

There's a road block and all traffic stops X2
