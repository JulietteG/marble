That's all I wanted
Something special
Something sacred
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
Maybe this time is for ever
Say it can be

That's all you wanted
Something special
Someone sacred
In your life
Just for one moment
To be bold and naked
At my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
But something tells me together we'd be happy

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hands in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I've had enough of crying
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

That's all I wanted
Sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's blue eyed shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hands in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I've had enough of crying
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

If you are the desert
I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger
Hunger for me
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be

So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared but left us to crie
Beautiful darling, don't think of me

I will be a father figure
I will be a father figure
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time---
