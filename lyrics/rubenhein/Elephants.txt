The elephants left 
Through a hole in the wall 
And it can't be right to pretend 
That it all didn't happen 
Because it did 

She turned away and nobody spoke 
Of the china and windows 
The elephants broke 
Just silence, and that's it 

And it seems that we both forgot 
We try to be something we are not 
But tonight we were shown the truth 
'Cause that's what elephants do 
Oh, we're so mistaken 

We cover the mess with small talk 
And we can't even see 
It's our own heart that is breaking 
Breaking the rules 

The elephants will come back 
And they sure don't like to be ignored 
Like they have been before 
Like a bunch of fools 

And it seems that we both forgot 
We try to be something we are not 
But if we can't live with the truth 
The elephants cannot live too 
And elephants die alone 

And elephants die alone... X3

So let us start to remember 
All the things that we want to do 
We should just skip the food over candlelight 
I know I want to crush all the tables with you 
I want to dance just like elephants do 
I want to break everything 
That I once held for a place that is home 
Now I know that it's you 
That is home
Oh now I know that it's you---Lyrics submitted by Frankie Bloise.
