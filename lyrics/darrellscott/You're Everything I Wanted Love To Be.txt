There's a sadness, and I've heard it in the breeze.
There's a sorrow, in the falling of the leaves.
There's an emptiness when you live your life alone.
I'm so glad my lonely days and nights are gone.

Now and then, someone special comes along.
Now and then, someone brings you happy songs.
Now it's love I'm hearing in the morning breeze.
Oh, your everything I wanted love to be.

And I'll love you, 'till the closing of our day's.
And yes I'll need you. Through the valleys and the shadows, and the highways.
And we'll put our feet upon the path of life, and it's byways.

In the morning, when I wake up by your side.
In the evening, as we stand against the tide.
Every hour that your with me I can see.
Your every thing I wanted love to be.
Yes you are,
Everything I wanted love to be.---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
