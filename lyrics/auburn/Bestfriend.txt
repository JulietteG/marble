[Verse 1:]
The thought of this is killing me, it's been on my mind
Can't believe it's been right here after all this time
And even though I love you I can't seem to find someone who cares the way you do
You know, I love the way we've always been nothing more than friends
So why do I give every man the stand up
Thought I was over this but once again I'm comparing you to him
And I find that there's no you in him that matters

[Chorus:]
Boy even though your my best friend
I can't help it whenever I compare you to him
It's like I always do this
With every single man
And I hate that I can't find someone who's worth my time
Just like my best friend

[Verse 2:]
And I know you hear me say this all the time
I don't do relationships cause I'm on my grind
But see a part of it's
Because I just can't find someone who knows me like you do
Always brought out the good in me
Don't know just what you say
Whatever it is, no other guy has even tried
Remember when you left one day and turned around and say "you're my best friend"
"You're my best friend"
And right there you made me cry

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'm trying to let you know
A part of me just can't let this go
Never had a friend and it might have been
With you it so different yeah
I don't know whatchu did
But I know whatever it is
I'm so grateful for you
I'm so grateful for you

[Chorus]---
