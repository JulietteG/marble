[Intro (Auburn):]
I'm sorry, daddy I'm sorry I'm sorry, daddy I'm sorry I'm sorry, daddy I'm sorry Oh ooh oh ooooh

[Verse 1:]
Lately, we've been spending time with eachother and baby I must admit I'm catching feelings for you it's crazy
You got my heart racing, can't express my pain I can't let nobody know, (nobody know)
I was sneaking, tryin to find excuses just to cover our creeping I told my family I'm with my girls for the weekend,
so you wouldn't see them I bet you they were wonderin' if I were in your arm

[Chorus:]
Because the way it felt when I was by your side
Made me believe you was so good and must be right (I couldn't see me without you)
Wanted to break the news so bad but didn't think they'd understand
Wut we had in between us if, it's more than a crush thought I was in love
So daddy don't be mad at me I knew you never stood me wrong but you didn't know what's going on
Wanted to speak up but it's just if, it's more than a crush thought I was in love
So daddy don't be mad at me

[Verse 2: (Painful)]
Something, like an arrow to my heart was unable
To show him off to the whole world was my angel, laid it all on the table
And found myself running back to him in a rush, started missing
Everything about him daddy I should of listened
When you said baby girl I think you should end this (I thought the division)
Cuz I was tired of keeping him myself

[Chorus:]
Because the way it felt when I was by your side
Made me believe you was so good and must be right
Wanted to break the news so bad but didn't think they'd understand
Wut we had in between us if, it's more than a crush thought I was in love
So daddy don't be mad at me I knew you never stood me wrong but you didn't know what's going on
Wanted to speak up but it's just if, it's more than a crush thought I was in love
So daddy don't be mad at me ---Lyrics submitted by Ryhan SoExrah Smith.
