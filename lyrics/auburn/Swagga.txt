Stilletoes on my feet
Jeans hug my thighs
My LRG made her roll her eyes
She looked at me then at her guy, she tries to leave
While he asks why

This is just anotha day where
Insercurity leads a girl to hate
But it's a fact
You know my swagga so natural
It's so unethical, they can't let it go

And they ask how you get like that
Girl, how you get them jeans to fit like that
How you get them custom made kicks like that
All I can tell em' is, It's like that

And they ask how I get like that
How you make the v.I.p list like that
How you get yo hair to curl and twist like that
Now they askin how you make that hit like that?

You see the tank top
Matchin with the waist drop
Complimentary to the jewels that I just kopped
You can't say that you got the ish that I rock
I know for a fact cause it ain't off the block
But...

This is just anotha day where
Insercurity leads a girl to hate
But it's a fact
You know my swagga so natural
It's so unethical, they can't let it go

And they ask how you get like that
Girl, how you get them jeans to fit like that
How you get them custom made kicks like that
All I can tell em' is, It's like that

And they ask how I get like that
How you make the v.I.p list like that
How you get yo hair to curl and twist like that
Now they askin how you make that hit like that?

And they ask how you get like that
Girl, how you get them jeans to fit like that
How you get them custom made kicks like that
All I can tell em' is, It's like that

And they ask how I get like that
How you make the v.I.p list like that
How you get yo hair to curl and twist like that
Now they askin how you make that hit like that?

S-w-a- double g-a
It's to bold
You can't eva say you got those
Please girl don't hate
Cause they not yours, Not yours

S-w-a- double g-a
It's to bold
You can't eva say you got those
Please girl don't hate
Cause they not yours, Not yours

And they ask how you get like that
Girl, how you get them jeans to fit like that
How you get them custom made kicks like that
All I can tell em' is, It's like that

And they ask how I get like that
How you make the v.I.p list like that
How you get yo hair to curl and twist like that
Now they askin how you make that hit like that? ---Lyrics submitted by summer leon.
