I, am thinking it's a sign,
that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images 
and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned.
And I, Have to speculate
that god himself did make us into corresponding shapes
like puzzle pieces from the clay.
And true, It may seem like a stretch,
but it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head
when you're away when I am missing you to death.
When you, are out there on the road,
for several weeks it shows and when you scan the radio,
I hope this song will guide you home.

Chorus:

They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now, they'll say..
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now,
But we'll stay..

I, tried my best to leave
this all on your machine,
but the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listening,
And that, frankly will not fly,
You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows,
with the windows down, when this is guiding you home.

2 x's Chorus:
