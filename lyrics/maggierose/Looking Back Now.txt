Looking back now, I probably should've let him run

He smelled like gin with a hint of her
Up 'til then I wasn't sure
But he swaggered by and said "The boys said to tell you hey"
And I was kicked back in his easy chair
Holding a fifth tapping the barrel
Of a fresh cleaned steel blue polished up .38
And I was kind of hoping he'd at least look scared
But all he said was "Okay, she was good and you don't dare"

Looking back now I probably should've let him run
Paybacks are hell where I come from
And any fool should now
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holding whiskey and a gun

Well the sun shines gray in the prison yard
Life to go was going hard
When the warden started getting sweet on me
And he dragged me to his room one night
And poured me some 'skey gave me a light
And I smoked slow and waited 'til he was done
And I thought that was that 'til he got rough and I fought back
And when I grabbed his pistol he laughed and said
"Girl you ain't got the guts"

Looking back now I probably should've let him run
Paybacks are hell where I come from
And any fool should now
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holding whiskey and a gun
Whiskey and a gun

They're strapping me down and I'm scared to die
Now I ain't the kind of girl to cry
But I find myself begging God for mercy
My hands are cold as I start to slip
Sodium theopentol drips
The room goes black and I wonder if He heard me

Looking back now I probably should've let 'em run
I bet paybacks are hell there where I'm goin'
But any fool should know
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holdin' whiskey and a gun
Whiskey and a gun
Whiskey and a gun
Whiskey and a gun---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
