I hear about all I'm good for
is spouting off lines of love
cause i have been saving those fears
for another set of ears
as lonely and naive as mine

if its addiction you want
well, you got it
they dont come more addicted than me
a couple pills to help me think
and pour some whisky in my drink
and I'll pray that your the one that keeps me from my dreams

[chours]
cause my dear you're too good to be
I cant find better reasons for loosing some sleep
just save me a place between your sheets
and I'll let you make a mess out of me

and I'm down for loving those lies
if you can tell them the way I tell mine
just leave some poison from your kiss
to do its work upon my lips
and this boy will grace a slow death
with a smile

if its addiction you want
well, you got it
they dont come more addicted than me
a couple pills to get me through
cause its all that i can do
while I'll pray that you're the one that keeps me from my dreams

[chours]
cause my dear you're too good to be
I cant find better reasons for loosing some sleep
just save me a place between your sheets
and I'll let you make a mess out of me (x2)

I'll let you make a mess out of me
..i'll let you make a mess out of me
i'll let you make a mess out of me---
