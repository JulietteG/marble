Yo heh heh tell him its like uhh you know uhh
Sweet sweet tell him

Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer Ill envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause hes all that I got and
Tell him...

Tell him I need him [yeah]
Tell him I love him [tell him]
And itll be alright
*background singing* telll himmm be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Itll be alright

Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know Im imperfect [i know Im imperfect]
& not without sin [& not without sin]
But now that Im older all childish things end
And tell him...

Tell him I need him [yeah]
Tell him I love him [tell him]
And itll be alright
*background singing* telll himmm be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Itll be alright

Bridge
Ill never be jealous
And I wont be too kind
Cause love is not boastful
Oooh and loveis not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everythings gonna be alright [w/ adlibs]
Oooh oooh yeah yeah aww yeah

Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth? 
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him...

Tell him I need him [yeah]
Tell him I love him [tell him]
And itll be alright
*background singing* telll himmm be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Itll be alright---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
