Don't say goodbye, don't even try
For you are my love, the only love I'm dreaming of
Don't say goodbye, you make me cry
For you are my thrill, the only thrill, I'll tell you why

I'll miss a kiss such as this
In the middle of the night
Oh don't you know that your touch means so much
When you're holding me tight

Don't say goodbye, I told you why
Can't you see you're meant for me?
Don't say goodbye
(Don't ever say goodbye) ---Lyrics submitted by bill diamond.
