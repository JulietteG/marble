I wish I was on yonder hill 
'Tis there I'd sit and cry my fill, 
Til every tear would turn a mill, 
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan

I'll sell my rod, I'll sell my reel, 
I'll sell my only spinning wheel, 
To buy my love a sword of steel 
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan.
[chorus]

[chorus]
Siuil, siuil, siuil a run,
Siuil go sochair agus siuil go ciuin
Siuil go doras agus ealaigh lion
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan


I'll dye my petticoats, I'll dye them red, 
And 'round the world I'll beg my bread, 
Until my parents shall wish me dead, 
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan.
[chorus]

But now my love has gone to France, 
To try his fortune to advance; 
If he e'er comes back, 'tis but a chance, 
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan
[chorus x2]


Translation:

Siuil, siuil, siuil a run,				Walk, walk, walk, O love,
Siuil go sochair agus siuil go ciuin			Walk quickly to me, softly move;
Siuil go doras agus ealaigh lion			Walk to the door, and away well flee,
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan			And safe may my darling be.---Lyrics submitted by Brent.
