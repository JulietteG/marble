Sleep, O babe, for the red bee hums 
The silent twilight's fall. 
Aoibheall from the grey rock comes 
To wrap the world in thrall. 
O, leanbhan, O my child, my joy, 
My love and heart's desire. 
The crickets sing you lullaby 
Beside the dying fire. 

Dusk is drawn and the Green Man's thorn 
Is wreathed in rings of fog. 
Siabhra sails his boat 'till morn 
Upon the starry bog. 
O, leanbhan, O the pally moon 
Hath brimmed her cusp in dew 
And weeps to hear the sad sleep tune 
I sing, my love, to you. 

Sleep, O babe, for the red bee hums 
The silent twilight's fall. 
Aoibheall from the grey rock comes 
To wrap the world in thrall. 
O, leanbhan, O my child, my joy, 
My love and heart's desire. 
The crickets sing you lullaby 
Beside the dying fire.---Lyrics submitted by Mary Smith.
