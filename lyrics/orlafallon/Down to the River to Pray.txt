As I went down in the river to pray,
studying about that good old way
and who shall wear the starry crown.
Good Lord, show me the way.

Oh, sisters lets go down, 
lets go down, come on down.
Oh, sisters lets go down, 
down in the river to pray.

As I went down in the river to pray, 
studying about that good old way 
and who shall wear the robe and crown. 
Good Lord, show me the way.

Oh, Mothers lets go down, 
come on down, 
don't you wanna go down? 
Oh Mothers lets go down, 
down int he river to pray.

As I went down in the river to pray, 
studying about that good old way 
and who shall wear the starry crown. 
Good Lord show me the way.
Oh, fathers lets go down.
lets go down, come on down.
Oh fathers lets go down, 
down in the river to pray

As I went down in the river to pray, 
studying about that good old way 
and who shall wear the robe and crown.
Good Lord show me the way.---Lyrics submitted by co ropes.
