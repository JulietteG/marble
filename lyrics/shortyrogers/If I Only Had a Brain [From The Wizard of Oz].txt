I could while away the hours, conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain.
And my head I'd be scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain.

I'd unravel every riddle for any individ'le, 
In trouble or in pain.
With the thoughts I'll be thinkin' you could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain.

Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore.
I could think of things I never thunk before.
And then I'd sit, and think some more.

I would not be just a nothin' my head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain.
And perhaps I'd deserve ya', and be even worthy of  ya',
If I only had a brain.---Lyrics submitted by Diane.
