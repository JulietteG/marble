When I saw your eyes
My heart slipped inside you
Our blood mixed to a fever
A candle in the sky

Through trials and tides
I'll stand beside you
The father of the sea holds
The mother of the light

All through the night, we've been feeding
The binding fire that warms us
And brings us to the light
We burn through the night

The darkest of May
Our seeds of July
The storm of September
Brought us to the fight

All that remains
Is all that there can be
The spirits guard our children
In living golden light

All through the night, we've been feeding
The binding fire that warms us
And brings us to the light
We burn through the night

All through the night, we've been feeding
The binding fire that warms us
And brings us to the light
We burn through the night---Lyrics submitted by lachlanrdale.
