All consuming fire burn.

Lord ignite the rage(ignite the rage).
Flowing through me.
Hear your spoken words(your spoken words).
Consume me oh Lord.

Release my selfishness(my selfishness).
We hold this unto you (unto you)
We battle through our days of irony.
Close your eyes.
Yet, we never felt an ounce of pain.
Until now.
We battle through our days of irony.
Close your eyes.
Yet, we never felt an ounce of pain.

All consuming fire burn
All consuming fire burn

Straight to the heart 
All consuming fire burn
God give me strength.
River of life 
All consuming fire burn
flow through my veins.

I exalt your name(exalt your name).
Hold on to me. I'll never let go(never let go).
Consume me Lord.

Yeah!
OH!

We battle through our days of irony.
Close your eyes.
Yet, we never felt an ounce of pain.
Until now.
We battle through our days of irony.
Close your eyes.
Yet, we never felt an ounce of pain.

Yeah!

All consuming fire burn.
All consuming fire burn.
All consuming fire burn.
All consuming fire burn.---Lyrics submitted by Alberto.
