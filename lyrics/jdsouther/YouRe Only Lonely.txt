When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed
You're only lonely

When you need somebody around
On the nights to try you
Bring 'em to me, I was there when
you were a queen
And I'll be the last one there beside you
So you can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed
You're only lonely

When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you
So don't you ever be ashamed
When you're only lonely
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
When you're only lonely
It's no crime
Darling, we've got lots of time
Oh, you're only lonely
Oh, you're only lonely
No, there's nothing wrong with you
Darling, I get lonely too
Oh, you're only lonely
Oh, you're only lonely
So if you need me
All you gotta do is call me
You're only lonely...---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
