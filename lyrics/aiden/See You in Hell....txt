DIE!!
So now the lights flash white and all you see is anger get up.
Was your life worth it?
Were you content?
Could you make everything feel perfect in your own head?

But now after all,
can you just forget?
But now after all,
what do you got to show for it?

To darkness,
to suffer,
when I fall.
I will see you in hell.2x

DIE!!

Theres no second chance to write away that anger take it.
I felt comfort in this broken glass,
were soaked in ash,
would you catch me if I fell hurting.

But now after all,
can you just forget?
But now after all,
what do you got to show for it?

To darkness,
to suffer,
when I fall.
I will see you in hell.2x

When youre broken,
youre beat down.
See you in hell now see you in hell now. 3x

DIE!!

So heres my last goodbye,
this nightmare ends youre asleep now get up.
I set my friends on fire,
I know Ive lost control,
I see youve lost your smile as this life takes its toll

But now after all,
can you just forget?
But now after all,
what do you got to show for it?

To darkness,
to suffer,
when I fall.
I will see you in hell.2x

You won't be there when I call,
I will see you in hell

To darkness,
to suffer,
when I fall.
I will see you in hell. 2x---Lyrics submitted by Xante.
