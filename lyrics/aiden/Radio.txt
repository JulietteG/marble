shaking like a dog shitting razor blades
waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me
I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved 
While you' re taking your time with apologies
I'm making my plans for revenge 
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong 
I'd drive straight off the edge 
I'd drive straight off the edge 

Taking your own life with boredom, 
I'm taking my own life with wine
it helps you to rule out the sorrow, 
it helps me to empty my mind 
Making the most of a bad time 
I'm smoking the brains from my head 
Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red 

I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling 
In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying 
I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you, 
plugged in and ready to fall 
plugged in and ready to fall 
plugged in and ready to fall---
