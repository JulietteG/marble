You can illustrate your life in romance.
But I can show you something so much more than words, in my hands.
It's not your best intention now to burn your friends. This is your last night, this is your last chance in my hands.

(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we fall asleep.
(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we die complete.
(Die romantic, romantic)
Tonight's the night and it's all we need now, to die romantic.

I sat and watched your heartbeat fade with every breath, i watched your lips turn blue.Your eyes went cold and all, with all the rest.
I felt the panic and tried to breathe, is this happening?
I've fucking had it, God Save her please, 'cause I don't think she'll make it through the night.

(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we fall asleep.
(Die romantic, romantic)
This is the nightmare we die complete.
(Die romantic, romantic)
Tonight's the night and it's all we need now, to die romantic.

Your last words to me "Tonight's the night" meant redemption is only found in books."
Your last words to me "Tonight's the night" meant redemption was harder than it looks."
So take care of what you love and all this stuff are remnants of a life in shattered glass.
It's all I have to ask.

I MISS YOU!
I MISS YOU!

You can illustrate your death in romance I can show you something so much more than words in my hands.
I felt the dead-end price you pay for everyday
This is your last night,
Suicide kept tight
Your gone tonight.

Die romantic romantic
This is the nightmare we fall asleep.
Die romantic, romantic
This is the nightmare we die complete.
Die romantic, romantic
Tonights the night and its all we need now, to die romantic.
