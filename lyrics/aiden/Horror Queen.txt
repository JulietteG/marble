She wrote this symphony with a plastic sin
And striking pale blue eyes
It's your dead skin and my last sunrise
Glorify this cemetery vision
Usher me from this life
I want to see your crimson version of hell

Horror, eternally idolize
Horror, sell your soul for lies
Horror, We've got just one last chance to shine
Horror, I know my horror queen won't let me down tonight

Walk alone a cemetery version of a mile
Hang your skin on nails 
And her vicious smile
Glorify this cemetery
I want to see your crimson vision of hell

You walk beyond the grave awake
I walk beyond the grave and wait---Lyrics submitted by serena.
