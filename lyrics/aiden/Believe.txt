Lying face down, lying face down
In the gutter now so damn proud.
Well I know, I know, I know
It's my fault, it's my fault.
Lying face down, lying face down.
In the gutter now so damn proud
Well I know, I know, I know
It's my fault, it's my fault.

In a world where we all just waste away,
in a place you cry for today.
We're all going back.

Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.

Lying face down, lying face down,
In the underground so damn proud
Well I know, I know, I know.
It's my fault, it's my fault.

In a world where we all just waste away,
in a place you cry for today.
We're all being brainwashed.

Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.

Love silence and fade away.
Darkness, darkness indicate.
Scarlet kiss and what to say.
Darkness, darkness indicate.
Love silence and fade away.
Darkness, darkness indicate.
Scarlet kiss and what to say.
Darkness, darkness indicate.

Believe, believe, believe in me.
Believe, believe, believe in me.

Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
Believe, believe, believe in me.
I will follow.
Believe, believe, believe in me.---Lyrics submitted by Amii.
