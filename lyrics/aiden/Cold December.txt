those nights we walked together
i couldnt sleep
i still remember what you wore, now
it was the cold decemder air,
the way the rain hit your hair, but then
i woke up from a dream i cant repaire
and then realized how far i've finally come
well the damage thats been made
the hurt i've caused can never be erased 
only until now, can we dissappear
now?

i walked aline some nights
thinking of those times
we laid your soul to rest
this disallusion comforts me
i'll wait for you sometimes
but always feel my life is flashing way too fast
never had a second chance
from when was my place branded
faithless lost,
again
faithless was my friend


i will never trust and lable death as my only defese
i will never love again---
