Baby, (ba-da-da-da)
Now that I've found you,
I can't let you go,
(Ba-da-da),
Build my world around you,
I need you so,
(Oooh)
Baby, even though,
You don't need me,
You don't need me,

Baby, baby since first we met,
I knew in this heart of mine,
(I wanna tell you)
The love we had,
Could not be bad,
I played it right,
And bide my time,

All my life I've waited for somebody,
To give me love like you,
Now you tell me that you wanna leave me,
(Darlin' I just can't let you)
