The sign of horns is 666
 Swear to the lord in 666

The prophecy of unborn child
 Heir of throne the antichrist
 Time will come and blood will rain
 Forward to the sacrifice
 Light shall break in your eyes
 Altar awaits your blood runs fuckin' slow
 Your god is dead

Hatespawn
 Submit to death
 My mission comes to an end
 The prophecy of unborn child
 Heir of throne the antichrist
 Altar awaits the elements of anger awake

Spawned by evil and hate

Hatespawn
 I swear my oath by the angel of light
 My allegiance to the kingdom of darkness
 To sign the contract in blood

Hatespawn
 And so I send my spiritual existence
 Sacrilegious baptism and blessed damnation
 And eternally I walk upon the left hand path

The sign of horns is 666
 Swear to the lord in 666---Lyrics submitted by Cookie.
