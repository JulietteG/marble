Welcome To Forever: Welcome to forever, on this wrinkled piece of paper. Welcome to forever. I write a letter to you, to this generation and the generations to come. Vanity of vanities, everything under the sun,  everything under the sun, everything will be forgotten. All that you remember, wrapped around this world. Grasping for the wind, where both the wise and the fools both achieve emptiness in the end. Emptiness in the end. Where does the time go? Who are we when we are all alone? When we're all alone. Welcome to forever, everything will be forgotten all that you remember wrapped up in this world, welcome to forever, everything will be forgotten, all that you remember. Wrapped up in this world, grasping for the wind where both the wise and the fools both achieve emptiness in the end. Welcome to forever, on this wrinkled piece of paper. Welcome to forever. I write a letter to you, look back and retrace your steps. Don't look at the clouds and ignore the one who's coming through them.---Lyrics submitted by ben.
