In the Damascus city recorder I read The other day
How little jimmy one-eye blew mary dockets away
And as she was lying dead there in the street 
I saw flowers rain all around her feet
I saw the heavens open up and I saw a finger pointing 
And it asked me if she was dead and I said
That looks like the joint Jack

Chorus
You don't visit my grave every Sunday
Your in the doghouse, flowers in the rain
You been whored out and pissed up 
With every blue-eyed stranger
You'll dance 

me to death one day

The Jordan valley examiner the headline it did read
Martha Tomlinson killed Marty no witness for to see
For ever every fool that feel upon her hands 
She was damned to dance upon his grave
Sing a sad romance

Chorus

Dance---Lyrics submitted by louise.
