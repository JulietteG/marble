(Verse 1)
Gotta car lot in my garage
Gotta condo down near the stars
Im geeked up off dem bars
Gotta car i aint even gotta park
No key push button to start
She aint a dime I wont get hard
Got hoes dat need a green card
Say Ima dogg but i dont even bark
Got em biting this swag like sharks
when i hit imma knock it out the park
Trap beat so godamn hard
Got Kush Got Lean Got Bars
That Re Re hard to scale,
Got bricks dont need no scale
Im plugged in with the mail
Im part of the cartel
That Rerock aint no clean
62 hundred for a neen
Said fuck it all up on jeans
Ima true religion fiend
Got bands in the pockets of my jeans
Need a kickstand way i lean
Promethazine fiend, Styrofoam, Sprite and Lean.

(Chorus)
Got campaigne going so strong.
Getting brain while im talkin on da phone
Spend money when ya money's dis long
Real street niggas aint no clones
We at tha top where we belong

Smoking on 1000 dollas worth of strong
When da club bout to hear this song

Gotta 100,000 dollars worth of clothes

I keep me a big bank roll(bank roll)
I aint tricking off on these hoes(these hoes)
These hoes bringing me they soul
I will never sell my soul.
Cash out on all these cars
These foreign (foreign) Broads.
Gotta Nigga living in the stars
Im on my way to Mars.

They all wanna do a minaj

We aint never gotta got dam flarge.

(Chorus)

Gotta know i keep dem racks
Yo girl wont leave me alone

Dont even know how to relaaaax

Had to wake up on a bean
Got racks off in my jeans
Man busting out the sceeene
Got kush all in my lungs
Get high like ching ching chong
Eight-hundred a zone,
Aint blowing it less its strong

Strapped up no bodyguuaaaard!

(Chorus)
Got campaigne going so strong.
Getting brain while im talkin on da phone
Spend money when ya money's dis long
Real street niggas aint no clones
We at tha top where we belong
Drank Lean, Rose, Patron
Smoking on 1000 dollas worth of strong
When da club bout to hear this song

Got racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on raaacks!

Got racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
