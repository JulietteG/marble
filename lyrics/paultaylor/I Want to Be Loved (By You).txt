~Music plays by Paul Taylor~

Play it Paul... (Latoya London)
Play it so sweetly

Calm and so unsuspectingly
The image of you passes me by 
And I see a life of loved and passion
Like you can imagine
If only you knew the things you do to me
Each and every night while I sleep
Oh but why must it be just when Im dreaming
Silently Im screaming.... 

(Chorus)
I want to be loved
I want to be loved by you 
I want to make a dream come true 
If I could just see in the room 
Theres nothing that I rather do

I want to be loved
I want to be loved by you
Baby make you want me too (make you want me)
I want to be loved by you
Theres nothing that I rather do

Some say that its not lady like um no
To tell a man the way that you feel
But I cant conceal this any longer
Desires getting stronger
So lets put the formalities aside (tonight)
I cant let it slip thru my hands
This is my chance for not to take it (for not to take it)
So Im just gonna say it...

(Chorus)
I want to be loved
I want to be loved by you (oh baby)
I want to make a dream come true (I want to make it come true)
If I could just see in the room
Theres nothing that I rather do (I wanna be loved)

I want to be loved by you
Baby make you want me too (gonna make you want me)
I want to be loved by you
Theres nothing that I rather do (tell you what Im gonna do)

I m gonna bare my thoughts and unload all my feelings
Cause nobody knows (no one but me)
Im gonna let you in on fantasies
Ive held within for such a long time
Im gonna tell you whats on my mind 

~Music plays by Paul Taylor~

Play it for me Paul Taylor
Play so sweetly

I want to be loved by you
I want to be loved by you
I want to make a dream come true
If I could just see in the room
Theres nothing that I rather do

I want to be loved
I want to be loved by you (I wanna be loved)
Baby make you want me too (right next to you boy)
I want to be loved by you
Theres nothing that I rather do 

Only you, only you can do it to me yea hey hey
Woo hoo
Wanna be- I wanna be I want to be loved....by you baby
Wanna be- I wanna be...I want to be loved yea---Lyrics submitted by Nikki Henderson.
