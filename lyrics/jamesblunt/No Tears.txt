Don't I know it,
Nobody has to say.
That I've been lucky,
Guess I was born that way.

I thank my father,
His absence has made me strong,
And I love my mother,
But she had troubles with god.

[Chorus]

No tears,
For the life that you led,
You've had angels in your head.
Did you hear them singing in the air?
All the things that you've seen,
All the things that could have been.
Well I've been everything I wanna be.
So no tears.
No tears for me.

Yeah I've bathed in sunshine, 
But cherished the fading light.
And I heard my heartbeat faulter,
On a winter's night. 

I loved a women,
But she didn't hear my prayers.
So lord,
Oh lord,
I'm yours.

[Chorus]
No tears,
For the life that you led,
You've had angels in your head.
Did you hear them singing in the air?
All the things that you've seen,
All the things that could have been.
Well I've been everything I 'wanna' be.
So no tears,
No tears.

[Bridge]
Cos' someone, 
somewhere's going home tonight.
Trying to understand the sacrifice.
So save your tears for those left behind - 

For the life that you led,
You've had angels in your head.
But did you hear them singing in the air?
All the things that you've seen.
All the things that could have been,
Well I've been everything I 'wanna' be.
So no tears,
No tears

No tears for me.---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin.
