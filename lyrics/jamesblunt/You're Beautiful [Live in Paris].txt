My life is brillient.... 
My life is brillient,
my love is pure.
i saw an angle over that im sure.
she smiled at me on the subway,
she was  with another man.
but i wont lose no sleep on that cause ive got a plan. 
u r beautiful u r beautiful,
u r beautiful its true.
i saw ur face in a crowdy place
and i dont know wat to do,
cause i'll never be with u.
yes she caught my eye
as we walked on by she could see from my face 

that i was flying high
and i dont think that i will see her again 

but we shared a moment that will last till the end
u r beautiful u r beautiful,
u r beautiful its ture
i saw ur face in a corwdy palce
and i dont know wat to do cause 

i'll never be with u 
La la la laa la la la laa
la la la laaaaaa laaaaaa............
u r beautiful u r beautiful,
u r beautiful its true.....
the must beautiful angel with a smile on her face
when she thought up that i should be with u...
but its time to face the truth
i'll  never be---Lyrics submitted by Rabin.
