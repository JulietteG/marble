Ooo, these feet carry me far
O, my body o' so tired
Mouth is dry, hardly speak
Holy Spirit rise in me

I swear, forever is just a minute to me 
And I'll take everything ... in this life
I'll join everyone
Ooo, when I die - have my body, have my mind, have my coat, take my time
These I borrowed, borrowed so far
Turned to dust, fall apart.

I swear, forever is just a minute to me
And, I'll take everything ... in this life
I'll join everyone ... and then the star grows old and dies

And I'll take everything ... in this life 
I'll join everyone ... since I'm gonna die
I'll take everything ... in this life
I'll join everyone, cause all men die---Lyrics submitted by Charmain.
