Nag Nag Nag
Home again asphalt boys,broken bodies,broken toys
Not too tall ameoba like ,mono head mono mind

Live for lust ,quite unnerving,live unjust even more frightening
15 minute pharaohs,happy now,golden hands then back below

What nerve perfect face ,perfect stranger,perfect place
Up to now so far so good ,please recall if you could---Lyrics submitted by Tony Pace.
