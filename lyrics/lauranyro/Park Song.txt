Let your leaf fall
In my child's hand
He's laughin' & whirlin'
His love is a ten piece band
That child throws sparks 
Across the park
Across this whole crazy world
Ooh
If that was his livin' plan

Autumn leaves 
Drift by like angels
Drift past the world 
Of man made reality
"They" call "great"
But I couldn't relate it 
From the start
So cool the tired
Renew the weary
As you float down in wonder---Lyrics submitted by Andre'.
