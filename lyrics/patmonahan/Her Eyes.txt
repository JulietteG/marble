She's not afraid, she just likes to use her nightlight 
When she gets paid, True Religion gets it all if they fit right
She's a little bit manic, completely organic, doesn't panic for the most part
She's old enough to know, and young enough not to say no
For any chance that she gets for home plate tickets to see the Mets
Like everybody, she's in over her head, dreads, feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds
She's a Gemini Capricorn, thinks all men are addicted to porn
I don't agree with her half the time, but damn I'm glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She got the kind of strength that every man wishes he had
She loved Michael Jackson up until he made Bad
Tells me that she's lived about a hundred lives, scares me to death when she thinks and drives
Says cowboy hats make her look fat and I'm so glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She doesn't know the word "impossible"
Don't care where I've been and doesn't care where we're going to
She takes me as I am, and that ain't easy
She's beautiful, so beautiful
And sometimes, I think she's truly crazy and I love it

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where new skies always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where new skies always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She's not afraid, she just likes to use her nightlight---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
