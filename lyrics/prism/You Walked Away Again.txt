You had me on your side
but even now we're far away
I've got to settle down
you know I've waited for so long
but you walked away again
just as it was time to start
don't lead me on again
you know it breaks my heart
         chorus
You walked away again
before love even had a chance
you walked away again
before we even said romance
you walked away again
you walked away again

You want to talk again 
but all I get's a busy line
I cant control myself
goin' through this all the time
but you walked away again 
just as it was time to start
don't lead me on again
          chorus
solo
         chorus x2


It's tearin' me apart
          chorus---Lyrics submitted by William.
