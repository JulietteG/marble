Youve created a mob,
But you must bear one thought.
The mob has no rules.
The mobhas no rules.

Outstanding citizen shows off his mob.
But is in fear of ridicule, when surrounded by fools.

Lately, Ive been feeling rather strange.
Sheep in wolves clothing on the firing range.
Lately, a sixth sense of deja vu
Haunts my mind, and haunts yours too.

Question marks hang around, after each word.
The sweat of my back, is stuck to my shirt.
Drama and intrigue, are boring me so.
I just want a simple
Life, live it so.

Lately, Ive been feeling rather strange.
Sheep in wolves clothing on the firing range.
Lately, a sixth sense of deja vu
Haunts my mind, and haunts yours too.

How do we choose the lesser of two evils?
One man cannot control a million people.

Lately, Ive been feeling rather strange.
Sheep in wolves clothing on the firing range.
Lately, a sixth sense of deja vu
Haunts my mind, and haunts yours too.
Haunts my mind, and haunts yours too.---Lyrics submitted by Kacie Moo.
