Hall of fame
 Yeah you can be the greatest
 You can be the best
 You can be the king kong
 Banging on your chest
 You could beat the world
 You could beat the war
 You could talk to god
 Go banging on his door
 You can throw your hands up
 You can be the crack
 You can move the mountains
 You can break rocks
 You can be a master
 Dont wait for luck
 Better get yourself and you go by yourself
 Standing in the hall of fame
 Yeah
 And the worlds gonna know your name
 Yeah 
 with the burn of the brightest flame
 Yeah
 And the worlds gonna know your name
 Yeah
 And youll be on the walls of the hall of fame
 You can go the distance
 You can run the mile
 You can walk straight through hell
 With a smile
 You can be the hero
 You can get the gold
 Breaking all the records you thought that could be broke
 Do it for your people
 Do it for your pride
 How you ever gonna know if you never even try
 Do it for your country
 Do it for your name
 Cause they gonna be a day when youre
 Standing in the hall of fame
 Yeah
 And the worlds gonna know your name
 Yeah
 With the burn of the brightest flame
 Yeah
 And the worlds gonna know your name
 And youll be on the walls of the hall of fame
 Be a champion
 Be a champion
 Be a champion
 Be a champion
 Youll be on the walls of the hall of fame
 Be student, Be teachers
 Be politicians, Be preachers

 Be astronauts, Be champions, Be true seekers
 Be students, Be teachers

 Standing in the hall of fame
 Yeah
 And the worlds gonna know your name
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!
 With the burn of the brightest flame
