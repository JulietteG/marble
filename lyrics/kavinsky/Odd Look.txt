You are the snake, get around me
And it came with rain
Never seen what raining

(Chorus)
So I just could lead the way
Theres nowhere to ride around me
No one around, its amazing
Elevating as it seems to you
But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when its raining?
You were mine

So Im with you baby
You were to put it else yea baby
You were right, you made it
You were alright

So Im with you baby
You were more, I seen no more
You were right to enslave me
I think you wouldve made it

(Chorus)
So I just could lead the way
Theres nowhere to ride around me
No one around, its amazing
Elevating as it seems to you
But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when its raining?
You were mine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
