There is Fenris grim
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves
Jormungandr twists and turns, mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

Thor, odins son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor, Hldyns son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, ragnark awaits


Vingthr rise to face the snake with hammer high
at the edge of the world
as lightning fills the air
as Mjlnir does it's work
the twinfold serpent roars in pain //edited

Thor, odins son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor, Hldyns son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, ragnark awaits


Mighty Thor, grabs the snake
firmly by its tongue
lifts his hammer high to strike
soon his work is done


Victory against the guardian
leading to the twilight of the thundergod
ragnark awaits
twilight of the thundergod
twilight of the thundergod
twilight of the thundergod
twilight of the thundergod---Lyrics submitted by Nicky.
