There comes Lopt, the treacherous 
Lusting for revenge 
He leads the legions of the dead 
Towards the Aesir's realm 

They march in full battle dress 
With faces grim and pale 
Tattered banners and bloody flags 
Rusty spears and blades 

Cries ring out, loud and harsh 
From cracked and broken horns 
Long forgotten battle cries 
In strange and foreign tongues 

Spear and sword clash rhythmically 
Against the broken shields they beat 
They bring their hate and anarchy 
Onto Vigrid's battlefield 

There comes Lopt, the treacherous 
He stands against the gods 
His army grim and ravenous 
Lusting for their blood 

Nowhere is longer safe 
The earth moves under our feet 
The great world tree Yggorasil 
Trembles to its roots 

Sons of muspel gird the field 
Behind them Midgaard burns 
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim 
And the Fenris wolf returns 

Heimdal grips the Giallarhorn 
He sounds that dreaded note 
Oden rides to quest the Norns 
But their web is torn 
The Aesir rides out to war 
With armor shining bright 
Followed by the Einherjer 
See valkyries ride 

Nowhere is longer safe 
The earth moves under our feet 
The great world tree Yggorasil 
Trembles to its roots 

Sons of muspel gird the field 
Behind them Midgaard burns 
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim 
And the Fenris wolf returns---Lyrics submitted by Zachary.
