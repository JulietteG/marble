I stroke the blade with my hand
The sharp edge cuts the skin
Blood drips to the rain wet sand
My journey can begin

Once a slave but now I'm free
My honour is restored
Once again I'll ride the seas
Free at last from whip and oar

I slide the sword into the shied
The ocean God is hailed
And as we push out to sea
We raise the red striped sails

I've missed the breeze of my home shores
The frozen lakes and winter snow
But now my dreams starts to unfold
Father, I'm coming home

The storm came down without remorse
And water crashed the rails
The ship was thrown back and forth
As strong winds ripped the sails

The icy waves embrace on my skins
I am going numb
The endless ocean swallows me
This will be my cold wet tomb

Won't feel the breeze of my home shore
Nor see the lakes or winter snow
My hopefu dreams lie ripped and torn
Father, I die alone.---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
