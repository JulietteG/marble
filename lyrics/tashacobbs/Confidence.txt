I got so much faith in, Lord I trust your word it's true
No matter the circumstance, my life is in your hands
I've got confidence, so much confidence, in you

Your love has been so good to me, it's so unfailing
My heart is in your hands, you hold the master plan
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
 I've got confidence, so much confidence in you

Your Ways are

Higher, Deeper,

How you do what you do, but you do what you do

I've got confidence, so much confidence in you---Lyrics submitted by Tao Iga.
