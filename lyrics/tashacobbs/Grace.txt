God loves me, adores me 
Watches over me, You are for me 
Grace loves me and its not what I deserve
And nothing that I've earned
But daily grace saves me

OOOooo But for your grace
OOOooo But for your grace 
OOOooo But for your grace
I'd be lost,but for your grace

God loves me,adores me 
Watches over me , You are for me 
Grace loves me and its not what I deserve
And nothing that I've earned
But daily grace saves me


OOOoo But for your grace 
OOOooo But for your grace
OOOooo But for your grace
I'd be lost,but for your grace


Oooooo But for your love.....
I'd be lost,but for your love
I'd be lost,but for your grace
I'd be lost,but for your grace

Grace-it saves me
Grace-it raises me 
Grace-it keeps me 
Grace-am clothed in it
Grace-am mighty great full
Grace-am mighty great full
Grace-I don't desire it 
but it's my all mind
Grace-am mighty great full
Grace-am mighty great full
Grace-it belongs to me
Grace-it belongs to me
Your Grace-your grace is saving
Grace-and it keeps going every day
Grace-the grace of the Lord 
Grace-it's unmerited favor
Grace-unmerited favor
Grace-it's my all mind
Grace-somebody praise Him for grace
Grace-we give you glory for grace
Grace-it's been faithful everyday
Grace-it's been keeping me every day

Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah
I'd be lost but for your grace
I'd be lost but for your grace
but for your grace---Lyrics submitted by akieralattimore.
