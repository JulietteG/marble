You make me happy
You make me whole
You take the pain away
I'm so in love with you [Repeat 4 times]
Everything about you is right
It covers all my wrong
Your life saved my life [Repeat 2 times]
With you is where I belong
I belong to you Lord [Repeat 3 times}
You make me happy
You make me whole
You take the pain away
I'm so in love with you [Repeat 3 times]
Everything about you is right
It covers all my wrong
Your life saved my life [Repeat 3 times]
With you is where I belong
I belong to you Lord {LEAD repeat 3 times}
So in love with you
Can't make it without you
I live to worship you
Forever me and you [Repeat 4 times]
Forever me and you [Repeat 6 + times]
Forever me and you
Forever me and you
Forever me and you
Everything about you is right {LEAD}
Everything about you is right
Everything about you it is right
Everything about you it's so right
And it covers my wrong---Lyrics submitted by NDea Colter.
