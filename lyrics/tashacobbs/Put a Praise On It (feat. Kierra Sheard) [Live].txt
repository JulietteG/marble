There's a miracle in this room
With my name on it
There's a healing in this room
And it's here for me

There's a breakthrough in this room
And it's got my name on it

So I'm gonna put a praise on it
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody put a praise on it
There's a miracle in this room
With Tasha's name on it
You outta put your name in the atmosphere, C'mon
(Tasha talking)

There's a healing in this room
And it's is here for me
There's a breakthrough in this room
And it's got my name on it
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody put a praise on it
Can you help me put a praise on it
Somebody put a praise on it
Let's Go ....
Tasha talking (I dare somebody to put a praise in this room, I declare wherever you are miracles are breaking off in your house. You outta declare there is a miracle in this room and it's got my name on it)

There's a miracle in this room
With my name on it
There's a healing in this room
And it's is here for me
There's a breakthrough in this room
With my name on it
So what you gone do---
