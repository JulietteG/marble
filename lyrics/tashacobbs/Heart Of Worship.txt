Heart Of Worship

If You're Deep In The Ocean Or High On The Mountain
Lord My Worship Will Chase You
My One Desire Is
To Never Be Too Far Away
So Draw Me Close Enough To Touch You

Whooo.......Oooooo
Repeat 4 X's

Here's My Heart Of Worship I Give It To You

Whoooo.......Ooooo

Father......Father---Lyrics submitted by Tanecia Weems.
