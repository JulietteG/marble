You generals all and champions bold that takes delight in the field
That knock down palaces and castle walls and but straight to death must yield 

I am an Englishman by birth, Lord Marlborough is my name
In Devonshire I drew my breath, that place of noted fame

I was beloved of all my men, kings and princes likewise
It's many a town I often took I did the world surprise 

King Charles the Second I did serve to face our foes in France 
And at the battle of Ramilies I boldly did advance 

The sun was down, the earth did shake, how loudly did I cry 
"Fight on, my lads, for old England's sake, we'll conquer or we'll die" 

That very day my horse got shot, 'twas by a musket ball
And as I mounted up again, my aide-de-camp did fall 

Now I on a bed of sickness lie, I am resigned to die 
You generals all and champions bold stand true as well as I 

Stand true my lads, and take no bribes, fight with courage bold
I led my men through smoke and fire and never was bribed by gold 

I am an Englishman, Lord Marlborough is my name
We knocked down palaces and castle walls

I was beloved of all my men, kings and princes likewise
It's many a town I often took I did the world surprise 

Stand true my lads, and take no bribes, fight with courage bold
I led my men through smoke and fire and never was bribed by gold 

You generals all and champions bold that takes delight in the field
That knock down palaces and castle walls and but now to death must yield 

I am an Englishman by birth, Lord Marlborough is my name
In Devonshire I drew my breath, that place of noted fame---Lyrics submitted by Mario Butter.
