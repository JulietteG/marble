So much for the light show 
Pissing on while pissing off 
Sucking in a smokescreen 
Selling of a loose knit dream 

Folding up the skyline 
Agreeing on a steep decline 
Cant control this airplane 
Being caught is just the same 
Headed for a lowlife 
Little lover's so polite 
Waking up the core needs 
With smelling salts and faulty means 

Did the bones collide 
Who let the bones collide 
Why did the bones collide 

([Nikki:] it's always the same way for me 
Ending in the same way.) 

So much for the showdown 
Keeping up while keeping off 
Choking on the cold feet 
Rolling up the plastic sleeves 
Can't control the slow ride 
Little lover's so polite 
Turning off the low light 
Tell me did the bones collide 
The bones collide 
The bones collide 
Little lover's so polite 
So polite 
So polite 
Turning off the low light 

([Nikki:] it's always the same way for me 
Blue turns soft with time 
Broke remains, an everyday disguise 
Ending in the same way. . .the same way) 

Tell me did the bones collide 
The bones collide 
The bones collide 
Little lover's so polite 
So polite 
So polite---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
