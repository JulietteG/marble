The fuzz in my head grows 
It's already so low 
The fuzz in my head stands 
It's already all too clear 

So much for losing track of time 

Can cope with a white noise 
Repeating imitation 
Can cope with a white noise 
Blissful complication 
The fuzz in my head stands 
It's already all too clear 

And the hum 
It seperates the two 
It's all frontline, frontline 
It cuts down inbetween 
It's all for nothing 

Too bad it's been here for awhile 
So much for losing track of time 

Let go i've seen it's worth your while 
So much for losing track of time...---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
