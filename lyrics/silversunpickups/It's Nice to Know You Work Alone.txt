It's the beauty of confession
In the sound when the levees break
And all the air is wrong - wrong
Redesigning a connection
A composition painted on my face
With a smile drawn on - on

Sit back and breathe
It's nice to know you work alone
My head is reeling
It's nice to know you work alone
It's nice to know you work alone

Disembody the infection
With water marks on a pillowcase
With all the nerves turned on - on
Overriding the obsession
To take it all and be on my way
Dragging the lead along - along

Sit back and breathe
It's nice to know you work alone
My head is reeling
It's nice to know you work alone
It's nice to know you work alone

But all the grace is gone, gone
And all the tired scorn is gone
And all the fire is gone, gone
But the reveal is gone, it's gone

Sit back and breathe
It's nice to know you work alone
My head is reeling
It's nice to know you work alone
It's nice to know you work alone

Reaching the serene
It's nice to know you work alone
My head's stopped reeling
It's nice to know you work alone
It's nice to know you work alone
It's nice to know you work alone
It's nice to know you work alone---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
