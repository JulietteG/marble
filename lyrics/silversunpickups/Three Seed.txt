Remove a bullet from my head 
Extracting over confidence 
Hidden so easy to pretend 
Too bad the rush was found again 

I can see the pictures on the floor 
Sketches of what was there before 
Three came from one little seed 
The last one is all i need 

I can see the bottle on the ground 
We turned the corner safe and sound 
No thought of him as it was done 
A clean execution 
A clean execution 

Cool like the ocean 
Burned like a summer home 
Fooled by the notion 
That the sums don't add up at all 

There's the line that is leading clearly feeding all 
The things I don't believe in but i'll step in once 
Again 
Cut in line to get closer to the source of all the 
Things I'll never belong to 
Step it up and sign right in again 

Cool like the ocean 
Burned like a summer home 
Fooled by the notion 
That the sums don't add up at all 

Cool like the ocean 
Burned like a summer home 
Fooled by the notion 
That the sums don't add up at all 
That the sums never add up at all 
That the sums don't add up at all...---Lyrics submitted by Max.
