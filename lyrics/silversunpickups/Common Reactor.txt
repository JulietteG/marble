It's the common reactor 
It's the long way out 
It's the stream of a motion blur 
That swirls around til you drown 

But I couldn't put it down 

It's the colorless picture 
In a heart shaped frame 
The silhouette of a dough eyed girl 
Who at one point had a name 

But I couldn't put it down 
No I couldn't put it down 

Let's break the window panes 
And separate the walls from all the nails 
Cuz maybe if we're loud we'll stay alive 
While everybody wants to join the fight 
But now it's too late 

Brush away all the memories 
Keep the cries curbside 
I'll be ashing on the images 
That have all been caught inside 

But i couldn't put it down 
No i couldn't put it down 
No i couldn't put it down 

Let's break the window panes 
And separate the walls from all the nails 
Cuz maybe if we're loud we'll stay alive 
While everybody wants to join the fight 
Cut even if we barricade the door and seal it with the 
Blood found on the floor 
We're always going to cross the finish line 
While everybody wants to run and hide 
But now it's too late---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
