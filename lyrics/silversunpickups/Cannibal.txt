when the king comes down to speak
with animals
animals

with his claws out for a feast
a cannibal
cannibal

when we crawl out to the brink
to meet and greet
with a wink

pull the rug out from underneath
this cannibal
cannibal

who is gonna break the ice
no room for shallow alibis
who will be the first to bite
or do we keep on playing nice
until the next time

hey
its too late
ive been here before the change
this latest phase

if the king bows to our feet
a cannibals
a cannibal

who is gonna break the ice
no room for shallow alibis
who will be the first to bite
or do we keep on playing nice
until the next time---
