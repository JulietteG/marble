I like friends and I like strangers
Carved out forms of steamy nature
Coming on strong but soon or later
A curtain calls on misbehavior

When you seal it away and you're on your own
And you brush away the old war zones
And the music plays for broken bones
We'll be running again away we go
Away we go

I like trends and I like heydays
And being caught in the haze of sleeping late
But when nighttime comes, I see you straining
Through my fingertips, I feel you changing

When you seal it away and you're on your own
And you brush away the old war zones
And the music plays for broken bones
We'll be running again away we go
Away we go

Leave it alone
My how you've grown
Never knew how low
You could get before zero
Cling in a way
That'll drive us insane

Wait 'til you find
The end of the line

When you seal it away and you're on your own
And you brush away the old war zones
And the music plays for broken bones
We'll be running again away we go

When you seal it away and you're on your own
And you brush away the old war zones
And the music plays for broken bones
We'll be running again away we go
Away we go

Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin,
Pins and needles in your skin---
