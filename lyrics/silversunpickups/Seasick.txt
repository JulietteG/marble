What can we do to make this worse?  
Where can we lay down
Lay down the fallen leaves
Too fair to scream
Scatter dry heaves
My stone mixture
Floorboards keep moving
Ruptured on casualties
No more malady
At least thats how it seems

Dont make a sound, it throws me off
My center, where faith is (not) lost.  
Dont fake a loss, dont say we had enough.  
Dont make a sound, it throws me off.

Dark shares enclose, 
These walls wont hold.  
Dont tell from the paramour
Rooted in family tree.  
Or let them see, 
Cause it mattered to me.  

Dont make a sound, it throws me off, 
My center, where love is lost.  
Dont fake a lot, dont say we had enough.  
Dont make a sound, it throws me off.

If you only knew  
Trying to move
Trying to move
Keep my head high
We made a life
We made a life
Could you realize
Ill kiss the sky
Ill kiss the sky
If you only knew
Doctors believe us on the ground
You face this on the ground.  
Ill be there on the ground.  
Face it on the ground.  

She sways over to me, falling overboard
But I cant see nothing
She sways over to me, shes still going hard
But I cant hear anything.
She sways over to me, falling overboard
But I cant see nothing
She sways over to me, shes still going hard
But I cant hear anything.
Dont make a sound, it throws me off, 
My center, where faith is lost.  
Dont fake a lot, dont say we had enough.  
Dont make a sound, it throws me off.---Lyrics submitted by Mysti Cali.
