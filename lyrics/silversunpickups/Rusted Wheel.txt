So you can't hold a star in your hand though 
At least you can hold on to another plan 

Rusted wheel planted still 

I can tell it's summer from the 
Size of the bugs that fly through my window 
Flying through my window 

Rusted wheel planted still 
Rusted wheel can't move on 

I can tell it's winter from the 
Size of the lump in my throat 
Got a lump in my throat 

Rusted wheel planted still 
Rusted wheel can't move on 

And it feels just like the ground 
But trapped in another way 
Just still in the ground 

And it feels just like the ground 
And trapped in another way 
Just still in the ground 

So you can't hold a star in your hand though 
At least you can move on to that better plan 

Rusted wheel planted still 
Rusted wheel can't move on...---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
