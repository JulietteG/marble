There's a vulture perching right off screen
And it's bitter and whispers chaotic things
And it reached in quick ain't it worrying
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, stop listening

I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
And now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry

You're a marionette in the center of
All the twisting strings coming from above
It may seem too deep to recover from
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, just let it go

I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
And now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

When the voices start spinning just be aware
I have brought enough stones for us to share
That one's grinning that one's burning, aim for the throat
Let him choke on the stones that we are to throw

It's the great downfall
Not the overthrow
If you shoot them down
It'll make you soar

When reactions turn into hurricanes
And the middle course seems a little tame
Whether full or empty it's all the same
It's so easy to see, everyone can agree, you're not to blame

I know you've heard it before
But then it wasn't enough
You don't wanna be held back from the substitution
I know you've seen this before
but now enough is too much
You don't wanna be set back when the substitution comes
I'm sorry---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
