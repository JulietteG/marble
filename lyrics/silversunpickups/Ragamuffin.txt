Here, on the summit we cry
Tears down the mountain side
Waves, crashing over the roads
And down to bury our home
Enough to bury our home

Then, as the years flew by
And all the water dried
There, I saw you dancing alone
On everything we own
Dancing alone

Hey, you sing in youthful notes
You're wearing different clothes
Should we hesitate?
When you shake the ground
With our voices so loud
It's how we operate

Hey, you sing in youthful notes
You're wearing different clothes
Should we hesitate?
We can shake the ground
With our voices so loud
It's how we operate

Fighting fires with water guns
This ragamuffin has swallowed enough
(enough, enough, swallowed enough)
(enough, enough, swallowed enough)

Flags are down, speed trials are done
The engine has failed and there's nowhere to run
(Run, run, nowhere to run)
(Run, run, nowhere to run)

Covered your tracks, so how would you know
This ragamuffin wants to follow you home?
(Home, home, follow you home)
(Home, home, follow you home)
(Home, home, follow you home)

Let's speed away, like it's our lives on the line

Hey, you sing in youthful notes
You're wearing different clothes
Should we hesitate?
We can shake the ground
With our voices so loud
It's how we operate...

Should we hesitate...

It's how we operate
We operate
We operate
We operate

Hey, they're on the side of the road
You've got a ways to go---
