Winded through monotone 
One foot on checkered floor 
Head hung but still watching 
One dimlit figurine 

Concealed 
Pass it on 
Appeal 
Play along 

Please don't stop singing 
Cohorts are empty jars 

Concealed 
Pass it on 
Appeal 
Play along 

Meanwhile another scene 
Tracking mud while blood letting 
We've been so proud 

Watch how our star behaves 
We'll all roll in our graves 
Sink with every word 
While all their backs were turned 

Meanwhile our little gem 
Is sleeping with sycophants 
But now and then we're joining in 
Tracking mud while blood letting 
We've been so proud---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
