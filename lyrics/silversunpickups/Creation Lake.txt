The way things have fallen 
Can't be afraid anymore 
First we were water 
In creation lake 
Have to start to end 
To go where life lives 

There's 24 parts in a day that divides me from you 

The way things have fallen 
Can't be afraid anymore 
First we were water 
Came from clouds hit the ground 
Mama's the sweetest 
Alarm clock around 

There's 24 parts in a day that divides me from you...---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
