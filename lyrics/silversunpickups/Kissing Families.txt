Stop the season stop the sting 
A plastic mic a broken string 
Infected wound from a rusty ring 

Soon you'll be there too 

Kissing families can't recall 
A program to derail us all 
Forgotten prison it's been safe 'til now 

It's no wonder that we did it this way 
Keep looking forward on paths sideways 
It's everything that is connected and beautiful 
And now i know just where i stand 
Move on 
Roll along 
Not today 
It's everything that is connected and beautiful 
And now i know just where i stand 

Thank god you're heart is too close 

This can be the bitter end 
I know it wont 

Well someone said i made a mistake 
Kept looking forward on paths sideways 
It's everything that is connected and beautiful 
And now i know just where i stand 
Seasons always shift too late 
Spent too much time now on paths sideways 
Everything that is connected and beautiful 
And now i know just where i stand 
Thank god it's over....---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
