We are ready for the siege
We are armed up to the teeth
Be careful how you live and breathe
Release whats brewing underneath

How many times do you wanna die?
How many ways do you wanna die?

To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

We can laugh about it now
We hope everything works out
Be careful how you lick your wounds
Believe the change is coming soon.

How many times do you wanna die?
How many ways do you wanna die?

To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

You used to do a little, but a little wont fly
And right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time.

Can it please you still?
Renaming your father's will
Or does it make you ill? 

Let us bruise their knees
We will aim straight for the feed
and you'll be relieved 
so Relieved, so relieved

Turn on full desire 
Feel the sparks of the friendly fire 
Injuries inspire 

Your throat has been cut several times before
Never noticed the size of the flow 
It can't be ignored 

To feel safe again look over your shoulder 
Carefully look over your shoulder 

You said you believe it, but believing won't fly 
and right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love, but not the first time 

And when it's all over and you open your eyes 
To see the room turned on its side 
You'll be lying by a note on the floor signed:

The Royal We (x8) 
Love The Royal We---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
