Pardon me, But a little fiddle fantasy
Quietly, show you everything you'll ever need
I hope you'll take it, I know your fakin just a little bit
Come on and taste it, Just get excited cause your givin in

Come and see how the wind in your hair now feels differently
Catch and release the lure above

Who.....

Here we are, In the bath water overflow
Later on ,Don't say I didn't tell you so
Maybe I didn't but your takin it
You were fakin just a little bit
Now that you taste it
No need to fight it cause your givin in
Follow me
Down the strings of your sweat on your body
Can't believe the lure was enough
Do you see how the wind in your hair now feels differnetly
Catch and release the lure above

Do you see how the wind in your hair now feels differently
Catch and release the lure above

And who knows how this feeling grows
Was it truly worth, truly worth us starting
And who knows, why the engines blown
Hope it's truly worth, truly worth the parting

Follow me down the strings of the sweat on your body
Can't believe the lure was enough
Do you see how the wind in your hair now feels differently

Guess the lure was enough---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
