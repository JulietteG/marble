I have seen a summer day that slowly opens like a rose
Along a quiet road that wanders by and I have smiled and wondered where it goes
I have stumbled through the night  alone as any man can be
Then found a silent canyon full of stars and in my heart I heard them telling me 
I was home

The gentle wind, the rain that falls
The tallest tree, I'm part of it all

I've seen the silver mountaintops and golden prairies on my way
Now everywhere I go across the land I stand so proudly in the sun and say 
I am home  (music interlude)

I've dreamed of Eden all my life.  I find it more and more each day
Now everywhere I go across the land, I stand so proudly in the sun and say 
I am home---Lyrics submitted by Fred Galvez.
