[The train now approaching platform 4 is the delayed 1147 Southern service to London Bridge. This train is the service from London Victoria]

Ive got a friend in Crewe
Im going to be there soon

Ive got a book
But I like to look
Out of the window too

I buy a cup of tea
While Im on platform three

It seems too dear
Theres no change I fear
Therell be no lunch for me

(Chorus)
Im waiting for a train  choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo. Im waiting for a train.

I do hope Im not delayed
Now that my tickets paid
I close my eyes
I visualise all of the plans we made

Im waiting for a train  choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo, Im waiting for a train.

Im waiting for a train
(Im waiting for a train)
(Im waiting for a train)
(Im waiting for a train)

Im waiting for a train
(Im waiting for a train)
(Im waiting for a train)
(Im waiting for a train)

Im waiting for a train  choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)

Choo Choo. Im waiting for a train  choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)

Choo Choo. Im waiting for a train  choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)
Choo choo (choo choo)

Im waiting for a train---Lyrics submitted by Luke.
