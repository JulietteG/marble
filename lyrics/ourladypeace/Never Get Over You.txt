She said it's quiet, in the shadow of the sun.
She looks tired, the life that's come undone.
She turns, turns, turns, turns.

She likes hockey, and summers by the lake.
We're not talkin' because of my mistakes.
I burn, burn, burn, burn.

If you walk out that door, I just don't know what i'd do.
I'll never get over you.
If my heart hits this floor, I just don't know what I'll do.
I'll never get over you.

In this silence, It's never been so loud.
I try and fight it, but the words just don't come out.
I burn, burn, burn, burn.

If you walk out that door, I just don't know what I'd do.
I'll never get over you.
Ir my heart hits this floor, I just don't know what I'll do.
I'll never get over you.

There's no hiding, from your silence.
There's no hiding.

If you walk out that door, I Just don't know what I'd do.
I'll never get over you.
If my heart hits this floor, I just don't know what I'll do.
I'll never get over you.

Don't you go.
Don't you go.
Don't you go.
Don't you go.---Lyrics submitted by skylar.
