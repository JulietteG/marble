She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer dont discriminate or care if youre just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, "I know that youre afraid and I am, too
But youll never be alone, I promise you"

When youre weak, Ill be strong
When you let go, Ill hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that Ill be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death,
Like you cant take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
Im gonna love you through it.

She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, "I don't think I can do this anymore"
He took her in his arms and said "That's what my love is for"

When youre weak, Ill be strong
When you let go, Ill hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that Ill be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death,
Like you cant take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
Im gonna love you through it.

And when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on
Just take my hand, together we can do it
Im gonna love you through it.
Im gonna love you through it. ---
