Through crooked teeth and mouthed up ties 
They spit you up river just like all those lions 
That walked the banks 

They said, "Paint me that river 
And would you use only blues 
With a brilliant big black mouth and?
Lengths of pines that route the river through 
Through and through" 

Fashion ballrooms of the leaves 
Wed like to watch the ghosts dance 

They said, "Paint me that arm 
That lies directly over mountains 
Where the glaciers climb so tall. 
One absent of the scars passing boats and ships and oars 
Tend to leave with all the sounds of the ocean." 

I am but a man 
But a proud, proud man 
Silver bells that line the way 
Through baited trails. 
Well find you there---Lyrics submitted by Chloe.
