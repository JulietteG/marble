This can't be living now
If so, then show me how
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away
We shook, shook, shook the night away

Wanna love like this love was yours
But will I die, it's all because
Find it, at the bottom of it all

We got it all, we got it all, we got it all
Till the revolution comes
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all
Till the revolution comes

I run the world now, 
My teacher told me everything
I want it all now, 
My parents told me it would be

When I was born, I could find your times
But they were nothing, nothing like mine
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away
We shook, shook, shook the night away

Feels like school again
But man it's all right now
Find it, at the bottom of it all
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsty.com/portugal-the-man-got-it-all-lyrics.html ]
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all
Till the revolution comes
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all
Till the revolution comes

I run the world now(The revolution comes)
My teacher told me everything (The revolution comes)
I want it all now
My parents told me it would be
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away
We shook, shook, shook the night away
This can't be living now, 
If so, then show me how
That we will find it, at the bottom of it all

We got it all, we got it all, we got it all
Till the revolution comes
We got it all, we got it all, we got it all
Till the revolution comes

I run the world now, 
My teacher told me everything
I want it all now, 
My parents told me it would be
