Dream come true
The summer of 05
I still remember how you caught me by surprise
It was the fourth of July
My favorite time  I love to paint the sky
Good time to be alone  thats what I always told myself
But I lied, but at least I tried
You saved me from the one that let me drowned
That turned my whole world upside down
I cannot be without you
I cannot be without you
But I cant buy you a diamond ring
Or serenade you cuz I cant sing 
But I can love you with everything I am
A life with you  itd be so sweet 
Id call it a dream come true
Alone with you  it would make my day
Just to hear you say I love you
Theres a passion in your eyes
A familiar sight that gets me every time
Youre beautiful inside 
And thats so rare these days 
Ive searched  so hard to find
You  I cant believe I found you
So come on come on come on
Dont be scared
Come on come on come on 
Ill be there
Come on come on come on 
No one compares to you
But I cant buy you a diamond ring
Or serenade you cuz I cant sing 
But Ill stand by you through anything
A life with you  itd be so sweet 
Id call it a dream come true
Alone with you  it would make my day
Just to hear you say I love you
I know I dont always show the way I feel
Its just so hard to tell you 
After all the cracks I fell through
That you are the only one on my mind
 A life with you  itd be so sweet 
Id call it a dream come true
Alone with you  it would make my day
Just to hear you say I love you---Lyrics submitted by De.
