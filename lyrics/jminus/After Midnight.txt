After midnight I'll meet you by the seaside in my mind
I could walk a million miles with you by my side
See the glow of the moon dancing through the night
Words can't describe the feelings I hold inside
And after midnight, I come to you in a dream
Take my hand and run away to a place you've never seen
And we can watch the water such a beautiful sight
We'll be together after midnight

Please don't wake me up don't take me from this place I'd rather be
I don't know if you can go there, outside of a dream
If I could I would I'd stay there with you, never want to leave
You will always be there with me, holding as I sleep

And after midnight I'll see you beneath the darkened skies
We can run around in the open chasing fireflies
Make a wish upon the stars, forever we'll be free
'cause I've become a part of you and your a part of me

If I lead you, will you follow?
Stay right behind me
If I take you, leave your sorrow
Stay right behind
If I lead you, will you follow?
Stay right behind me
No more worries till tomorrow
No more worries....---Lyrics submitted by Zara Stewart.
