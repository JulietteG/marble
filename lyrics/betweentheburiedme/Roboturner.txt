Crush Us Over And Over Again
The Years Have Come To This
An Improper Art Form
Faking Our Own Thoughts And Sounds 
Robots Crush
Death Of Human Music

Bright Lights Fill The Sky..Track Us Through Our Feilds of Money...The Old Days Seem Shitand primative...Abduction..Control...You Write for me.. Oh, Master...
they will never see us coming

No More Human Voice...No More human Actions..Imperfect Fucks Stand in the dark..

Crush us Over And Over Again
The Years Have Come To This...an improper art form...
Faking Our Thoughtsand sounds Robots Crush...Death Of Human Music

Counteract this idea of control...Human Emotion can only produce the thoughful..Finally Discovering the the idea of perfect harmony..this is the day we finally make Beutiful notes again...but will we ever realize A situation So Far Dead.. Make this a war.. Blood fills the sky...Drop the deadly dive bomb..the end of this outside life..

We Will Find Art Again---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
