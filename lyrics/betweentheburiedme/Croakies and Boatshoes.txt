Crokies And Boatshoes...Collars Up
Daddy Money Increases my social Status
Dang, My Loafer Got Smudged
We Are the suberban Elite
Hey! Were Yall Want to meet?

I'v Got Something to Fucking Prove Man.
I've Really Gotten Something to Prove.
Dude.. Brah..Lets Go Party Tonight..
Maybe Start another Goddamn Fight
But it's all right..My Coach knows the sherrif

Don't Stare.....
At My Car
At MyShirt
At My Girl---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
