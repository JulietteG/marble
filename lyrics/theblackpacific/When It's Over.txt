Confession's on the tip of your tongue
Keep wrapping it up til the pain is gone
Nothing promised - nothing gained
Keep losing it all until you've won

When it's over - nothing matters
When there's nothing left to feel
that's when it happens
When it's over - nothing matters
When it's over

Depression's all you got to give
Keep counting scars 'til you resist
You are so sick, so sick again
Keep fighting 'em all until you've won---Lyrics submitted by b.
