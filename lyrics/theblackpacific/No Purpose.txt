I don't feel so good
I don't think that anyone should
What were you thinkin? What were you drinkin?
Jump into the fire? Or just keep on tryin?
Got you wrapped round their finger
What were you thinking?

It really doesn't mean a thing - no purpose to it all
No reason to believe

I don't feel so good
I don't know how anyone could
Why are you fighting? Where's your defiance?
Do you join the delusion? What's your solution?
Got you wrapped round their finger
What were you thinking?

It really doesn't mean a thing - no purpose to it all
No reason to believe---Lyrics submitted by b.
