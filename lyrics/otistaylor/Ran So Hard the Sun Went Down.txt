Spoke to the wrong person that day,
Went back home and hid away.
Woke up wonderin' what'd I see?
Tar and feather comin' after me.

I ran so hard the sun went down,
I ran so hard the moon came up,
The moon came up, The moon came up,
The moon came up, The moon came up.

I ran so hard the sun came down,
Ran so hard the moon came up,
The moon came up, The moon came up,
The moon came up, The moon came up.

Woo!

Woo!

Ran so hard the moon went up,
Run that up, Moon went up.

The moon went up, The moon went up,
The moon went up, The moon went up,
I ran so hard the sun went down,
Ran so hard the moon went up,
The moon went up, The moon went up,
The moon went up, The moon went up.

Woo!

Step on it!

Woo!

The moon went up, The moon went up,
The moon went up, The moon went up,
I ran so hard the sun came down,
I ran so hard the moon went up,
The moon went up, The moon went up,
The moon went up, The moon went up.---
