Wish I could go down to a department store,
buy myself some freedom.

Wish I could go down to a department store,
buy myself some freedom.

Freedom,
freedom,
freedom have mercy on me!

Freedom,
freedom,
freedom over me.

Wish I could swim wherever I want,
Daddy wouldn't have to live across the ocean.

Wish I could swim wherever I want,
Daddy wouldn't have to live across the ocean.

Freedom,
freedom,
freedom, have mercy on me!

Freedom,
freedom,
freedom over me.

Wish I could eat at whatever lunch counter I want,
then I wouldn't have to go on hungry.

Wish I could eat at whatever lunch counter I want,
then I wouldn't have to go hungry.

Freedom,
freedom,
freedom, have mercy on me!

Freedom,
freedom,
freedom over me.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
