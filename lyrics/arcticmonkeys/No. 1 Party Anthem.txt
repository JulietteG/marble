Could you step outside for a walk for a talk with me
That long little fluttering look you give
is just not doing it any more
You sat alone for a while but then you pitch across your mind
Your move is solitude when you take me by my hands

And if anyone told me you'd be the one, I'd tell them your not for me
but give you a chance and you'd twist them as far as they'd go

If you think you can stay out all night you've got a paradoxical hope
When you come home for a while I'll stand they're and put on a show
You put your heart in my hands and I suppressed it as hard as I can as we danced to the number one party anthem

Would you step outside for a walk for a talk with me
That long little fluttering look you give
him oh he don't believe no more
He sat alone for a while but then you pitched him your mind
And you moved like solitude when you took him by your hands

And if anyone told me you'd be the one, I'd tell them your not for me
but give you a chance and you'd twist them as far as they'd go

If you think you can stay out all night you've got a paradoxical hope
When you come home for a while I'll stand they're and put on a show
Well I put my heart in your hands and you suppressed it as hard as you can as we danced to the number one party anthem

Well If you think you can stay out all night you've got a paradoxical hope
When you come home for a while I'll stand they're and put on a show
Well I put my heart in your hands and you suppressed it as hard as you can as I danced all on my own.---Lyrics submitted by James Ford.
