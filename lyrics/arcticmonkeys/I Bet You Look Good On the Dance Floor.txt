Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you.
And what it is that surprises me,
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night),
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite).
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand.
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor.
I don't know if your looking for romance or,
I don't know what you're looking for.
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor,
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984,
From 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me.
Because you're sending me to despair.
Without a sound yeah you're calling me.
And I don't think it's very fair.
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

Oh there ain't no love no, Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes 'n' DJ sets 'n'
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
 Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!---Lyrics submitted by Richard Charles.
