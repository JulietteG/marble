We all want some one to shout for
Everyone wants somebody to adore
But your heroes arent what they seem
When youve been where weve been

Have i done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia

Everybodys got there box and are doing what theyre told
You push my faith near being lost but well stick to the guns
Dont care if its marketing suicide, we wont crack or compromise, your derisory devides will never unhinge us

Theres a couple of hundred
Think theyre Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled here long before you

Just because were having a say so
And not lining up to be play doh
In five years time will it be; who the fucks arctic monkeys?

Everybodys got there box and are doing what theyre told
You push my faith near being lost but well stick to the guns
Dont care if its marketing suicide, we wont crack or compromise, your derisory devides will never unhinge us

All the thoughts that i just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with,
Im not angry, Im just disappointed

It's not you it's them, that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their thong
Tell 'em to take out their thong

It's not you it's them, that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out  their thong
Tell 'em to take out  their thong

Bring on the backlash

It's not you it's them, that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out  his thong
Tell 'em to take out  his thong

It's not you it's them, thats the faith
I wont mess with your escape
If it's really your escape---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
