Lady where has your love gone? i was looking but cant find it anywhere
They always offer when theres loads of love around but when youre short of some its nowhere to be found

I know your game, you told him yesterday no chance, youll get nothing from me but now shes there, youre there and everybodys there and hes in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me

Lets go down, low down where i know i should not go
She thinks shes the one but shes just one in 24
And just 'cause everybodys doing it doe that mean that i can too

Lady where has your love gone? it was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand must he first be in demand? how he longs for you to long for him once more

Lets go down, low down where i know i should not go
She thinks shes the one but shes just one in 24
And just because everybodys doing it doe that mean that i can too

Her eyes went down and cut you up, theres nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you lost

And ache in your soul its everybodys goal to get what they cant have
Thats why youre after her and thats why shes after him but saying it wont change a thing
Realising it wont change a thing.---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
