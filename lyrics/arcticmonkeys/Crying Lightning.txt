Outside the caf by the cracker factory,
You were practising a magic trick,
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed, 
On the last of your pick and mix.

Said your mistaken if you thinking that I an't been called cold before
As you bit into your strawberry lace,
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper,
Is all you have left and it was goin' to waste.

Your past-times, consisted of the strange,
And twisted and deranged, 
And I love that little game you had called,
Crying lightning,
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons.

The next time that I caught my own reflection,
It was on its way to meet you,
Thinking of excuses to postpone.
You never look like yourself from the side,
But your profile could not hide,
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne.

With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war.
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw.

And your past-times, consisted of the strange,
And twisted and deranged, 
And I hate that little game you had called,
Crying lightning,
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons.

Uninviting,
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes,
You are crying lightning.

Your past-times, consisted of the strange,
Twisted and deranged, 
And I hate that little game you had called,
Crying lightning,
Crying lightning,
Crying lightning,
Crying lightning.

Your past-times, consisted of the strange,
And twisted and deranged, 
And I hate that little game you had called,
Crying...---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
