The daydream whispers enter to my head
So I turn to you for another point of view
I remember well you've got those broken footsteps too

And from these tires eyes we'll rascalize, and find our way through

Because we know exactly where we want to go to
All aboard the adventure
All aboard our adventure, our adventure, our adventure

All aboard the adventure
All aboard our adventure
All aboard the adventure
All aboard our adventure, our adventure, our adventure

And from these tires eyes we'll rascalize, and find our way through

Because we know exactly where we want to go to
All aboard the adventure
All aboard our adventure, our adventure, our adventure---Lyrics submitted by Elise.
