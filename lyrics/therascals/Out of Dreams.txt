Be careful of that mind of yours
And the paths down which it turns you
Well you
Don't have to follow
You, don't

Keep an eye on the killer
Borrowed from a friend
Coz if he has his way
Who knows where all of this might end?

Are you out of
Out of dreams
Are you out of
Out of dreams
Out of dreams
Out of dreams

Now our war is over
And no-one really won
Well you'll think about those days
And how they might have rung
And now the treachery in the air
And I can taste it on your tongue
Well now that the cats got mine
I feel
Far too young

Are you out of
Out of dreams
Are you out of
Out of dreams
Out of dreams
Out of dreams

Sink them in and rip and tear
For all your worth
I know your type and i've seen you before
Well I'm sure you'll make me yawn again
You'll make me yawn again

Be careful of that mind of yours
And the paths down which it turns you
Well you
Don't have to follow

Keep an eye on the killer
Borrowed from a friend
Coz if he had his ways
Who knows where all of this might end?
Where all of this might end
Where all of this might---Lyrics submitted by Elise.
