Sure like
The pure light
No end

And sure when dark
It's hard to breathe
Love proves you believe

In Love's eye's
For you see
No cares

And where you fall
Love's arms are there
Catching all your fears
Caressing all your tears
Indeed

Angels rejoice every time
You say I'm yours
I raise my voice to heaven
For your love
An ocean without shore
So free
Love is all believe

In the lonely nights
Love will shield and guide
To life's warmer heights
Through the wind and sky you fly
Golden spring delights
Love sends something to remind you

When your hearts a fright
Love will always be your guide
To life's warmer sights
Surely you can fly
Like God's gentle might
Love forevermore 
Grace will find you

New day light
Love's beside and guides you
To warmer heights
Surely you can fly
Like God's gentle might
Love forevermore
Everlasting

Lonely nights
Love will shield and guide
Keep you warm and right
Through the wind and sky you fly 
Like God's gentle might
Love forevermore
Love will find you---Lyrics submitted by Blond Rae.
