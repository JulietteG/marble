Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Marys boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas Day
Hark now hear the Angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and Angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new shining star
Then hear a choir sing
The music seemed to come from afar
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethleham that night
Then find no place to born the Child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and Angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Marys Little Boy was born

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the holy Bible say
Marys Boy Child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas Day

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and Angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Hark now hear the Angels sing
Listen what They say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day---Lyrics submitted by Joyce.
