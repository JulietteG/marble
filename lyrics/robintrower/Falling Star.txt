Falling star.
Falling free.
Where you are is were I want to be.
Falling star, Yeah falling free don't fall on me baby.

Wishing star how I wish you could.
Wish me luck, I sure wish you would yeah.
Falling star, Yeah falling free don't fall on me baby.
Don't fall on me.

Falling star don't you.
Falling star don't you.
Falling star don't you no.

Falling star don't you.
Falling star don't you.
Falling star don't you now don't you.
Don't you.
Falling star don't you.
Falling star don't you.
Falling star don't you.---Lyrics submitted by Dave Rico.
