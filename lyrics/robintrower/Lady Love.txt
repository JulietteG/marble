Lady love
I heard a voice and it soothed me
Lady love
A simple tune and it moved me

Move me and sooth me
Leading me home
Truly for me now
Lady love

Lady love
The man's a fool to be leaving
Dreams of love
Passing by like the seasons

Maybe I'll wake up
Oh, tell me I will
And find you there waiting
Lady love

Lady love
I need some warm and tender
Nights of love
Sweet and fine to remember

Maybe tomorrow
Your fever will find me
Waiting for me now
Lady love

I'll find you waiting, lady love
Find you there waiting, lady love
I'll find you waiting, lady love
Waiting, waiting, lady love---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
