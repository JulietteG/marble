Feeling low down and dirty 
Just like a dog without a bone 
Oh what happened to my lady 
Better get her tail back home 

CHORUS Gonna be suspicious, more suspicious from now on 

Too much howling at Big Yeller 
Too much growling at the door 
Too much running round in circles 
Won't be kicked around no more 

CHORUS 

Feeling low down and dirty 
Getting me mad as hell 
Getting down, getting angry 
They're stealing water from my well 

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
