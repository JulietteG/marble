Caledonia, Caledonia.  Seeing you walk by.
Make a river twist and shout, chase the birds down from the sky.
Caledonia, who could own ya'?, spirit of romance,
Caledonia, Caledonia dance.

Caledonia, Caledonia, you tempt the devil free.
Make an engine lose it's wings, make a fool right out of me.
Caledonia, who could own ya'? spirit of romance.
Caledonia, Oh, Caledonia dance!

Caledonia, Caledonia!  You make my senses fly
Give me reason to believe, and I don't wonder why.
Caledonia, Who could own ya'? Spirit of Romance.
Caledonia Whoa, Caledonia Dance!!

Caledonia, Caledonia..... Yeah, satisfy my soul
Caledonia, Caledonia.....  Well, Ohh, Move me slow!
Caledonia, Caledonia.....  Woooooo
Caledonia, Caledonia....    Hey.... HEY!!---Lyrics submitted by Thom.
