Well I might be a sinner 
and I never was a winner
Down in desolation
till I find my vocation
Found a real solution
that's gonna end my mind's confusion
Got my invitation to the final revelation

Well I used to be a sinner 
and I never was a winner
Down in desolation 
till I find my real vocation

Hey don't mind my pillar
I'm just looking for my Savior
Goin' over Jordan
I'm layin' down my burden

Used to be a sinner
and I never was a winner
Down in desolation
till I find my vocation---Lyrics submitted by honey mustard.
