Ooh, let's go

Are you ready, hey
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
I need a break, ah

Are you ready, hey
Are you ready for this
Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat
I need a break, ah

Are you ready, hey
Are you ready for this
Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat
I need a break beat

Outta the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat, hey

Yo, a for the kids in the club that's ready to get bugged
Another one bites the dust
A for the dogs with the burners, that wanna blast off
Another one bites the dust
And for the kids on the blocks, shootin' at the crooked cops, blaow
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, Wyclef, and another one gone, Dirty Cash
Another one bites the dust, Young Free, Freddie where you at?

Steve walks wearily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Some cat up in Brooklyn just got robbed with a Kangol
Are you ready, hey
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat, hey

My man got shot, and the block got hot
Another one bites the dust
Yo, hey I hear more shots, this is like Fort Knox kid
Another one bites the dust
Yo, hold your breath, and another one gone, hold your breath, and another gone
Hold your breath, another one bites the dust, yo, check it

If you're a soldier at ease
My military style is known to murder Nazi's, Brooklyn to Germany (ohhh, yeah)
My kamikaze will blow the U2, they hire Idi Amin in Timbuktu
Whether you indo, or do the Voodoo
You can't foresee this unless I bring the previews, yeah, yeah
Yo, it's the number one rappin' band, come on

Yo, this review will be critically acclaimed
Leave you in critical pain, clinically insane
The name Wyclef Jean, with a yes, yes y'all
Better have a vest y'all, I'll blast, and bless y'all, oh yeah
"F"- y'all, the mark of the beast, the triple six
Time running out, listen to the tick, oh yeah
If you see what I saw, then you seen what I seen
If you know what I know, you know what I mean, oh yeah
Commanding officer of the Navy Seal team
Once I give the orders, you feel the infrared beam, oh yeah, blaow

For all you critics, sayin' "another remake"
Another one bites the dust
Yo, if you know the deal, this is the master reel, kid
Another one bites the dust, oh yeah
And another one gone, right, and another one gone, right
Another one bites the dust, hey, Freddie Mercury, where you at yo

How do you think I'm gonna get along
Without you when you're gone
I need a break beat, oh yeah

Yo, if you're ready for the first of the month, for that welfare check, come on
Kicked me out on my own
I need a break beat
Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
I need a break beat
Outta the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, look out

Yo, bulletproof vests, like the wild, wild west
Another one bites the dust
Yo, this is a stickup, now take off your Rolex
Another one bites the dust
Yo, dirty money, good money, yo it's all money-money
Another one bites the dust
Yo, and another one gone, Dirty Cash, and another one gone, Dirty Cash
Another one bites the dust, the adventures of Dirty Cash

Yo, for the love for the cash, I'll blast you in my path
Keep my eyes on the math, you cats don't know the half, oh yeah
As far as I'm concerned, you cats can burn in flames
This ain't no game, I'm a start callin' names, oh yeah
So come get me, if you know the one-fifty
A million refugees ready to bust with me, oh yeah
Bloody, filthy, in this rap shhh
You gonna have to kill me, since you can't beat me, oh yeah
Pras, Dirty, Cash, you're the greedy
Believe me, you gotta let me fly like R. Kelly, oh yeah
Bite another dust with my man Freddie Mercury
What height nineties got ya cash, wannabe crazy, oh yeah, Navy Seal

Yo, I know you wanna see the (unknown lyric) bust bite the dust
So you can pay my body below the earth's crust, oh yeah
But I'm a small soldier that stays focused
With guts I rip the scab off and lay in the (unknown lyric) oh yeah
I'm an extraordinary military mercenary
Searching for extra intelligence I steady, oh yeah
My rhymes cut through the radio waves like machetes
The predator becomes the prey in the Serengeti, oh yeah
High priest Nash, no security purposely
To safely return the statue of Freddie Mercury, oh yeah
Verbally Wyclef, Pras and Free
Holding it for the refugee Navy Seal team, oh yeah

Practically, I tactically destroy
Deploy more decoys than a presidential convoy oh yeah
My whole envoy stay camouflaged out
And when I walk the street, I take the Refugee route oh yeah
This one go out to all my thugs in the borough
Soldier state, they're all like Kilamanjaro oh yeah
Split it with an arrow, my girl platoon roll
Outta control, the female Mandingos oh yeah
Free, I evolve from the egg of a seminarian
Don't go down, 'cause I'm a vegetarian oh yeah
And when I bust, it ain't in God we trust
And if you bring a gun, you better bring a black tusk oh yeah

She looked into my eyes and said FBI
Another one bites the dust, oh yeah
She said she loved me, she was a spy who lied
Another one bites the dust, right

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust

Let's go

Steve walks wearily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip---
