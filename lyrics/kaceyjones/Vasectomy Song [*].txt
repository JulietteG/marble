Honey,you will always be the man that I adore
But kids are such a pain in the butt, i don't want anymore
The sponge, the pills, the diaphragm, the contraceptive gel
The condom and IUD's  they didn't work so well.

Now that we had baby number six, don't you think it's time to get you fix 
a little steps, a little eyes and then we will both be worry-free.......
I made you in a point that  get vasectomy---Lyrics submitted by mae aude.
