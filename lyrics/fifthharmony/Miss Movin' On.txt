Im breaking down gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch a sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry
Im not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me but I survived
Now Im coming alive

Chorus: 
Ill never be that girl again
No ooh ohh
Ill never be that girl again
No ooh ohh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me
Call me
Call me
Miss movin on
Ohh ohh ohh
Miss movin on
Ohh ohh ohh

Yeah
I broke the glass surrounding me (surrounding me )
I aint the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side(the other side)
My whole world was electrified(electrified)
Now Im no longer afraid
Its Independence Day(Its Independence Day)

Chorus: 
Ill never be that girl again
No ooh ohh
Ill never be that girl again
No ooh ohh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me
Call me
Call me
Miss movin on

Bridge: 
Everything is changing
And I never want to go back to the way it was 
Im finding who I am
And who I am from here on now is going to be enough
Is going to be enough


Chorus: 
Ill never be that girl again
No ooh ohh
Ill never be that girl again
Ooh ooh ohh 
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me
Call me
Call me
Miss movin on
Ohh ohh ohh
Miss movin on
On and on and on and on and on
Miss movin on
On and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on
Yeah (6ce)
Yeah Im movin on---Lyrics submitted by Gabriella.
