These are the lyrics to Fifth Harmony's song Reflection.

Dinah:
I must confess, you're looking fresh (so fresh)
Yep, I'm impressed, go ahead flex (flex turn up)
Everybody be hatin' the way that you stealing the show
Cause oh you be killin' em just like Little Terio

Camila:
Oh, you can get anything you want (anything you want)
And can't nobody (can't nobody) ever tell you no (no no)
Don't need no filters on pictures before you post them on the gram
Shut down the internet they don't, even understand

Lauren:
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They don't make them quite like you
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
It ain't bragging if you know it's true

Normani:
Oh where you from (where you from), must be heaven
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession
Think I'm in love, 'cause you so sexy
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection

Camila:
Why'd you think I'm putting on my favorite perfume?
Why'd you think I'm in this dress so tight that I can barely move?
Why'd you think I'm dancing in these uncomfortable shoes?
I did it all, I did it all, I did it all for you

Lauren:
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you ever get it confused
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
It ain't bragging if you know it's true

Normani:
Oh where you from (where you from), must be heaven
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession
Think I'm in love, 'cause you so sexy
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection

Ally:
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call? (Snow White Snow White)
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
On the wall

Normani:
Oh where you from (what planet), must be heaven (okay)
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession (cha-ching)
Think I'm in love, 'cause you so sexy (you so sexy)
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you
I'm talking to my own reflection---
