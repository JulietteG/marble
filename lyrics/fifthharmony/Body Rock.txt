Ally:
I'm dancing in the rain, 'cause there's a fire burning deep inside of you
I'm locked into your chain, 'cause I'm addicted to the way your body moves

Normani:
Oh my heart racing and my temperature is blazing through the roof
And I'm tired of this charade, 'cause I can't hide the way I'm fiending over you

Lauren:
I'm overwhelmed I might as well stay underneath the spell you put on me
And when you touch me, I can feel it in my veins like electricity

Fifth Harmony:
All day I'm only think 'bout you
All day you got me going baby
Always I love the way your body rocks when we rock, you rock with me
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
See this is how real love suppose to be
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
Say this is how real love suppose to be
Body rock

Dinah:
And it makes no sense at all
How your love takes me off the wall
And make my body rock

Fifth Harmony (Dinah ad-libs):
All day I'm only think 'bout you
All day you got me going baby
Always I love the way your body rocks when we rock, you rock with me
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
See this is how real love suppose to be
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
Say this is how real love suppose to be

Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Body rock
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Body rock
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air---
