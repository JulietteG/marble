Normani:
Same words, same thirst
Just a different name
Same jokes, same laugh
Guess that's just your game
You got at her the same way you got at me
You show me everything I need to see

Camila:
Well even though you're so damn fine
I know I'm better off without ya
Even if you cross my mind
I would always have to doubt ya

Lauren:
I won't believe a thing you say
This time
All them other girls told me how you play your game
Yeah we know all about you

I know it probably worked for you
Last time
But them other girls told me how you play your game
Yeah we know all about you

Dinah:
Ooooh we know we know we know
We know we know we know

Ooooh we know we know we know
We know we know we know

Ally:
First off you should really be ashamed
You won't entice me with that big ol chain (Normani: aaaah)
Can't have my number put that phone away
Maybe you should just stay in your lane

Camila:
Well even though you're so damn fine
I know I'm better off without ya
Even if you cross my mind
I would always have to doubt ya

Lauren:
I won't believe a thing you say
This time
