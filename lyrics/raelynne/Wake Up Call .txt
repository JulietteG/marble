[Verse]
I didn't hear what you were saying.
I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me.
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it babe.

[Bridge]
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now Im taking love
And its not my fault
Cause you both deserve
What is coming now
So dont say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so.

[Breakdown]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Bridge]
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now Im taking love
And its not my fault
Cause you both deserve
Whats coming now

So dont say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I dont feel so bad, I dont feel so bad, I dont feel so bad

[Breakdown]
I'm so sorry darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

Woah oh ohh

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here anymore? I dont feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Dont you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I dont think so.
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He wont come around here anymore
No, he wont come around here. I dont feel so bad

I dont feel so bad (Wake up call)
I dont feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I dont feel so bad (Dont you care about me anymore?)
Care about me? I dont feel so bad.
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore? ---
