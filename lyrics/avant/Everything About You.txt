everything about you
if i...
could get inside your mind and let my light shine like no other man would
if i...
can physically, mentally, and emotionally make you feel like no other could
if i...
can take you to my house and lay u on the couch and do my thang
if i...
express to you the way i feel in the song about the cure you bring

chorus
is it your hair No!
your eyes No!
your face No!
its everything about you.
its your neck, No!
your breasts, No!
your navel,
its everything about you.
Its your ears,No!
your thighs No! (my gurl)
your beautiful toes.
Its everything about you. I dont have one thing that I dont love about you girl.
Its everything about you

If I...
Can smell the morning dew and your body scent too laying next to me
If I...
Can give you protection, love, and affection so baby, you dont have to worry.
If I ...
Can be your teddy bear, or the one that truly cares when it hurts so much.
If I...
Can be the one that fits in your life, like a Mit or a hand in glove...(i'll be)
Ill be your sunshine, when your in the rain, (And I will)
Ill give you my happiness and Ill take your pain...yeah!

Is it your hair, No!
your eyes, No!
your face, No!
Its everything about you.
Its your neck, No! (My Girl)
Your breasts, No!
Your navel,
Its everything about you.
Its your ears, No!
Your thighs, No!
Your beautiful toes.
Its everything about you.
I dont have one thing that I dont love about you girl.
Its everything about you

You can get to know me, get to love me for who I am
and if you need some time to make up your mind I wont give a damn... No
Cause you are so special, worth more than, diamonds and pearls
Girl I want you to be, No you need to be part of my world.

Chorus x2

Is it your hair, No!
your eyes, No!
your face, No!
Its everything about you.
Its your neck, No!
Your breasts, No!
Your navel,
Its everything about you.
Its your ears, No!
Your thighs, No!
Your beautiful toes.
Its everything about you.
I dont have one thing that I dont love about you girl.
Its everything about you---Lyrics submitted by francisco.
