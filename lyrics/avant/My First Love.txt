Silhouette, of a perfect frame,
Shadows of your smile, will always remain (Will always remain).
Beginners love, soon fades away (Oh Baby)
We go on...
I Will long as...

(Long as I live)
Long as I live, you will be my, (my first love).
Oh baby you and only you.
(Long as I live)
Long as I live (my first love) you will be my first love.
And I choose you again.

I'm keeping no Candy-Coated Valentine,
Memories of you, you when you were mine.
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain,
Times keep changing come sun or rain.

(Long as I Live)
Long as I live, you will be (my first love)
My first love and my only love.
(Long as I live)
Long as I live,(my first love).
Ohhh, you will always be my,
Oh, be my first love.

(Long as I Live)
Long as I live, you will be (my first love)
My first love and my only love.
(Long as I live)
Long as I live,(my first love).
Ohhh, you will always be my,
Oh, be my first love. 

A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain,
Avant:
times keep changing come sun or rain.

(Long as I Live)
Long as I live, you will be (my first love)
My first love and my only love.
(Long as I live)
Long as I live,(my first love).
Ohhh, you will always be my,
Oh, be my first love.---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
