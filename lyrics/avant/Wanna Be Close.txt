I want to be everything your mans not.
And Im going to give you every little thing Ive got.
Cos you are more than a man needs
Thats why i say your truly my destiny

Im gonna get you until if it takes forever.
No you dont feel me if forever turns into never.
Ill let you know  my love is just as strong.
And for you never aint for  that long

I wanna be the smile you put on your face.
I wanna be your hands when you say your grace.
I wanna be whatever your favourite place.
I just wanna be close

I wanna be the hat that you put on your head.
I wanna be the sheets that you put on your bed.
I wanna be the skirt wrapped around your legs.
Oh , I just wanna be close

And even if the day turns into night.
I will love you by the candlelight.
And even if the water starts to run over.
Ill be there to put you on my shoulder.oohh yeaahh
And if its hard for you to get to sleep.
I will sing you a melody.
I wanna feel this way till the end of time.
Cos I pray one day that you will be mine.

I wanna be the smile you put on your face.
I wanna be your hands when you say your grace.
I wanna be whatever is you favourite place.
I just wanna be close

I wanna be the hat that you put on your head.
I wanna be the sheets you put on your bed.
I wanna be the skirt wrapped around your legs.
Oh , I just wanna be close

See my lifes filled with ups and downs.
Im ok when your around.
And when Im in a storm.
And my nights are cold.
Reach out your hands for me to hold

So your my queen on a throne.
And your the reason.
For a song and I cant wait.
To fill you up with love.
Fill you with love

I wanna be the sun.
Your stars,your moon.
I wanna be a hot summers day in june.
I wanna be your smell.
Of your perfume.
I just wanna be close

I wanna be the seed .
That bare your life.
I wanna be the one.
Thats so faithful and true.
I wanna be the man down that aisle.
In that suit , yes
I just wanna be close.

I wanna be the sun.
Your stars,your moon.
I wanna be a hot summers day in june.
I wanna be your smell.
Of your perfume.
I just wanna be close.

I wanna be the seed .
That bare your life.
I wanna be the one.
Thats so faithful and true.
I wanna be the man down that aisle.
In that suit , yes
I just wanna be close.

I wanna be the sun.
Your stars,your moon.
I wanna be a hot summers day in june.
I wanna be your smell.
Of your perfume.
I just wanna be close.---Lyrics submitted by dylan.
