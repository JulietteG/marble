verse

this is so amazin
got my heart racin
the way it goes down
im not afraid to say
that you can take charge
got my eyes in the back of my head
while im seein stars

its sounds like ya ready girl
for daddy girl
and we dont have to prolong
in fact
we can get a track
and do it to the sound of a hand clap

chorus

let me handle that
(oooh just how u like it babe)
ill give you what u lack
(dont take it in a negative way)
baby its a fact
when we get up in this sack
im gonna break yo back
(in a good way)

verse

stop 
let me start again
i can hear u moanin
and we not alone yes,
i can see our shadows on the wall
movin gracefully

its people in the other room but
i dont really give a damn baby
ill be really missin u and
i am sick and tired of waitin
forever whenever baby
i am defininatly ready
we can role play
and make it a game

chorus

let me handle that
(oooh just how u like it babe)
ill give you what u lack
(dont take it in a negative way)
baby its a fact
when we get up in this sack
im gonna break yo back
(in a good way)

repeat chorus

verse

???
baby ring the alarm
we about to get it on
ill do whatever it takes
just to keep you sastified
we dont have to worry bout a thing
cause im goin all night

chorus
let me handle that
(oooh just how u like it babe)
ill give you what u lack
(dont take it in a negative way)
baby its a fact
when we get up in this sack
im gonna break yo back
(in a good way)---Lyrics submitted by chetavia.
