{Verse 1}
I know you gowin thru alotta thangs...
I can see it in your eyes but i can't explain it....
Said you wishin' looking so strange...
Like a picture on the wall without the frame and...
If tears fall i wanna be there to catch'em...
Just let me babe...
And if you get lost let me change your direction...
It's this way...
Girl he's...Not treatin' you like a queen...
And i hate when he cause a scene...
I wouldn't do it in my wildest dream...No...
Don't let it happen...
Cause baby you are so beautiful...
I don't wanna step on his toes but i think he should know...

{Chorus}
You neva had someone...
That's all about your needs...
You neva had someone...
That always do you properly...
You neva had someone...
to give you what you waitin for...
You neva had someone...
But now...
Baby you got someone...
You ain't had, Neva had no one to lay you down...
Start up on the bed...
when we finish we'll be on the ground...
But yo head ain't been workin...
Girl i know you been hurtin...
But baby don't you worry...
Cause now you got someone...(Got someone)

{Verse 2}
At home with yo head down...
Dont wanna show yo face from the confrentation...
Can't even go to work now...
Gotta call off saying that you need a vacation...
I don't know why...You let him do it....(why you let him do it girl)
But it seems you gettin use to it...(Yeah)
Girl you...
Don't have to make an excuse...
Bout the crazy things he do...
You ain't gotta take the abuse...No...
Even though its none of my business...
Im right there til' yo sky turn grey...
Girl believe in me...I'll neva treat you that way...

{Chorus}
You neva had someone...
Thats all about your needs...
You neva had someone...
That always do you properly...
You neva had someone...
Ta give you what you been waitin for...
You neva had someone...
But now...Baby you got someone...
You ain't had,Neva had no one ta lay you down...
Start up on the bed...
When we finish we'll be on the ground...
But yo head ain't been workin...
And i know you been hurtin...
But baby don't you worry...
Cause now you got someone...(got someone)
