Storm clouds hanging over head
offer not the slightest bit of comfort
for the first time in days
i wait till discovered disasters that ive
slept though,while i felt so alive

So we say goodbye So we say goodbye
heartsrings severed just as quick as they were discovered
So we say goodbye So we say goodbye
ill breakmy own fall , to keep you picture perfect
just dont wake me up now

Chorus:
So say goodbye close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong

The silence she whispered to me
telling me things we dare to speak out loud
the collaboration of the blindings on
through vacant streets hits home hard
like a hatchet to the skull
i'd keep you here if it kept me warm
and these winters away your hands
were the only hands needed to hold me
for the first time in days...i fell alive

in the end we'll both rot together
in the end we'll rot together
our love lies in embers,our love lies in embers

(Repeat Chorus)

Peering out those same cracked windows
that i studied for days upon days
suddenly collapse..It all falls down

(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by paul.
