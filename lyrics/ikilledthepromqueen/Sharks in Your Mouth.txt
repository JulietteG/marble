If I ruled the earth I'd sail ships over seas till sundown.
Then I'd return in dark to walk these streets alone.

By day I hear the serpents calling me
this leads me from the shore in search of the deepest abyss.
I am forever covering my tracks, I'm standing hear with little less than an existence.
though I hold the keys to everything.

this sinking feeling never dies.
I'll chase my sunset laced with pride in this heartless gallion.

although I'd rather fill my lungs and rapidly descend.
and lay with my thoughts under a bleak starlight.
I'll keep pushing on though this perpetually darkness.
then in hell I'll seek my confidence.

then I'd return in dark to walk these streets alone.
the twilight here won't embrace my words like waves do.
the feeling of dryland is making me sick.
So I stand here coughing up sharks till
My neon glowing neck breaks

This sinking feeling never dies
I'll chase my sunset laced with pride in this heartless gallion

walking through the dark hears to a new beginning.
it's time to bow your heads to a nations swinging axe.
while you search for answers planted in the ground.

I'm happy watching you dance your legs down to your knees.
I'm happy watching you be inflactuated with love.
I'm happy watching you... watching you die

this war with myself never ends.
this war with myself never...

the only way I'd return is to an orchestra on wolves.
the only way I'd return is if I ruled the earth. ---Lyrics submitted by Josue.
