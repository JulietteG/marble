Oh, the waves crash and the tide pulls out
It's an angry sea there is no doubt
That the lighthouse will keep shinin' out
To warn the lonely sailor
The lightnin' strikes and the wind cuts cold
Through the sailor's bones to the sailor's soul
Till there's nothing left that he can hold
Except the rolling ocean

But I am ready for the storm
Yes Sir, ready
I am ready for the storm
I'm ready for the storm

Oh, give me mercy for my dreams
'Cause every confrontation seems
To tell me what it really means
To be this lonely sailor
And when you take me by your side
You love me warm, you love me
And I   should have realized
I had no reasons to be frightened

But I am ready for the storm
Yes Sir, ready
I am ready for the storm
I'm ready for the storm

The distance it is no real friend
And time will take its time
And you will find that in the end
It brings you me, the lonely sailor
And when the sky begins to clear
The sun it melts away my fear
I'll   cry a silent weary tear
For those that need to love me.

But I am ready for the storm
Yes Sir, ready
I am ready for the storm
Yes Sir, ready
I am ready for the storm
Yes Sir, ready
I am ready for the storm
I'm ready for the storm---Lyrics submitted by Brenda.
