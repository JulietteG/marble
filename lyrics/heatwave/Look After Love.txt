The stars fill my eyes
When you're, by my side
And words weren't invented
For moment like this
Only a kiss.

So don't ever leave
I'll always be there
And we'll live a life 
Filled with moments
And memories unfold

[Chorus]
So let's look after love
And we'll be alright
Hold on to all we've been sharing, caring

Let's look after love
And we'll do just fine 
Keep all this sweet dreams alive
(In my mind)

I don't have to try
I know, I can smile
'Cause you bring me magic
That shines through my day, lightens my way

And each time, we've touched
I fall more in in love
'Cause we found that something
That time can't erase
Together always, always together

[Chorus]
So let's look after love
And we'll be alright
Hold on to all we've been sharing, caring---Lyrics submitted by Howard Byrdsong.
