ANGEL COME TO ME
LET ME BE
PART OF ALL THE LOVE YOU ARE
CUZ ANGEL WE COULD FLY
YOU AND I
FLY A RAINBOW TO THE SKY
(CHORUS)
SO HOLD ME ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
STAY TILL THE DAY IS BRIGHT
AND ANGEL DON'T EVER GO (DON'T BREAK THE SPELL)
CUZ YOU'RE THE STAR OF THE STORY
I'LL ALWAYS TELL
YOU ARE- MY STAR (2X)
ANGEL
I USED TO SAY
YESTERDAY
LOVE WAS ONLY IN A DREAM
BUT ANGEL
GUESS I WAS WRONG ALL ALONG
JUST TOOK YOU TO MAKE ME SEE
(CHORUS)
I LOVE SO WELL
YOU ARE-MY STAR (2X)
GUTIAR INTERLUDE 

CHORUS  TILL FADE OUT---Lyrics submitted by MICHELLE.
