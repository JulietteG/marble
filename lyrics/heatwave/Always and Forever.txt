Always and forever, each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and

Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you forever, forever

There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and

Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you ever, ever

Loving you is the thing that I've planned
For a very long time
Me with you, you with me, we as one
Love together for a very long time
Loving you, you, baby

Always, forever love you
Always, forever love you
Always, forever love you

I said, "Forever love you, love you"
Ever and the day and one day
Loving you, you, you, you, you
Forever, tomorrow's tomorrow

Ever and a day, ever and a day
Ever, everyday, yeah, you
Loving you forever, ever, you, you
Forever---
