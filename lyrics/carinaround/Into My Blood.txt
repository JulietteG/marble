Read between smoking silhouettes
Did not catch sight of you yet

Oh why
Is it so unkind?

Silver morning brings something to fight
Into the frame of its idiot night
It keeps me inside

I wait all my life
Just for the rush
The passing of fire
Into my blood

All the reasons that raced through my mind
Just to keep me twisted and drowned 
I leave them behind

Watch the people get tricked out of time
Every dream they had passing them by
It's freedom to find

I wait all my life
Just for the rush
The passing of fire
Into my blood

Wait all my life
Just for the rush
The passing of fire into my blood
Into my blood

Burn the secrets I know a landslide
We'll always fall on the eclipse side
Tell me I've got no other way home/down 
The way
I wait all my life
Just for the rush
The fear and the fight towards the inside
Into the light, ready to burn
I wait no more or hang on my turn
Move too slow, it's like waiting to die
To diffuse my mind
A dream that's/less defined 
Into the flow/ hands to the floor 
This feeling is pure
They're shooting up love
Into my blood
Into my blood---Lyrics submitted by viana.
