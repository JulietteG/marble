I will be friendly 
(Please don't be...)
My soul came to be terrified
(...so terrified)
Please don't be so shy

So will you never be my lover or my valentine 
Never be a friend of mine
Never see my better side 
Maybe you'd be terrified 
Of all the secrets you were wishing you won't ever find 
'Cause deep inside me 
And I don't wanna hide me

'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love

Yeah, pick it fast like a flight far away from here (fly away)
Before I know I feel at home whenever you are near
Live my life, you better cold cut to this
I wish you'd hold me open just to see your vision clear

'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)

'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
About my love
About my love
About my love

I will be friendly 
(Please don't be...)
My soul came to be terrified
(...so terrified)
Please don't be so shy---Lyrics submitted by Ruby Cheng.
