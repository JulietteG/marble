(originally by Imogen Heap)

Eat, sleep,
And breathe that you're full of the stuff
Go back, get tied up tight
Wheat-meat-dairy-free, tee total,
So happy clappy high on life
You should try it, you know
Go on while no one's looking

A-ha! caught you now!
Caught ya red handed in the biscuit tin!
Cost you to keep me quiet

Golden boy boots
Pocket pedestal
Picking shots at my moves
Plastic, tin can, paper, separated
Busy bee wave, wave 'save the planet' flag
But sneaky in suburbia

A-ha! candid camera!
Hook, line and sinker
For the four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Keep me quiet! (keep me quiet!)

Nicest sweetest
Utmost in everything
It's so charming, very charming
Well reckon play the fool no one's ill at ease
And put the deepest Swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming ---Lyrics submitted by Landon.
