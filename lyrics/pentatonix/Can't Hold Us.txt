PTX, get up! What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isnt
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit me
Get up! Fresh out pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and cosby sweatergang nope nope yall cant copy
Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on broadway,
Ha! and we do it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
into everything I record
And yep yep yep yep Im on
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T cause ha,
Chasing dreams since we were 14
With the four track
bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack,
fat cat, crushing

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
like the ceiling cant hold us,
like the ceiling cant hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. yeah I'm so damn grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But thats what you get when wu tang raised you
Yall cant stop me, go hard
like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And Im eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raise those hands, this is a party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me then from that failure gain humility we keep marching

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
like the ceiling cant hold us,
like the ceiling cant hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

Pa ra rap pa pa

Pa pa pa pa
(Pa pa pa)

(So we put our hands up)
Oooh wooooooaaaah! [2x]

Nana nana nana nana
Oooohhhhh
(So we put our hands up)
[3x]
Nana nana nana nana
Ooh woaah woaaaaahh!!!!

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
like the ceiling cant hold us,
like the ceiling cant hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up
like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us ---
