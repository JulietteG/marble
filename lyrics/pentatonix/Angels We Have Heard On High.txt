Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Angels we have heard on high
Singing sweetly through the night
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their brave delight
        Glooooo-gloris
        In excel sis Deo
        Gloria

Oh shepherds, why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heav'nly song
        Gloria
        In excel sis Deo
        Glooooo-gloria

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angel sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord; the newborn
        King (Gloria)
        Gloria (In excel sis Deo)
        Gloria
        In excel sis Deo
        Gloria
        In excel sis Deo

Angels we have heard
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
Oh in excel sis 
        Deo---Lyrics submitted by Laila Maxwell.
