We've come to far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars
Hey

We're up all night, all night to get
Up all night to get- get- get lucky

Last night I had this dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
There's nothing wrong with just a little bit of fun
We were dancing all night long
Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I hope this dream comes true

One more time
