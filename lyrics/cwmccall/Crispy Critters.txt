One day about four er five years ago
We 'as settin' at the Conoco station
Kickin' tires, an' swattin' flies
An' dis-cussin' the state a the union
When right out in front a the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
An' thirty five hippies an' dogs inside
About half of 'em went fer the courthouse lawn
An' them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
An' I sez "Roy, go git yer Flit gun"
He sez "which is the hippies, an' which is the dogs?"
I sez "beats the hell outta me Roy"
What they was, was a bunch a them crispy critters
And the leader was a space cadet
An' he sez "Sagitarius, we has arrived
Prepare to disembark man
Get the incense goin' an' the sitar out
We gonna camp in the city park man"
I sez "Boys, le'me 'splain the sit-u-ation to ya
A, you gettin' me down
An' B, we got us a leash law here
An' C, you in the wrong town
You drop one string a beads in that there park
An' you gonna see a whole lotta stars
You got fifteen seconds to git outta town boys
Or we gonna blow ya to Mars

Well they all got back in their purple bus
An' proceeded to the city limits
Then the telephone rang, it was the swimmin' pool
Sez a mess a wild critters 'as in it
So we all got in the Marshall's Plymouth
Which 'as always at the Conoco station
Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool
To give them critters a citation
By the time we arrived it 'as too damn late
Them critters's all had their pants down
Them dogs 'as a tearin the bathouse apart
An' they's after the fish in the fish pond
I sez Roy, you git the one in the silver teeshirt
An' I'll git the rest with a net
We gona have a jail full a naked crispy critters
An' a drip dry space cadet

{Funky Interlude - Man there's banjo's 'n washboards, 'n pots-'n-pans, an' a mess a wild hootin' an' hollerin'}

Well we gave 'em hell but we lost the war
Cause them critters out-numbered us
So they moved in, an' set up camp
An' they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later there 'as nothin' in town
But eighty-four dogs, an' a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds, an' sunflower seeds
An' astrological postcards
Yeah, the critters took over the city council
An' the dogs all barked their brains out
An' the whole damn town was crispy critters
An' the mayor was a space cadet ---Lyrics submitted by David Rhoads.
