There was no room for me in a room full of you,
There were doors all around, but I couldn't find the keys,
When we ran out of air
We didn't know what to do
Suffocated by love in a room with no view
Am I sorry?
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm sorry
But why do I feel so sorry?
When I'm not really sure,
When I'm not really sure what I'm sorry for?

Oh, I tried to tell you a thousand times
That we both needed space to find some peace of mind
And I could have made you happy
Though you know, you know I tried
You know I tried
I gave you everything
I didn't think twice
And I lost myself in the sacrifice
No, I could have made you happy
How with every breath, I died
'Cause there's no room for me in a room full of you

In between all the noise, silence build a China wall
We build it up to the sky
Throwing stones to watch them fall
Did I hurt you?
You know I didn't mean to
Then I tried too hard not to love you
Like I could've cared less,
No I couldn't, well I couldn't, no I couldn't care more

I tried to tell you a thousand times
That we both needed space to find some peace of mind
And I could have made you happy
Though you know how hard I tried
You know I tried
I gave you everything
I didn't think twice
And I lost myself in the sacrifice
No, I could have made you happy
How with every breath, I died
You know I died
'Cause there's no room for me in a room full of you

When I said I didn't love you
Did you know I lied, I lied, I lied?
Say goodbye
Said that I need you, said that I need you
Like I said I gave you everything
I didn't think twice
And I lost myself in the sacrifice,
No, I couldn't make you happy
And with every breath, I died
'Cause there's no room
No there's no room for me
In a room full of you

And the doors are closing now, I'm walking out
'Cause there's no room for me in a room full of you,
And there's no room left for you, for me, goodbye goodbye

I'd like to say I don't love you, but that would be a lie---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Plescia.
