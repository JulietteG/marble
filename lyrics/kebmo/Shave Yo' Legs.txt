You don't need no fancy tricks, painted eyes or glossy lips.
I love you just the way you are, hope you don't mind my beat up car.
You don't need to change your dress, you don't need to change your shoes.
Don't try to hide your natural looks, forget about the cover, lemme read the book.
Don't get me wrong I like those heels, but, the way I feel is the way I feel.
You don't need to change your dress, you don't need to change your shoes.
Go ahead be wild and free, you don't have to shave your legs for me.

Honey Babe don't starve yourself, you're looking good you're looking well
And I'm proud to have you by my side, glad to have you in my life..
You don't have to clean my house, you don't have to wash my clothes.
Go ahead be wild and free, you don't have to shave your legs for me.

You're an angel.    Mmmm

You don't have to read them magazines, you already know how to get to me.
Just be yourself and I will to, that's all we really have to do.
You don't have to be ashamed, you don't have to hide your knees
Go ahead be wild and free, you don't have to shave your legs for me.
Now,Go ahead be wild and free, you don't have to shave your legs for me.

Mmmm , you don't have to shave your legs for me.
