I been high
I been low
I been everywhere I wanted to go
But I never been here before

I been all around the world
Even outer space
But what I'm seeing right now
Feels like a brand new place

I was so damn close
If it was a snake
It would have bit me
Crawling right under my nose

Baby I must admit it
That I really didn't get it

But now you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
La-la-ba-dee-dah
How could I have been so blind?
Cause now you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
Oh baby
La-la-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
I see love

I been in
I been out
Of every kind of love affair
But all I ever got was the blues

I've had money, cars
And some good champagne
But your love much better
Than all them things

I'm so glad to have you
Here with me
Standing right under my nose

Baby I must admit it
That now I really get it

And that's why I'm singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
La-la-ba-dee-dah
How could I have been so blind?
Lord have mercy, you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
Oh baby
La-la-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
I see love

Oh and I'm so glad to have you
Here with me
Standing right under my nose

Baby I must admit it
That now I really get it

And that's why I'm singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
La-la-ba-dee-dah
How could I have been so blind?
Cause now you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
Oh baby
La-la-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
I see love

Oh baby
La-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
