Every mornin' an' every evenin'
Every day I, I think of you
The way you love me, through and through

And when I'm with you, it feels like heaven
And you're an angel, holdin' me
Your sweet, sweet lovin', it sets me free

And in my wildest, imagination
I could never, imagine you
Lovin' me as much as, as I do you

And it may be winter, it may be fall
I might have plenty or nothin' at all
But, baby, I'll be there whenever you call, ever you call

'Cause every mornin' and every evenin'
Every day I, I think of you
The way you love me, through and through
The way you love me, through and through---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
