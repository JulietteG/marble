When the music starts to playin
She slides out on the floor
Dancing without a partner
Swaying on the two and four

There's a rhythm in her footsteps
And a flower in her hair
A smile on her face
Cause she's in a place
Where she don't have a care

She ain't looking for no lover
She ain't looking for a romance
She just wants to dance
She just wants to dance
Yeah she just wants to dance
Ooo she just wants to dance

Well she's moving kinda lazy
And it's obvious to me
This little girl ain't crazy
She's as wild as she is free

She can feel it in her fingers
And it moves on down her spine
And when it hits her hips
She parts her lips
And you know she's feeling fine

She ain't looking for no lover
She ain't looking for a romance
She just wants to dance
She just wants to dance
Yeah she just wants to dance
She just wants to dance
Oh go on get it girl

She ain't looking for no lover
She ain't looking for a romance
She just wants to dance
She just wants to dance
Get out the way and let the girl dance
Yeah she just wants to dance
Yeah she just wants to
Slide along the floor
She wanna shuffle her shoes and shake her hips
She wanna wave her hands in the air
She wanna shake that hanky
Yeah
But she don't want no hanky panky
Yeah she just wants to dance
Leave her alone
And let her dance ---
