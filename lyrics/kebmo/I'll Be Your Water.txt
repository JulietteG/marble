Do you ever get worried
And your load is hard to bear
And your life is like a sad sad story
No one nobody really cares?

But if you ever need someone to talk to
And if you ever need a helping hand
I'll be your ship out on the ocean
I'll be your water in the desert sand

I've been there, I've felt like you do
Feelin' like winter would never turn to spring
And everybody I know has got problems
But there's a solution to everything

And if you ever need someone to talk to
And if you ever need a helping hand
I'll be your ship out on the ocean
I'll be your water in the desert sand

And after you've found your way
You won't owe me nothin'
'Cause you're gonna know that your well
Will never run dry, never run dry

If you ever need someone to talk to
And if you ever need a helping hand
I'll be your ship out, your ship out on the ocean
I'll be your water in the desert sand

I'll be your water and I will give you shelter
I'll be your water, I will be there for you
I'll be your ship out on the ocean
I'll be your water in the desert sand---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
