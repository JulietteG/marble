When I first laid eyes on you
I swore Id do anything
But you cleaned me up, fixed me up
Just to get you to wear my wedding ring
Now Ive having second thoughts
And Im writing you this letter
Im scared to tell you to your face
That I like the old me better.

I like the old me better
I was a lot more fun
I like the old me better
Didnt take crap from anyone
But Id sleep all day, party all night
Do whatever I want whatever I liked
Baby, you made me a brand new man
But I like the old me better

Dont get me wrong, it aint that bad
And I appreciate your work
I dont drink too much I dont swear too much
You even made me go to church
I aint done much talkin since the day we got together
Im a different man because of you
But I like the old me better

I like the old me better
I was a lot more fun
I like the old me better
Didnt take crap from anyone
But Id sleep all day, party all night
Do whatever I want whatever I liked
You made me a brand new man
But I like the old me better

No doubt about it, youre the only one
And I know you really love the man that Ive become
But I like the old me better
I was a lot more fun
I like the old me better
Didnt take crap from anyone
But Id sleep all day, party all night
Do whatever I want whatever I liked
You made me a brand new man
But I like the old me better

Well I got to say you are the only one that Ive ever loved
You and I have a good thing, were like hand in glove
But now Im sitting here looking back
Wearing this stupid sweater
Truth be told I got to say
I like the old me better

I like the old me better
I was a lot more fun
I like the old me better
Didnt take crap from anyone
But Id sleep all day, party all night
Do whatever I want whatever I liked
You made me a brand new man
But I like the old me better
You made me a brand new man
But ImeI like the old me better.---Lyrics submitted by Assad Shoman.
