Heavenly father up above
Have mercy on me
After 7 years of bad bad love 
I finally got free
I dont mean to seem ungrateful 
You answered my prayers 
And father if youre able
Dont let me do the same damn thing all over again

You get the fever
You get the itch 
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again

Oh mighty father great and good
You need to be in my shoes
You let me fall in love just like before 
And now Im stepping in a big pile of the blues
But now the honeymoon is over
Lets not pretend
I guess I never
Learned my lesson
I did the same damn thing all over again

You get the fever
You get the itch 
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again

Mother Mary, father Joe
I need to talk to your son
He had troubles just like mine
And hes the chosen one
So if I ever go to heaven, will that be the end?
Or will I fall for some sweet little angel
And do the same damn thing all over again

You get the fever
You get the itch 
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money, the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
