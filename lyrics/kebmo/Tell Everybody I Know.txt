lt`s no secret, l don`t care
Gonna shout it out everywhere
Well, l love my baby,
hot, cold, fast, or slow
l love my baby, gonna tell everybody l know
ln the evening in my bed l hear voices in my head
They say, Never, never, ever let her go
l love my baby,gonna tell everybody l know
l love my baby,gonna tell everybody l know
Other women don`t mean
a thing to meWell, you can pick them all up,
dump them all in the sea

`Cause if l got no money, she don`t care
She`ll open up her pocketbook
and pay my fare l know she loves me,
up, down, high, and low Love my baby,
gonna tell everybody l know l love my baby,
got to tell everybody l know

Other women,
they don`t mean a thing to me
Yeah, you can pick them all up,
drop them all in the sea
`Cause if l got no money,she don`t care
She`ll open up her pocketbook
and pay my fare
l know she loves me,
up, down, high, and low
l love my baby,
gonna tell everybody l know
Love my baby,
gonna tell everybody l know
Oh, she`s a sweet thing
Fine thing, baby
Lovely thing, darling
Tell everybody
Tell my baby
Hot, cold, fast, or slow

Great big eyes
Great big lips
Little skinny legs
Got them big, wide hips
Tell everybody
Tell everybody l know
l love my baby
Hot, cold, fast, or slow
Tell everybody l know
Tell everybody Everybody l know
