Brother,
I need to talk to you
This might sound strange
And you'll probably think I'm crazy
and I've lost my mind
well, OK
I'm amazing 
I'm incredible 
I'm a miracle; a dream come true
and I'm marvelous
I'm beautiful
Guess What?
So are you 

People 
It's becoming clear
i can feel down in my soul 
I know that I am you
And you are me 
Uh-oh
and I'm grateful 
for the simple things that we take for granted everyday
Listen,
I can walk i can talk
I can use my mind
OK
I'm amazing 
I'm incredible 
I'm a miracle; a dream come true
I'm marvelous
I'm beautiful
Guess What? 
So are you

That don't mean we're better 
than anyone or anything
It's a call to come together
and except responsibility
and be amazing 
incredible 
your a miracle a dream come true
I'm marvelous
I'm beautiful
Guess What?
So are you
Guess What? 
so are you
That's right 
so are you---Lyrics submitted by camisha.
