People come and
People go
They take and they give
Build you up
Just to let you down
That's just the way it is
All I need is one friend
To get me through the day
One friend
That never goes away
Only one friend
To understand
And never let me down
I've been in love 
I've been in pain
I'm a sinner
And a saint
No matter where I am
Or what I do
It's you I appreciate
All I need is one friend
To get me through the day
One friend
That never goes away 
Only one friend
To understand
And never let me down
Can't nobody love you
More than you love yourself
And as long as I've got my one good friend
I don't need nobody else
All I need is one friend
To get me through the day
One friend
That never goes away 
Only one friend
To understand
And never let me down---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
