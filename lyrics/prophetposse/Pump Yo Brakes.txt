Yeah! (Yeah!) (Yeah!)
Nickscarfo,
Prophet Posse,
It's goin' down,
The world's most crunkest group,
Straight out the M,
Adn we ain't talkin' shit,

Gimmie some room hoe, x3] x2
[Pump yo brakes, followed by the peel,
... M till I die, know I'm trill,]
[... Gimmie some elbow, x3]

(Verse 1)
Now umma kick back,
Like a big, fat,
Misaac,
While Prophet Posse rang the shit out of you son of bitch ass,
Think I'm playing, then observe what a nigga goin' do,
I swear to God I ain't goin' stop until my time done got through,
It's very simple, lemme do my best to try to explain,
???????????????, (Yeah!),
It's wang for some change, it's change for some wang,
Done deal that's that... don't play no fuckin' games,

(Verse 2)
I'm 'bout to crack him with this bottle and send him to la-la land,
You so hard, you so gangsta, all yo niggas ran,
Scattered like buckshots,
Them fighters, I think not,
The only thing you punching is bags and time clocks,
Cause uh, the bigger you is, the harder you fall,
I'm hollain' "Timba", nothing ain't goin' cushion the fall,
Playa stop while you ahead, all that thuggin',
And muggin',
Ain't goin' get it,
You need some nuts, and some big ass tittes,
Yeah,

[Gangsta Boo]
Ey, fall up off a mu'hfuckin' mack like Gangsta Boo,
You know, like I know,
That I don't,
Fuck with you,
Never will I bow,
Down,
Take back, I'll wear the crown,
Listen to my damn sounds,
It's comin' from the undaground,

Undaground, x3

Rap,
Sippin' on purple while I'm in the back,
Of the 'lac,
Nigga like that,
I'll be at the same block, same hoe,
Same house, same sto',
Same folks, lookin' good, bitch, I ain't change hoe,

[DooD'Nem]
Don't get mad cause yo hoe all in my face,
You better think again boy and pump yo brakes,
Cause I'm a pistol-packin',
Jackin',
Ass nigga from the Mound,
I got my Prophet niggas with me so you know it's goin' down,
2 round,
3 down,
That's what I be throwin' up,
I hope you gotcho Re's on, you better stay pumped up,
I'm buck,
You crunk,
Look pimpin' nigga what it do,
When they pull us out the club, umma bust my fuckin' 2,
Nigga, Bitch!
