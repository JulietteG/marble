Back to det nigga, (What?!),
Yo Gotti (Yo Gotti)... Kelo nigga, (Kelo Nigga!),
G-A-M-E,
It's a mothafuckin' G-A-M-E,

Umma,
[Cop it (cop it), cook it (cook it), cut it (cut it), sell it (sell it),] x8

[Yo Gotti]
I'm the same nigga, came through at 17,
With 20 inch rims and cash money drop bling bling,
Dragged on and choose, do you bust yo gun... he sends help, merge?
I was purchasing birds,
??, water whippin' manufacturing birds,
Distributing, transporting and delivering birds,
Whatever you wanna call it, my words stu-stu stuck,
And then they fall and stumblin' like alcoholics,
Example,
Fuck around and get yo ass trampled,
Anthrax,
Tryin'a relax,
To my anthem,
I buy, sell and trade,
Other words, I buy it, cook it up then I sell you yay,
Young niggas is made,
When the transaction found,
I wanna re ? or replay, rewind yo ??,
I got a solution,
All that bullshit producin',
Street niggas give a fuck 'bout yo music solutions,

[Kelo]
[Hook x8]
Aw yeah,
Cop it, cook it, cut it, sell it, nigga
??, here I go

I'm up before the sun rise, first to hit the block,
A lil' skinny mothafucka with a heavy sack of rocks,
Serving nothing but deals, to them hustlas on my block,
Yea, I done sold everything, but I ain't never got caught,
You want that ?, I got that yellow real thick,
You want that hard, I got that big ol' chunkie brick,
Just like Big Moe, you know I got that purple shit,
Killa fie hydro, all bud, no sticks,
I got that fry,
From ???,
I ain't goin' lie,
The Hell? You stuck like tough glue, big ol' caramelized,
And when you don't get dough,
And you need a quick supply,
Just call Kelo,
The Work, I betcha I'll get you high,
Nigga,
I still got weed, big bags,
Got rocks, and crack,
Got powder, Anthrax,
Yeah nigga all that,
Got weed, big bags,
Got rocks, and crack,
Got powder, Anthrax,
Yeah nigga, cop that,

[7:30]
I cop that work, cook it, cut it, then sell it,
I take that back, I don't cop shit, I just sell it,
... I ain't gotta cop the work cause I already got it,
It's in an attic,
Wrap the plastic,
With the automatics,
I handle water,
From Pepsi-Cola,
To 'cross the border,
I work more yola,
Than Arm & Hammer work baking soda,
Me and Kay-yola,
We in the kitchen,
We mixin',
Chickens,
After we mix em,
We grab the techs, hit the trunk and ship it,
Now 7:30's,
In a Suburban,
With 7 birdies,
I'm in a hurry,
To get this cream, like ????,
My momma's worried, my bitch is bitchin',
They think that I'm missin',
Cause daily I'm moving chickens,
And cookin' bricks in the kitchen,
I got hoes,
Holdin' O's,
In they baby strollas,
Only roll,
With real rollas like ????,
Call me cocaine,
Wayne,
I'm the coke mane,
Sold more coke than Coke mane,
I supply the dope mane,
