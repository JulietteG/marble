Yeah
I used to build you up
To watch you tear me down
I'd always let you in
And let you kick me out
You used to make me laugh
But now you make me sick
Thought you were just so dope
But now you're full of it

Cause all day and all night
I would take all your shhh
Your what?
Yeah all day and all night
But I'm o-over it

It's all good
Yeah baby, it's alright
I release you, tonight
It's all cool, n-no need to think twice
I release you
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Yeah
You said you need your space
How 'bout a thousand miles
How 'bout I change the locks
In case you change your mind
I waited patiently
For you to come around
I used to hold it in
But now I'm freakin' out

Cause all day and all night
I would take all your shhh
Your what?
Yeah all day and all night
But I'm o-over it

It's all good
Yeah baby, it's alright
I release you, tonight
It's all cool, n-no need to think twice
I release you
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Yeah

Hey baby, I-I know I'm good without you
Hey baby, I (oooo)
Hey baby, I-I'll never think about you
Hey baby, I (oooo)

Release you, yeah
Cause all day and all night
Yeah

It's all good
Yeah baby, it's alright
I release you, tonight
It's all cool, n-no need to think twice
I release you
Goodbye

It's all good
Yeah baby, it's alright
I release you, tonight
It's all cool, n-no need to think twice
I release you, tonight
Yeah

Hey baby, I-I know I'm good without you
Hey baby, I (oooo)
Hey baby, I-I'll never think about you
Hey baby, I (ooooo)---
