(Ha ha ha ha. Clap.)

Lets get it started
Im just a dreamer on a Friday night
You know I want it
Yeah I gotta gotta get it right
Just a small town girl with West Coast dreams
Gotta do a lot of driving in these skinny jeans
I gotta get some sun, get some rays
Wanna live my nights and waste my days, whoo!

There aint no beach in this town
Baby Ive been dying just to get up off the ground
A-whoa, oh, oh, a-whoa
Yeah theres a sunset somewhere
But Im stuck standing here in nowhere
But I know we can make it if we up and leave right now
A-whoa, oh, oh, a-whoa
Cuz theres a sunset somewhere

I wanna feel it (feel it)
I need a sunburn badly baby
You know I mean it
Oh yeah you know it drives me crazy

Being a small town girl with West Coast dreams
Wanna do a lot of driving in these skinny jeans
Gonna get some sun, gonna some rays
I wanna live my nights and waste my days, yeah!

There aint no beach in this town
Baby Ive been dying just to get up off the ground
A-whoa, oh, oh, a-whoa
Yeah theres a sunset somewhere
But Im stuck standing here in nowhere
But I know we can make it if we up and leave right now
A-whoa, oh, oh, a-whoa
Cuz theres a sunset

And if we make it there
Well make it anywhere
Theres a sunset somewhere
Theres a sunset somewhere

(Clap.)

There aint no beach in this town
Baby Ive been dying just to get up off the ground
A-whoa, oh, oh, a-whoa
Cuz theres a sunset somewhere
But Im stuck standing here in nowhere
But I know we can make it if we up and leave right now
A-whoa, oh, oh, a-whoa
Cuz theres a sunset somewhere
Cuz theres a sunset somewhere
I want that sunset somewhere
