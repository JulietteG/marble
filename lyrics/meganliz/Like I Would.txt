She is a pageant queen, with over 20 titles to her name
But here's the funny thing, 
She's not a day older than 18
See, I have bigger dreams, living in this town
I'm not a beauty queen
I would stay, but I don't want to drown

But then there's you
You won't dream that big and that's why

She's the kind of girl you marry
And I'm the kind you don't
She's the one you want to carry into your brand new home
After your honeymoon, right
She looked better in white than I ever could, but
She won't love you like I would

He is the basketball star, the captain of the team
And it's so sad to think
That's it the only place he'll take his dream
In 20 years from now, when he's married to his beauty queen
He'll look down at his baby
Is this as perfect as it seems?

But then there's you
You wouldn't dream that big, and that's why

She's the kind of girl you marry
And I'm the kind you don't
She's the one you want to carry into your brand new home
After your honeymoon, right
She looked better in white than I ever could, but
She won't love you like I would

Maybe I regret not loving you
And maybe it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do

She's the kind of girl you marry
And I'm the kind you don't
Ooh, but I'm just not right for you, oh

She's the kind of girl you marry
And I'm the kind you don't
She's the one you want to carry into your brand new home
After your honeymoon, right
She looked better in white than I ever could, but
She won't love you like I would---Lyrics submitted by Jena Weber.
