I thought we were unstoppable, yeah
I felt it's undeniable that anyone could see I was so in love with you yeah

I thought we'd always be happy, happy 
I thought you'd always be good for me
Guest I was wrong 
Guest you'll always be my happy, happy, happy never after 
Happy never after

Maybe, you're no good for me, but baby
no I don't need you
Now I see so clearly it's time to let you go, yeah

I thought we'd always be happy, happy 
I thought you'd always be good for me
Guest I was wrong
Guest you'll always be my happy, happy, happy never after
happy never after

I thought we'd always be happy, happy 
I thought you'd always be good for me
Guest I was wrong 
Guest you'll always be my happy, happy, happy never after
I thought we'd always be happy, happy
I thought you'd always be good for me
Guest I was wrong 
Guest you'll always be my happy, happy, happy never after
Happy never after
Happy never after---Lyrics submitted by Courtney Vance.
