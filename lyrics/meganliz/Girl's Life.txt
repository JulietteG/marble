No, girls dont just wanna have fun
We take it fast, take it slow, we can come undone

Were so much more than a magazine, cant you see
Its a fight with society

Ive been living in a movie
So make believe
Tired of this script
I was losing me

Im rewriting
Happy endings, I realize
I take the pen
I control the lines

Turn it up make it louder
Jammin out alone
I love this song
Bout a boy whos proven wrong
I dont have many secrets
What I say best believe it
Oh, it feels so right
Living a girls life

Watching movies no make up on,
you arrive
cant decide if Ive got the time

Im at the scene where Edward is gone
Oh Bella you better better stay strong

Turn it up make it louder
Jammin out alone
I love this song
Bout a boy whos proven wrong
I dont have many secrets
What I say best believe it
Oh, it feels so right
Living a girls life

This is a song is for every girl
Whos ever felt the weight of the world
Ive been there too, shes been there too weve been there too

so just

Turn it up make it louder
Jammin out alone
I love this song

Turn it up make it louder
Jammin out alone
I love this song
Bout a boy whos proven wrong
I dont have many secrets
What I say best believe it
Oh, it feels so right
Living a girls life
