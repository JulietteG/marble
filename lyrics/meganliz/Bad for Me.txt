I wore red cuz you liked that
Youre like hey, let me get that
But when I text, you dont text back,
No you didnt cuz you didnt care.
Well the game makes me crazy
Its like yes, no maybe,
And youre calling me baby,
When I know that you just dont care
Whoa oh-oh
Sayin that Ill quit but it's just not true
Like whoa oh-oh
I say I dont like it but you know I do

(CHORUS)
Cause
You make me feel so right,
Even if its so wrong
I wanna scream out loud
Boy, but I just bite my tongue
This ones for the girls, messin with boys
Like hes the melody and shes background noise
Baby why cant you see
It feels so good, but youre so bad for me
Oh, oh
I feel so good 
But you're so bad for me
Oh, oh
It feels so good 
But you're so bad for me

Always want what I cant have
Give it all, never get half
Youre like girl where you been at
And I really wanna just not care
But
Whoa oh-oh
Sayin that Ill quit but thats just not true
Like whoa oh-oh
I say I dont like it but you know I do

(CHORUS)
Cuz
You make me feel so right,
Even if its so wrong
I wanna scream out loud
Boy, but I just bite my tongue
This ones for the girls, messin with boys
Like hes the melody and shes background noise
Baby why cant you see
It feels so good, but youre so bad for me
Oh-oh
I feel so good 
But you're so bad for me
Oh-oh
It feels so good 
But you're so bad for me

Im dying tonight
Trying to hide, hide
What Im feeling, Im feeling like Im
Dying tonight
To keep it inside
When I say hello, should be saying goodbye

(CHORUS)
You make me feel so right,
Even if its so wrong
I wanna scream out loud
Boy, but I just bite my tongue
This ones for the girls, messin with boys
Like hes the melody and shes background noise
Baby why cant you see
It feels so good, but youre so bad for me
Oh-oh
It feels so good
But you're so bad for me
Oh-oh
It feels so good
But you're so bad for me
Oh-oh
But you're so bad for me, so bad for me
Oh-oh
It feels so good
But you're so bad for me---Lyrics submitted by Kiyomi.
