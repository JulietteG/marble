Whoa oh oh 
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

Coffee candy,
Seats are sandy,
In the car that we drove from the south pier,
Hitched a ride with the band, and decided to stay for just another year.

Bring it up to go downtown,
Apparitions in the night,
Runnin' round with the sound of your voice and the choice between wrong and right.

And I'm runnin' on fumes,
Tryin' to make it through,
Tryin' to get back to you,
I know I gotta make it soon,
I'm runnin' on fumes.

Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.

I'm runnin' on fumes, 
Whoa oh oh 
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.

Red sun sinkin', 
Sets me thinkin', 
'Bout direction, connections, they come and go, 
Bleary-eyed I come to realize the road keeps headin' home, 
Lookin' out from the inside, 
Life can be a lonesome dream, 
Plug it in, 
Crank it up, 
Hum along, 
Like a motor in the mad machine.

And I'm runnin' on fumes, 
Tryin' to make it through,
Tryin' to get back to you,
I know i gotta make it soon (yes I do).

I'm runnin' on fumes,
Whoa oh oh,
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.

I'm runnin' on fumes, 
Whoa oh oh,
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.

I'm runnin' on fumes,
And I'm runnin' outta time,
Gonna leave it all behind,
Down to my last lullaby (lullabyyyy).

Coffee candy,
Seats are sandy,
In the car that we drove from the south pier,
Hitched a ride with the band and decided to stay for just another year.

I'll be runnin' on fumes,
Tryin' to make it through,
Tryin' to get back to you,
I know I gotta make it soon (I know I do).

I'll be running' on fumes,
Tryin' to make it through,
Tryin' to get back to you,
I know I gotta make it soon (yes I do)

I'm runnin' on fumes,
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.

I'm runnin' on fumes,
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.

I'm runnin' on fumes
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh.---Lyrics submitted by Elena.
