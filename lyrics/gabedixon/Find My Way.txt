I don't mean to trouble your mind
I just got to find a way home
Silently i'm seeking a kind of way 
To get by on my own

Downtown saturday
In a better way
Than I ever was before

Don't need anyone
Standing in my sun
Don't need that anymore

Well it's a long way to go
And there's no one way to go
But it's all gonna show in the end

I got to...
Find my way
Find my way
Find my way home

I got to...
Find my way
Find my way
Find my way home

All those plans that I made for myself
I've got nobody else to lean on
Gone so far with my head in the clouds
Now it's time to come down and be gone

Downtown saturday
In a better way
Than I ever was before

Don't need anyone
Standing in my sun
Don't need that anymore

And all the time in the world
And everything I'll have heard
You know it's all in one word
Destiny.

Find my way...
Find my way...

I got to...
Find my way
Find my way
Find my way home

Find my way
Find my way 
Find my way home

I got to...
Find my way
Find my way
Find my way home

I got to...
Find my way
Find my way
Find my way home

Yeah Yeah...

Find my way home...---Lyrics submitted by savy.
