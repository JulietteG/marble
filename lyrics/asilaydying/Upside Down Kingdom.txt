many choose to find their hope in the thoughts of afterlife
when there is none to be found right here before we die
so I understand the feeling of helplessness
when we are just taught to wait here for death

wait here for death
wait for this suffering to end
wait here for death
wait for this suffering to end

we are not forgotten
for a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streets
we can represent now what will one day be complete

simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
and the powerless rise
this is the kingdom born upside-down
this is the kingdom where the broken are crowned

the "blessings" of excess are only a burdon on us

it is a broken system where we just wait for death
it is a broken system where suffering can never end

simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
and the powerless rise
this is the kingdom born upside-down
this is the kingdom where the broken are crowned

If helplessness is our system
then we're better off upside-down---Lyrics submitted by alvin.
