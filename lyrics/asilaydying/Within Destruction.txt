if music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart 
then i will write the darkest song 
for without forgiveness my soul is lost 
all that is hope within destruction comes from you, for i have fallen 
from you 
if music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart 
then i will write the darkest song, 
for without forgiveness my soul is lost 
all that is hope within destruction comes from you 
for i have fallen, and there is nothing good within me 
yet ive been given life i will never deserve 
for without forgiveness my soul is lost 
all that is hope within destruction---Lyrics submitted by April.
