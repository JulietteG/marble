can you understand my meaning hidden in the roses around my eyes 
i want you to know how much it means to have you in my life 
your love brings me close again in this instance this single moment when our worlds collide 
the wire of eternity twists around us 
i can feel this river rising, moving up my back 
some things never change 
some things never go away 
some things never change 
some things never go away 
i could never forget you 
and i will never be the same 
i could never forget you 
and i will never be the same 

some things never change 
some things never go away
i could never forget you 
and i will never be the same
