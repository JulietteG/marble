Condemned! x5 Without given a chance to speak
Without acknowledgment they're made less than human

Condemned!
Condemned to anonymity
Trapped by!
Trapped by obscurity
Condemned!
Condemned to anonymity
Sentenced!
Sentenced to neglect

They will never share our blood, yet is that reason
To drain what's left of theirs abandoning compassion?

Condemned!
Condemned to anonymity
Trapped by!
Trapped by obscurity
Condemned!
Condemned to anonymity
Sentenced!
Sentenced to neglect

Why do we uphold allegiance
Higher than maintaining life?
The ties of blood breaking a stronger bind!

Condemned!
Condemned to anonymity
Trapped by!
Trapped by obscurity
Condemned!
Condemned to anonymity
Sentenced!
Sentenced to neglect---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
