How many years have we waited
For a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted
Chasing a love that was not our own?

I sat ashore and watched as one
Hopeless wave crashed upon another
While my thoughts ran to the highest hills
My heart never, never reached the sea
With only delusions of an endless journey
I am left with an ocean between you and me
An ocean between

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone elses dream

The gate to my heart has been weld shut
With the splendor of my aspirations closed in

How many years have we waited
For a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted
Chasing a love that was not our own?

Is this your salvation?

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone elses dream

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone elses dream

How many years, how many years have we waited
For a ship that never, never set sail?
How many years have we waited
For a ship that never, never set sail?

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone elses dream

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone elses dream---Lyrics submitted by Drew.
