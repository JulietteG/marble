That night i never came home 
wandering souls captured my thoughts, 
emptiness filled my mind 
urgency spoke her lies 
in the confines 
of these grey walls 
i watched them move together 
taking me places i cannot remember 
remember we have poured ourselves 
into this loveless bride 
how quickly i forget that this is meaningless x2 
in a world passing through my fingers 
i still chase the wind 
how quickly i forget that this is meaningless x2 
what have i learned from yeasterday x2---Lyrics submitted by michael.
