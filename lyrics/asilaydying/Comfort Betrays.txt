You sat and watched
As I nearly destroyed myself

Never had I felt so betrayed
That you would sacrifice my life
For no more than comfort

And now your love means nothing to me
You are a coward, the antithesis of a friend
Take action before there is
No one left to defend

For I would have stood by you
Right to the gates of hell---Lyrics submitted by Reese.
