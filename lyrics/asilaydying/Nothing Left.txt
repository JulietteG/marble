This world was never worthy
But how can I call it unfaithful
Every promise was fulfilled
As decay crawled from it's throat
Like the dead rising from an open grave
Lips of splendor and tongue of deceit
All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there's nothing left
[2x]

Nothing left
[3x]

If All my sorrow has led me here
Then I would cry all of my tears
To have this chance again
And know there's more than this
And know there's more than you

|-Phil's-Solo-|

Like those gasping for their last breath
we cannot hide there's nothing left
[2x]---Lyrics submitted by Jaqueline.
