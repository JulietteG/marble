what is this world, what is this weve created 
in the burdens of this life i cannot rest 
this world means nothing 
everything we hold will pass away 
with a void of completion comfort will ever fade 
i long for this wind to cease 
we once held undying devotion 
now dead to our thoughts, undefined like our love
