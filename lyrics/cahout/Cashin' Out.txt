36 O's Ho ridin' 'round with that nina
Ridin' with a ho named Keisha, smokin' on Keisha...
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I met you?
She fly high, high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 o's so'I'm ridin round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I met ya?

I got versace all on my back, these hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back, cause they know I'm moving that pack
These Louies all in my face, 4/5 feel stay up on my waist
Plus it ain't on me for nothin so please don't make me catch a case
Cause bitch I'm bout it, me walking round with no check on me
Psss, yeah I doubt it
Your girl ain't finna leave with me, pss, yeah I doubt it
And I'm like, what the hell they talkin' bout?
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know I'm cashing out, cool

Ok, I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they coming by flocks in
Birds coming by flocks in
Pass them birds like stockton
Play with my money I'm poppin
No acting, but it's a movie
Got Spinz on da beat so we ain't loosing
Don't act like yo ho ain't choosin
I'm blowed up, yeah I'm da bomb
Ridin roun blowin on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms
Top flo' suite chillin at the palms
We want the whole loaf leave ya'll the crumbs
Til then I'm runnin my check up
And it's fuck a bugatti I'm callin my jet up

Cool

Pimpin over here... Chuuch
Time to cop the Maybach already had da vert
I got big money visions, sammi sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumping out the kitchen
And I'm on da money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your cam corder, press record and gone and watch me
And you can skate on my ice, just like you playing hockey
And in the booth, I beat the beat up, call me Rocky
Yeah I'm cocky

Cool
