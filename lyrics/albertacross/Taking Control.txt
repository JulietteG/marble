The way of the weekend
is getting right to yah
And the city just deceived you 
and then stared right at yah 
And the way we learn 
its the way down on the weekend 
Thats taking control 

Im hollow but Im heaving 
where did my week go 
And why do I feel cold 
When Im triggered to run 
And the way we are 
is taking control 
And the way down on the weekend 
Is getting right to yah 

And the way down on the weekend 
Is getting right to yah
And the way we are 
is taking control---Lyrics submitted by gypsy.
