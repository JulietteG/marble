Well all people hanging around 
well all people ghouling around 
We were city ghosts 
we just follow
cause we are just people 

Yeah city walls are growing 
How will I find my way out 
We were wasted lifes in the city 
Where a million people stole my way 

Where have we gone 
Im staying around 
Where have you gone 
Im sticking around 
Im going inbound 
inside the city walls 
inbound inside the city walls 
its getting kinda mystic
Going inbound 

Yeah city walls are growing
 How will I find my way out 
We were wasted lifes in the city 
Where a million of people stole my way

Yeah city walls are growing
 How will I find my way out 
We were wasted lifes in the city 
Where a million of people stole my way---Lyrics submitted by gypsy.
