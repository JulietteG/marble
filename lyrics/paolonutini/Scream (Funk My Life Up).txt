How was I to know you'd just come along? 
And funk my life up 
Lips like Debbie's, sing sex like strawberry songs 
Just funk my life up 
Never heard her coming, thought it was just another woman 
With a shotgun in her hand 
Funk my life up 

She's the bass, she's the beat, she's the rhythm, she's the band 
Just funk my life up 
And that girl, so fine 
Makes you wanna scream hallelujah 

Sly hands, spinning wax lights, oh god 
Beats are dripping on me like spider milk 
And I never heard the warning when I woke up in the morning 
With my sunshine on a drip 

She's my rock, she's my but, she's the dealer trip 
And that girl, so fine 
Makes you wanna scream hallelujah 

How can I refuse? I'm not fit to chose 
Just funk my life up 
Said the only way I win is the way I lose 
Just funk my life up 
And I never got the script, I unzipped 
Got a little bit wet up there in my brain 
She's your church, she's your sin, she's a comic, she's a 
And that girl, so fine 
Makes you wanna scream 

She gets me sinning, she's like a trick on me 
Hell, I don't even know her name but yet she sticks to me 
And in the climax she would scream with me 
Yeah, she sticks to me 
She gets me funny, she doesn't want none of my money 
So I pour it over her like gasoline 
Light a match and then I'm back in my teens 
Me and super girl smoking my green 
Me and super girl smoking my green 

Unload, reload, eyes back swinging,
Sweet thing, knows things, Jeff Beck sings
Roundhouse, going down Lets go!
And the girl so fine makes you wanna scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Yeah, the girl, so fine, you wanna scream ---
