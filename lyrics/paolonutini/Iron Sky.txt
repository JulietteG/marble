We are proud individuals living on the city,
But the flames couldnt go much higher.
We find God and religions to, 
To paint us with salvation.
But no one,
No nobody,
Can give you the power,

To rise over love,
And over hate,
Through this iron sky,
Thats fast becoming our minds.
Over fear and into freedom.

Oh, thats life
Thats dripping down the walls
Of a dream that cannot breathe
In this harsh reality
Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind
Serves now to define our cold society

From which well rise over love,
Over hate,
From this iron sky,
Thats fast becoming our minds.
Over fear and into freedom.

You just got to hold on!
You just got to hold on!

Ohhh ohhhh oh oh

(To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. 
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed,
the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. 
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, 
and the power they took from the people will return to the people. 
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. 
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men  
machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! 
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! 
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, 
to make this life a wonderful adventure 
Let us use that power! 
Let us all unite!)

And well rise over love,
And over hate,
Through this iron sky,
Thats fast becoming our minds
Over fear,
Into freedom.
Into freedom!

From which well rise over love,
And over hate,
Through this iron sky,
Thats fast becoming our minds.
Over fear and into freedom.
Freedom!

Oh!
Rain on me!
Rain on me!
Rain on me!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
