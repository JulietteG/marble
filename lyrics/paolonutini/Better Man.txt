She makes me smile
she thinks the way i think
that girl makes me wanna be better

Took her down Bleecker Street
so she drank the way I drink
I kiss the sky to send her blue a letter

That girl
makes me wanna be a better man
ye sure she sees
gonna treat her like a real man can

Shes fearless, shes free
she is a real life wire
and that girl
shes got me feeling so much better
oh you trade all the money in the world
just to see this girls smile
all the while, shell make you feel so much better

oh that girl, makes me wanna be a better
sure she sees, gonna treat her like a real man can

ah, ah, la la la

come on in my arms
you make me feel alright
you make me feel alright
you know I might get eager
I might lose my cool
if you like, Im in detention
in the hall of the school

and you live to love me
or you hate me
but I can see youve got no tires
for the end of ..
but the reflection in your eyes
gonna look so much better
I said that girl makes me wanna be a better man
yeah yeah yeah
sure she see she fit, gonna treat her like a real man can
gonna treat her like a real man can
gonna treat her like a real man can
gonna treat her like a real man can---
