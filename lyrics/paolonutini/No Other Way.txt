Darlin' my frustration 
It gets me, it gets me where it hurts me most 
Like five rapid to the gut its not so easy to see
And I've been gone far, far too long 
To expect you not to have changed even a little bit 
And I guess I hope I'm still the kind of guy you're needing for your fool 

Cause life's a ball here on the road on these four wheels 
Oh, but something about the whole thing, it doesn't feel real 

Work my days for you, cause I love you
Girl, I don't want you 
I need you and I can't see no other way 
Darlin', I work my days for you, cause I love you 
Girl, I don't want you 
I need you and I can't see no other way 

Oh this separation, it really gets you thinking 
And all those used up free days, well they've worn enough in the wind 
And I wonder if you're half as innocent as you assure me? 
Or if you thank him for his time and just never call again 

Oh, oh 
And after all the lights and shows and long haul planes 
It'd be you and me again, but until then 
I work my days for you, cause I love you
Girl, I don't want you 
I need you, I can't see no other way 
Oh darlin', I work my days for you, cause I love you 
Girl, I don't want you 
I need you and I can't see no other way 
Oh babe! I'm home!
So love me and I'm home babe 
Oh so touch me 
Yeah, I'm home, so kiss me, like you do 
Cause you bet, baby but I'd do it for you 

Oh babe, yeah baby, I want you babe 
Oh I'm home babe 
So take me in your arms 
Oh baaaaaaby 
Love me like you do 
Oh kiss me like you do 
And baby you bet I'll do it to you 
Ohh nooo 
Hold me like you do---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
