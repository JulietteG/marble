Oh worries are about
And heavy on his gut
He feels he's being punished
For the bad things that he's done

Help him Jesus, help him
Send him down a sign
'Cos he feel's he is getting old before his time

And he is sitting at the table
The table he has set
He is begging for the courage to redeem some self respect

Help him Jesus, help him
Walk along the line
'Cos he feel's he is getting old before his time

He says it takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
He is worried now
But he won't be worried long

He broke her heart on a warm and sunny day
Oh he broke her heart on a warm and sunny day
When she heard what he had to say
All that sun soon went away
He broke her heart on a cold and windy day

He says it takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
He is worried now
But he won't be worried long

And so he moves towards his sweet redeeming light
Shadows cast but none obscure his sight
And they wonder where he is going
While he is knelt before her throat
Refusing to go down without a fight

He says it takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
He is worried now
But he won't be worried long---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
