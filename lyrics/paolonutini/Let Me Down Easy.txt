Let me down easy
Though your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

We are broken by others
But we mend ourselves
We take comfort in strangers
But I don't think it helps
If every fool were a clown
I would be a king and not a clown
Cause love can't be
Closer than our hands and our feet

But it's lost on me
Ohhhhh ohhhh
It's lost on me
Your love for me is wrong
Let me down easy
since you feel to stay is wrong
There was no sweeter fruit than this
With no taste of bitterness
It was so fresh and sweet before
But I can't taste it anymore

I was like a man with no candy
I had everything
But it's lost on me
Lost, lost on me, yeah

Your love for me is wrong
Let me down easy
Your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

On a better day
we'd be waiting on our corner
Selling dreams of redemption
But this time you've gone your way
So I'll go mine
Out of sight, out of love, out of time

Your love for me is wrong
Let me down easy
Your love for me is gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong

Let me down
Let me down easy---
