Ooooh
All the people wanna try you girl,
And I hope you tell them where to go,
Cus I've got so much here to offer girl,
Oh I love you more than you can know

Some people wanna speed it up,
Infact I want to slow it down.
I wanna get myself dressed up,
And take you out on the town

I'll be a model pupil tonight, babe.
I wanna get ten out of ten.
I'll be a model pupil tonight, babe.
I wanna get ten out of ten, yeah.

(Get ten out og ten)x2

Everybody's got opinions girl,
There own versions of a good idea.
But the best one I can think of now,
Is to make sure that I keep you near.

And I know that I've got to keep it up,
Cus I can see you're feeling down
And I wanna get myself dressed up yeah,
And take you out on the town

I'll be a model pupil tonight, babe.
I wanna get ten out of ten.
I'll be a model pupil tonight, babe.
I wanna get ten out of ten.

Get an A in the taxi,
A in the restaurant.
Get ten out of ten.
Get an A in the kitchen
And an A in the bedroom
and get ten out of ten

You make it out of nothing,
And turn it into something,
And give it to you all for free
I'll be a model pupil tonight, babe.
I wanna get ten out of ten.---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
