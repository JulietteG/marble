Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line
Don't know why you
Wanna jump on me
Baby, baby, baby
You're making me cry

Baby, I, I'm gonna
Find myself someone new
Someone who will be true
And no more toeing the line

I know it's over
Cause I see the signs
Don't let me waste
Your precious time

Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line
If you want to get rid of me
Baby, baby, baby
You're doing fine

Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line
I'm gonna put on
My walking shoes and
Leave you far behind

You're rolling over
And over so divine
But you can't fix this
Broken heart of mine

(CHORUS) 2X

Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line
Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line

Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line
Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line

Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line
Baby, I'm tired
Of toeing the line---Lyrics submitted by James.
