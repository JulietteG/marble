I'm at  your back door 
With the earth of a hundred nations in my skin
You wouldn't recognize me
For the light in my eyes is strange
It was years ago, god knows
When you strained to tell me your whole truth
That you were not mine to save
That you could not change

Well, would it be enough to go by
If we could sail on the wind in the dark?
Cut those chains in the middle of the night
That had you pulled apart
Would it be enough to go by
If there's moonlight pulling the tide?
Would it be enough to go by
If my love could keep alive?

I've built a lot of castles
I've built a lot of blazing, speed-of-light machines
But it doesn't matter, you know
They all crumbled in the winds of change
So I turned back to breathing
I learned a few good reasons to cry
And I finally called home
Praying you weren't out of range

Carry the weight
I'll carry the weight of you, I swear
Carry the weight
I'll carry the weight of you

Well, would it be enough to go by
If we could sail on the wind in the dark?
Cut those chains in the middle of the night
That had you pulled apart
Would it be enough to go by
If there's moonlight pulling the tide?
Would it be enough to go by
If my love could keep alive?

So will you let me come in?
The mosquitoes have found me
And they're crowding 'round my blood
At least offer me a drink
Or a breaking of the ice
I'm wanting your anger
I only want to see if I can shake you out of sleep
And bring you out under this flooded sky
At any price

So carry the weight
Carry the weight of me in your heart
Carry the weight
Carry the weight of me---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
