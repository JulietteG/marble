feather moon
scarlet sky
living clouds
my blinded eye
waters black
wood in snow
dead of night
how bright you glow

breathe in breathe out
exhale and inhale

seven sins
god of stone
all is true
down to the bone
feather moon
scarlet sky
I love you endlessly
not knowing why---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
