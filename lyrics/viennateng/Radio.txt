It's just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio and your runaway imagination
Just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio, we could turn away to another station

It came from nowhere on the 38 Geary
A girl with a backpack of shrapnel and wire
Through spiderweb windows of bloodstained glass
A pagoda's shadow and a cruel sunny sky

Oh the flash then the silence
Shouldn't there be screaming, praying, crying, oh anything at all
Tell me where are the sirens
Fire's getting closer but I've got to stay calm

It's just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio and your runaway imagination
Just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio, we could turn away to another station

Outside they're handing out fate to the wounded
Little tags in black, red, yellow, and green
It's now my twenty-fifth hour with a scalpel in hand
If I stop moving I will sleep on my feet

And the rumors are seething
Gunfire at freeway exits, bridges, mid barricades
I can feel the fog creeping
God, where is the morphine, the sweet lidocaine?

It's just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio and your runaway imagination
Just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio, we could turn away to another station

Sing me a love song, dear
What good has the news ever done to me
Come on, it will never happen here, oh no
We are not some third world country
This is not some third world country

I'm sorry mama, I held on for as long as I could
I'm sorry papa, there was nothing more I could do

It's just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio and your runaway imagination
Just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio, we could turn away to another station

It's just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio and your runaway imagination
Just the radio darling, just the radio
Just the radio...---Lyrics submitted by K G.
