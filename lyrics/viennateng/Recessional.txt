It's so beautiful here, she says
This moment now
And this moment, now

And I never thought I would find her here
Flannel and satin, my four walls transformed
But she's looking at, me straight to center
No room at all for any other thought
And I know I don't want this
Oh I swear I don't want this
There's a reason not to want this but I forgot

In the terminal, she sleeps on my shoulder
Hair falling forward, mouth all askew
And fluorescent accouncements beats their wings overhead:
Passengers missing, we're looking for you
And she dreams through the noise
Her weight against me
Face pressed into corduroy grooves

Maybe it means nothing
But I'm afraid to move

And the words, they're everything and nothing
I wand to search for her in the off-hand remarks
Who are you, taking coffee, no sugar?
Who are you, echoing streetsigns?
Who are you, the stranger in the shell of a lover
Dark curtains drawn by the passage of time?

Oh words like rain, how sweet the sound
Well anyway, she says
I'll see you around...---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
