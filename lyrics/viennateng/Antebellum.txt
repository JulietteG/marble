In the fall
we circle through the leaves
and talk about the little ones
and we smile
but never say too much
the moment always vanishing

One by one the neighbors' lights come on
our October day is almost gone

I know 
the borderlines we drew between us
keep the weapons down
keep the wounded safe

I know
our antebellum innocence
was never meant to see the light
of our armistice day

In the spring
we climbed the rolling hills
and talked about our budding plans
and we smiled
our faces like a mirror
showing us our secret signs

But then the fights
the sharp words splintering the night
how I couldn't be what you'd need
but oh, how I could make you bleed

I know
the borderlines we drew between us
keep the weapons down
keep the wounded safe

I know
our antebellum innocence
was never meant to see the light
of our armistice day

But how much would I give to have it back again?
how much did we lose to live this way?

(You'll go home, I'll stay here
seasons keep on marching
I'll stay here, you'll go home
with only strangers watching)

I know
the borderlines we drew between us
keep the weapons down
keep the wounded safe
(You'll go home, I'll stay here
seasons keep on marching)

And I know 
our antebellum innocence
was never meant to see the light
of our armistice
(I'll stay here, you'll go home
with only strangers watching)

I know
the borderlines we drew between us
keep the weapons down
keep the wounded safe
(You'll go home, I'll stay here
seasons keep on marching)

I know 
our antebellum innocence
was never meant to see the light
of our armistice day
(I'll stay here, you'll go home
with only strangers watching)---Lyrics submitted by K G.
