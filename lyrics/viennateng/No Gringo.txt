Father says, head down, we don't want them finding you
Mother says, practice now all the words you know

Oh Arizona's burning
They say the fence turned 'round
And now the razor wire keeps us out

Mother says, with luck we'll sleep under a roof tonight
Father says, in the truck we'll be crushed in tight

Oh Chicago, don't forget me
As the miles between us grow
Keep the maple tree carved
With the name of my love
The hills we would sled race down
Lake Michigan, stay endless and painted
And sky, goodbye

Mother says, years ago the whole world was ours to rule
Father says, let it go, those days are gone for good

All the signs read No Gringo
But somehow we'll find our way
Maybe waiting at dawn by the factory doors
Sunburnt and bent in the fields
Hey don't turn us in 
We'll be silent as the grave, as time

No gringo
No gringo aqu
Words as levies against the flood
Hoy cerrado
There's too many to feed
Room for only our own kind, our own blood

No gringo
No gringo aqu
You have stayed in this land for too long
Tan amargo
There's no time to grieve
You just pack up your things and move on
And move on, and move on---Lyrics submitted by K G.
