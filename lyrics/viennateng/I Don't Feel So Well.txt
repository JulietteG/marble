I don't feel so well
I thought you should know before you fall
I don't call them back
I thought you should know before you fall

I saw it begin to dawn on us both
And somehow it wasn't surprising
And so you're preparing to swear every oath
But all the while, I'm realizing:
I can't love you there

I thought you should know before you fall---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
