wait
don't let this line go slack
don't go alone into the cold
wait
don't give up on this yet
I know that there's more you haven't told

wait my love
just one more thought
wait my love
I haven't got time in my life
to watch you drive out to sea

so please, wait
don't let this line go slack
I want to bring you back
to where I know you

wait
don't give up on this yet
I want you to let you let me hold you
wait my love
just one more thought

wait my love
i haven't got time in my life to watch you drift away
but i've all kinds of time if you'll stay

I know we're transcontinental, 1:30a.m.
and there's not even a wire, just a whispering in air

I know we're transcontinental, 1:30a.m.
but I'm here---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
