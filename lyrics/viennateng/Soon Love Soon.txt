there'll be a fire burning in the temple of our peace
there'll be a soaring voice for our silent pleas
we will hold our broken circle and begin to pray
we will find a black and white in the gray

and we will be as one god
and we will be as one people

we will find illumination in unnatural light
you will travel a thousand miles without leaving my sight
we will find we never knew hatred ran so deep
such a wide, wide chasm of faith to leap

but we will be as one god
and we will be as one people

there will be an evolution of the human soul
we will know that be a part is to be truly whole
we will know the pattern of centuries rise and fall
we will know that the fate of one is the fate of all

and we will be as one god
and we will be as one people---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
