city fast asleep
clouds up on the hill
so quiet, so still
dreams of rain in sheets
dreams of ice and wings
so delicate, these things

love is a word so small
let it fill up till I can't see at all
I want to be blind, only my hands to guide me
bring all of you inside me

city fast asleep
lights hum in the gray
like her breathing will someday

strangest beauty cries
one and one, by and by
now three of us here lie
love for one so small
come fill me up till I can't see at all

I want to be blind, only my hands to guide me
gather all the world inside me---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
