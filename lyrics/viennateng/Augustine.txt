Oh my God
What have I done?
Chasing some mirage in my Mojave sun

Don't say every chance is lost
Please don't say anything at all

In sand and thorns
I'm walking forth
Bare and blinking as the day that I was born

Bells in spires of china white
Ring for an Augustine tonight

Oh, now
I'm breaking down, breaking down
Oh, now
I'm breaking down, breaking down
Oh, now, I'm breaking down
Oh, let me be, let me be 
Your Augustine

Lead me now
I understand
Faith is both a prison and an open hand

Bells on low, on high
Will you ring for Augustine tonight?

Oh, now
I'm breaking down, breaking down
Oh, now
I'm breaking down, breaking down
Oh, now, I'm breaking down
Every illusion in between
All the lies that I have seen
Oh let me be
Your Augustine---Lyrics submitted by K G.
