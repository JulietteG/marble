Anna Rose, sleep well tonight
The stars are dancing on the carpet of the sky
Time to close your wandering eyes
For I see the sleepiness creeping

Anna Rose, it makes my heart smile
To know you give love so freely
Anna Rose, it makes it worthwhile
Your love makes me see things so clearly
How it grows, heaven knows
Anna Rose, sleep well tonight

Anna Rose, it's time to dream
I see that your imagination knows no bounds
There it flows like some magical stream
And carries you on its journey

Anna Rose, it's my heart heart smile
To know you give love so freely
Anna Rose, it makes it worthwhile
Your love makes me see things so clearly
How it grows, heaven knows
Anna Rose, dream well tonight---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
