it's the quiet night that breaks me
I cannot stand the sight of this familiar place
it's the quiet night that breaks me
like a dozen papercuts that only I can trace
all my books are lying useless now
all my maps will only show me how to lose my way

oh, call my name  you know my name
and, in that sound, everything will change
tell me it won't always be this hard
I am nothing without you
but I don't know who you are

it's the crowded room that breaks me:
everybody looks so luminous and strangely young
it's the crowded room that's never heard
no one here can say a word of my native tongue
I can't be among them anymore
I fold myself away before it burns me numb

oh, call my name  you know my name
and in your love everything will change
tell me it won't always be this hard
I am nothing without you
but I don't know who you are---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
