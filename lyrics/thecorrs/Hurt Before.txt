She's a girl in a world
She's moving as fast as she goes
Loves her mom and her dad 
The only secure that she knows
But at night she's alone
She's dreaming of somebody new
Her someone for to hold
She's praying the dream will come true

Show me the way
Show me, show me how
Help me be brave for love
Show me the way
Show me, tell me how
What do you say?

There's a pain in her heart
She's trying so hard to unwind
Makes her cry in the night
When vision's so real make her blind
Wants to break through the fear
Erasing the scars from within
Starting a new kind of being
She's down and she praying again

Show me the way
Show me, show me how
Help me be brave for love
Show me the way
Show me, tell me how
What do you say?

You see she's turning the key
Unlocking the door
Embrasing the rollercoaster world
Stepping outside
With body and soul
Taking whatever future holds
Turning the key
Unlocking the door
Embracing the rollercoaster world
Take it in stride
You're just twenty-five
And you know we've all been hurt before

You see she's
Turning the key
Unlocking the door
Embracing the rollercoaster world
Stepping outside
With body and soul
Taking whatever future holds
Turning the key
Unlocking the door
Embracing the rollercoaster world
Take it in stride
You're just twenty-five
And you know we've all been hurt before
Yeah we've all been hurt before
So you're not alone...
No...
You're not alone...---Lyrics submitted by Roxanne.
