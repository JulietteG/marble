Go ahead, drive the nails in My hands;
Laugh at me, where you stand.
Go ahead, and say it isn't Me;
The day will come, when you will see.

'Cause I'll rise, again,
Ain't no power on earth can keep Me down!
Yes, I'll rise, again,
Death can't keep Me in the ground.

Go ahead, mock My name;
My love for you is still the same.
Go ahead, and bury Me;
But very soon, I will be free!

'Cause I'll rise, again;
Ain't no power on earth can keep Me down!
Yes, I'll rise, again;
Death can't keep Me in the ground.

Go ahead, and say I'm dead and gone,
But you will see that you were wrong.
Go ahead, try to hide the Son;
But all will see that I'm the One!

'Cause I'll come again!
Ain't no power on earth can keep me back!
Yes, I'll come again;
Come to take My people back.---
