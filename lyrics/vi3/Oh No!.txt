*Oh No*

Hook
Oh no baby, there ya go...go, think that I don't know...know
('Bout all the lies and the games that you try to run on me)
You tried to play me, but you cannot fade me, cuz I'm not the same "G"
(That you and your little girlfriends back home think about me)

Verse 1
Now I've been thinkin' about what you said to me
On how lately your needin' more privacy
But frankly girl, that ain't makin' no sense to me
Because you told me you thought we were meant to be

B-Section
Oh no, you always got to go...go, walkin' out the door...door
(You turned your back on me for the last time baby)
I got this feelinl', your words are too deceivin', sorry but I'm leavin'
(I'm gone...I'm gone...I'm gone!)

Hook 2x

Verse 2
I got no time for your sorry apologies (no-no)
I got no time for them secrets you kept from me (uh-huh)
I got no time for your low cell battery
I seen a picture of him, can't compare to me!

B-Section 2
Oh no, now i gots to go...go, I'm walkin' out the door...door
(I turned my back on you for the last time baby)
I got this feelin', your words are too deceivin', sorry but I'm leavin'
(I'm gone...I'm gone...I'm gone!)

Hook 2x

Rap
I've been thinkin' bout times...rewind
Back to the times you were mine
Hey yo I miss them days no doubt cuz....
I was the only one on your mind
But now...things changed...they're not...the same
Who's to blame, hey yo I don't know
But your caller I.D. displayin' his name
And you're lookin' through my cell phone (uh-huh)
Lookin' through my 2way (uh-huh)
Must have a guilty conscious, ya better get it off your chest
Because I'm sick of this nonsense
One time and it's shame on your, two times then it's shame on me
It really ain't no thang to me, no pain to me
Matter of fact, you can put that blame on me! (uh)
