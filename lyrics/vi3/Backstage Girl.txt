*Backstage Girl*

Verse 1
Late at night when I close my eyes
I think about a face that I can't deny
And I wonder why, emotions fly
Thoughts multiply, then I start to cry (now)
Wonder why I feel this way
(Uh) Livin' my life from day to day
Thinkin' of the games that I used to play
If she was right here, this is what I'd say (now)

Oh, oh, girl...tell me what's on your mind
Mind, girl...can we just spend some time in my world
All I really need is your sign
Sign, girl...gotta let me know, what your heart is feelin'

It's the way you look, the way you talk, the way you walk
Gotta be the one you want, after the show baby
You're my backstage girl (From the front to the back, yo the place is packed)
Backstage girl (backstage...)
It's the way you smile, the way you move, the way you groove
Wanna be the one you hold, when the lights go out baby
You're my backstage girl (But ya gotta wait in line, till we find the time)
Backstage girl...(backstage)

Verse 2
I never thought in my life, that I'd  find the one
But I see her every night when the show is done
And I realize, to my surprise
Don't wanna be alone, I want her by my side (now)
Even though she is hard to find
Sits V.I.P., inside my mind
After every show, I see her face in line
Cuz her backstage pass, will never be declined (now)

Well I've never been the kinda to wanna settle down
But you got me goin' crazy, and now I've found
That I'm doing these things, that I said I'd never do
Goin' home...all alone, yo it's all for you
Don't wanna be the one to get with every girl
Livin' coast to coast, playin' around the world 
I'm lookin' for the one, but runnin' outta time
When I see you backstage, then I gotta make ya mine

We could take a little trip to the...hot-spot
Then take it to the floor, make it...hot-hot
Roll out in my ride, no...top-top
Back to the hotel, don't...stop-stop (2x)
