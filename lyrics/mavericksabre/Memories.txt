Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let...

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let go...

Mm...
Back to them corners where I used to stand,
Watchin' them days pass, Back to that same place,
Same grass, Same stage, Same chance,
And..
Back to that same mentality, Where everyboy knows you, 
But now you're alone in your tragedy,
Back to them grey walls,
That wanted you as you, But now that that same reality,
Theres nowhere to run away to,
It breaks you and breaks that very hope that made you,
Back to them friends that would cost you,
But that didnt mean a thing when it jumped you,
Back to not belonging in my home town,
Cos if your not one then youll never be,
And i was never one to never speak,
Back to them memories and nightmares,
And back to them same streets,

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let... 

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let go...

To them wide open spaces, Where I used to stand watching,
The day fly right by my face,
And..
Back to them bitches and shops slum,
Over the counter checking everything I got,
Thinking am I thiefin or what?
Get your bloody cheif down;
Just to check the spots - standard procedure, 
Just cos they dont know my mothers face.
Small town state of mind, Where they been?
Say i'm fuckin race, And theres nowhere to escape
Back to sittin on the bus as a kid by myself,
Waiting for change but that change never came,
Nah..
Nah that change never came,
Back to that place where i don't ever see the sun,
Mum, dad son lost in this babylon, I remember when it rained, 
Used to look like it would never stop,
No,

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let... 

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let go...

Back to them days I remember all of it,
Back to that stage I rememebr all of it,
Back to that day.. 
Yea I remember all of it,

Back to them corners
Yea.. I remember all of it,

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let... 

Memories don't leave they'll never go,
Forever eating at your soul,
Reach out to let go,
Reach out to let go...---Lyrics submitted by samwise.
