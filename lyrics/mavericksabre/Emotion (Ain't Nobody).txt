I sat up in the back seat
I'm driving 'round these back streets
Somethings getting at me
I'm numb so what does that mean?
Am I sad because you lied?
Or am I mad because you tried?

Don't want to deal with the politics
But that's the deal when I come with it
Yes I'm trying to be positive
But I'm feeling the opposite
I've been down these lonely roads before
And where the lead is only war
I can't do this anymore

Ain't nobody love me better
But ain't nobody cause me pain like you
Ain't nobody love the things like I do
Oh oh oh oh

Driving through the city lights
My brother is trying to ring my line
Telling me leave it behind
But the fire is burning in my eye
I can hear the voices
Saying there's no choices
And I can here the voice speak
While the mad in me ignores it

This jealousy keeps telling me I'm always right
And this envy from my head and me just keeps me blind
So I unlock the door, step outside the car
But is this what I want? Now I'm not really sure

Ain't nobody love me better
But ain't nobody cause me pain like you
Ain't nobody love the things like I do
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody love me better
And ain't nobody oh the things I could do

Ain't nobody love me better
But ain't nobody cause me pain like you
Ain't nobody love the things like I do
Oh oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
