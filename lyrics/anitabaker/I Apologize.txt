Operator get my baby 
on the line
why just the other night
we had a horrible fight

I admit that I 
I was out of control
but I still love my man 
with my body and soul 

Well the road gets rough 
you say things you should not say
I never meant to treat my baby that way

(Chorus) 
I apologize 
O believe me I do
I apologize honest and true
because I know I was wrong 
and so I sing you this song
and I'm tryin' to get through
and make it up to you yeah

Operator it was like a bad dream
and all you should have heard
 the way he shouted 
and the way that i screamed 
I'll regret it 'cause I was unfair
I took it all out on him
just because he was there

well the road gets rough 
you say things you should not say
I never meant to treat my daddy that way

(Chorus)
I apologize 
O believe me I do
I apologize honest and true 
because I knew I was wrong
and so I sing you this song 
and I'm gonna get through yeah
and make it up to you

I apologize for I was unkind
and I wish that I
could roll back in time 
erase our good-byes
and rewrite my lines
become rain or come shine 
I'm gonna do right this time 
I apologize

Because I know I was wrong  
and so I sing you my, my, my song yeah I apologize---Lyrics submitted by Charles.
