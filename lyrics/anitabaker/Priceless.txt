When you ask me
How I feel about you
I try to find the words
That best describe you

You are to me 
Like a precious jewel
So valuable baby
With a shine so bright
Lighting up my life 
With pure delight

You are so priceless to me
And loving you has made me see
With your love I can do most anything
You are so priceless to me
You're like the first rainbow in spring
Your love comforts my heart with joy you bring

I envision you and me in love together
Getting closer, as we share each day together
Gimme all the gold in the world
It will not replace this love baby
Take a diamond worth a lot
What we got, cannot be bought or sold

You are so priceless to me
And loving you has made me see
With your love I can do most anything
You are so priceless to me
You're like the first rainbow in spring
Your love comforts my heart with joy you bring
