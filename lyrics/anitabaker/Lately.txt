(feat. Tyrese)

I can't imagine life
Without you by my side
This is love babe that I'm feeling
And I'm hoping that you're feeling the same way

Things tend to slip my mind
Like how you like to wine and dine, babe
With romantic lights you mean a lot to me
In so many ways

Lately, have I told you I love you?
Lately, have I told you you still mean the world to me?
Lately, have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well, tell me what you want babe

Don't think twice of our love
I say these things because
I love you but it's hard to explain
And I'm hoping that you're feeling the same

You know that all of my
Feelings are inside
And verbally I tend to forget
How much I L O V E U really means

Lately, have I told you I love you?
Lately, have I told you you still mean the world to me?
Lately, have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well, tell me what you want baby

Try your hardest to deal
Yes I forgot but you know how I feel
Things slip my mind baby that's a fact
Tell me you love me and I'll tell you back, baby

Lately, Lately
Lately baby, no
I love you babe, I love you baby
I love you baby, I love you

Hold me close to you, never let me go no no
I want you near, I adore you baby
It's your world, it's your world
Never let me go

Have I told you I love you?
Lately, have I told you you still mean the world to me?
Lately, have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well, tell me what you want baby---
