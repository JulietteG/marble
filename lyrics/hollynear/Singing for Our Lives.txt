We are gentle angry people
And we are singing, singing for our lives
We are gentle angry people
And we are singing, singing for our lives

We are a land of many colors
And we are singing, singing for our lives
We are a land of many colors
And we are singing, singing for our lives

We are gay and straight together
And we are singing, singing for our lives
We are gay and straight together
And we are singing, singing for our lives

We are a peaceful loving people
And we are singing, singing for our lives
We are a peaceful loving people
And we are singing, singing for our lives---Lyrics submitted by enormous.
