(Rick Ross intro)
This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight
you dig,
Let me slow down (its so incredible)
I go to the grave b4 I be a bitch nigga
Better behave you dealing with some rich niggaz
We the law symbol speaking crypted codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold

(Rick Ross verse 1)
I embarq on life, my path is all man
I understand the codes these hackers cant crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control, or violate parole
I wont fail but a lot of men will
Imma kinda in the feel, like Solomon Seal
Uh, this just the intro 
Allow my flow time to sing into the tempo
Free mason, freelancer, free agents we faster
Big contracts, big contarctors, 
Built pyramids, period we masters 
No kinda pillars, 
It was just a lotta niggaz
A lot of great thinkers and a lotta great inventors
All white mansion Im the child of God
All black diamonds times were hard
New rose royce, yes you made it nigga
All white neighborhood you their favorite nigga
My top back like JFK, they wanna push my top back like JF gay 
So so I JFK, join forces with the kings
And we ate all day
Right now I can rewrite history
I stop writing so fuck it Ill do it mentally

(Hook)
I go to the grave b4 I be a bitch nigga
Better behave you dealing with some rich niggaz
Started in the ghetto, now we world wide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
(Rep)

(Jay-Z verse 2)
Idiots couldnt do nothing with me 
They put the devil on me
Id prefer if niggaz squeezed the mental on me
Rumors of Lucifer I dont know who to trust
Whole world want the demize, turn the music up
Hear me clearly
If yall niggaz fear me, just say yall fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell, this is God engineering
This is a hail Mary path yall interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So yall look in the mirror and double check yall appearance
Bitch i said i was a-mazin
Not that i'm a mason
It's amazing that i made it through the maze that i was in
Lord forgive me i never would've made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him
Bitch im red hot
I'm on my third six
But a devil i'm not
My Jesus piece blooded,but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes on my covet
Im a bad mother fucker
It's Hov just say you love me

(Hook)

(John Legend)
If i ever die
Never let a b said i didn't win
Never, never say, never say Legend didn't go aye
Imma go aye
I just wanna die on top of the world
Making love to my favorite girl
Im making beautiful music
We making a movie
We knew you was born to do it
