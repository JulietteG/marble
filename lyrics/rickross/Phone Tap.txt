I think a nigga phone tapped 
Wanna give me time for my old raps 
Indict me for my own raps 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped 
My phone tapped 
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped 

18 nigga wildin', trafficin' with a pilot 
Crazy net worth, Miami bred the tyrants 
First day of trial, courtroom was silent 
Till the wiretap replayed back the dialect 
Had tears in my eyes as you took your oath 
Sweaty palms have on niggas who be touchin' dope 
Open the doors, smell the Pyrex in the air 
I'm dealin' raw, D-boys so debonair 
In the barber shop, it's known that I can sell a pair 
Count to forty-five before that man could shave his head 
Pistol underneath the apron as I'm in the chair 
Raise it to my neck, I tip a hundred for the beard 

I think a nigga phone tapped 
Wanna give me time for my old raps 
Indict me for my own raps 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped 
My phone tapped 
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped 

My right hand, I knew him since fourth grade 
'88, afros with no fades 
Fist fights, the box Chevys on blades 
Chief all they gave us the rules to play 
They trynna paint a picture of a hungry nigga 
Another lion runnin' in the jungle with us 
Told the bitches we was brothers, shared the same people 
Introduce you to my mother, made sure you eatin' 
Now you hangin' out with different people on the weekend 
Quotin' different numbers nigga, like I wouldn't peep it 
If it's war, here come murder, cause that come the cheapest 
Call me on my sister phone, keep it on some G shit 

I think a nigga phone tapped 
Wanna give me time for my old raps 
Indict me for my own raps 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped 
My phone tapped 
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped 

Niggas tellin' cause the jealous, look at what I'm wearin' 
They want me in the prison when I'm just apparent 
Quarter million in Atlanta, boy I had some talent 
Throw a stack in Magic City, make a hater panic 
305 nigga, ridin' in the Chevy 
Count a half a milli in a couple seconds 
Fuck two bitches then I want seconds 
Richest nigga in the city, boy I broke some records 
Puttin' spinners on your cars, suspendin' on the smoke 
What your spendin' on your home, spendin' on the boat 
Everybody watchin', everybody tellin' 
When your days numbered, nigga, cherish every second 

I think a nigga phone tapped 
Wanna give me time for my old raps 
Indict me for my own raps 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
I think a nigga phone tapped 
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped 
My phone tapped 
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped ---
