[Rick Ross]
Ugh, there he go, thats John Doe
There he go, thats John Doe
There he go, thats John Doe
Balling on you b-tches like Im Rondo

[Chorus]
24s, John Doe
All gold, John Doe
them boys dealing blow, they John Doe
Night work for the load, thats John Doe
Im still balling like Im dough dealin
ugh Im still balling like Im dough dealin
ugh I parked the Caddy in the living room
just parked the Caddy in the living room

[Rick Ross- Verse 1]
I brought a Benz and its paid for
I brought a b-tch that b-tch paid for
I brought a stick and its made for
welfare, yeah stick it in ya a-hole
aye ho you know I got that A-1
yayo and Im quick to slang one
jumping n-ggas like a chess piece
spend a couple hundred dollars on my chest piece
outta town n-ggas we call em fresh meat
he say he nettin me boy you must refresh me
better miss me with the convo
wanna know my name b-tch, John Doe

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross- Verse 2]
I got a b-tch who has a habit
spending stacks on nice fabrics
that head great, that p-ssy lavish
Im peeling collie greens that 30 carrots
reporting live from my Rolls Royce
Im ready to die and put that on my old boy
count 1.5 I holla Oh Lord
when Im on the jet know them choppers on board
rims taller than a bulldozer
everybody tucking pistols when we pulled over
fresh up out the fest, salute my n-gga Fanzo
yea they asked my name but he told em John Doe

[Chorus - x2]---Lyrics submitted by chenel.
