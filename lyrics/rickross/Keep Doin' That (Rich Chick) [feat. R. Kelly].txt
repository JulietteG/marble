This is for my rich bitches 
Her puppy named Panamera 
Her puppy named Panamera 
She got a condo in the area 
Rich bitch 
Uh, yeah 

She stay at her friend's and all these bitches is bad 
Watch them lick on each other, I'm talkin' pussy to ass 
Dope boy still at large, trackin' device on her car 
Tattoos on her arm, Double M diamond charms 
Chanel bag on her hip, Herms bracelets and things 
Let her fuck Meek Mill, told her keep chasin' her dreams 
Get the Lexus to flip, purple Texas to sip 
She make it rain like a nigga, we got more money to get 
Rich bitch, call her rich bitch 
Cause she fuck with dope boys and can suck a good dick 

Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money 
Girl, you doin' somethin' to me 
Hell yeah, keep doin' that 
Doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that 
Doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that 

I be feastin' on Tinder, she take just like piegeons 
Diamond-studded La Perla, that pussy's prestigious 
Yeah, she remind me of somethin' but that shit ain't my Jeep 
Matchin' Bugattis, Versace, she's went with three 
She be movin' that dough, quarter mil on her wrist 
Why you niggas be slippin'? This bitch is fuckin' your bitch 
Spent five tags, might pop tags 
Crocodile, python, that's a zoo on her bag 
She on the phone makin' deals, we gettin' them checks 
My Penelope Cruz, I let her meet my connects 
I fuck her all on the marble, yeah, that girl is a freak 
She like comin' in mornin', she's the female me 

Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money 
Girl, you doin' somethin' to me 
Hell yeah, keep doin' that 
Doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that 
Doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that 

Room service for weeks, a dozel towel on the beach 
She only wear panties once, then pass it down to her niece 
Let's go shoppin' at Boca, sixty stuffed in the sofa 
Can't be tweetin' locations, she postin' pics from her yoga 
Never party with locals, niggas with them was moguls 
VIP with dope boys, the DJ shout out to Sosa 
Valet park in the Wraith, cocaine all on her face 
Her Rolex icy as mine, throw up my gang sign 
We goin' bottle for bottle, Belaire Ros to the roof 
Rich bitch is her name and she Chanel to the boot 
Uh, I be droppin' so much, nigga 
My bitch shoppin' so much, nigga 

Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money 
Girl, you doin' somethin' to me 
Hell yeah, keep doin' that 
Doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that 
Doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that ---
