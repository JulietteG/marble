Hood billionaire 
Nigga need that quinine 
I'm making more with the baking soda, don't hate on me 
You know where I'm at though 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the dogfood, the soft, nigga, and the hard 
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the hard 
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs 

I got priscilla, I got priscilla 
I got vanilla, boy, I got vanilla 
I been that nigga, I been that nigga 
I bend that corner, I'm stacking scrilla 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the dogfood, the soft, nigga, and the hard 
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs

My face familiar, my face familiar 
Half a milli for the whip, this bitch'll hurt your feelings 
I could fly Brazillian, send her in the mail 
She got Meek Milly cellphone in the county jail 
I'm at the car wash off on Elvis Presley BLVD 
That nina hit your van, your ass gon' holla "good God" 
You feel that itch, you feel that itch 
That Camaro moving fast, boy, I'm getting rich 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the dogfood, the soft, nigga, and the hard 
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs

Run up in the chopper, I push the panic button 
Lil' 'Toine snorting coke, he ain't scared of nothing 
Bumping player fly until a player die 
Charged 'em for the nine gram, but I gave a five 
My baking soda fine, I'm baking over dimes 
I got them brown bags, I bet they know the smell 
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Can I park an airplane in a nigga yard? 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the hard 
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs

Fresh in them sneakers, pills up, I'm stepping on the dogs 
Bringing down a half a thing, mane, get these puppies off 
Hard work pays off, get more if you selling soft 
Catch you slipping out here though, my dog, we knock your melon off 
They cannot stunt, shoot them, rifles long like African 
Got them young boys shooting shit up like Africans 
Me gold in me mouth, 'round my neck like leprechaun 
Lamborghini or Ferrari, watch these bitches come 
Packing funds all because me go quick to rob the clubs 
Me go an hour full of slugs, left these bodies full of slugs 
Met me on the south side of the city with the whole thing 
Iced 'em with the heater, took the shit, it's a cold game 
These niggas know I done it, now there's rumors they want my head 
Got my Russian bitch sleeping with me right in the bed 
My niggas killing about this shit, for realling about this shit 
Fuck around and get a hundred years, dawg, for about this shit 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the dogfood, the soft, nigga, and the hard 
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs 

I'm riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Riding down Elvis Presley BLVD 
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the hard 
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs---
