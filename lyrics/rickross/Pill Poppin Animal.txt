i'm a pill poppin animal
syrup sippin nigga
syrup syrup sippin nigga
syrup syrup sippin nigga

im a pill poppin animal
syrup sippin nigga
im so high you could'nt reach me with a fuckin antenna

im a pill poppin animal
syrup sippin nigga
syrup syrup sippin nigga
syrup syrup sippin nigga

im a pill poppin animal
syrup sippin nigga
im so high you could'nt reach me with a fuckin antenna

feelin like a million bucks
fillin up a philly blunt
feelin on your bitch
if you dont like it i dont give a fuck
she know whats on my mind by the way a nigga look at her
she lookin at my watch if you dont like you should get you one
love to make her ass bounce just to get the dick hard
stickin on a double stack your rollin wit a rich boy
make it do tha helicopter ?????

tell it to the teleprompter you can tell em seven ???
fifty grand in dolla bills
call em nigga hollywood
time to make a movie
then its time to get up outta here
