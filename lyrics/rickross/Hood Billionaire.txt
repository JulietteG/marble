Boss
I done took over the game nigga, 
Hoppin' out the Bugatti with my Ballys on 
No underwear nigga, my jeans tight fitted to nigga 
Jay-Z wuddup nigg
Uh, yeah 
Let me f--- with 'em right now 

Niggas want to kidnap (kidnap), leave me in the trunk, walk away with big stacks (big stacks) 
They jealous of the fortune, the glitz and the fame my cocaine mortgage, 
In the game like Tony Parker, snow white range and my partner pocket, 
I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem, homie I put that only mamma. 
Still rollin' with the 4 5th now that I'm rich got these broke niggas so sick, 
And my daughters college pre paid, she straight - say thanks to the d game!, in that phantom 
On that Tupac, ridin' through the ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot, nawwt. but i'm well 
Established,Ii f--- with heroin cause it sells the fastest. 

I'ma ride bout mine, and i wouldn't tell a lie, 
Take it out of town go and get my money right. 
And if it ain't bout cash, I don't really care 
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire 
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire 
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire 
If it ain't 'bout cash i don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash
I'm a hood billionaire.---
