Go home
Turn off the radar
Let all the noise die out now
You've been waiting for this day to come
With the wrong people getting involved
You're hung up so c'mon grow up cause it's on

Charming as ever
And the grass is always green
Charming as ever
With your mind somewhere between

Stay home
Watch the rain now
Ride along with temptation
You've been waiting for this day to come
I put a note outside your door
To remind you it's tough when enough is enough

Charming as ever
And the grass is always green
Charming as ever
As the rain washes away

Leave home if you got one
You've been holed away so long
Waiting for this day to come
Tell me what you're searching for
You walk out then turn back
For things you want but cannot get

Charming as ever
And the grass is always green
Charming as ever
With your mind somewhere between
Charming as ever
As the rain washes out

Make a wish
Make a wish
Make a wish
Make a wish---
