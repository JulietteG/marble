Get in where you fit in
Get in where you're feelin'
Get in where you fit in
But don't get caught

I am more wine and roses
and crystal clear
It's just smoke in mirrors
around here
Nananana...

Keep on rowing high
when you feel so alive
just take and fly
Wait for this moment to arrive

And you're crazy if you wanna be mine
Too careful if you wanna be sure
you're everything money can buying
When he is here:
The Gentleman of the Year

Get in where you fit in
get back your feeling
Get in where you fit in
but don't get lost

In foreign places
bad times for god
just go on dancing 'til the music stops
nanana...

Keep on rowing high
when you feel so alive
just take and fight
wait for this moment to arrive

And you're crazy if you wanna be mine
Too careful if you wanna be sure
you're everything money can buying
When he is here:
The Gentleman of the Year
The Gentleman of the Year
(gentlemen, gentlemen)
The Gentlemen of the Year.
(gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen...)

Let me go from here

(Where did we go wrong?)
(Where did we go wrong?)
(Where did we go wrong?)
(Where did we go wrong?)

Don't get caught
And don't get caught!
Don't get caught
And don't get caught!

Don't get...---
