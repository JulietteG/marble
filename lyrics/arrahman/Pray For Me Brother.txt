Pray for me brother
Pray for me brother
Pray for me sister
Are you searchin.
Pray for me brother

Lookin for the answers To all the questions In my life
Will I be alone Will you be there By my side
Is it something he said Is it something he did
I wonder why He is searchin For the answers
To stay alive

Could you ever listen Could you ever care
To speak your mind
Only for a minute For only one moment
In time

The joy is around us But show me the love
That we must find
Are you searchin For a reason to be kind, to be kind
He said Pray for me brother

Pray for me brother Pray for me sister
Pray for me brother Say
what you wanna say now
But keep your hearts open
Be what you wanna be now
Lets heal the confusion
Pray for me brother

Dont let me take When you dont wanna give
Dont be afraid Just let me live
Dont let me take When you dont wanna give
Dont be afraid Say what you wanna say now
But keep your hearts open

Be what you wanna be now Lets heal the confusion
Pray for me brother Pray for me brother
Im ashamed ah, brother be dying of poverty
when he down on his knees its only then he prays
And its a shame ah, brother be dying of ignorance
cos the world is a trip and everybodys a hypocrite
Need to stop ah , taking a look at the other
Im not ashamed of poverty
need to be making his life better
So think about it, think about it once more
cos life is a blessing and its not justa show, ah
Round and round the world is spinning around

We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now
Round and round the world is turning around
We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now
Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith
We need to coming together just to win this race

Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith
We need to coming together just to win this race (twice)
Are you searching for a reason to be kind ?---Lyrics submitted by Ankit Singh.
