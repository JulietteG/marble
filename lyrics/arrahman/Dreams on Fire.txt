You are my waking dream
Youre all thats real to me
You are the magic in the world I see

You are in the prayer I saying
You brought me to my knees
You are the faith that make me believe

Dreams on fire
Higher n higher
Passions burning
Ride (right?) on the path

Once for- forever yours
In me
All your heart
Dreams on fire
Higher n higher

You are my ocean waves
You are in my heart each day
you are the laughter from childhood games
You are the spark of dawn
You are where I belong
You are the ache I feel in every song

Dreams on fire
Higher n higher
Passions burning
Ride (right?) on the path

Once for- forever yours
In me
All your heart
Dreams on fire
Higher n higher---Lyrics submitted by Sophia.
