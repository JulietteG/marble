Saans mein teri saans mili to
mujhe saans aayi..

when your breath mixed in my breath,
I was able to breathe..

rooh ne chhoo li jism ki khushboo,
tu jo paas aayi..

soul touched the body's fragrance,
when you came nearby..

kab tak hosh sambhale koi,
hosh ude to ud jaane do..
dil kab seedhi raah chala hai
raah mude to mud jaane do
tere khayal mein doob ke aksar
achchi lage tanhaai..

how long can one remain in control,
when consciousness goes, let it go..
when has the heart gone on a straight path,
if the path turns, let it turn..
when I am in your thoughts,
loneliness feels good..

raat teri baahon mein kate to,
subaha badi halki lagti hai
aankh mein rehne lage ho kya tum,
kyon chhalki chhalki lagti hai
mujhko phir se chhoo ke bolo
meri kasam kya khaayi..

when the night goes in your arms,
morning looks very light,
have you started living in my eyes,
it keeps spilling..
touch me again and say,
have you sweared on me..

Saans mein teri saans mili to
mujhe saans aayi..

rooh ne chhoo li jism ki khushboo,
tu jo paas aayi..---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
