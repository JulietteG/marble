I'd do 22 states and half a mile 
Just to see your face before I die 
I don't care if all the lights are red 
I've got a wild horse running right through my head 

Well jeez Louise now don't you stop 
'Cause I'm not half way through of having enough 
You and me until we drop 
We're gonna hip shake escape 
Come on take-me-to-the-top 

You got me head over heels on gasoline 
You know how it feels like nicotine 
Head over heels go raise your flag 
Come on Bang Bang Bang give me heart attack 
Heart attack 

Burning down the wheels tonight 
Hey! Are you ready 
Burning down the wheels tonight 
Hey! Are you ready 
Burning down the wheels tonight 
Hey! Hey! You ready 
Burning down the wheels tonight 

My man knows what it's all about 
He will shoot me first then ask me out 
It was meant to be right from the start 
Yeah he carved his name into my heart 

Well jeez Louise a love roulette 
Yeah we got good times rolling in a red corvette 
You and me in silhouette 
We're gonna hip shake escape 
Do the things we never dared 

You got me head over heels on gasoline 
You know how it feels like nicotine 
Head over heels go raise your flag 
Come on Bang Bang Bang give me heart attack 
Heart attack 

Burning down the wheels tonight 
Hey! Are you ready 
Burning down the wheels tonight 
Hey! Are you ready 
Burning down the wheels tonight 
Hey! Hey! You ready 
Burning down the wheels tonight 
X2 
You got me head over heels on gasoline 
You know how it feels like nicotine 
Head over heels go raise your flag 
Come on Bang Bang Bang give me heart attack 
Heart attack
