Somebody joined
Somebody drowned
When Lady Jesus came to town, she made the calls, she made it fall in a gruesome vibe never seen before

Somebody joined 
Somebody drowned
Whos gonna care for a blinded fool?
Whos gonna save this blinded fool?
Watch out everyone here she comes, claiming like she the chosen one
Whos gonna save this blinded fool?

This is it, a money pit, i sense a fear of mother wit
Disguise! smokey eyes
How come she dont take advice?

Hey you hiding way
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Big fool!
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Hey you hiding way
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Big fool!
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never gettin inside


Walk the streets of my city hood
A silly sense of love and youth
What is left of an empty space, is society screaming for a better day
Walk the streets of my city hood

This is it a money pit, a sense of fear of mother wit
Disguise! smokey eyes
How come she dont take advice?

Hey you hiding way
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Big fool!
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never gettin inside

Hey you hiding way
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Big fool!
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Never gettin inside
Never gettin inside
Never gettin inside

Heyy Oh Awohhh

Hey you hiding way
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Big fool!
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never gettin inside

Hey you hiding way
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Big fool!
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never gettin inside
Never gettin inside
Never ever gettin inside

How does it feel eating souls for money huh? hehehe---Lyrics submitted by Blondie.
