if I drink this beer  
I'll probably have two, three  
If I Know me  
I'll be digging up past  
Like it's money in the backyard  

If I drink this beer  
I know it's gonna seem like a good idea  
To call you up in the middle of the night  
And tell you how I feel  

So why don't you just put it down  
Last thing I need to do tonight  
Is push my luck, drunk, get all messed up  
Now you'll never find a guy like me  

If I drink this beer  
I know it's going to leave you bored  
The night is short  
What would I do if knocked on your door  
And your boyfriend answer  

If I take just one sip  
It's going to get ugly quick  
Man it's tough  
'Cause I'm in love  
And I need to ease the pain---Lyrics submitted by ridlo islami.
