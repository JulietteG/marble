Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Don't try to change my melody,
Make me dance a different beat,
Cause this is where I belong.

Heaven knows that I can't see,
Listen to the sound of my own heartbeat.
I'm tempted by the brightest star.
They call my name but they're still too far.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Don't try to change my melody,
Make me dance a different beat,
Cause this is where I belong.

When all the lights turn to dark inside of me,
They grow a spark.
It made a fire,
The flames got higher.
Can't stop it now.
This is my time.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Every time I close my eyes I see that fire.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.

Don't tell me I can't sing this song,
Tell me that I've got it wrong,
Cause this is where I belong.
This is where I belong.
Oh, this is my song.---
