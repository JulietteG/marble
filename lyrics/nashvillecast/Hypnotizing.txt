You must've hit me, when I wasn't looking
Woke up dizzy, I can't remember nothing
Oh oh, but those sweet blue eyes

I'm seeing flashbacks dancing in my mind
The way you kiss me, as sweet as summertime
And I, I don't stand a chance

Oh, 'cause boy I was rolling the second
you walked in the room

This night you come and put a spell on me
You shook my world apart and suddenly
I'm helpless, reckless,
so baby I lost my mind
And tonight, your love is hypnotizing
Hypnotizing

The way you touch me, boy you send me flying
The way you move me is electrifying
Oh oh, rushing through my veins

I try to fight it, but I'm powerless
I'm no match for what I'm up against
But I, I keep giving in

And I don't have a prayer
but honey I don't even care

This night you come and put a spell on me
You shook my world apart and suddenly
I'm helpless, reckless,
so baby I lost my mind
And tonight, your love is hypnotizing
Hypnotizing

This night you come and put a spell on me
You shook my world apart and suddenly
I'm helpless, reckless,
so baby I lost my mind
And tonight, your love is hypnotizing
Hypnotizing

Your love is hypnotizing
Hypnotizing---
