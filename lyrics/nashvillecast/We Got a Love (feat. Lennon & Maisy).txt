The darkest cloud was put in fade 
Everything was the way 
And I hold you close 
Till the the sun comes out 
Baby, can you see it now 

We got a love, oh oh 
We got a hope breaking in spring 
Patience as a porch string, love 
Oh oh, me and you 

We got a love, oh oh 
Will rest free as a black bird 
True as the good word, love 
Oh oh, me and you 

So what do you need that you don't have? 
What have you lost you can't get back? 
What if I promise it'll be alright? 
It'll be alright 

'Cause we got a love, oh oh 
We got a candy apple red 
We steady as a heartbeat 
Oh oh, me and you---
