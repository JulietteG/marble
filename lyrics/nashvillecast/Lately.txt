I've been needing you, lately
When the sun goes down

I don't know where to find you
So I just drive around

Feel like a stranger in this place
I wanna see your face
I've been needing you
I've been needing you, lately

I've been missing you, lately
Things just aren't the same
All I'm feeling is lonely
Sometimes I call on your name

I want so bad to believe
Somehow you can hear me

I've been missing you
I've been missing you, lately

I'm on this road
My wheels just roll
I've always...
I've always, been yours
But I feel it even more....Lately

(Lately, etc.....)

Feel like a stranger in this place
I wanna see your face
I've been needing you
I've been needing you
I've been missing you
I've been missing you lately
Missing you lately---
