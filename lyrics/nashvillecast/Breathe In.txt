(feat. Charles Esten)

Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna break
Got what it take to keep me on the run
Not gonna stop for anything

I'm gonna roll, rollin' to the sun
Roll, roll, rollin' to the sun
Breathe in, breathe in
I got another day to breathe in

No lookin' back, no time for that
Hot on the track, burnin' in the dust
I see you bright, I see you clear

I'm gonna roll, rollin' to the sun
Roll, roll, rollin' to the sun
Breathe in, breathe in
I got another day to breathe in

Breathe in
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Breathe in, breathe in
I got another day to breathe in---
