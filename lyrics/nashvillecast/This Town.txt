	Hold on until the feelin' is so strong
Until the ground that you walk on
Is where you stand.
This dream, it heals and it haunts me
It's tempted and taught me who I am

This town ain't yours
And this town ain't mine.
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out.
Some will burn bright.
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town.
In this town.

Strangers, we're nothin' but strangers
When our heart's in danger
For the song we sing.
I've seen the devil inside me
But I won't let him guide me
Or take my wings

This town ain't yours
And this town ain't mine.
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out. (Some will burn out.)
Some will burn bright. (Some will burn bright.)
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town
In this town

This town ain't yours . (This town ain't yours.)
And it surely ain't mine. (This town ain't mine.)
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out.
Some will burn bright.
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town
In this town (This town.)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh this town.)
In this town. ---
