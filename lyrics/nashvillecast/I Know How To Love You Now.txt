(feat. Charles Esten)

My broken promises
Broke your heart
Time and time again
I let everything fall apart
I was such a fool back then
But you love me once I know
So many songs ago

So here I am
And I just pray
That you listen long enough
To hear me when I say
This brand new man
Won't let you down
YOu let me show you
I know how to love you now

I see the look in your eyes
You're scare
And I understand why
So am I

But here I am
And I just pray
That you will listen long enough
To hear me when I say
This brand new man
Won't let you down
You let me show you
I know how to love you now

Girl let me show you
I know how to love you now---
