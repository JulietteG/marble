I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Yeah, I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
