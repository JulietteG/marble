Storm's comin' around here again
Storm's comin' around here again
Dark clouds forming wherever I've been
Thunder is clashing in my mind
All the lightning makes me go blind

Storm's comin' I can't get away
Storm's comin' I can't get away
Dead Rodney is leaving but I have to stay

Storm's comin'
Storm's comin'---
