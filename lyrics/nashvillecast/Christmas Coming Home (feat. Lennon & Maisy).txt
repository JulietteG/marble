Snowflakes on my window pane 
Calling rudolph out by name 
Join in all the reindeer games 
It's Christmas coming home 

Picking out the perfect tree 
Stringing lights of red and green 
Prettiest star you've ever seen 
It's Christmas coming home 

Sitting by the fire burning 
Listening to children learning 
Christmas songs, they sing along 
(Here comes santa claus) 
(Here comes santa claus) 

Over the hills of snow 
Bundled up with a rosey nose 
The time is night come inside 
It's Christmas coming home 

Going out tobogganing 
Wearing mittens on a string 
Listening to the sleigh bells ring 
It's Christmas coming home 

Decorate like candy land 
Paper angels hand in hand 
Bring out the marching band 
It's Christmas coming home 

Sitting by the fire burning 
Listening to children learning 
Christmas songs, they sing along 
(Here comes santa claus) 
(Here comes santa claus) 

Over the hills of snow 
Bundled up with a rosey nose 
The time is night come inside 
It's Christmas coming home 

Winter white is coming down 
Friends and family gather round 
Let peace and love on earth be found 
It's Christmas coming home 

Sitting by the fire burning 
Listening to children learning 
Christmas songs, they sing along 
(Here comes santa claus) 
(Here comes santa claus) 

Over the hills of snow 
Bundled up with a rosey nose 
The time is night come inside 
It's Christmas coming home 

The time is night come inside 
It's Christmas coming home 
It's Christmas  
Christmas 
Coming home---
