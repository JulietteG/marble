( feat. Chris Carmack)

I've been a mover and a shaker
A sinner and a taker
A big mistake maker all my life
I was a sucker for a good time
A crosser of a straight line
A shadow in the sunshine
And I was blind
Then I was loved by you

I was lost as lost could be
I was running aimlessly
Down a road that only leads to nowhere fast
Couldn't noone slow me down
Lift me up on solid ground
Yea our love was nothing more than broken glass
Then I was loved by you.

I'd be lookin' for a lover
somewhere deep down in the gutter
Takin' cover underneath the neon lights
I was always on a bender
Back before I knew it mattered
Happy everafter never crossed my mind
Then I was loved by you

I was lost as lost could be
I was running aimlessly
Down a road that only leads to nowhere fast
Couldn't noone slow me down
Lift me up on solid ground
Yea our love was nothing more than broken glass
Then I was loved by you.

I was lost as lost could be
I was running aimlessly
Down a road that only leads to nowhere fast
Couldn't noone slow me down
Lift me up on solid ground
Yea our love was nothing more than broken glass
Then I was loved by you.

Yea, then I was loved by you
