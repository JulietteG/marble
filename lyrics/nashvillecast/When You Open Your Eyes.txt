(feat. Sam Palladio & Clare Bowen) 

When you close your eyes
You can only go back
To the place in your mind
Where it all goes off track
Staying up all night
Staring at the ceiling fan
Round and round you go

Breathe, let it all go by
Breathe, I'm always by your side
Breathe on me now (breathe on me)
I'll still be here
When you open your eyes

When the sun breaks through
And you're feelin' strong
When you give your best
But it still goes wrong
Either way I'll always be your home
Through the highs and lows
Up and down we go

Breathe, let it all go by
Breathe, I'm always by your side
Breathe on me now
I'll still be here
When you open your eyes

When you open your eyes

Breathe

Breathe, let it all go by
Breathe, I'm always by your side
Breathe on me now
I'll still be here
When you open your eyes

When you open your eyes
When you open your eyes---
