When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark
Have a little faith in me

And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darling, from a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you, you will see
I'll catch you, I'll catch your fall
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

I've been loving you for such a long time now
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You see time, time is our friend
But for us there is no end
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me---
