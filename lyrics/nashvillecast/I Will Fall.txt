(feat. Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio)

Im afraid to go up onto the second floor
If you wanted to work it out whyd you lock the door
I thought i was good at loving you
But our light went out when you wanted it to
I wish you the best, im headed west
its all i know to do

I will fall, I will fall if you come around
Just when i think my heart break has settled down
I will fall, I will fall if you come around
When we said goodbye it was forever
And i spent the last year piecing my life together
Just when i think ive let you go
Your songs playing on the radio
And just like that it rushes back
every part of you
I will fall, I will fall if you come around
Just when i think my heart break has settles down
I will fall, I will fall if you come around---
