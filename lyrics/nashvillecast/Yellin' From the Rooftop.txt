Love struck me out of nowhere
Like lightning from the sky
I wasn't even looking for the look in your eyes
Glory, Hallelujah
I feel like I've been saved
Washing in the river of your real love waves

Yeah

Something I never felt
and I can't keep it to myself

You've got me
Yellin' from the rooftop
So everybody knows
I've fallen for you baby
Never letting you go

I'm screaming from the mountain
Gonna sing it everywhere
Yeah, you call me crazy
Baby, I don't care
Can you hear me, hear me
Yellin' from the rooftop
Telling the whole world
Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl

Hey, yeah

You can call me lady lucky
I know I've been blessed
Your kissing got my heart beating outta my chest
It's easy, like breathing
You make me come alive
But it's a whole lot more than just a feeling inside

Yeah

It's left no shadow of doubt
So true, gotta let it out

You've got me
Yellin' from the rooftop
So everybody knows
I've fallen for you baby
Never letting you go

I'm screaming from the mountain
Gonna sing it everywhere
Yeah, you call me crazy
Baby, I don't care
Can you hear me, hear me
Yellin' from the rooftop
Telling the whole world
Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl

(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Telling the whole world)
(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl)

(Yellin' from the rooftop)
Baby
(Telling the whole world)
Telling the whole world
(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl)

Oh baby,
You make me wanna testify
Every day and every night

You've got me
Yellin' from the rooftop
So everybody knows
I'm falling for you baby
Never ever, never never letting you go

Yellin' from the rooftop
Gonna paint it in the sky
I never felt nothing like this in my life

I scream it from the mountain
Gonna sing it everywhere
Yeah, you call me crazy
Baby, I don't care
Can you hear me, hear me
Yellin' from the rooftop
Telling the whole world
Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl

(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Telling the whole world)
Scream it from the mountain
(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl)
I'm falling for you baby

(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Telling the whole world)
Telling the whole world
(Yellin' from the rooftop)
(Mama's little baby's gonna be your girl)---Lyrics submitted by Krystal Larsen.
