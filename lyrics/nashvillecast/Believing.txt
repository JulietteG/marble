(feat. Charles Esten and Lennon and Maisy)

I don't remember how I got here
When my rose colored glasses disappeared,
Sometimes my fingers, they can lose touch
Start letting go of everything I love

When I get the feeling that my prayers have hit the ceiling,
And those darker days when my faith has lost all meaning,
You keep me believing.

Life is your savior, heaven your hand
When I'm broken you put me back together again
All that I once was, all I could be
When I've forgotten baby you remind me

When I get the feeling that my prayers have hit the ceiling,
And those darker days when my faith has lost all meaning,
You keep me believing.

Every red heart starts beating new
If you want me baby I'll come back for you

When I get the feeling that my prayers have hit the ceiling
And those darker days when my faith has lost all meaning
When I get the feeling that my prayers have hit the ceiling
And those darker days when my faith has lost all meaning
You keep me believing---
