Some nights I don't sleep at all
I lie awake with my eyes closed
Some days I'm inside a cloud
So tired I just float around

And I'm lost again
I'm lost
Too far from you

I thought time would fade your face
Was sure that others could erase
What my heart felt so deep it's bronzed
Now I don't know what's going on

And I'm lost again
I'm lost
Too far from you

Too far from that body of water
Too far from songs that kept me dancing round

It's the kind that cannot break
All this time I still can't shake
The moment that we knew it's weight
And both had to just walk away

And I'm lost again
I'm lost
I'm lost again
I'm lost
I'm lost again
I'm lost
Too far from you---
