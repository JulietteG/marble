My broken promises broke your heart
Time and time again
I let everything fall apart
I was such a fool back then
But you loved me once I know
So many sorrys ago

So here I am
And I just pray
That you will listen long enough
To hear me when I say
This brand-new man won't let you down
If you let me show you
I know how to love you now

I see that look in your eyes
You're scared
And I understand why
So am I

But here I am and I just pray
That you will listen long enough
To hear me when I say
This brand-new man won't let you down
If you'll let me show you
I know how to love you now

Girl, let me show you
I know how to love you
Now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
