When you wake up wanting me
And you can't go back to sleep
Change your mind

When you're weak and alone
And you're reaching for the phone
Change your mind

Keep on going 'till you're gone
Even when you think it's wrong
When you look back in regret
The moment that you left

Change your mind
Baby don't come back this time
Don't wanna have to say goodbye, all over again
So if you think there's still a chance to make it right
And I'm the only one you want tonight
Change your mind
Change your mind

In the early morning haze
When my kiss is all you crave
Let it go
Cause I don't wanna do that dance
The push and pull, the second chance
I already know, yea I know

You'll just promise me forever
And then you'll take it back, just like that
Saying you can't live with out me
Then you'll...

Change your mind
So baby don't come back this time
Don't wanna have to say goodbye, all over again
So if you think there's still a chance to make it right
Change your mind

Cause I don't wanna have to say goodbye, all over again
So if you think there's still a chance to make it right
And I'm the only one, the one you want tonight
Change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind---Lyrics submitted by Carm.
