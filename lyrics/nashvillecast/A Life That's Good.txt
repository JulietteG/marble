Verse 1:
Sittin' here tonight,
By the fire light,
it reminds me I already have more than I should.

I don't need a thing, no one to know my name,
at the end of the day,
lord I pray, I have a life that's good.

Chorus:
Two arms around me, heaven to ground me,
and a family that always calls me home,

Four wheels to get there, enough love to share
and a sweet sweet sweet song

At the end of the day,
lord I pray ,
I have a life that's good.

Verse 2:
Sometimes I'm hard on me,
When dreams don't come easy,
I wanna look back and say,
I did all that I could,

Yeah at the end of the day, Lord I pray,
I have a life that's good.

Chorus:
Two arms around me, heaven to ground me,
and a family that always calls me home,

Four wheels to get there, enough love to share
and a sweet sweet sweet song

at the end of the day, Lord I pray
I have a life that's good
