Theres no music
No confetti
Crowds dont cheer and bells dont ring
But youll know it
I can guarantee
When the right one comes along

What their thinking 
What youre feeling
You no longer have to guess
All those questions
Finally put to rest 
When the right one comes along

Every single broken heart
Will lead you to the truth
You think you know what your looking for
Til what youre looking for finds you

In a cold world 
Its a warm place 
Where you know that youre supposed to be
A million moments 
Full of sweet relief
When the right one comes along

Every single broken heart
Will lead you to the truth
You think you know what youre looking for 
Til what youre looking for finds you

Its so easy 
Nothing to it
Though you may not believe me now
But i promise 
Honey youll find out 
When the right one comes along

All that changes 
Is only everything
When the right one comes along---Lyrics submitted by Sue W.
