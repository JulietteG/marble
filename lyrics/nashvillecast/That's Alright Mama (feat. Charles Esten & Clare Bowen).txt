Well, that's all right Mama
That's all right for you
That's all right Mama, just anyway you do
That's all right, that's all right
That's all right my Mama, anyway you do

Mama she don't told me
Papa don't told me too
Son, that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no girl for you
That's all right, that's all right
That's all right my Mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right my Mama, anyway you do

Mama she don't told me
Papa don't told me too
Son, that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no girl for you
That's all right, that's all right
That's all right my Mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right my Mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right my Mama, anyway you do

That's all right my Mama, anyway you do---
