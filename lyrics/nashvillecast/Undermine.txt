(feat. Charles Esten and Hayden Panettiere)

Sometimes good intentions
Dont come across so well..

Get me analyzing everything that
aint worth thinking 'bout
Just cause I aint lived through,
The same hand that was dealt to you
Doesn't make me any less
Or make any more of you.

I wouldnt trade my best day.
So you could validate
All your fears.

And if Ive only got one shot
Wont waste it on a shadow box
Ill stand right here

Chorus:
Its all talk, talk, talk
Talkin' in the wind
It only slows you down
If you start listenin'
And its a whole lot harder to shine, Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

First mile is always harder
When you're leaving what you know
Wont blame you if you stay here
Waving to me as I go
Always wished the best for you
Thought that you would see me through my wildest dreams
Yeah, the ones you thought Id never make

Still, you would trade your best day
Just to have your way
All these years
And if you only had one shot
Maybe all this talk
Would disappear

Repeat Chorus

It's a whole lot harder to shine
Yeah, it's a whole lite harder to shine, Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well...---
