Tell that devil to take you back, take you back, take you back
My heart went from red to black, red to black, red to black
Came up from that lake of fire, lake of fire, lake of fire
Only had that one desire, one desire

Got a mouth full of gasoline
Don't you bring your mind in me
Well I gave you all I got to give
I know that ain't no way to live
So I told that devil to take you back
I told that devil to take you back

You came around to watch me break, watch me break, watch me break
Just another soul to take, soul to take, soul to take

Sweet shot of kerosene
When I threw it back, it poisoned me
Well I gave you all I got to give
I know that ain't no way to live
So I told that devil to take you back
I told that devil to take you back

Ooooh-ooh ....

Tell that devil to take you back, take you back, take you back
My heart went from red to black, red to black, red to black
Came up from that lake of fire, lake of fire, lake of fire
Only had that one desire

You're a sweet shot of kerosene
When I threw it back, it poisoned me
Well I gave you all I got to give
I know that ain't no way to live
So I told that devil to take you back
I told that devil to take you back
I told that devil to take you back---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
