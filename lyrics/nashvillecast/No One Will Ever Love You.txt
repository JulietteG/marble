(feat, Connie Britton and Charles Esten)

 Dont you try to tell me someones waiting.
Theyre not waiting for you.
Oh and dont you try to tell me that youre wanted.
That youre needed.
Cause its not true.
I know why youre lonely.
Its time you knew it too.
No one will ever love you, no one will ever love you.
No one will ever love you like I do.

Why you always looking for the limelight?
Aint you satisfied with me?
For once why dont you get down off your high heels,
youre no big deal.
Cant you see? I know why youre lonely.
Its time you knew it too.
No one will ever love you. No one will ever love you.
No one will ever love you like I do.
Im all you got.
Im all youll ever need.
Im all youll ever have.---
