The rivers between us are deep
and dark as the secrets we keep
We stand on the shores
time runnin' by at our feet
Oh, the rivers between us are deep

Our love is like the moon
rising too fast, fading too soon
This night will soon be gone
help me hold on

There are kingdoms to keep us apart
so we live out our lives in the dark
Love has a way of making you pay with your heart
There are kingdoms to keep us apart

Our love is like the moon
rising too fast, fading too soon
This night will soon be gone
help me hold on
Help me hold on...---
