(feat. Connie Britton)

All the lies of the lonely
All the empty words of the solitary mind
A thin disguise, you think they don't see
Can't hide the lonely in your lies

I don't wanna be no ball and chain
i don't wanna wear no headpiece
I don't wanna be somebody's other
I got my my friends, don't need no lover

Well, I love being single
I love my friend
I love telling everybody that we're not together anymore
And all of those love songs
Well, they can keep 'em to themselves
'Cause I'm so much better off than I was before

All the lies of the lonely
All the empty words of the solitary mind
A thin disguise, you think they don't see
Can't hide the lonely in your lies---
