Back to back
Lines drawn deep into the dust
Ten paces forward
Staring straight into the sun

You shoulda rode your
High horse outta town
You no-good, lyin',
cheatin' run around
I'm gonna show you
how the west was won

This love ain't big enough
for the two of us
Locked 'n' loaded, it's high noon
Make my day, you son of a gun
This love ain't big enough
For the two of us

(This love
Ain't big enough
This love, for two of us)

Undertaker waitin'
on somebody to go down
I'm gonna take what's
left of this love
And put it in the ground

It was a knockdown
Drag-out romance
Quick draw
Honey, let me see you dance
Look at who's the last one standin'
Now !

This love ain't big enough
for the two of us
Locked 'n' loaded, it's high noon
Make my day
You son of a gun
This love ain't big enough
For the two of us

Pick the coffin, bury this love
Drive a nail in, baby, I'm done
Pick the coffin, bury this love
Drive a nail in, baby, I'm done

This love ain't big enough
for the two of us
Locked 'n' loaded, it's high noon
Make my day, you son of a gun
This love ain't big enough
For the two of us---
