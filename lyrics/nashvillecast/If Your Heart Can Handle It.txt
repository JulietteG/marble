If I could well I would 
Go back in time 
Yeah baby 
Back before 
Left you high and dry 
And maybe 

I could show you a thing or two 
About what good love is supposed to do 
It left you scare to love again 
Where you're riding ain't where you've been 

Let me dry your eyes 
And heal the hurt inside 
If you willing to 
Baby, Got a pocketful of promise 
Got it if you want it 
Got a whole lot more to give 
If your heart can handle it 

I've been broke, I've been used 
Can't take another go round, honey 
It's gonna take a little time 
You just know the right kind of loving 

But if you ain't in any kind of hurry 
Then baby that's the least of my worry 
Now and when you laid it all out there 
If I'm going to start 
This gotta start somewhere 

You can my dry my eyes 
And heal the hurt inside 
If you willing to 
Baby, Got a pocketful of promise 
Got it if you want it 
Got a whole lot more to give 
If your heart can handle it 

We got all the pieces 
All the things we need to 
Put it back together again 

I'm in 
If you're in 
Well I'm in 

Let me dry your eyes 
And heal the hurt inside 
If you willing to 
Baby, Got a pocketful of promise 
Got it if you want it 
Got a whole lot more to give 
If your heart, your heart 
If you heart can handle it 

If your heart can handle it 
My heart can handle it---
