Oh, here I go again
Walking the line killing time between my sins
Oh, why do I come here?
The ending is still the same
Im bringin' back old tears
I act like I dont know
Where this road will go

Pour me something stronger, pour me something straight
All these crooked voices, make them go away
I can barely stand up
I can hardly breathe
Pour me something stronger than me
Pour me something stronger than me

Sunrise hurts as much as you
You always come up when I dont want you to
Oh, I can still hear you say
That you and I will both be better off this way
These things that I run to,
What I put my heart through

Pour me something stronger, pour me something straight
All these crooked voices, make them go away
I can barely stand up
I can hardly breathe
Pour me something stronger than me

Pour me something stronger, pour me something dark.
Pour it up so high till I cant feel my heart.
I can barely stand up.
I can barely breathe.
Pour me something stronger than me.
Pour me something stronger than me.---Lyrics submitted by Cathy Koschik.
