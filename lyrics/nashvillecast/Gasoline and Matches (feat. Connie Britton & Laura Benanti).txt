Baby, baby, baby, baby, listen what I say
Baby, baby, baby, baby, let me have my way
I'm gonna keep on knockin' till the door unlatches
You and me are gasoline and matches

Baby, baby, baby, baby, when it's cold and dark
Baby, baby, you make me, you make me feel a spark
Yeah I feel a spark and the fire catches
You and me are gasoline and matches

You pull my pin and you trip my wire
You come in and set my heart on fire
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis
You and me are gasoline and matches

Baby, baby, baby, baby, when you make your move
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can feel your groove
The resistance of a strong willed man's in ashes
You and me are gasoline and matches

You pull my pin and you trip my wire
You come in and set my heart on fire
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis
You and me are gasoline and matches

Baby I'm incarcerated and I don't want out
Baby we should get related and there ain't no doubt
That when your heart and my heart attaches
You and me are gasoline and matches
You and me are gasoline and matches
You and me are gasoline and matches---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
