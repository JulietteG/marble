I've been up, down, turned inside out
all messed up over you
You've been up, down, all over town
like you've got nothin' to lose
I just can't keep, tryin' to keep up with you

I'm done runnin'
chasing after somethin'
waiting on your lovin' to stay here with me.
I can't keep hopin', never knowin'
where you're goin' when you leave
Cause I don't know if you're ever gonna be done runnin'

We both know we've been here before,
on the edge of goodbye
We both know we can't take no more
and I'm so tired of the fightin'
So I'm gon'a try if it's just for the night

I'm done runnin'
chasing after somethin'
waiting on your lovin' to stay here with me
I can't keep hopin', never knowin'
where you're goin' when you leave
Cause I don't know if you're ever gonna be done runnin'

I don't hate you, cause I can't change you
I still love you but I'm through

I'm done runnin'
chasing after somethin'
waitin' on your lovin' to stay here with me
I can't keep hopin', never knowin'
where you're goin' when you leave
Cause I don't know if you're ever gonna be done runnin'

I'm done runnin'---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
