(feat. Connie Britton and Laura Benanti)

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Listen what I say
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Let me have my way
I'm gonna keep on knockin'
Till that door unlatches
You and me
Or gasoline and matches

Baby, baby, baby, baby
When it's cold and dark
Baby, baby
You will make me
Make me feel a spark
Yeah, I feel a spark
When the fire catches
You and me
Or gasoline and matches

You pull my hand and trip my wire
You come in and set my heart on fire
You knock me out
And rock me off my ashes
You and me
Or gasoline and matches

Baby, I'm intoxerated
And I don't want out
Baby, we should get related
And there ain't no doubt
When your heart and my heart attaches
You and me
Or gasoline and matches
You and me
Or gasoline and matches---
