Left my home when I was young
Sold my heart for a song
I may be wrong
To think you'd sing along

But the hardest thing I ever had to do
Was stand up straight and try to love you

Playing cards in motel rooms
I can't take calls they won't get through
You know this life
But that don't make you right

Still the hardest thing I ever had to do
Was stand up straight and try to love you

Changing strings and breaking town
Drank so much I damn near drowned
Can't get much rest
Living like this

Still the hardest thing I ever had to do
Was stand up straight and try to love you (2x)

Oh the hardest thing I ever had to do
Was stand up straight and try to love you---
