I can rock a Target tank top
Gucci sunglasses
cheap flip flops
and still look like a million bucks to you
You know its true

Throw my hair up and be ready to go
Spend all night trying on clothes
I can make up 
and blame it all on you

You wouldnt understand it

Im a girl, oh yea
I can get a free drink from flipping my hair
Stay home
with a bottle of wine
and you

Im a girl, I got skills
I can dance all night in five inch heels
Can make you feel like the luckiest boy in the world
Cause Im a girl

At a drop of a hat
When I get pulled over for going too fast
Drive away with his phone number too

Im an expert in chocolate and Chinese food
And at that time of the month, I feel sorry for you
Im a pain, shoot
Aint nothing you can do

I like my men real tall
well, I kinda like them all

Im a girl, oh yeah ---
