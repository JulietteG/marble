Every story's got a bad guy
Leaves a trail behind
Everybody's got a sad song
'n' this one's Mine

Somebody caught red-handed
Holding a smoking gun
'n' To tell the truth I always knew
I'd be the one

But You...
You left a hole in the world
where the rain gets in
Are We never gonna be the same again?
Yeah..eah..eah. Yeah..eah..eah

You...
You left a hole in the world
where the love fell through
In the shape of a heart that's broken in two
Yeah..eah..eah. Yeah..eah..eah
You..ooh..ooh..

I had always been the outlaw,
Riding into the sun
Never stopped to think about,
All the damage done

No, I'm no Calamity Jane
I knew love had a price
No, I aint that tough
but I didn't realise how much

So You...
You left a hole in the world
where the rain gets in
Are We never gonna be the same again?
Yeah..eah..eah. Yeah..eah..eah

You...
You left a hole in the world
where the love fell through
In the shape of a heart that's broken in two
Yeah..eah..eah. Yeah..eah..eah
You..ooh..ooh..

Could have left Me with a reason why
Could have left Me with a little blue sky

But You...
You left a hole in the world
where the rain gets in
Are We never gonna be the same again?
Yeah..eah..eah. Yeah..eah..eah

You...
You left a hole in the world
where the love fell through
In the shape of a heart that's broken in two
Yeah..eah..eah. Yeah..eah..eah
You..ooh..ooh..

You left a whole in the world
Ooh..ooh....---
