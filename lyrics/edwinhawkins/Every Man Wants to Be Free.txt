Choir:
Everyman wants to be free (ahhh, ahhh, ahhh) 
Wants to be free....

Lead:
Every man wants to be free.
As free as the bird that fly over land and over sea. He wants to be free.
Free to do things my way (my way)
Free to say want I want to say (what I want to say)
And make my own decisions, even if I lose
God gave me the right to chose

Choir:
Ba ba baa, Ba ba baa, Ba ba baa , Ba ba baa
Ba ba baa, Ba ba baa, Ba ba baa , Ba ba baa

Every man wants to be free, every man wants to be free
Every man wants to be free, every man wants to be free
Every man wants to be free, every man wants to be free
Every man wants to be free, 
He wants to be free, He wants to be free He wants to be free

He wants to be free (every man)
He wants to be free (every man)
He wants to be free (every man)
He wants to be free (every man)---Lyrics submitted by Rev Johnson.
