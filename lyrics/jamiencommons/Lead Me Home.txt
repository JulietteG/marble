Oh Lord live inside me, lead me on my way
Lead me home
Lead me home

Oh Lord in the darkness, lead me on my way
Oh Lord in the darkness, lead me on my way
Lead me home
Lead me home

Hmmmmm
Hmmmmm

Oh Lord heaven's waiting, open up your door
Oh Lord heaven's waiting, open up your door
Lead me home
Lead me home

Lead me home
Lead me home

Lead me home
Lead me home ---
