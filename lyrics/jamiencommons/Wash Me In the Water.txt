I'm wilt, yeah I'm angry,
But I've been raising Cain.
Cuz the path I'm on seems much the same.
But in the cold night,
I can't help but ask for more
Seems to be the pain
That I've been asking for

So wash me in the water
Take it all away
Wash me in the water, Take away this pain
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water
(Wash me of it all) Wash me of it all
(Wash me in the Water) Wash me in the water, before my fall.

And I've changed, Lord I've changed, the man I used to be.
I've hurt you far too much fore I could see.
But in the cold night
I'm sure I'll find a way
To drag you honey
And bring you down again

So wash me in the water, Take it all away
Wash me in the water, Take this pain
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water
(Wash me of it all) Wash me of it all
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water, Before my fall

All these days just pass me by now 
Ending up the same
Lord all those days just pass me by now
Just ending up just the same
Ending always the same, ending always the same, ending always the same, and always the same

(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water
(Wash me of it all) Take it all away
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water, Take this pain
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water
(Wash me in the water) Wash me of it all
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water, Before my fall
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water
(Wash me of it all) Take it all away
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water, Before I fall
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water
(Wash me of it all) Wash me of it all
(Wash me in the water) Wash me in the water, Before I fall

Well if I had it my way
Lord, if I had it anyway---Lyrics submitted by Dontae Dixon.
