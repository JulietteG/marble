I heard all I needed
Can't fight the signs
I could taste the blood there

I can taste the lust
I can see the sorrow
I can find the light
See the angel of death there

She slowing camping the town
It's when you thought that the war was over
It's when you thought that the worse was doom
she coming back around
she coming back around
she coming back around to get you

Karma, Karma
What goes around, comes back around
When I see you again
I'm gonna put you down

Karma, Karma
What goes around, comes back around
When I see you again
I'm gonna put you down

Why don't you hold you hands up?
Why don't you take your stance?
You should have let me die there
You should have took your chance

I feel a turning tide there
Feel it raised the flag
I take the sun from your stars there
Now you can't look back

It's when you thought that the war was over
It's when you thought the worse was doom
she coming back around
she coming back around
she coming back around to get you

Karma, Karma
What goes around, comes back around
When I see you again
I'm gonna put you down

Karma, Karma
What goes around, comes back around
When I see you again
I'm gonna put you down

Karma, Karma
What goes around, comes back around
When I see you again
I'm gonna put you down

Karma, Karma
What goes around, comes back around
When I see you again
I'm gonna put you down---
