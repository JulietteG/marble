Night falls and Im calling out your name
And youre right where I want you to be
Tears turn to stars in my eyes
And your love is an old mystery

Superlover, I wonder
does every other lover in the world 
make each other feel
The way you make me feel

I think Im going insane
You bring out the need in me
Never felt such joy or such pain
I know I ought to go but I just can not leave

Superlover, I wonder
does every other lover in the world 
make each other feel
The way you make me feel

Never knew anybody like you
No one could move me like you do
Love on top of love
More love than I ever dreamed of

Superlover, I wonder
does every other lover in the world 
make each other feel
The way you make me feel

Baby Baby Wont you touch me touch me
Make me make me
Drive me crazy

Superlover, I wonder
does every other lover in the world 
make each other feel
The way you make me feel (twice)
Superlover, I wonder does (fade)---Lyrics submitted by T.
