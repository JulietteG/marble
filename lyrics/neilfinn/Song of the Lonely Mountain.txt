Far over the Misty Mountains rise
Leave us standing upon the heights
What was before, we see once more
Our kingdom a distant light

Fiery mountain beneath the moon
The words unspoken, well be there soon
For home a song that echoes on
And all who find us will know the tune

Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Havent seen the back of us yet
Well fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
Well ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long-forgotten gold

We lay under the Misty Mountains cold
In slumbers deep and dreams of gold
We must awake, our lives to make
And in the darkness a torch we hold

From long ago when lanterns burned
Till this day our hearts have yearned
Her fate unknown the Arkenstone
What was stolen must be returned

We must awake and make the day
To find a song for heart and soul

Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Havent seen the end of it yet
Well fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
Well ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long-forgotten gold
Far away from Misty Mountains cold.---
