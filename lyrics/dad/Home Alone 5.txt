Gently my eyelids close, I'd rather be good than clever 
I'd rather have all facts wrong than no reply whatever.. 
I learned before I could speak with those "being patient eyes" 
When God created my kind. But he forgot to tell me why 
So gently my eyelids close.. 
All alone, at home I sit - I'm very tired of it 
Burn the midnight oil or pour it on my salad 
I lost the thread I thought I had... 

Led by hearts & ears - memory lagging behind 
No shame being a fool, I got many things on my mind 
Pick up the phone on first riiiing - I never get out anymore.. 
There's nowhere to go, but back and there's quicksand outside my door 
So gently my eyelids close 
All alone, at home I sit - I'm very tired of it 
Burn the midnight oil or pour it on my salad 
I lost the thread I thought I had.. I lost it - I lost it. Yeah! 
Is that a shadow - or a hole in the floor? 
And what's that noise outside my door?? 
Home alone. On my own.. And all alone...---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
