I'm looking at the sky, I'm trying
not to cry coz it's over
they're turnin' down the light
it's late now
wave the last goodbye

Coz it's after dark now
and Disneyland is closed
we've been served ice cold beer
and Walty is our host

it's after dark now
and Disneyland is closed
the party is over
the night is her
let's bring out a toast---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
