I need to be afraid, said the kind weak man 
As he lay cuddled up in his bed with those whispers around his head 
Yeah, he'd come to nothing in a way - in a way that left him 
With nothing to say but: o.k.! Yeah, his eyes only worked one way 
There's no such thing as paranoia, it's always twice as bad as you fear 
And the thing that destroys you, is that you had the answers right here 
There's no such thing as paranoia, it's always twice as bad as you fear 
I told you I told you I hate to say I told you so.. 

Old scars, but the cuts were new, said the girl, who loved many 
But trusted a few, yeah, it's true - 'coz she feared anyone new 
She lend out her feelings of pure affection, he kept the collection 
And the missing piece of her heart - Yeah, her eyes only looked that far 
There's no such thing as paranoia, it's always twice as bad as you fear 
And the thing that destroys you, is that you had the answers right here 
There's no such thing as paranoia, it's always twice as bad as you fear 
I told you I told you I hate to say I told you so.. 

There's murder going on inside... 
Yeah, 'coz you only see so much through the human eye 
There's no such thing as paranoia, it's always twice as bad as you fear 
And the thing that destroys you, is that you had the answers right here 
There's no such thing as paranoia, it's always twice as bad as you fear 
I told you I told you I hate to say I told you so..---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
