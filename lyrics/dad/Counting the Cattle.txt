I'm countin' the cattle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
I'm countin' the cattle
just to check if they're alive
I'm countin' the cattle
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
I'm countin' the cattle once again

Well, the first little cow, she went for a climb,
she went off the mountain
and they're still 9

and the second little cow, went out for a date,
discovered it was Wolfie
and then we were 8

I'm countin' the cattle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
I'm countin' the cattle
just to check if they're alive
I'm countin' the cattle
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
I'm countin' my cattle once again

Well, number 3 and number 4, they were long horned chicks
they met some horny bulls,
and now I'm only countin' 6

Number 5, 6 and 7, went out without their key,
and now they're hanging at the butchers
and I'm only countin' 3

I'm countin' the cattle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
I'm countin' the cattle
just to check if they're alive
I'm countin the cattle
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
I'm countin my cattle once again

Well, the 8th and the 9th, said we're never havin' fun
and then they packed their things and left
and now I'm only countin' 1.

Now you see, we're alone me and Molly.
She is brown-spotted, cheerfull and she's jolly
she milks herself every day, 
and she's promised me that she'll stay.

Well, our son is a muh-tant but who gives a damn
I mean, when the folks downtown calls us Mr. and Mam.

I'm countin' the cattle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
I'm countin' the cattle
just to check if they're alive
I'm countin' the cattle
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
I'm countin' the cattle while they're here
I'm countin' the cattle once again.---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
