I don't know your name
I don't know your sex
Don't know what you look like
Doesn't make much sense
to know I will love you
Almost like my own
Heard your mama crying 
On the telephone

What can I do now
But lay up and sing,
Moving this one out,
welcoming you in?

Well the news is in
That you came at last
I was getting worried
Seems you took your time
You're a long thin boy
With the widest hands
Seems the stars above
Are wondrously alive

What can I do now
But to sling my voice
Serenading you
Wild with overjoy?

You're on your way
I heard your mother
You're on your way
I heard your mother moan

Punch it up on your keyboard
Punch it up on your screen
Down in your money markets, up on TV

Make it into a clone,
Take this piece too
Building block to building block 
Don't mean you.

With a million feet fighting your own
Oh baby what a sight
When all of creation is known!

On your way 
Into the air
Dissipating
But still out there---Lyrics submitted by aaron.
