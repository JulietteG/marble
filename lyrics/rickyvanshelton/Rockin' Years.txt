I'll do everything i can to make you proud to be my man
And I'll fullfill all your fantasies
I guess we're promising alot, but for now it's all we've got
And i'll stand by you through our rockin years

(chorus)
Rockin' chairs
Rockin' babies
Rock'a'bye
Rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you hold me tight when you love me
Thats all i'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years


I'll be your friend 
I'll be your lover
Until the end they'll be no other
And my heart has only room for one
Yes I'l always love you
And I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you throgh our rockin' years

(chorus) 


Rockin' chairs
Rockin' babies 
Rock'a'bye 
Rock of ages 
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years

Rockin' chairs
Rockin' babies 
Rock'a'bye
Rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And yes I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years 
Yes I'll be here and I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Through our rockin' years---Lyrics submitted by Lynn.
