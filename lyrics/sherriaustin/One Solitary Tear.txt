Your love was reckless baby I fell deep
Easy to hold but you were hard to keep
You were a heartache waiting to be
We took off flying down a dead end street

I never knew that love could hurt so bad
When you said goodbye with a tip of your hat
I watched you leaving across the welcome mat
And though I know that you ain't coming back

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
Falling from my eyes
I'll get over you I'll get by
One solitary tear at a time

Little things remind me that you're gone
The mailman still brings all your catalogs
The radio just keeps on playing our songs
But I tell myself that I have to be strong

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
Falling from my eyes
I'll get over you I'll get by
One solitary tear at a time

I'll get over you
I'll get by
One solitary tear
At a time
One solitary tear
At a time---Lyrics submitted by shelly ellison.
