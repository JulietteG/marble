This one is for the ladies, they lookin' so amazing
Let's get crazy, ain't nothing gonna save me
Make this an epic night
Make this an epic night

Turn down the lights, turn up the music
You've been waiting all week to let it out
Your piece of mind, go ahead and lose it
We don't need no gravity, it's going down

This one is for the ladies, they lookin' so amazing
Let's get crazy, ain't nothing gonna save me
Make this an epic night
We gon' do it right
Our hands up in the air
Make this an epic night
Don't wanna see daylight
Our hands up in the air

When that beat go boom, boom, boom
I wanna see you move, move, move, move, move, move, move
When that beat go boom, boom, boom
I wanna see you move, move, move, move, move, move, move

Forever young, party forever
Don't watch the clock, you came to have a good time
Something's wrong, don't make it better
Do what you want
You just gotta live your life

This one is for the ladies, they lookin' so amazing
Let's get crazy, ain't nothing gonna save me
Make this an epic night
We gon' do it right
Our hands up in the air
Make this an epic night
Don't wanna see daylight
Our hands up in the air

When that beat go boom, boom, boom
I wanna see you move, move, move, move, move
When that beat go boom, boom, boom
I wanna see you move, move, move, move, move

Put your problem aside, you've got the right
To lose your mind
Get your hands in the sky
And move your body close to mine

This one is for the ladies, they lookin' so amazing
Let's get crazy, ain't nothing gonna save me
Make this an epic night
We gon' do it right
Our hands up in the air
Make this an epic night
Don't wanna see daylight
Our hands up in the air

When that beat go boom, boom, boom
I wanna see you move, move, move, move, move
When that beat go boom, boom, boom
I wanna see you move, move, move, move, move

Our hands up in the air
Make this an epic night
Our hands up in the air
Make this an epic night ---Lyrics submitted by Chloe McCoy.
