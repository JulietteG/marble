Wait a minute, before you tell me anything how was your day?
Cause I, been missing, you by my side, yeah. 
Did I, awake you out of your dreams I'm sorry but I couldn't sleep.
You calm me down there's something bout the sound of your voice.

I,I,I,I never, never, never as far away as it may seem, no
Soon we'll be together we'll pick up right where we left off.....

(Chorus)
Paris, London, Tokyo. There's just on thing that i got to go.
(Hello) Tuck you in every night on the phone (Hello) Tuck you in every night
And I can never take another good bye baby wont be long
Your the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello) Tuck you in every night on the phone (whoa)
Girl I'm been thinking about you WORLDWIDE x3
Girl I'm been thinking about you WORLDWIDE x3 Girl I'm been thinking about you

Yes, I may, meet a million pretty girls that know my name
But don't, you worry, cause you have my heart
It ain't, easy, to keep on moving city to city just get up and go
The show must go on so I need you to be strong

I,I,I,I never, never, never as far away as it may seem, no
Soon we'll be together we'll pick up right where we left off.....

(Chorus)
Paris, London, Tokyo. There's just on thing that i got to go.
(Hello) Tuck you in every night on the phone (Hello) Tuck you in every night
And I can never take another good bye baby wont be long
Your the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello) Tuck you in every night on the phone (whoa)
Girl I'm been thinking about you WORLDWIDE x3
Girl I'm been thinking about you WORLDWIDE x3 Girl I'm been thinking about you

(Oh) Where ever the wind blows me, your still the one and only girl on my mind
Baby no, There ain't no one better (World wide) so always remember (World wide)
Always remember, Girl your mine

(Chorus)
Paris, London, Tokyo. There's just on thing that i got to go.
(Hello) Tuck you in every night on the phone (Hello) Tuck you in every night
And I can never take another good bye baby wont be long
Your the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello) Tuck you in every night on the phone (whoa)
Girl I'm been thinking about you WORLDWIDE x3
Girl I'm been thinking about you WORLDWIDE x3 Girl I'm been thinking about you (World Wide)

Yes, I may, meet a million pretty girls that know my name
But don't, you worry, cause you have my heart.---Lyrics submitted by michael.
