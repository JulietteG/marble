Looks good in a dress
Even better in a sweatshirt
My car is a mess
But she don't mind
She never complains
Even when I'm out all night
I sleep in all day
And that's just fine

'Cause she knows that I'm falling fast
Oh, oh
And I know that I'll never let her go

Singing oh yeah, I'm loving that
The ways she makes me feel
Singing oh yeah, she's so rad
This is just unreal
And all around the world
I've never seen a girl
That makes me crazy, baby
Girl you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl you're just amazing

The only one at the show
That doesn't beg for attention
She already knows
She's got the part
She lives in the now
Even if it's not forever
So girl take a bow
You've won my heart

'Cause she knows that I'm falling fast
Oh, oh
And I know that I'll never let her go

Singing oh yeah, I'm loving that
The ways she makes me feel
Singing oh yeah, she's so rad
This is just unreal
And all around the world
I've never seen a girl
That makes me crazy, baby
Girl you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl you're just amazing

Woah, woah, girl you're just amazing
Girl you're just amazing
Woah, woah, girl you're just amazing
Now baby listen to me
You're more than all that I need
When you're by my side
I must be under a spell
And girl if you couldn't tell
You light up my life, yea yea

Singing oh yeah, I'm loving that
The ways she makes me feel
Singing oh yeah, she's so rad
This is just unreal
And all around the world
I've never seen a girl
That makes me crazy, baby
Girl you're just amazing

Singing oh yeah, I'm loving that
The ways she makes me feel
Singing oh yeah, she's so rad
This is just unreal
And all around the world
I've never seen a girl
That makes me crazy, baby
Girl you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl you're just amazing
Oh, oh, girl you're just amazing---Lyrics submitted by Christian J.
