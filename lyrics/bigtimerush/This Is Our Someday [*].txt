another day feels like, the other
and everywhere looks just the same
when every dream seems like, forever
and you're a face without a name

maybe now is our best chance (best chance)
to finally get it right (get it right)
'cause if the world is an apple (oh yeah)
then its time to take a bite

someday
it'll come together
someday
we will work it out
i know
we can turn it up all the way
'cause this is our someday 

someday
is what we make it
someday
is right here or now

why wait? (why wait?)
why wait?
cause this is our someday

oh oh,oh oh
oh!
oh oh, oh oh, oh (yeah yeah)
oh oh, oh oh
oh oh, oh oh (oh, oh)

we all have times
times we wonder
will the spotlight shine on me?

i can't let the waves go and pull us under
i'll miss the opportunity (oh no)
don't look down or look back (look back)
there's not that far to go
cause if we never try then
we will never really know (so!)

someday
it'll come together
someday
we will work it out (work it out)
i know
we can turn it up all the way
'cause this is our someday 

someday (yeah)
is what we make it
someday
is right here or now

why wait? 
why wait?
why wait? (why wait?)
cause this is our someday

oh no
i don't have all the answers
but there is one thing
i know for sure (yeah)

one is good
but four is better
it took some time to get here (time to get here)
but it's better late than never

someday
it'll come together

someday
we will work it out

i know
we can turn it up all the way

'cause this is our someday

someday
is what we make it

someday (someday)
is right here and now

why wait? (why wait?)
why wait?
'cause this is our someday

someday (oh!)
it'll come together
someday
we will work it out 
i know
we can turn it up all the way
cause this is our someday (oh!)

someday
is what we make it
someday (whoo!)
is right here and now

why wait? (why wait?)
why wait?
'cause this is our someday---Lyrics submitted by meleena.
