Thinkin' we don't wanna get caught up in over-thinking, we only got tonight
Moments, we gotta keep on living for these moments, 'cause this is our time

Life's too short to sit and wait for luck to come our way
Light it up like fireworks, I wanna hear you say

We are, we are
We are alive, and we are the light that's shinin' now
We are, we are
We are the reckless, you can hear us drownin' out the sound
We are, we are
Young and dumb, always chasin' something 
We are, we are
Hearts like drums, you can hear us comin'
We are, we are

Chances, you know there's nothing wrong with taking chances, we put it on the line
Oh, someday (someday) I know we're gonna be somebody someday, only gotta try

Life's too short to sit and wait for luck to come our way
Light it up like fireworks, I wanna hear you say

We are, we are
We are alive, and we are the light that's shinin' now
We are, we are
We are the reckless, you can hear us drownin' out the sound
We are, we are
Young and dumb, always chasin' something 
We are, we are
Hearts like drums, you can hear us comin'
We are, we are

Oh oh, oh-whoa 
Oo-whoa, oh, oh o-whoa
We are, we are.
Oh oh, oh-whoa 
Oo-whoa, oh, oh o-whoa
We are, we are.
Oh oh, oh-whoa 
Oo-whoa, oh, oh o-whoa
We are, we are.
Oh oh, oh-whoa 
Oo-whoa, oh, oh o-whoa

We are alive, and we are the light that's shinin' now
We are, we are
We are the reckless, you can hear us drownin' out the sound
We are, we are
Young and dumb, always chasin' something 
We are, we are
Hearts like drums, you can hear us comin'
We are, we are---Lyrics submitted by Finn Human.
