Want you to cry
'Cause you're laughing so hard tonight
Playing air guitar alright
We're being who we are even if they hate that

Want you to shout
At the top of your lungs about
All our favorite songs so loud
We'll be singing along even if they hate that

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh whoa oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, nevermind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa
So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh oh oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, nevermind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa
So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Whoa oh oh oh
We can do it like nobody's around
Whoa oh oh oh
We can do it like nobody's around
Yeah yeah yeah
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
We can do it like nobody's around
Whoa oh oh oh
We can do it like nobody's around ---
