Waking up from another day
I'm feeling so insane
'Cause ever since I saw your face
I got it tattooed on my brain

Did you know that you came and you got me like this
'Cause I know you're the one that I wanna be with
You gotta know I'd do anything
To get you to notice me

What I gotta do to get you into my life?
I can be your bad boy, or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars if you'd give me the night
Come on, eh, eh, eh

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world, and no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

Now I got your attention babe
There's some things I need to say
Like you're the one that I dream about
It's on my mind like every day

Did you know that you came and you got me like this
'Cause I know you're the one that I wanna be with
You gotta know I'd do anything
To get you to notice me

(So tell me)

What I gotta do to get you into my life?
I can be your bad boy, or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars if you'd give me the night
Come on, yeah yeah yeah

Got my head in the clouds and I'm walking on it
Want you all to myself and I don't want to share
Where you wanna go 'cause I'm taking you there
Come on, eh, eh, eh

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world, and no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

One in a million, so baby what are the odds
A million miles away, but I know this is my song
You know you got the right girl with the right muscle
Keep you reeled in but won't knock the hustle
I want you to want me, no I don't wanna be wondering
If you wanna be with me, when the skies get to thunder
And I still want my heart fluttering everyday without a shadow of a doubt
Baby all you gotta say

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world, and no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

What I gotta do to get you into my life?
I can be your bad boy, or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars if you'd give me the night
Come on, eh, eh, eh

This song's for you

Got my head in the clouds and I'm walking on it
Want you all to myself and I don't want to share
Where you wanna go 'cause I'm taking you there
Eh, eh, eh

This song's for you
This song's for you
This song's for you---Lyrics submitted by Christian J.
