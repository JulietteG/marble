get a call on a random afternoon
i pick it up and i see that its you
like my heart you were breaking the news
you said its over its over its over

heading out cause im outta my mind
all my friends are gonna see me tonight
staying here till the sun starts to rise
and im gonna im gonna im gonna

dance hard laugh hard
turn the music up now
party like a rockstar can i get a what now
i swear ill do anything i have to 
till i forget about you

jump up fall down gonna play it loud now
dont care my heads spinning all around now
i swear ill do anything i have to
till i forget about you

till i forget about you 

i thought id be here on my own 
waiting for you to knock on my door
since you left ive been waiting by the phone 
and im moving im moving im moving

i found a place where i cant lose myself 
and just leave your memory on the shelf
see im fine no i dont need nobody else 
cuz im going im going im going

dance hard laugh hard turn the music up now
party like a rockstar can i get a what now
i swear ill do anything that i have to 
till i forget about you

jump up fall down gonna play it loud now
dont care my heads spinning all around now
ill swear ill do anything i have to
till i forget about you

been running like you dont mean a thing 
im going crazy now i dont even think 
im losing my mind thats all i can do 
till i forget about you!

dance hard laugh hard turn the music up now
party like a rockstar can i get a what now
i swear ill do anything that i have to 
till i forget about you!

jump up fall down gonna play it loud now
dont care my heads spinning all around now
ill swear ill do anything i have to
till i forget about you

till i forget about you
till i forget about you 
till i forget about you---Lyrics submitted by kenzie.
