You, you walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon
That's when I saw you for the first time
And I was paralyzed
I had a million things to say
But none of them came out that day
cause I was never one of those guys
That always had the best lines
Time stopped ticking
My hands keep shaking
And you dont even know that

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Cant even talk, cause words dont come into my mind
Id make a move if I had the guts to
But Im paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

Now I learned a lot from my mistake
Never let a good thing slip away
Ive had a lot of time to look back
And my only regret is

Not telling you what I was going through
But you didnt even know that

I try to speak but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but Im f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Cant even talk, cause words dont come into my mind
Id make a move if I had the guts to
But Im paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

As the years go by I think about you all the time, whoa
If I get the chance I hope I won't be paralyzed, paralyzed by you

You walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon

I try to speak but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed (you got me paralyzed)

I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Cant even talk, cause words dont come into my mind
Id make a move if I had the guts to
But Im paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed (you got me paralyzed)

Paralyzed, paralyzed, you got me tongue-tied
Paralyzed, paralyzed, now I'm frozen inside
Paralyzed, paralyzed
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed---Lyrics submitted by Carlos Celaya.
