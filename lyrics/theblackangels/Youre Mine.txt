Evry Night I see you girl
you promise me good things
but evry time I see your face
you look the other way

In the time Ill find you girl
I know that youre safe
that evry night you dream of me
and how I make you scream

Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time
Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time

The way you taste at night
forever paints my mind
my favourite wine
Ill drink you all the time

I die each night I see you girl
and wish for you the same
but when you go, I promise you
Ill never take the blame

Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time
Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time

All the wildest honest verges
eating me alive
all the smiles and sacrifice
you got me hypnotized

Me and you are wonder
what its like with you
me and you are wonder
I believe its true

Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time
Yeah youre mine, youre mine
youre mine

All the boys and all the girls
wonder where you are
there and now they look for you
searchin near and far
never will they find a trace
or have a single clue
inside me youre safe and sound
I always be with you

Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time
Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time
Yeah youre mine, youre mine
all the time---Lyrics submitted by haegiFRQ.
