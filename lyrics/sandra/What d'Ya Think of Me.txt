Darkness in all of my dreams
Only the moon is still awake
Calmness entrees my soul
Have I succeeded in life
Where have they all gone
My childhood dreams?
I lie awake all night

What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me
(what d'ya think of me)
What d'ya think of me
(what d'ya think of me)

(what d'ya think of me)

There's a curse upon that ship on the billows
Have I been stranded or have I just left my cage
Has all been lost
I have to roll my heart like a dice
And wait for doublets to appear
Did two eyes full of intimacy
Dare to tell me lies
I kept believing you
Over all these years
We're something so special
You wanted it all and even more
I still trust you and you know it

What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me

What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me
(what you, what you)
What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me
What d'ya think of me...---Lyrics submitted by ro2yak.
