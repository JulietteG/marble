don't like golf,
I don't like swimming,
I just like chasing them big butt women.
We gonna do that butt thing,
Kinda like that nookie thing.
We gonna do that butt thing,
And we gonna make that butt swing.

Woo

I don't like golf,
And I don't like swimming,
I just like chasing, them big butt women.
We gonna do that butt thing,
Kinda like that nookie thing.
We gonna do that butt thing,
We gonna make that butt swing.---Lyrics submitted by Tina.
