It seems like everyday's the same and I'm left to discover on my own.
It seems like everything is gray and there's no color to behold.
They say it's over , and I'm fine again yeah.
Try to stay sober , feels like I'm dying here.

And I am aware now of how everything's going to be fine.
One day , too late , I'm in hell.
And I am prepared now , seems everyone's going to be fine.
One day , too late , just as well.

I feel a dream in me expire , and there's no one left to blame it on.
I hear you label me a liar , 'cause I can't seem to get this through.
You say it's over , I can sigh again yeah.
Why try to stay sober , when I'm dying here.

And I am aware now of how everything's going to be fine.
One day , too late , I'm in hell.
And I am prepared now , seems everyone's going to be fine.
One day , too late , just as well.

And I'm not scared now , I must assure you.
You're never going to get away.
And I'm not scared now , and I'm not scared now no.

I am aware now of how everything's going to be fine.
One day , too late , I'm in hell.
I am prepared now , seems everyone's going to be fine.
One day , too late , just as well.

I am prepared now , seems everythings going to be fine.
For me , for me , for myself.
For me , for me , for myself.
For me , for me , for myself.
I am prepared now for myself.
I am prepared now and I am fine again.---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
