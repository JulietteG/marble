Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self-esteem along the way, yeah

Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
Good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Woah oh oh your such a fuckin' hipocrite

You should know that the lies wont hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way, yeah

Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
Good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection 
Woah oh oh your such a fuckin' hipocrite

Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I can fake it with the best of anyone
I can fake it with the best of them all
I can fake it with the best of anyone
I can fake it all

Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self-asteem along the way

Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
Good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel raped man follow me down

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Woah oh oh your such a fuckin' hipocrite

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Woah oh oh you're such a fuckin' hipocrate.---Lyrics submitted by Adolf.
