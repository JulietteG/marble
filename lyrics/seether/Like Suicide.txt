Premeditation will kill the trust 
They'll never know if you fear me
with every second collecting dust
I feel so bloated and weary

Cuz she belongs to heaven
She's coming over like a suicide
and its the same old trip, the old trip as before
another complicating suicide
and its the same old trip, the same old trip AS BEFORE

burn

She'll cut you down with a single thrust
She's taking over too quickly
No medication can cure the lust
So say a prayer for the sickly

Cuz she belongs to heaven
She's coming over like a suicide
and its the same old trip, the old trip as before
another complicating suicide
and its the same old trip, the same old trip AS BEFORE AS BEFORE

You set me up to fucking fail this time x8

She's coming over like a suicide
and its the same old trip, the old trip as before
another overbearing suicide
and its the same old trip, the same old trip 

shes coming over wearing genocide
and its the same old trip  the same old trip as before
another complicating suicide
and its the same old trip, the same old trip AS BEFORE AS BEFORE---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
