I feel so unsure,
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies...
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind a silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

Chorus
I'm never gonna dance again,
Cuz guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend,
And waste the chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you.
Chorus

Time can never mend,
The careless whispers of a good friend.
To the heart and mind,
If your answers kind...
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is all you'll find.

Chorus
I'm never gonna dance again,
Cuz guilty feet have  got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend,
And waste the chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you.
Chorus

What am I without your love?

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose the crowd.
Maybe it's better this way,
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say.

We could have been so good together,
We could have made this dance forever...
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.
(Alternatively):
And now it's never gonna be
That way...

Chorus
I'm never gonna dance again,
Cuz guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend,
And waste the chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you.
Chorus

Now that you're gone...
Now that you're gone...
Now that you're gone...
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?---Lyrics submitted by walt.
