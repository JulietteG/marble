NEVER LEAVE

Will I fall again into dismay?
WIll I be ashamed of crying?
And I know it's never been the way 
that I described
But I am afraid of trying.
Shes the one that keeps me all excited
She keeps me begging for more.
Shes the one who deams me uninvited
Now its over.

(chorus)
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
Never tease me and don't leave me here.
It's all the same in the end

Now I find that I am weaker fare.
That I am ashamed of lying.
And I know things never feel the way that's 
right inside.
And I am afraid of dying.

Cause you're the one who keeps me all excited.
You keep me begging for more.
You're the one who keeps me uninvited
Now it's over.

(chorus)
Never leave me and don't deceive me.
I'll keep on crawling my friend.
Never tease me, and don't leave me here.
It's all the same in the end.

Never leave me, don't deceive me.
I'll keep on crawling my friend.

Its only a symbol.

You've got me falling away
And I am afraid.
Take back what I said.
