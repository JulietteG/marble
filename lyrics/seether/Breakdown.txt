The sun is gone and the flowers rot.
Words are spaces between us.
And I should have been drown 
In the rivers I found 
Of token lost.
And I should have been down
When you made me insecure.

So break me down if it makes you feel right.
And hate me now if it keeps you all right, oh.
You can break me down if it takes all your might,
Cause I'm so much more then meets the eye.

And I'm the one you can never trust.
Cause wounds are ways to reveal us.
And yeah I could have tried
And devoted my life 
To both of us.
But what a waste of my time when
The world we had was yours.

So break me down if it makes you feel right.
(So break me down)
And hate me now if it keeps you all right, oh.
(So break me down)
You can break me down if it takes all your might,
Cause I am so much more than all your lies.

Hate me,
Break me down.
(So break me down)
Down.
(So break me down)

So break me down if it makes you feel right.
(So break me down)
And hate me now if it keeps you all right, so
(So break me down)
You can break me down if it takes all your might,
Cause I'm so much more than meets the eye.---
