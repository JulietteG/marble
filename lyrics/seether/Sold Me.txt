Here I stand before myself
 I see somethings out of place
 You tasted all my purity
 Now there's nothing left to waste
 The feeling gets so in my way
 It's getting lost in my delivery
 The feeling gets so in my way
 I'm getting lost in your periphery

And you sold me up the river again
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you made me start it over again
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you moved me, and you soothed me, and you fought me
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you left me wondering what the hell
 What is wrong with me?

I never felt like i had felt
 Until the day you came undone
 I never felt like I was lost
 Until the day you killed me again
 The feeling gets so in my way
 It's getting lost in my delivery
 The feeling gets so in my way
 I'm getting lost in your periphery

And you sold me up the river again
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you made me start it over again
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you moved me, and you soothed me, and you fought me
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you left me wondering what the hell
 What is wrong with me?

Are you stronger
 For cutting me open
 Are you stronger
 For leaving me broken

And you sold me up the river again
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you made me start it over again
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you moved me, and you soothed me, and you fought me
 (I don't wanna be alone again)
 And you left me wondering what the hell
 What is wrong with me?---Lyrics submitted by Charles Collins.
