Trust all the things
 I tell you are true
Dress up in your best
so I can be proud of you
And never believe I won't turn on you
And never believe I do this for you

You're leading me on again
And I find it, yeah I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me, given to ME  (chorus)

How I wish I could be rid of this ennui
Make you regret and make you afraid of me
And never believe I do this for me
Qnd never believe I'll do this gently

(chorus) X 2

Can't believe in broken promises
And render consciounce all of me
I'll tell you it's all for you
Then deny it

(chorus) X 2

(last line of chorus) Now I know it was given to me, given to me
IT'S ALL FOR ME!---Lyrics submitted by jan.
