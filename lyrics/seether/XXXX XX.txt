I guess i like it when we play (the way you drag me down)
I guess i like it when you hate me (the way you drag me down)
'cause I cant face myself in the mirror (I'm left alone with all my pain)
and i disgrace myself in the mirror (i'm left alone with my shame)

Xxxx xx- I see you in me
Xxxx xx- I feel you in me
Xxxx xx- I'll heal you in me

I guess i like it when we fight (the way you drag me down)
I guess i like i when you smite me (the way you drag me down)
cause i cant face myself in a mirror (I'm left alone with all my pain)
and i disgrace myself in the mirror (i'm left alone with my shame)

Xxxx xx- I see you in me
Xxxx xx- I feel you in me
Xxxx xx- I'll heal you in me

You're out of luck can't get a piece of me
It's all blown up- dont ever XXXX with me
I cannot please you all forever
i cannot please you at all...
(I feel you coming behind me)

Xxxx xx- I see you in me
Xxxx xx- I feel you in me
Xxxx xx- I'll heal you in me---Lyrics submitted by shelby.
