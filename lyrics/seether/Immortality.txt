Vacate is the word
Vengeance has no place on me or her
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tear
Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers?
Vulnerable
Wisdom can't adhere
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on 
But there's a trapdoor in the Sun

It's Immortality...

As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than Thou, How?
Surrendered, executed anyhow
Scrawl dissolved 
Cigar box on the floor
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on too 
He saw the trapdoor in the Sun

It's Immortality..

I Cannot stop the thought
I'm Running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide
Oh, Stripped and sold, mom 
An auctioned forearm
And Whiskers in the sink
A Truantsfinds home 
And will hold on to
Some die just to live---Lyrics submitted by Avery.
