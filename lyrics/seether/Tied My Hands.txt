Can you 'member when,
when we used to cry,
But never in distress?

Can you picture then,
how we used to pride,
ourselves on neatness?

Cause i can understand,
what you meant to me,
you made me wild,
then you tied my hands,

Can you 'member when,
when we used laugh,
bout those mistakes we made?

Can you picture then, 
how we used to drive,
and never reach the end?

Cause i can understand,
what you meant to me,
you made me wild, 
then you tied my hands,

Since you went away,
made me find,
i have nothing to say,

But since you went away,
made me find,
I have nothing to say,

Cause i can understand,
what you meant to me,
you made me wild,
then you tied my hands,

yeah, I can understand,
what you meant to me,
you made me wild, 
then you tied my hands,

you tied my hands (X3)---Lyrics submitted by Aeryck.
