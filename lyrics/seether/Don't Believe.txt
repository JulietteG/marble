Your heart is carved in stone
And apathy flows in your veins
When flesh falls from the bone
You've taken all you can take (you can take x3)

Don't believe in anyone
cause they'll feel you so much more
Deep inside the venom is burning
Lover

When stink fades into smell
The liquor has washed you away
When face cracks into smile
You've taken all you can take (you can take [X3])

Don't believe in anyone
cause they'll feel you so much more
Deep inside the venom is burning
Lover

You can't take
I'll give in
You can't break
What's broken
Your mistake
I'll rest my body in the ground

Don't believe in anyone
cause they'll feel you so much more
Deep inside the venom is burning
Lover
Don't believe in anyone
cause the day that you were born
Can't deny the enemy's taken over---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
