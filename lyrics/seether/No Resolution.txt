Im doing fine
 Even though you preyed upon my mind
 Been living a lie
 Seems every day it eats me

Yeah, and theres no resolution
 Yeah, but it makes me think twice
 Yeah, and I need retribution
 You dont get it then Im your pollution

Im breathing a sigh
 In passing away Ill take my time
 Im still getting high
 I love the way it feeds me

Yeah, and theres no resolution
 Yeah, but it makes me think twice
 Yeah, and I need retribution
 Just dont get it then Im the solution now

You cant keep me down my friend
 You cant keep me down my friend

Im doing fine
 Even though this hatred plagues my mind
 Im living a lie
 But I love the way you need me

Yeah, and theres no resolution
 Yeah, but it makes me think twice
 Yeah, and I need retribution
 You dont get it then Im your pollution

Yeah, and theres no resolution
 Yeah, but it makes me think twice
 Yeah, and I need retribution
 You dont get it then Im the solution now---Lyrics submitted by Thomas Lee Payn.
