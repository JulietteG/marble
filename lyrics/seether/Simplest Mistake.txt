Watch it blow my mind
It's something I am ill-prepared to remedy
But let it slow the time it takes to die
and close your eyes to your enemy 
DEFY!!!!

Self made millionaires 
won't take ideas from all the little plebeians
Just suffocate with smiles and force fed lies
and close your mind to reality
Deny!!!!

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lose what I'm feeling to them
and not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
TONIGHT!!!!!

Watch it blow my mind
It's something I am ill prepared to remedy
But let it slow the time it takes to die
and close your eyes to your enemy
DEFY!!!! 

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lost what i'm feeling to them
and not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
Tonight

So you make the simplest mistake
So you make the simplest mistake
and fearlessly you deny
your involvement in my demise
but give me your open hand
Burn!!!!!

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly 
Lose what I'm feeling to them
and not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lost what I'm feeling to them 
and not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
DENY!!!!
