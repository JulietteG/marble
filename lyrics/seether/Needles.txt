I never seem to find a reason 
to let you in again, or forgive you
Im sick of feeling like I need you 
knowing I never did
but I miss you

Taking, breaking and hating
I remember all you said, to me now
faking, forsaking and failing
my memories are all stained...again

Let me get inside your head
let me show you Im prepared
let me stick my needles in
and let me hurt you again

I never reach my indecision
to let you see again, all I give you
Im sick of feeding your attention
knowing I never did
I distress you

Taking, breaking and hating
I remember what you said to me now
faking, forsaking and failing
my memories are all stained...again

Let me get inside your head
let me show you Im prepared
let me stick my needles in
and let me hurt you again

Fuck you for killing me.....
Me!
Fuck you for killing me.....
Me!
Fuck you for killing me.....
Me!

Yeah, let me get inside your head
let me show you Im prepared
let me stick my needles in
and let me hurt you again
Youre Fucking Killing Me!!!---Lyrics submitted by Kayla Damron.
