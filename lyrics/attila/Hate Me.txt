I dont give a f--- about my bad reputation

Never catch me slippin, red cup solo sippin out the whip with yo bitches
Dont give a f--- about opinions, that dont pay the bills
Im just keepin it real
When youre out on the town I hope youre thinkin of me
Sippin liquor out the bottle and smokin up on that tree
The moral of the story is- I just want you to see
That the opinions of others should never bother you or me

Get f---ed, you wonder why nobody likes you
but you hate on everything and have a negative outlook
F--- that, Im the product of your creation
all your hate and negativity made me stronger
Hell yeah, nobody does it like we do it
Having this much fun should be illegal
Woah, were takin over this bitch
Join or die up in this bitch
Straight villain till the death of me

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth
Ill keep my dick in your mother
While youre starin at each other
Hate me
You keep on payin my bills
Im living just for the thrills
You keep on poppin your pills

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth
Ill keep my dick in your mother
While youre starin at each other
Hate me
You keep on payin my bills
Im living just for the thrills
You keep on poppin your pills

Ohhhhh
Livin it up is just an understatement
Yeah were livin large what what motherf--- a slut
So f--- whatever you heard

Never catch me slippin
Red cup solo sippin out the whip with yo bitches
Dont give a f--- about opinions, that dont pay the bills
Im just keepin it real
When youre out on the town I hope youre thinkin of me
Sippin liquor out the bottle and smokin up on that tree
The moral of the story is I just want you to see
That the opinions of others should never bother you or me

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth
Ill keep my dick in your mother
While youre starin at each other
Hate me
You keep on payin my bills
Im living just for the thrills
You keep on poppin your pills

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth
Ill keep my dick in your mother
While youre starin at each other
Hate me
You keep on payin my bills
Im living just for the thrills
You keep on poppin your pills

I dont give a f--- about my bad reputation

Youll never understand
That all your negativity wont get you shit
Youre so blind and stupid
Just keep on doin you and I wont give a f---

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth
Ill keep my dick in your mother
While youre starin at each other
Hate me
You keep on payin my bills
Im living just for the thrills
You keep on poppin your pills---
