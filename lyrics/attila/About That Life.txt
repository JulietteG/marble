I'm a bad motherfucker not a fucking role model
fuck church, hit a bong, then go smash a fucking bottle
got a few sluts to help me roll a few blunts
and they never question me cause they know I hate cunts
OHHH
Eat my words and swallow my sentences 
here we go you fucking asshole
living off the dirt on my shoes does it keep you alive

I'm about that life

hold me accountable 
you're itching for the money that I use to whip my ass
here's some shitty Benjamin's 
too bad they'll never help you buy some fucking class

trapped in a world where money controls you
hustle hard or be a piece of shit
watching the tears rolling down your face 
I'm throwing away diamonds 

I like a bad bitch 
she fucks me all night
then she counts my money while I'm on my play station
every moments always filled with sensation
always fuckin blazin america's my nation
I wouldn't have it any other fucking way
I'm about this fucking life I hustle hard and then I play
put your lips on my dick so you can taste success
that's the shit swallow and don't spit

I'm about that life

trapped in a world where money controls you
hustle hard or be a piece of shit
watching the tears rolling down your face 
I'm throwing away diamonds
on and on it never stops till the moneys gone
rip this bong and get yo money bitch start stacking the paper

I had diamonds but I threw them away cause I don't give a fuck
SUCK MY FUCK
she rides my dick like its a merry go round 
and I just bust my nut on her

let me tell you somethin
tighter than a virgin 
making money like a surgeon 
and we stack it to the roof 
because my pockets started hurting 
balling a hauling and taking over like I'm Stalin 
got a few fucks but I do not give them to anyone. 
holy shit 
I guess I'm really just about that life
SUCK MY FUCK---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
