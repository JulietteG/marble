remember the time when we sat by the telly, in your sunnies
you were the nonce with a thought for the nation, and super-frustration

can ya? could you remember then? 
caught in a floral breeze?
what does it take to restore your vision?
and you said it again 
must have thought it again 
done it again 

20 next month and a ride cliff to z-block
oh and you're waiting
once you're pure friday and twice your creation
it's weighted

can ya? could you remember then? 
caught in a summer breeze?
what does it take to restore your vision?
and you said it again 
must have thought it again 
done it again

solo

na-na-na-na

can ya? could you remember then? 
caught in a flow and breeze? 
what does it take to restore your vision, yeah in your sunnies. 

na-na-na-na---Lyrics submitted by Michael Mauss.
