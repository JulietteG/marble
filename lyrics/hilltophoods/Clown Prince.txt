It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

First up, on the dulcet tones,
of the gravy bone projects, 
Suffa MC came to take you home
I drip lyrics like spits, spit lyrics like drips
Into arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle whip, 
whip, cos what im hearing's all shit on the lyrical tip
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid
We gave ya, something to jock,
but it wasn't no thing, like Bobby,
gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring (Thanks Bobby)
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers that Eve
Says, keep adam I'm going down on Louise
And I'm a wreak havoc
Little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Titties representing the city I grew up in
We lay the path so you got a way in
It's Hilltop, we're three stars at the holiday inn.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Next up, when I get loose with no fail
appealing like the naked truth and the truth is for sale,
So when I leave yo
Ya fucking with my pride I don't see though
Typical MC
My nuts don't match the size of my ego
I seize an opportunity, cause they don't linger
The glass ain't half empty it's half full
That's why I'm a table drinker
Think your on Pressure's level?
Only thing tight bro, that you might show is dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker
Damage and suckers masterfully, huh,
If I married ya mother ya still wouldn't be half of me
You should run from me
Fuck battling, ain't nothing sweet,
'Cause I won't beat ya to the punch I'll punch ya to the beat
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
My foots always in my mouth i just can't stomach defeat
I'm a master these until it's hard to breath
It's Hilltop we the first to come, last to leave.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Man I'm smooth like, Marlon Brando at thirty
At my peak like, Marlon Brando at fifty
And I'm fat like, Marlon Brando at seventy
Fuck it, no one sick can ever better me (no one man)

And half the time half my crew could drink the bar,
and half these cats and half of what they think they are
We independent, a sign on the line
The day me giving you the finger as a sign of the times

their rhymes are designed to try diss us but why diss us?
i dont rewind to try to find disses,
man I just recline and mind my business,
and I think in lines in rhymes, the rhyme stitches,
up the minds of the lines of dimes and fine...

i pen letters that kill
Then stab your neck with a feather until you've bled in my quill
This veteren's ill, thinkin' you can better my skill
Ya need medicine chill, with Pressure vendetta's for real.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager---Lyrics submitted by Damien.
