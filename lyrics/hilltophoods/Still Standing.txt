VERSE 1: PRESSURE
Standing in line, fifteen couldnt wait,
Couldnt fathom any talent in rhyme,
Had to get mine, granted in mind,
Was my rapping that I thought would never happen in time,
Odds stacked to reject us, attacking the hecklers,
Reckless with rap till they had to respect us,
Laid tracks, never asked for jack for my efforts,
Cause everything we do comes back to affect us,
And as long as I got lungs Im a say this,
Long as we get love we got some that will hate us,
Well never change its done for the faithless,
I dont care for favourites on somebodys play list,
Aint enough paper for the names I gotta mention,
Without them, no way I would of made it a profession,
I wouldnt trade it for a day of my obsession,
Were staying dedicated to perfection

CHORUS 1
Its been so long, were glad we came,
Before we gathered fame or had a name,
Our story hasnt changed with accolades,
Were still standing and well be back again

VERSE 2: SUFFA
Im still standing, fuck it, one of us had to,
Though Im not standing still like a statue,
Man, I can tighten loops like a lasso,
You see my blood runs blue like a cut up a tattoo,
Its ironic, some say its even confusing,
That Im still standing cos Im keeping it moving,
And Im still champion we keep on improving,
And Im Main Source man, Im breaking and moving atoms,
What we spit is absurd,
Since a kid, Ive always loved the rhythm of words,
The beauty of language, and spewing the anguish,
All over the canvas like the riff was a curb,
Now if you live by the word then you die the pen,
The critics can criticise but were the crme dele crme,
Me and P-Dela we blend what theyre calling the standard,
Still standing while theyre screaming when will it end?

CHORUS 1
Its been so long, were glad we came,
Before we gathered fame or had a name,
Our story hasnt changed with accolades,
Were still standing and well be back again

CHORUS 2
How long you been here? Ive been here for years,
How long you been here? Ive been here for years,
How long you been here? Ive been here for years,
How long you been here? Ive been here for years,
We still sharp, still craft Hip Hop that they played in the park,
Still jamming, still paving the path,
Still making our mark, still aint for the faint of the heart,
Still standing, still state of the art,
We still sharp, still craft Hip Hop that they played in the park,
Still jamming, still paving the path,
Still making our mark, still aint for the faint of the heart,
Still standing, still state of the art---Lyrics submitted by josh.
