here in this 
place
with humbleness and brokenness
we seek all you are we seek you
And its for You
Its all for You
Were leaping over walls to get to You
Would You pull us along
Pull us home

We are
We are reaching
We are reaching out
(And were calling for You, Lord)
Were caught up in this hunger
Searching for Your heart
(And were calling for You, Lord)

Here on this earth
We lift our eyes to the stars
We seek all You are
We seek You
And its for You
Its all for you
Were breaking off our chains to run to You
Would you fill our hearts
Oh, fill our songs

Leaving the lights on, the lights on 
We wait for you
This wont be the last song, the last song
We sing to you

We are
We are reaching
We are reaching out
(And were calling for You, Lord)---Lyrics submitted by angel.
