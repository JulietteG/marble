No one's taking my heart away
No one's taking the place of you
Even though I am miles away
You should know that I'm always true
Count the days 'til I reach the end
Week by week in a satellite
And until I am back again
All I need is to close my eyes
And I run
Run back to you
Yeah and I run
Run back to the one I love
This is the way I spent the day
Uh-huh
Did you, too?
Running back to you
And when I dream
I only see us
Do you too?
Running back to you
I wish that I could go back in time
To the city that's always cold
Time to leave but we stayed inside
Moving as though our bones were old
Trapped in ice in an avalanche
Here it comes, the pulse pounds and I'm ready to go
Mind fills up and it races fast
But it's erased the moment you close your eyes
And i run 
Run back to you 
Yeah and I run 
Run back to the one i love
This is the way i spent the day
Uh huh
Did you to?
Running back to you
And when i dream i only see us 
Do you to?
Running back to you
You'll say
"Is it really you or am I dreaming?"
You're not dreaming
This is the way i spent the day 
Uh huh
Did you to?
Running back to you
And when i dream i only see us
Do you to?
Running back to you
Meet me in the dreamworld tonight
Meet me in the dreamworld tonight!---Lyrics submitted by dez.
