Franky:
Have you noticed everybody's being super nice?
The igloo's glowing with a special glimmer on the ice, yeah
Franky And Cadence:
The party's heating up
Come on and join the club
There's always room for just one more
Look around and it's obvious

Franky:
It's cool, cool, cool, out in the cold

Cadence:
And it's fun, fun, fun, covered in snow

Franky and Cadence':
Everyone's here, it's that time of the year
Oh, oh, oh
It's cool in the cold (Oh, oh)
It's cool in the cold (Oh, oh)

Cadence:
There's a chill dance party going down where the puffles are
And the snowballs don't get thrown nearly half as hard, no
We're giving Coins for Change

Franky:
We're rocking on our skates

Franky And Cadence':
Yeah, we love to play this time of the year
Winter's the best because

Franky':
It's cool, cool, cool, out in the cold

Cadence:
And it's fun, fun, fun, covered in snow

Franky And Cadence':
Everyone's here, it's that time of the year
Oh, oh, oh
It's cool in the cold (Oh, oh)
It's cool in the cold (Oh, oh)

(Short Counterpoint)

Franky':
It's cool, cool, cool, out in the cold

Cadence:
And it's fun, fun, fun

Franky And Cadence':
Covered in snow
Everyone's here, it's that time of the year
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
It's cool in the cold

Franky':
Cool, cool, cool, out in the cold

Cadence:
And it's fun, fun, fun, covered in snow

Franky And Cadence':
Everyone's here, it's that time of the year
Oh, oh, oh
It's cool in the cold (Cool in the cold)---Lyrics submitted by Annie.
