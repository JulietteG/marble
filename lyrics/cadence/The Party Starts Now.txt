Rated E for Everyone

Get up Party Penguins come on havent you heard
I get a lot of distance for a little flightless bird
Im a crowned queen of this funky scene with my stylin diva PUFFLE.
And my ice cold beats

Can I get the What. What! (What. What!)
Can I get the Who. Where (Who. Where)
I have the coolest club around.
Ooooooh

THE PARTY STARTS NOW!

When I waddle in, turn the music loud for an epic win!
DJ K-Dance in the house!
You ready to move?
You can boogie down cuz Im spinning the tunes,

The Party Starts Now Ah Ah Ah OWWWWWW
The Party Starts Now Ah Ah Ah OWWWWWW
Lets begin the countdown, lets turn it up loud!
Come on! 5,4,3,2,1 the party starts NOW!

Come on get your flippers up high in the sky
And if you wave them harder enough then you might even fly
If you cant cant can break dance
Then your chilling like a villain and some zero arctic win
