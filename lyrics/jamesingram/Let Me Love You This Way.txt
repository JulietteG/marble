Tonight I look at you, and you're so beautiful
there's so many things I wanna say
wish I could show you now, how far I'd go
just to prove my love will never fade

I'd steal the stars above
but that would still not be enough
cause what I need to let you know

CHORUS
Let me love you this way
by never letting go until my dying day
let me love you this way
by staying near your side always

And as the years go by
you know in your heart
that this feeling that I have is real
and if you'd ask me for the whole wide world
I would get it borrow, paid, or steal

But would that make you see
just how much your love really means 
would it truly let you know

CHORUS
Let me love you this way
by never letting go until my dying day
let me love you this way, baby
by staying near your side always

Girl, I wanna be more than a man
and love you for just one night
Oh, let me show you that's not the way I am
Oh darlin'

Let me love you girl
I'll never let you go
never, never, never, never, never baby

Let me love you this way
by never letting go
never til the day I die
let me love you this way, yeah
by staying near your side always---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
