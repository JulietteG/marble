Where did my heart go?


Where did my heart go?
When did it lose the way?
How did I let you slip away?
Why is it so hard to say?
The words that might touch you
Make you believe that Im  
More than it seems that Im today

*I can run but I cant hide
From all these dreams that I keep inside
Now its gonna take a while 
But I got to learn to smile again

Once it was easy 
I never had to try
I never had to tell a lie
Never thought Id see you cry
But now I know better
Ive got to find the way
I dont want to hear you say goodbye

Repeat *

Bridge

Ive got to find the smile 
That filled your heart with laughter
I dont want to find the way
To get along 
After you
I want to be the man
That you knew

Now its gonna take a while
When Ive got to learn to smile again
