Verse1
Ordinaryly I would fall in love
But that's not likely anymore
Cause I was hurt too bad before

Any other time I would let you in
But it's just too soon to change it
So please tryin' understand

Reff1
You're too much for this heart of mine
It's been broken too many times
I guess I am not ready yet to let the (my) feelings go

Reff2
May be somewhere on down the line
I'd give love one more try
But for now you're just too much for this heart of mine

Verse 2
Don't get me wrong I really want you here
But if my heart is what you need
Then you might do well too lead

I'm not saying I'm never fall again
But it's just too soon to change it
So please tryin' understand me... baby... oh no...

to: Reff

Bridge 1
It was nothing to do with you
And I hope you can understand
Give me time to believe in love again....
to: Reff

Bridge 2
Love's demanding... I'm trying to understand
This heart of mine, been broken many times
Heart of mine... (too much for this heart)
Too many times ( I'm not ready yet too let my feeling go)

Reff 2
Then Bridge 2 2x
