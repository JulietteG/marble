Some people laugh.
some people cry.
Some people live.
Some people die.
some people run, right into the fire.
and some people hide, their every desire.
but we are the lovers, if you don't believe me.
then just look into my eyes, 'cause the heart never lies.

some people fight.
some people fall.
others pretend, they don't care at all.
if you wan't to fight, i'll stand right beside you.
the day that you fall, i'll be right behind you.
to pick up the pieces.
 if you don't believe me,  just look into my eyes. 'cause the heart never lies...
(Woah x 2)

another year over, and we're still together.
it's not always easy, but i'm here forever.
yeah we are the lovers, i know you believe me.
when you looked into my eyes, 'cause the heart never lies.

and we are the lovers, i know you believe me, whenyou look into my eyes, 'cause the heart never lies
(oh oh oh Woah x2)

another year over, but we're still together.
it's not always easy but i'm here forever.
yeah we are the lovers i know you beileve me, when you look into my eyes
'cause the heart never lies
'cause the heart never lies
because the heart never lies.---Lyrics submitted by Sophia.
