Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 

Today Im laughing the clouds away 
I hear what the flowers say 
Drinking a drop of rain 
And I see places that i have been 
Things that Id never seen 
This side of the grass is green 

Oh I cant believe that its so simple 
It feels so natural to me 

If this is love then love is easy 
Its the easiest thing to do. 
If this is love, then love completes me 
Cause it feels like I've been missing you 
A simple equation, 
With no complications to leave you confused. 
If this is love love love, 
Oh its the easiest thing to do 

Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 

Whatever I do 
To watching the grey skies bloom 
Making the streets look new 
And the birds sing 
Tweedily tweet dee dee dee 
Tweedily dee dee dee 
And we know exactly what they mean. 

Oh I cant believe that its so simple 
It feels so natural to me 

If this is love then love is easy 
Its the easiest thing to do 
If this is love then love completes me 
Cause it feels like I've been missing you 
A simple equation, 
With no complications to leave you confused. 
If this is love love love, 
Oh its the easiest thing to do 

Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 

If this is love then love is easy 
Its the easiest thing to do 
If this is love then love completes me 
Cause it feels like I've been missing you 
A simple equation, 
With no complications to leave you confused. 
If this is love love love, 
Oh its the easiest thing to do 

Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Oh this is love love love love 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do---Lyrics submitted by Katrina.
