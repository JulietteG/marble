I was alone and my stomach was twisted,
I can get up now, the dark clouds have lifted
Back in the old life, before you existed,
I can see why the windows were misted

Said one word, made me feel much better,
Starts with L and it's got four letters

Things are looking up, looking up (hey!)
There's magic everywhere you go
Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello)
So turn it up, turn it up (hey!)
As loud as you can make it go
'Cause love is on the radio

Now that I've found you, my heart's beating faster,
We could be happy forever and after
We could be married, like Mrs and Mr,
We'll have a son and we'll give him a sister

Just one thing holding us together,
Four letter word that'll last forever

Things are looking up, looking up (hey!)
There's magic everywhere you go
Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello)
So turn it up, turn it up (hey!)
As loud as you can make it go
'Cause love is on the radio

Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio (turn it up, turn it up)
Love is on the radio

Only one thing lead to another,
Came along, filled my days with colour
And it's been an everlasting summer,
Since we found each other

Things are looking up, looking up (hey!)
There's magic everywhere you go
Strangers stop to say hello (hello, hello, hello)
So turn it up, turn it up (hey!)
As loud as you can make it go
Play it 'til your speakers blow,
Listen 'til your ears explode,
'Cause love is on the radio ---
