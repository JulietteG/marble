Nothing goes to plan
It's all the game of chance they say in Wonderland
There's magic in the air
A tragic love affair that I don't understand

[CHORUS]

These summer girls are really
Something else
Our lives are short
But the nights are long

Mrs halloween
Is drinking at the bar again in New Orleans
She throws another dart
And narrowly avoids my lonely broken heart
Torn apart

[CHORUS]

These summer girls are really
Something else (It won't be long)
Our lives are short
But the nights are long
The nights go on and on  x3

So pinch me I must be dreaming
My life has lost all its meaning
But i like the way I'm feeling now

Kissing your lips at midnight
Under the stars and moonlight
But i never thought we'd be this strong

The nights go on and on  x3

She's looking good tonight
I love the way she glows in ultraviolet light
Intoxicate my mind
I know that love is blind and i'm not seeing right
Not alright

These summer girls are really something else (It won't be long)
Our lives are short 
The nights are long
These summer girls are really something else (It won't be long)
Our lives are short
And the nights are long

The nights go on and on  x3---Lyrics submitted by Alyssia.
