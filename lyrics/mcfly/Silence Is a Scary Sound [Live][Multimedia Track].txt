1,2,3,4!

I look into the sky
all I have to ask why
She'd go and leave me
Oh why do feelings have to die?
Is it all just a sign?
Of what it's meant to be?

Well I'm just too excited
The end of this can be sighted
She's over due for a break out
I better go she blows my brains out
Silence is a scary sound

Funny feeling happened today
Somewhere buried in the past
Didn't mean much - that much
Anyway
I know that love will never last

I torn up inside
There's a hole in my mind
When you're not next to me
So I hope you choke and die
On every single lie
That's what you've done
To me

Well I'm just too excited
The end of this can be sighted
She's over due for a freak out
I better go she blows my brains out
Silence is a scary sound

Funny feeling happened today
Somewhere buried in the past
Didn't mean much - that much
Anyway
I know that love will never last

Funny feeling happened today
Somewhere buried in the past
Didn't mean much - that much
Anyway
I know that love will never last---Lyrics submitted by Malie.
