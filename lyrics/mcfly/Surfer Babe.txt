Well its quarter to four
Were hanging out at the pizza place
And weve all got our boards
Later on were gonna catch the waves

Well thats what I said when I left her in bed
With the radio on and the book she read
Let the truth be known

I just wanna date a surfer babe
I hope Im not a little too late
I never know what youre gonna say
You dont think that youre my type
But you are, but you are, but you are, but you are

You know I just
Dont know how im gonna get through
This thing that Ive been feeling for
You dont think I know your name
But I do, but I do, but I do
Youre a surfer babe

You know its hard when things
Never seem to wanna go your way
But I go this feeling that its
Not gonna happen today

You know Ive look all around for a girl in L.A.
And youre the prettiest face that has walked my way
Since I met you girl

I just wanna date a surfer babe
I hope Im not a little too late
I never know what youre gonna say
You dont think that youre my type
But you are, but you are, but you are, but you are

You know I just
Dont know how Im gonna get through
This thing that Ive been feeling for
You dont think I know your name
But I do, but I do, but I do
Youre a surfer babe

And Ive been waiting for a girl like you
Anticipating how to make my move
Coz there is nothing, I would rather do than
Catch the waves with you

I wanna a surfer babe
I hope Im not a little too late
I never know what youre gonna say
You dont think that youre my type
But you are, but you are, but you are, but you are
But you are, but you are, but you are,

But you are a babe
I hope Im not a little too late
I never know what youre gonna say
You dont think that youre my type
But you are, but you are, but you are, but you are

You know I just
Dont know how im gonna get through
This thing that Ive been feeling for
You dont think I know your name
But I do, but I do, but I do
Youre a surfer babe---Lyrics submitted by Kirsty.
