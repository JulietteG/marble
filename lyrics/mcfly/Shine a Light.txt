tell me are you feeling strong
strong enough to love some one
and make through the hardest storm
and bad weather
were you coming through the flames
hold me till i feel no pain
and give me shelter from the rain
forever

where can i find
her

she took the light and left me in the dark
ehhh
she left me with a broken heart
ehhh
now im on my own
if anybody sees her

ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh
if anybody sees her

tell me can you hear my voice
loud and clear and perfect noise
if i had the choice
i would not give up

where can i find
her

she took the light and left me in the dark
ehhh
she left me with a broken heart
ehhh
now im on my own
if anybody sees her

ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh

ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh

she took the light and left me in the dark
ehhh
she left me with a broken heart
ehhh
now im on my own
if anybody sees her

ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh

ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh ehh
shine a light on her
ehh ehh
if any body sees her---Lyrics submitted by doodle.
