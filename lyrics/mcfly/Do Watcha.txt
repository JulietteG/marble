Verse 1:
Crash into the room
Scared to turn the lights on 
like a ticking time bomb
She's got a fuse
I'm living in a rations
from the ghost of passion
What's a boy to do?
I swore i'd never come back
To this place of combat
Tie me a noose
We've been turning heart strings
Music in the dark sings dark things

Chorus:
Do watcha want 
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me

Verse 2:
Frozen to the bone
I cannot remember
Much from that december
Bruised and alone
Caution through the rough tide
Keep it on the inside this time

Chorus
Do watcha want 
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me

Verse 3:
Kick me to the curb rip a hole in my heart,
And drag me through the dirt by my soul from a car
Hug me in the night like a wolf in the dark
But... watch out for that bitch called KARMA!

Chorus:
Do watcha want 
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me
Do watcha want
Do watcha want to me x3
Do what you want
Do what you want
Just do what you want
Just do what you want!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
