You and I have got a lot in common
We share all the same problems
Luck, love and life aren't on our side

I'm in the wrong place at ther wrong time
Always the last one in a long line
Waiting for something to turn out right, right

Chorus:
I'm starting to fall in love
It's getting to much 
Not often that I slip up
It's just my luck

Rain clouds are gathering in numbers
just when I put away my jumper
Luck and love still aren't on my side

But I still refuse to be a sceptic
'Cause I know I could still correct this
Maybe this will be my lucky night, night

Chorus:
I'm starting to fall in love
It's getting to much
Not often that I slip up
It's just my luck

Just my luck, Just my luck...ect.---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
