When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing..oh nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon i will be there
To brighten even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever i am
I'll come running..yeah..to see you again
Winter, spring,summer or fall
All you gat to do is call
And I'll be there..yeah..yeah..
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
See turn dark and full of clouds
And that all north wind should begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud..yeah..
Soon I'll knocking upon your door

You just call out my name 
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running..oh yes i will..to see you again
Winter,spring,summer or fall..yeah
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there..yeah..yeah..yeah

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
Will the take your soul if you let them..oh yeah but don't you let them..

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running..to see you again..oh baby don't you know about..
Winter,spring,summer or fall..hey now
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You"ve got a friend

Ain't it good to know..you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know..you've got a friend
