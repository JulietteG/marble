I wish I could Bubble Wrap my heart,
In case I fall and break a part,
I'm not God I can't change the stars,
And I don't know if there's life on Mars,
But I know you hurt,
The people that you love and those who care for you, 
I want nothing to do with the things you're going through.

This is the last time, 
I give up this heart of mine, 
I'm telling you that I'm, 
A broken man who's finally realised,
You're standing in moonlight, 
But you're black on the inside, 
Who-oo-oo-oo
Do you think you ought to cry?
This is goodbye. 

I'm a little dazed and confused, 
But life's a bitch and so are you, 
All my days have turned into nights, 
Cos living without, without, without you in my life, 
And you wrote the book on how to be a liar,
And lose all your friends, 
Did I mean nothing at all? 
Was I just another ghost that's been in your bed?

Cos this is the last time, 
I give up this heart of mine, 
I'm telling you that I'm, 
A broken man who's finally realised,
You're standing in moonlight, 
But you're black on the inside, 
Who-oo-oo-oo
Do you think you ought to cry?
This is goodbye. 

Yeah!
Turn on the radio honey,
Cos every single sad song you'll be able to relate!
And this one I dedicate!

Whoa oh!
Don't get all emotional baby,
You can never talk to me,
You're unable to communicate! 

This is the last time, 
I give up this heart of mine, 
I'm telling you that I'm, 
A broken man who's finally realised...

This is the last time, 
I give up this heart of mine, 
I'm telling you that I'm, 
A broken man who's finally realised,
You're standing in moonlight, 
But you're black on the inside, 
Who-oo-oo-oo
Do you think you ought to cry?
This is goodbye...
