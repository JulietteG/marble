Everything was going just the way I planned
The broccoli was done
She doesn't know that I'm a virgin in the kitchen 
'Cause it's normally my mum

But then she called me 
And that's when she said to me she wasn't coming 'round for tea

I should have known much better but its so hard 
I can't forget her
She keeps playing me around
But I'm trying so hard to impress her
She puts me under so much pressure
And I just wanted her to let me know she cares

Blowing out the candles now and that's the way she treats me 
I'm a fool
And everyone will tease me now
Yhe rumours start to spread around the school
Yeah
Yeah

They say that I'm a loser but that girl's so cruel
But I keep feeding her the fuel

I should have known much better but its so hard 
I can't forget her
She keeps playing me around
But I'm trying so hard to impress her
She puts me under so much pressure
And I just wanted her to let me know she cares

I know she cares
I know she cares
She cares 
She cares 
She cares 
She cares
She cares
She cares

I should have known much better but its so hard 
I can't forget her
She keeps playing me around
But I'm trying so hard to impress her
She puts me under so much pressure
And I just wanted her to let me know

I should have known much better but its so hard 
I can't forget her
She keeps playing me around
But I'm trying so hard to impress her
She puts me under so much pressure
And I just wanted her to let me know she cares---Lyrics submitted by Keren.
