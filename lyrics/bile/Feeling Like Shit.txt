(Live Version)
Living underground and working downtown, got one foot in the grave. 
Punching, kicking, shooting, stabbing, but there's no way I'll be saved!
My dream it seems to be turning lean to get back to the top,
put a gun to my head wishing I was dead,
a bang, some blood, then stop.
FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT!
AGAIN AND AGAIN! FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT!
FEELING LIKE SHIT! LIKE I NEVER KNEW I CAN!
this medication that I'm taking is making me see things strange,
hallucinations, bad vibrations, I beg you make this change.
The doctor said about my head: "You've only got a month to live!"
But that was 2 years ago and I know that I look like the living dead!
FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT!
AGAIN AND AGAIN! FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT!
FEELING LIKE SHIT! AND I KNOW I'M GONNA DIE...
Listen to me when I say, I've slit my wrists thirteen times,
not once did I succeed. There's always someone there
who claims they care but I just want to bleed!
I'm in this hell but still alive, just want it to end.
I'll stay hurting and I'll keep hurting, pain is my friend.
FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT!
AGAIN AND AGAIN! FEELING LIKE SHIT! FEELING LIKE SHIT!
FEELING LIKE SHIT! I JUST WANT TO DIE! Shit! Shit! Shit!(4x)
FEELING LIKE SHIT!---Lyrics submitted by Gandalf.
