I've seen you in my dreams
You turn them to gold and shatter their bones
As broken as we seem, oh
We give up our heart, a shot in the dark

And I know that there's something about you
And the way that I want to
There's something about you I'm drawn to
But there's nothing I can do

I know you got away, I know you got away
All my time is consumed with your face
I tell myself that this feeling will fade
And I know, and I know, and I know that it won't

My nights begin to bleed
Mirages of love, Don't want to wake up
My days turn into weeks, oh
But searching your name is part of your game

And the feeling of getting you closer
Is taking me under
And the closer I'm getting to closure
Is making me wonder

I know you got away, I know you got away
All my time is consumed with your face
I tell myself that this feeling will fade
And I know, and I know, and I know that it won't

No, ooh, you're pulling me down yeah
And I
Come na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

I know you got away, I know you got away
All my time is consumed with your face
I know you got away, I know you got away
All my time is consumed with your face
I tell myself that this feeling will fade
And I know, and I know, and I know that it won't

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na---
