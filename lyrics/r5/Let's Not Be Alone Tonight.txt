Outside of the party where it's gettin' too loud
It feels like we're the only ones alone in the crowd
Chat college and politics in time that we spend
You look back and you say you think you lost all your friends
And I'm hopin' that it's all my fault
Yea, I'm hopin' that it's all my fault

Hey, let's not be alone tonight
Hey, let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)
No it don't, no it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, let's not be alone tonight
(You don't have to be alone)

Not wrong if you come on strong cuz life is too short
I like how we get along like snow and New York
All good if you change your mind, you know where I stand
Look back and I say to you I lost all my friends

And I know you know it's all your fault
Yea, I know you know it's all your fault

La La La La La
La La La La La
Yeah
La La La La La
La La La La La
Yeah
La La La La La
La La La La La

We might never feel the same
I'm just glad that you came
Am I right or is it all in my head?

You don't have to be alone tonight
You don't have to be alone tonight
No it don't, no it don't mean love
But it might, but it might be love
Hey, Let's not be alone tonight---
