Drop tops, sitting next to Cee-Lo
Pacific coast highway
This happens every day
And our song is playing on the radio
Like 20 times a day
Man this is so cray-zay

You can see the pretty ladies walking round in high heels in LA
What can I say
Sexy shades, two piece, the girls are lookin fine today
Its getting hot you see

I like them Cali girls
Like the way they move
Love the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them Cali girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
Cali girls when they check you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night
I like them Cali girls
Cali girls when they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

Models always hanging out at Venice Beach
The ones in magazines
Theyre hanging out with me (hanging out with me)
And you know she wasnt lying when she told you (uh-huh)
You know the Cali girls they really rock my world

Small skirts, So hot, lookin that other way
What can I say
Sexy shades, two piece, the girls are looking fine to say
Its like this everyday

When you got Cali girls
Like the way they move
love the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them cali girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
Cali girls when they check you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night
I like them Cali girls
Cali girls when they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need

I cant get those Cali girls out of my head
I cant get those Cali girls out of my head

Like the way they move
love the things they do
Keep me up at night
I like them Cali girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need
Cali girls when they check you out
Make you scream and shout
Keep you up at night
I like them Cali girls
When they look at me
Not too hard to see
That a Cali girl is what I need---Lyrics submitted by lennon nicole herron.
