Oh oh Christmas is coming
those elfs and raindeer are runnin'
and I just want you by my side

Santa is coming to town
and you're not gonna be around
this snow is bringing me down

Cause tomorrow's gonna be a big day-a-ay
and you're worlds away-a-ay
I'd give anything if we could sing
fa la la la
la la la la la la la

Oh oh Christmas is coming
those elfs and raindeer are runnin'
and I just want you by my side

This year the season is crazy
snow globes that somebody's shakin'
that's what makes is Christmas time

Presents under the tree
could never mean as much to me

As you here
that's why I believe
that when I see Santa's sleigh-a-ay
heading this way-a-ay

He's gonna hear my wishes
and know I miss ya
fa la la la
la la la la la la la

Oh oh Christmas is coming
those elfs and raindeer are runnin'
and I just want you by my side
*by my side(times2)*

This year the season is crazy
snow globes that somebody's shakin'
that's what makes is Christmas time

If we could all be together
in crazy Christmas sweaters
I know that Santa hears me
loud and clear

Don't ya hear me now

Oh oh Christmas is coming
those elfs and raindeer are runnin'
and I just want you by my side

*ooooo yeah*
This year the season is crazy
snow globes that somebody's shakin'
*ya know*
that's what makes is Christmas time
yeah yeah ah oh

*oooooooo*
Oh oh Christmas is coming
*yeah*
those elfs and raindeer are runnin'
*runnin'*
and I just want you by my side
*oh oh*

This year the season is crazy
*crazy*
snow globes that somebody's shakin'
that's what makes is Christmas time
*yeah*

Oh-o-whoa

Oh-o-whoa-o-o

That's what makes it
makes it Christmas time---Lyrics submitted by Eliza French.
