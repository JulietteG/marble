In the back of  taxi cab one 
qwick turn you were on my lap
we touched hands
and we pulled them back
yeah
I want you bad

And even though it should be so wrong
I can't help but feel this strong 
cause the way you turn me on
like a light switch

I might just go crazy 
cause your my bestfriends baby 
but you got me thinking
maybe just maybe 
I don't know what to do

I'm in love with someone else's girl
you rock my world
but you're the one that I cant have
girl I want you bad

In my crazy mind
I'm with ya all the time
cause you're the best I never had
oh girl I want you bad

oh (times 14)

I want you bad
so hard to just pretend
it sucks
you his girl and he's my friend
no
good way for this to end
yeah
I want you bad

I wish someone could help me
this is just so unhealthy
and everything you got
just kills me
goin' guilty 

go crazy
cause you're my bestfriends baby
but you got me thinking
maybe just maybe
I don't know what to do

I'm in love with someone else's girl
you rock my world
but you're the one that I can't have
girl I want you bad

In my crazy mind
I'm with ya all the time
cause you're the best I never had
oh girl I want you bad

oh(times 14)

I want you bad

I want you(times 6)

I want you bad
*I want you bad*

I want you(times 6)

I want you bad
I might just go crazy
*crazy*
cause your my bestfriends baby
*baby*
but you got me thinking
maybe just maybe
I don't know what to do

I'm in love with someone else's girl
*I'm in looove*
you rock my world
*woo!*
But you're the one that I can't have
girl I want you bad

In my crazy mind
*oh so crazy*
I'm with ya all the time
cause you're the best I never had
oh girl I want you bad
