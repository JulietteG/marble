There ain't no way that I could ever forget you
I can't remember why I ever went and left you

Maybe I was hitting my head
Maybe must've been something that I said
Baby I want to take it back tonight

Oh oh oh oh
You don't have to tell me twice
When lightning strikes

Oh oh oh oh
You don't have to tell me twice
When lightning strikes

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

So obvious that I wasn't seeing clearly
'Cause right before my eyes you were disappearing
If I could just go back in time
Say the words that blow your mind
Loaning less is such a crime
There ain't a thing I wanna do
I wanna do yeah

Maybe I wouldn't have been so
Crazy I was stupid letting you go
Baby I want to take it back tonight

Oh oh oh oh
You don't have to tell me twice
When lighting strikes

Oh oh oh oh
You don't have to tell me twice
When lighting strikes

Why can't I
Let you know
Why can't I

Oh oh oh oh
No oh oh oh oh
You don't have to tell me twice
You don't have to tell me twice

Oh oh ooooh
You don't have to tell me twice
When lighting strikes

You don't have to tell me twice
When lightning strikes---
