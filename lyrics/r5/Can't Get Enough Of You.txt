You knock me off of my feet
can hardly breath
when you're around me I feel the heat

You steam up the mirrors
and make me shift gears
sometimes I can't think all that clear

I'm loosing sleep
I'm counting sheep like
1  2  3
LET'S GO

You hypnotize me
you mesmerize me
way-o
way-o
way over my head
and I don't know what to do

Cause I can't get enough of you

See girl you're like an equation
and I'm nott good at math
you're very confusing
my hearts in a trap

I don't see you're signs
or see through the lines
and I just can't understand you're mind

I'm loosing sleep
I'm count sheep like
1  2  3
*1  2  3*
LET'S GO

You hypnotize me
*yes you do*
you mesmerize me
way-o
way-o
way over my head
and I don't know what to do

cause I can't get enough of you

ooooooo

You hypnotize me
*yes you do*
you mesmerize me
*way-a-ay-o*
way-o
way-o 
way over my head
and I don't know what to do
*way-a-ay-o*

You hypnotize me
*yes you do*
you mesmerize me
*way-a-ay-o*
way-o
way-o 
way over my head
and I don't know what to do

Cause I can't get enough of you---Lyrics submitted by Eliza French.
