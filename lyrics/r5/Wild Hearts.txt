Go ahead, grab your guns
Draw a line and we'll cross for fun,
Let's go
Yeah, one by one they fall
Taken out by alcohol,
Poor souls

On a night like this
I remember how I miss
My window
And I know this,
We better live our lives up to the fullest
'Til we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night, don't slow, slow, slow it down

Been down this road before
Hit the wall, kick down the door,
Let's go
Mmm, money, power, want a taste
Pray to God it don't go to waste,
Don't know

On a night like this
I remember how I miss
My window
And I know this,
We better live our lives up to the fullest
'Til we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night, don't slow, slow, slow it down

And I know this,
We better live our lives up to the fullest
'Til we're the only ones left standing

Wild hearts run, your time has just begun
Keep chasing for the sun, don't slow it down
Wild hearts run, we're all animals inside
Go brave into the night, don't slow, slow, slow it down---
