Ooh eeh ooh

We're so beautiful and so broken
I think the cover is about to crack open
I watched you through the window at the Abbey
Looking like you're in a video
But when your so-called friends turn away
The shadow crosses over your face
For a minute I know just what you're thinking
You might have it all, but you're short of one thing

Living in a plastic world you think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing
I could be your that you need to feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing, girl
Ooh eeh ooh

All the posers that hover around you
Dropping names and cash like the who's who
Bet they all think they're Hollywood and high class
Bet their numbers all wind up in the trash
And though you seem so hard to get to
I know all the secret places I can find you
I like that you like to slumming on the dark side
Well I could keep you entertained for awhile

Living in a plastic world you think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing
I could be your that you need to feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing, girl

And girl when there's nobody else around
I'll make it okay to come down
Take off your Converse and your crown
Cause' you've been wandering, I've been waiting
And I'm what's missing

Ooh eeh ooh

Living in a plastic world you think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing
I could be your that you need to feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
But I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing, girl

I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
(Yeah, yeah, woah, woah)
I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
(Yeah, yeah, woah, woah)---
