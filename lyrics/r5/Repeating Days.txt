Climb the stairs to your apartment
Just to see you holding him
You try to tell me that it's nothing
So I keep coming back again

You're looking right in my eyes and I know that you're lying
When you say that you're mine and there's nobody else
But even when we fight, I can't stop from loving you
You know we can't be friends, I guess this is how it ends

Things that you say,
I can't erase
Repeating days,
It's all the same

Driving home I'm empty-hearted
Broken pictures on the floor
And when I thought that it was over
I see you standing at the door

I'm looking right in your eyes and you know that I'm lying
When I say that I'm fine, there'll be somebody else
But after all this time, I can't stop from loving you
You know we can't be friends.
Can I taste your lips again?

Things that you say,
I can't erase
Repeating days,
It's all the same

We're all afraid of loneliness
We're all afraid of dying 'lone
And even when you broke my heart
I'd do it again

You're looking right in my eyes and you know that I'm lying
When I say that you're mine and there's nobody else
But even when we fight, I can't stop from loving you
You know we can't be friends.
Can I taste your lips again?

Things that you say,
I can't erase
Repeating days,
It's all the same

Days repeating over again
Hopelessly go over our heads
Yeah, days repeating over again
Hopelessly go over our heads, yeah

All I got is cheap wine
Do you mind? All I got is love for you
All I've got is cheap wine
Are you mine? I'll will the time for you too

All I ask, please don't lie
'Cause this time, I won't come back home to you
Repeating days, where we stay
It's okay 'cause this time is ours to fade---
