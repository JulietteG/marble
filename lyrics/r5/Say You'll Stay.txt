Riker: It's summertime, and you are all that's on my mind, Everyday.
It seems like we, Could stay up and talk through the night.
Oh what do you say?

Ross: Say you'll stay (R5: hey-ey)
Heyy (R5:Sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (R5: Sta-ay)

No More running around, running around
(R5: No more running around, no no no, no more running around, no no no)
Running around, 
When I'm Around, 
Just say you'll stay.

Riker: Ramona's hair, (R5: Ramona's Hair)
She looks so cute in the clothes she wears. (Rocky: Yep, So Cute Man)
Her lips so sweet (R5: Her lips so sweet)
And when I walk her to the door, I'm thinking, 
Gee, Just give me one more kiss I'm begging please.
Ross: Say you'll stay (R5: hey-ey)
Heyy (R5:Sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (R5: Sta-ay)

No More running around, running around
(R5: No more running around, no no no, no more running around, no no no)
Running around, 
When I'm Around, 
Just say you'll stay.

(R5: And who-oo)
Ross: knows, when we are together, 
We never wanna go, oh-oh.
(R5: And you're not)
For Any kind of weather.
I just need to know, to know, 
That You, 
You'll be, there, 
Everytime I need you.

Ross: Say you'll stay (R5: hey-ey)
Hey (R5:Sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (R5: Sta-ay)

No More running around

Say you'll stay (R5: hey-ey)
Hey (R5:Sta-ay)
I just keep on wishing everyday. (hey-ey)
Hey (R5: Sta-ay)

No More running around, running around
(R5: No more running around, no no no, no more running around, no no no)
Running around, 
When I'm Around, 
Just say you'll stay.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
