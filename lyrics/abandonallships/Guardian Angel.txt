I'll be there watching from way up high. 
The shadow you can't see when the sun's in the sky. 
Wondering eyes have no disguise. 
It's obvious that this love never dies. 

Our love never dies, this love never dies. (2x) 

I'll be your guardian angel, your sweet company. 
No matter where I go, I'll make sure you're all I see. 
I'll be your guardian angel watching over you. 

When you thought that you were alone you turned your back on me. 
It's cause you think you sit high on a throne. 
I'll always have you on your knees. 

I'll be your guardian angel, your sweet company. 
No matter where I go, I'll make sure you're all I see. 


My eyes are glued I don't mean to intrude. 
I can't get them off of you. 
I pray you'll be watching from way up high. 
The shadow I can't see when the sun's in the sky. 
Watching over you, she felt a sense, a fear. 
As I came near, and on my face I drew a tear. 

I'll be your guardian angel, your sweet company. 
No matter where I go, I'll make sure you're all I see. 
My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude. 
I can't get them off of you I 'll be there watching from way up high 
The shadow you can't see when the sun's in the sky.---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa.
