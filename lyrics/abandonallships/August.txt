You paid attention
Was it time well spent?
Lies in the past, got dragged by the current.
How can you base what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august.

Mist fills my lungs,
Save me while I'm still young

We're lost in the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean

I tried to drown the pain away
But my pain learned how to swim
I think about it everyday
I'm what she wants she needs him
How can you base what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august

Mist fills my lungs
Save me while I'm still young

We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thought into the ocean

Lovers in August
Save me while I'm still young, save me while I'm still young. 

I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
Hoping they'd get back to you

We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean

We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean

Lover's in August, save me while I'm still young.---Lyrics submitted by BriAnna.
