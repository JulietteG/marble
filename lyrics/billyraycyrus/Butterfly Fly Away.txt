You tucked me in turned out the light 
kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that

Brushed my teeth and combed my hair 
had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back

You had to do it all alone 
make a living make a home 
must have been as hard as it could be

And when I couldn't sleep at night
scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree 
how you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far but you can always dream

wish you may and wish you might
don't you worry hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away

Butterfly fly away, butterfly fly away
Flap your wings now you can't stay 
Take those dreams and make them all come true

Butterfly fly away, butter fly fly away
You've been waiting for this day 
                 All Along
          You know just what to do
butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away

                Butterfly fly away 
Butterfly fly away---Lyrics submitted by Annalyn Johnson.
