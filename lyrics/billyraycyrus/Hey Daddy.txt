(Spoken)
Yeah you know
Time sure does fly by
It just goes on and on and on
One day you look up
Its all gone
Tomorrow's yesterday

Once there was this working man
Never standing still
Always with his nose to the ground stone
One day his little girl asked
Just as he walked past
She called out "are you leaving home?"

(Chorus)
Hey Daddy why you always gone away?
Hey Daddy, cant you stick around and play?
Can't you see I'm growing fast?
This time here will never last
Hey Daddy, think of me today

Funny how times seems to change
How they rearrange
So quick and yet so true
That little girl is a mama now
She grew up somehow
Left an old man feeling blue
he heard her say

Hey Daddy why you always gone away?
Hey Daddy can't you stick around and play?
Can't you see I"m growing fast?
This time here will never last
Hey Daddy, think of me today
Hey Daddy, think of me today---Lyrics submitted by manda.
