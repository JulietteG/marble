I chronicled the days you made me want to live
Memorized the way that it felt and then I turned it into this kiss
Tonight Im wearing my best smile in hope to make me worth your while
Ill be the best mistake youll ever make

From the lack of sleep and the bloodshot eyes
To the nervous kiss and the butterflies
Does this make any sense at all
She said, she said

Were not sleeping, and Im not breathing
If this means anything at all
I wont let you leave me anymore

If this holds insignificance, Ill have the hearse follow the ambulance
No medicine exists to make my lungs work again

Let's shake and burn, like an addict
My hearing's dead, only static
If I said your smile's all that mattered
Would you save my life?

We're not sleeping, and I'm not breathing
If this means anything at all
Don't let me leave you anymore
[4x]

Dont let me leave you anymore---
