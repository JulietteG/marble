such a beauty ,
ur a cutie ,
every man hypnotize
nutting cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

coulda neva lead mi stray ,
no matta how hard dem try
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

true u see mi hesitate ,
no badaa think say mi shy
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

them coulda.........................roll mi eye
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

{Chorus x2}

sweet girl ,
your the only one for me
the only one that has my heart
theres no need to stray ,

our love is like a perfect work of art
ain't no need to lose it,
cool it,
really gotta play it smart
(Got to play it smaaaaarrt)

now whole heap of man dem have dem woman and dem sweet heart
gyal inna mi ears ,
mi haffi tell her say fi ease off

understan mi fraid but mi no waan get her teed off
..... if you have a woman who nah ramp fi squeeze off

if u have a good ting ,
them say u no fi spoil it
argument a brew ,
and me no really waan fi boil it

have a whole heap of girl inna ya bed,
u might soil it!
you might come back home
and find she waan check out you private !!

{Chorus x1}

sweet girl ,
your the only one for me
the only one that has my heart
theres no need to stray ,

our love is like a perfect work of art
ain't no need to lose it,
cool it,
really gotta play it smart
( got to play it smaaaaarrt)

now wut a sweet chance fi wake up inna di mornin
afta me spend di whole night wit mi darlin

if pager go off and she a wonder ,
who's callin
look up pon her face ,
mi dun take dat as di warnin

no when a woman start get too protective
might haffi try figure out her objective


better make sure your argument is effective
real ol' columbo ,
she no stop play detective


{Chorus x1}

sweet girl ,
your the only one for me
the only one that has my heart
theres no need to stray ,

our love is like a perfect work of art
ain't no need to lose it,
cool it,
really gotta play it smart
( got to play it smaaaaarrt)

such a beauty ,
ur a cutie ,
every man hypnotize
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

coulda neva lead mi stray ,
no matta how hard dem try
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

true u see mi hesitate ,
no badaa think say mi shy
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

them coulda.........................roll mi eye
nuttin cant mash up mi and mi bonafied

CAUSE whole heap of man dem have dem woman and dem sweet heart
gyal inna mi ears ,
mi haffi tell her say fi ease off

understan mi fraid but mi no waan get her teed off
..... if you have a woman who nah ramp fi squeeze off

if u have a good ting ,
them say u no fi spoil it
argument a brew ,
and me no really waan fi boil it

have a whole heap of girl inna ya bed,
