Put your clothes back on
I'd rather be alone
Your thing is all worn out now get on home
You've had to many lovers in off the hair 
there ain't no way I'm going in there
Put you clothes on 
And get on Home

I should have never gone out
I should of never had a Drink
Take that thing out side it is starting to Stink
Your friends done told me where you have been 
And i feel sorry for all those men 
Put you clothes on Baby
And get on Home

Yeah get that thing away from me 
It looks like something your dog would eat 
Seen enough now set me free 
I think that thing just Barked at me (RUFF)
Early this morning it bit my leg
Oh, little darling don't you make me beg
Now put you clothes on 
And get on Home

Oh shit I'm scared
I need medical care
I think 3 midgets just crawled out of there
Now i was fine before you came
won't you throw something over that pitiful thing 
Baby put you clothes on 
And get on Home

Yeah, Put you clothes on 
And get your booty back home 
Go ohhhhh n---Lyrics submitted by Darrell.
