We fell in love and got married 
Back in 1993 
People said you had a rocky past 
It never mattered to me 
You say Im the only one, 
But theres pictures on our wall 
Of you and your x boy friend 
Kissn at the mall 

If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come you still talk to him 
If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come our baby looks just like Tim 

Im just asking questions 
I dont mean to pry 
You got all the answers 
So baby just tell me why 

If Im the only one you ever loved 
Whos underwear are these 
If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come youve got so many Marti Gras beads 
You say that Im the only one you love 

You didnt come home the other night 
You said you had to work late 
I came by your office with some cookies I baked 
I walked in and I saw him and his hands were in your hair 
And both your feet were pointed in the air 

If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come your boss is all over you 
If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come his pants are around his shoes 

Im just asking questions 
I dont mean to pry 
You got all the answers 
So just tell my why 

I just need an explanation 
So I can understand 
Why when I came home last night 
There was a necked man 
Runn across our land 
With his cloths in his hand, He ran 

If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come your names on the bathroom wall 
If Im the only one you ever loved 
How come it says for a good time call 
You say that Im the only one you love 
But you spent the night on 50 cents tour bus 

How am I the only one you ever loved.---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
