I was born a rappers son from Atlanta
Pimping ho's when I was 5 years old
We had plenty of Crystal and a Bentley
Cause that's just how we always like to roll

We didn't mind showing off our Bling Bling 
Our golden teeth and our Cadillac Escalade
The bitches shake there booty when they pass by me 
And as I smoke my Cuban tree i've got it made

Am livin fat an am livin large
Throwing leg in my Bentley car
And my P.O said that I won't get far
Being the son of a rapstar

Chillin at the club with ma hommies
Sipping on Gin n Juice when ma bo walks passed(wassup dude)
You better step on off and not be frontin
Or else i'll bust a cap off in u're ass

Am ma baby's daddy and his a mama
Don't axe me thats all you need to know
His pyjamas are made by Gooche and birsache
Cause thats just how we always like to roll

Am livin fat an am livin large
Throwing leg in my Bentley car
And my P.O said that I won't get far
Being the son of a rapstar

Being the son of a rapstar.....star.....star---Lyrics submitted by Darrell.
