I remember way back when i was just a boy,
goin places with my mom and dad,
It used to scare me to death, how momma used to act
after six or seven beers she's had.
we were sittin at a table when momma got disabled
all the liquor runnin to her head,
Soon I got to chokin', daddy wasn't jokin' when he grabbed me by the arm and said...

"Don't look now your momma's got her boobs out showing everybody in town."
Faces gettin' red we were wishin we were dead,
there where people standing all around
when when momma gets to drinking there ain't much thinkin',
there's nothing anybody can do,
Just hope and pray there never comes a day when my momma's out drinkin' with you

Well, we got her in the truck
and we started drivin' home
when momma said she had to go,
daddy pulled it over,
we were standing on the shoulder while mom is puttin' on a show
then he started up the truck and momma stood up with her pants still around her knees,
when we heard momma holler
if ya give me a dollar well I'll let you take a peek at these.

"Don't look now, your momma's got her boobs out."
Showin' everybody in town
Faces turning red, we were wishing we were dead
There were people standing all around
When momma gets to drinkin', there ain't much thinkin'
There's nothing anybody can do
Won't you hope and pray, there never comes a day when my momma's out drinking with you.
Oh, won't you hope and pray there never comes a day, when my momma's out drinking with you.---Lyrics submitted by savannah.
