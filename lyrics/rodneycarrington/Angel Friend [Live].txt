You lift me up each day, even though youve gone away.  Your spirit dances in my mind, in my heart, and in my soul.  The life you lived, the love you left the ones you touch we wont forget.   You gave us strength in time of need, my friend my angel friend.  And we shared good times through the years, in my heart and soul youre here with me, my friend my angel friend.
I hear you whisper in the wind, piece by piece our hearts will mend.   The dreams you shared will carry on, here and now and beyond. And the world will smile for you were here; the gifts brought well hold them dear.  Ill take you with me till meet again, my friend my angel friend.  And well share good times from now on, in my heart you live on with me, my friend my angel friend.
I miss my friend.---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
