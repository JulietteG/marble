Do you wanna do something that rhymes with truck
Do you wanna do something that rhymes with duck
Do you wanna do something that rhymes with my best friend,
His name is Chuck
Do you wanna do something that rhymes with truck

Do you wanna sit on something that rhymes with stick
Do you wanna sit on something that rhymes with brick
Do you wanna sit on something that rhymes with my old horse
His name is Flick
Do you wanna sit on something that rhymes with stick

Oh if you don't want to, I completely understand
Oh it's plain to see I'll never be, never be your man
Well I'll go home all alone and I'll climb up in my Loft 
and I'll do something that rhymes with Jacking-off 
There is nothing that rhymes with Jacking-off---Lyrics submitted by Eric Blades.
