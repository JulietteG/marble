when i got home the door was locked so i tried to ring the bell
i found a little bittie note that she had wrote tellin me to go to hell
i crawled in the window got inside she kicked me in the balls and then i cried
called me a name said i lied kicked me again and i thought i died
took my clothes caught em on fire hit me with her curling iron
i tried to block with my watch then she kicked me in the crotch again
todays the day my wife met my girlfriend
well i tried to tell her but she didnt care things werent what they seemed
she had pan on the stove full of boiling water and soon my nats will be steamed
i tried to run scream for help she hit me in the nuts with rinestone belt
it was like nothin that i ever felt i thank god i wasnt wearin a kilt
she grabbed a bat from beneath the bed swong it once missed my head 
she reared back swung it again then she hit me in the twins again
todays the day my wife met my girlfriend yeah todays that awful day 
my boys wont be the same yeah todays the day m y wife met my girlfriend---Lyrics submitted by derek.
