Just look at me, a fool you see,
This one who loves the ground you tread,
The sounds of love are in my head.

In my eyes the only sign that I can see,
The only light is outta sight and far from me.

Try a little sunshine and youll be right there,
It takes a little rain to see.
Try a little sunshine and youll be right there,
It takes a little rain to see.

Just look at me, a fool you see,
This one who loves the ground you tread,
The sounds of love are in my head.

In my eyes the only light that I can see,
Is outta sight and far from me.

[Guitar Break]

Try a little sunshine and youll be right there,
It takes a little rain to see.
Try a little sunshine and youll be right there,
It takes a little rain to see.
Try a little sunshine and youll be right there,
It takes a little rain to see.---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Hetherington.
