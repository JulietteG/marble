Thoughts transform into growth of the mind
I unfold, break the mold, and then regain control
Congregate, initiate - create a visual projection
I've got a synapse of a newfound perception

A rush of blood to the head
Bound together thread by thread
Tripping over a flux of decisions
Seeking out answers decoding these visions


Thoughts transform into growth of the mind
I unfold, break the mold, and then regain control
Congregate, initiate - create a visual projection
I've got a synapse of a newfound perception

Spores disperse, my eyes widen
Thoughts unstable, uncommon
Higher-level thinking
Senses melting - I am awake

Disperse
