From ashes of their own mistake
The masses rise against their control
How have they made it thus far?
Programmed to slave and to obey

Leave behind all your typical emotions
Now is the time for a change of the world

We don't have the power but still we have a voice
Here our words in your head like propaganda

We will rise
We won't stop now
x2

So let this occupy your mind
But don't believe a word they say
They are just feeding your primal appetite for lies (for lies)

Now it's time to bite the hand that feeds you (heed our warning)

Media slaves
Open your eyes, open your mind
x2

Greed has trashed the world, and profit's the problem
One day you'll realize that you are the one to blame

Leave behind all your typical emotions
Now is the time for a change of the world
Leave behidn all your aversions
Just attach strings to your back

Listen repeat
We are not free---Lyrics submitted by Logan Pollaro.
