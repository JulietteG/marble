Time, sometimes the time just slips away,
and your left with yesterday
left with the memories
I, I'll always think of you and smile  
and be happy for the time
I had you with me
Though we go our seperate ways 
I won't forget so don't forget 
The memories we made 

Please remember, Please remember
I was there for you and you were there for me 
Please remember, our time together 
The time was yours and mine. 
And we were wild and free
Please remember, Please remember me.

Goodbye, there's just no sadder word to say 
and its sad to walk away with just the memories
who's to know what might have been 
We'll leave behind a life and time
We'll never know again

Please remember, please remember 
I was there for you and you were there for me
And remember, please remember me.

Please remember, please remember
I was there for you and you were there for me
please remember our time together
the time was yours and mine
while we were wild and free
Then remember, please remember me

And how we laughed and how we smiled
and how this world was yours and mine 
and how a dream was out of reach
I stood by you, you stood by me
We took each day and made it shine
We wrote our names across the sky 
We ride so fast, we ride so free
and I had you and you had me

Please remember, please remember---Lyrics submitted by Beth.
