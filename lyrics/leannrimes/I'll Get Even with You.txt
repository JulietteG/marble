For all the nights you held me close
Warmed my heart when it was cold
When I was giving up
You gave me love

From some dark alley in my mind
You made a hidden dream unwind
Turned my stumbling blocks
To stepping stones

I'll get even with you
For the hard times you helped me through
I'm giving back to you
All the love you've given me
For the rest of my life
Everyday and everynight
If it's the last thing I ever do
I'll get even with you

When the odds were against me
And I was lost with no will to go on
You wrapped your loving arms around my heart
Took my losin' hand and led me home

I'll get even with you
For the hard times you helped me through
I'm giving back to you
All the love you've given me
For the rest of my life
Everyday and everynight
If it's the last thing I ever do
I'll get even with you

If it's the last thing I ever do
I'll get even with you.---Lyrics submitted by Covergurl.
