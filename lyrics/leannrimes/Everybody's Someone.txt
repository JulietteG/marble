Everybody's someone

And every day begins the same, 
get up, go out, come back again.
Same old, same old.

A thousand faces pass you by, 
you never look into their eyes.
You feel so ordinary, 
they feel so ordinary.

Chorus
Hey, everybody's someone, 
no matter where you come from.
There's light in every single star, 
you're more than who you think you are.
Hey, everybody's someone, 
and when it's hard to hold on.
Remember you are not alone, 
this house is everybody's home.

And every day we seem to chase, 
the perfect smile, the perfect face.
Same old, same old.
Same old.

For every one who gets to shine, 
a million more are left behind.
They feel so ordinary, 
you feel so ordinary.

Chorus

From a king to a common man, 
we're all part of a greater plan.

There's light in every single star,
you're more than who you think you are.
Hey, everybody's someone, 
and when it's hard to hold on.
Remember you are not alone, 
this house is everybody's home. 
Hey, hey.---Lyrics submitted by Marwileen.
