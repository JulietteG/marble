(verse 1)
Know all about
Bout ya reputation and now its bound to be a harvic situation.
But i cant help it if im helpless evertime im with you ahh
You walk in and my strength walks out the door
Say my name and i cant fight it anymore.
all i know i should go,
But i need your touch just to damn much.
(chorus)
Lovin you, is there really somethin i should do
shouldnt wanna spend my time with you
I should try to be strong
But baby your the right kinda wrong
yea baby your the right kinda wrong

(verse 2)
Ill be a mistake i almost think im naked.
But what your givin ill be happy to be taken
cuz no ones ever made me feel the way that i feel
 when im in your arms.
They say your somethin i should do without
they dont no what go's on when the lights go out
Theres no way to explain
All the pleasure is worth all the pain

(chorus)

Yea i shuld try to run
but i just cant seem to
Cuz everytime i run your the one i run tooo
I cant do without, but what you do to me i
Dont care if im in too deep yeaaaaaaa

(chorus)

You walk in and my strength walks out the door
Say my name an i cant fight it anymore
all i know i should go but i need your touch just to damn much
Yeaaaaaa
