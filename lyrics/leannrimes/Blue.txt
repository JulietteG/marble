Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Tears fill my eyes 'til I can's see
3 o'clock in the morning, here am I
Sittin' here so lonely, so lonesome I could cry

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Now that it's over, I realize
Those weak words you whispered, were nothing but lies

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Why can't you be blue over me?---Lyrics submitted by Estelle.
