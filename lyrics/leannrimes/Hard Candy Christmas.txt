Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just

Fine and Dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
Barely getting through tomorrow
Still I won't let sorrow bring me way down

Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
But still I'll be just

Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
Still I won't let sorrow bring me down

I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
Still I won't let sorrow bring me down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
