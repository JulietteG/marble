Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright

Silent night, Holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy holy holy infant, so tender and bright
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds quake, at the sight
All the prayers says the glories that stream down in ray from heaven above
Heavenly heavenly heavenly, all the angels sing Hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Born, born...

Silent night, Holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
All the radiant beams still light off the wall from thy holy face
With the dawn, oh the beautiful beatiful dawn redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at thy birth
Jesus, Lord at thy birth
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
