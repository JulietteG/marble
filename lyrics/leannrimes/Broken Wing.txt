Today I watched a robin
In our front yard
I thought by now that they should all be gone.
With winter round the corner
Snow on its way
Surely something must be wrong.
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate
And the song that she was singing
Seemed to say "Ill be right here"
"Id like to go, but your loves made me stay."
Hes got a broken wing
And thats why he cant fly

She just cant leave him there
So she stays by his side
Theyre just like you and me
Oh you shouldve heard her sing
They wont give up
Its just a broken wing.
I wish we all could learn
What they seem to have found
To love our families
When trouble comes around
Ill bet that God saw fit
To show them unto me
Him on the ground
Her in that tree.---Lyrics submitted by Carissa.
