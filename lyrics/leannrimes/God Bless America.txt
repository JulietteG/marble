God Bless America,
Land that I love.
Stand beside her, and guide her,
Through the night with the light from above.
From the mountains, to the prairies,
to the oceans, white with foam,
God Bless America,
My home sweet home.
God Bless America,
My home sweet home
God Bless America
From the mountains, to the prairies,
to the oceans, white with foam,
God Bless America,
My home sweet home.
God Bless America,
My home sweet home. ---Lyrics submitted by SoniaTerkildsen.
