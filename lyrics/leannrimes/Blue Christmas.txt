I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And the when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And the when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
