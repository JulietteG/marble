Our Father, who art in heaven, 
Hallowed be thy Name. 
Thy kingdom come. 
Thy will be done, 
On earth as it is in heaven. 
Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our dets 
As we forgive our detors 
And lead us not into temptation, 
But deliver us from evil. 
For thine is the kingdom, 
and the power, and the glory, 
for ever 
Amen.---Lyrics submitted by Vicky.
