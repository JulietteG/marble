The sun's coming out, there's a chill in the air
I'm dreaming, and driving, and not really there
People drive by me, talking on their cell phones
Never in my whole life, have I felt so alone

In the rocks in the ditch down near old twenty-one
There's a cross by the highway, in the rain and the sun
For somebody's loved one, it stands night and day
A cross by the highway

I heard an old preacher just the other day
Preaching these streets hard things washed away
Is it that simple, should it even be
My Mom once told me, son nothing here's free

In the rocks in the ditch down near old twenty-one
There's a cross by the highway, in the rain and the sun
For somebody's loved one, it stands night and day
A cross by the highway

It's a funny old world, and a very strange time
And no one can guess these thoughts of mine
Small talk and smiles, sports and the weather
Acting just like this all lasts forever

In the rocks in the ditch down near old twenty-one
There's a cross by the highway, in the rain and the sun
For somebody's loved one, it stands night and day
A cross by the highway---Lyrics submitted by John Majka.
