I've lost count of the ways I've tried to shut this down
But the flame never goes out
All the dangers I've faced I've taken on my own
I've never had reason to doubt.
But you, you've opened through
I've got no defense as you take me over the edge

I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go

The one and only piece that I need to make me feel complete
The rest means nothing to me
The one and only wish that I get is you
Just when you're right there
You know you fill my head you push my senses over the edge

I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go

Falling into you there's nothing I can do
I got no defense against you
Falling into you the ways you pull me through
I keep falling deeper into you

I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go---
