It's been awhile since I saw your face
Maybe that's helped me move on
But I met a girl not a day too late
And of her I'm awfully fond

And I hope my remedies don't show
As I try to try to let you go
'Cause it's awkward; oh so hard to see
The similarities

She's got your hair
She's got your eyes
She's got your exact same horoscope sign
She may be pretty
She's something new
But that means nothing
She ain't you

I find it hard not to look your way
But I get in what I can
And I find this song just a bit clich
But I pray that you'll understand

That there's nothing, nothing on her mind
And she's far too, (far too), far too kind
If you miss me, Kiss me one more time
At least for old time's sake

She's got your hair
She's got your eyes
She's got your exact same horoscope sign
She may be pretty
She's something new
But that means nothing
She ain't you

She's got your hair
She's got your eyes
She's got your nineties' sweatshirt style
She may be pretty
She's something new
But that means nothing

She's got your hair
She's got your eyes
She's got your exact same horoscope sign
She may be pretty
She's something new
But that means nothing
She ain't you ---
