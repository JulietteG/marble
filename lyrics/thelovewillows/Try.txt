I walk for what seems like forever
I get nowhere
But I still try
I find not even the first clue to get me close to you
But babe Im trying

Im so lonely trying to get some company
Why cant you see theres something good inside of me?
And I try and I try and I try and I try
Im still trying

Youve been running away from me
So far that I can see  see you trying
You say so soft and slowly that youre happy
I guess youre trying

Im so lonely trying to get some company
Why cant you see theres something good inside of me?
And I try and I try and I try and I try
Im still trying to hold on to everything weve ever had
And Im dying inside to be with you every chance I get
Yeah yeah

Im so lonely trying to get some company
Why cant you see theres something good inside of me?
And I try and I try and I try and I try
Im still trying

Weve been trying to make it through
Just me and you 
Yeah were trying
Finally you said youre through with me
Im finding it hard to see
Cuz babe Im crying---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
