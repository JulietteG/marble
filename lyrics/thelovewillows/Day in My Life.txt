I wake up and get out of bed
Six o'clock, wanna sleep but I know I gotta go.
Grab some toast, juice and jelly.
Grab my coat and fly on out the door, gone until four.

It's a day in the life, my life in a day.
All is on time and never the same.
Hey, my life is great. I can't complain.
It's never the same. Oh, hey,
My life is great. I can't complain, it's never the same.

I ride my bike through the alley, meet my friend
On the corner of Main, on the seventeen.---Lyrics submitted by Bailey.
