Good morning, Good Morning, Good morning, Good Morning,

Wake up Mr.West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh, Mr. By hisself he so impressed! 
I mean, Damn, did you even see the test? 
you got D's motha f***er, D's, Rosie Perez, 
and yes barely passed,
 and he in every class,
 lookin at every ass,
 cheated on every test, I guess this my dissertation,
 homie this sh*t is basic, 
welcome to graduation! 
                          [chorus]
Good Morning, 
on this day we become legendary,
Everything we dreamed of,
I'm like the fly Malcolm X by any jeans necessary,
Detroit Red cleaned up,
From the streets of the league,'
from the eighth to the key,
but you graduate when you get up outta the streets
From the moment of pain,
look how far we done came, 
Haters sayin we changed, 
now ya doing ya thang,
                        [chorus]
Good Morning,
Look at the validitorian,
scared of the future
while I hop In the delorian
scared to face the world 
complacement career student, 
some people graduate but we still stupid
They tell ya read this,
Eat this,
don't look around  
just peep this 
preach this,
teach this,
Jesus!
Okay look up now,'
they done stole you streetness
after all that you receive this,
      Good morning,
 [ hustlers that's it we still livin, get on down]
Every time that we hear em' Good Morning!
 [repeat 4x]
Get on down, Get on down, [repeat 4x]---Lyrics submitted by Nate.
