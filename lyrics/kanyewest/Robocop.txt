'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'll turn my life to steven king

Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's something she don't need to know
She never let it go (ooo ohh)

OK ok, ok ok, you will never stop it now
You'll never stop it now
Ok, ok ok, you will never stop it now
You need to drop it now (drop it drop it)

Cuz I don't want no robocop
You moving like a robocop
When did u become a robocop
No I don't need no robocop

Just lookin at your history
You like the girl from misery
She said she aint take it to this degree
Well lets agree to disagree

Shawtys kinda crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it goin on
I told her it's something she don't need to know
She never let it go (oo ohh)

OK ok, ok ok, you will never stop it now
You'll never stop it now
Ok ok ok, you will never stop it now
You need to drop it now (drop it drop it)

Cuz I don't want no robocop
You moving like a robocop (yea)
When did u become a robocop
Somebody please make it stop

Stop... drop... roll
Pop... b**** I'm cold... I
Aint used to being told...stop
So i can never be yo'..ro-bot
Fast or slow... you can stay, you can go
Now now that you know... now now that you know
Yeah i had it before, but that happened before
You get mad when you know, so just dont ask me no mo'


Ok...
Ok...
Ok... (hey hey)

It ain't Ok...
Ok...
Ok... ay ay ay ay

You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Ha ha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now---Lyrics submitted by Andy.
