On lonely nights I start to fade(x2)

Her loves a thousand miles away(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

It's 4 am and I can't sleep(x2)

Her love is all that I can see(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend , will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

Winter(x2)

Goodbye my friend, will I eva love again(x3)

It's rain can't take the snow away(x2)

It melt away all our mistakes(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, I won't eva love again

Neva again....---Lyrics submitted by Tricey.
