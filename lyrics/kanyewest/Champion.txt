Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

(Kanye) 
Yes I did 
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everybody want it but it aint that serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

You dont see just how wild the crowd is 
You dont see just how fly my style is 
I dont see why I need a stylist 
When I shop so much I can speak italian 
I dont know I just want it better for my kids 
And I aint sayin we was from the projects 
But everytime I wanna layaway or deposit 
My dad'll say when you see clothes, close your eyelids 
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son 
In the movie I aint talkin' bout the rich ones 
Cuz every summer 
He'll get some brand new harebrain scheme to get rich from 
And I dont know what he did for dough 
But he'll send me back to school with a new wardrobe 
and ay, ay, ay ,ay 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

I think he did 
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

When it feel like living's harder than dying 
For me giving up's way harder than trying 
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion 
I wish her heart still was in rhyming 
Cuz who the kids gon' listen to 
Huh 
I guess me if it isnt you 
Last week I payed a visit to the Institute 
They got the Dropout keepin' kids in the school 
I guess i cleaned up my act like prison do 
If not for pledge at least for the principle 
They got the CD they got to see me 
Drop gems like i droped out of PE 
They used to feel invisible 
Now they now they invincible 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 
This is the story of a champion 
runners on their mark and they pop their guns 
Stand up stand up here he comes 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 

This is the story of a champion 
runners on their mark and they pop their guns 
Stand up stand up here he comes 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 

(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 
Yes I did 
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everybody want it but it aint that serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion
