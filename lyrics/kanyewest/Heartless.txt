In the night I hear `em talk
the Coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless (ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(y-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo I know some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo I did some things but that's the old me
and now you wanna get me back 
and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend,
Well I got homies
but in the end it`s still so lonely

In the night I hear `em talk
the coldest story  ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(ya-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless

How could you be so Dr.Evil 
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we were'nt gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo`
Homie I don't know 
She's hot and cold
I won't stop i won`t mess my groove up 
'Cause I already know how this thing goes
You run and tell your friends that your leavin' me 
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
 you'll never find nobody better than me

In the night I hear `em talk
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heart less?(ya-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we've been through 
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I've got something new to see
And you just keep on hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
 I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong?
And you can`t make it right 
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night

I hear `em talk
The coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?Oh
How could you be so heartless?---Lyrics submitted by sherri.
