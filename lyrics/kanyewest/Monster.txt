I shut the lights out
Hide 'til its bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life

[Rick Ross]
Bitch Im a monster no good blood sucker
Fat muthafucker now look whos in trouble
As you run through my jungle all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample, heres one for example

[Chorus]
Gossip gossip
N-gga just stop it
Everybody know (Im a muthaf-cking monster)
Ima need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
Ima need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
Profit profit, n-gga I got it
Everybody know Im a muthaf-cking monster
Ima need to see your f-cking hands at the concert

The best living or dead hands down huh?
Less talk more head right now huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And Im bout to take it to another level bitch
There you go again, aint nobody as cold as this
Through the rap and the track tripled up and no assist
But my only focus is staying on some bogus sh-t
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sh-t
I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
F-ckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
Chi n-gga but hes hold of his accent
She came up to me and said this the number 2 gal
If you wanna make it number one your number 2 now
This that goose an malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy How I hit em with the new style
Know that muthaf-cker well, what you gon' do now
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh its cool now
Nah gonna do, uhh its a new now
Think yo muthaf-cker really really need to cool down
Cause you ain't never get on top off this
So mommy's best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharoah
I put the p-ssy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallow ship
Im living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present kiss my ass

[Jay-Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong
Lochness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question what do all these things have in common
Everybody knows Im a muthaf-cking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
None of you n-ggas know where the swamp is
None of you n-ggas have seen the carnage that Ive seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles uh
I kill a block I murder the avenues uh
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles Heel is
LOVE I dont get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these n-ggas Ive made millionnaires
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake f-cks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
-inhales through nose- I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus]
Gossip gossip
N-gga just stop it
Everybody know (Im a muthaf-cking monster)
Ima need to see your f-cking hands at the concert

Everybody know Im a muthaf-cking monster
Ima need to see your f-cking hands at the concert

[Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster
Automobile gangster
With a bad b-tch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah Im in that Tonka, colour of Willy Wonka
You can be the King but watch the Queen conquer
Ok first things first Ill eat your brains
Then Ima start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause thats what a muthaf-cking monster do
Hairdresser from milan, thats the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel thats the monster shoe
Young money is the roster and a monster crew
And Im all up all up all up in the bank with a funny face
And if Im fake I don't know this cause my money aint
Now let me get this straight wait Im the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
50k for a verse no album out
Yet my moneys so tall that my barbies gotta climb it 
Hotter than a middle eastern climate climate
Find it 20 mataran dutty whine it whine it
Nicki on a pit while I sign it
How these n-ggas so one-track minded
But really really I dont give a F-U-C-K
Forget barbie f-ck Nicki cause shes fake
Shes on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
And Ill say Bride of Chucky is Childs play
Just killed another career its a mild day
Besides Yay they cant stand besides me
I think me, you and him should minaj friday
Pa-pa-pa-pink wig thick ass give em whip lash
I thi-thi-thi-think big get cash make em blink fast
Now-now-now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaahhhh, Im a muthaf-cking monster!

[Bon Iver]

And Ill-Ill let God decide-cide
I-I wouldnt last these shows
So I-I am headed home
