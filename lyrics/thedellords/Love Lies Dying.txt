Ive seen that look before, but not on you
Ive heard that tone of voice, but not from you
Once upon a time my mama came into my room
I still recall the smell of alcohol and her perfume
She said, Ive had it son, Im sorry but Im through
All this time I thought I was to blame
Now Im losing you the same way

How dark this night
Our love lies dying
How dark this night
How far the dawn
How dark this night
Our love lies dying
Ill never know why I needed you
And I dont know why I still do

Broken home and broken dreams, were two of a kind
Born with the same bad luck, born under the same bad sign
Everything about our love was wrong
I dont know how it went on so long
Or why it still burns so strong
What we called love, the world called something else
They say you cant love someone if you hate yourself

How dark this night
Our love lies dying
How dark this night
How far the dawn
How dark this night
Our love lies dying
Ill never know why I needed you
And I dont know why I still do

Take me back to our first kiss
I could feel the beating of an empty heart; yeah, another misfit
And that was enough for us
We thought we were born to be together
We thought this was love

The Winter came right through these walls, but we stayed right here
We told each other it was them not us, as our friends disappeared
We brought out the worst in us
A combination always ready to combust
Still it was a mighty love and a powerful lust
Either way, the sparks would always fly
Either way, Im not ready to say goodbye

How dark this night
Our love lies dying
How dark this night
How far the dawn
How dark this night
Our love lies dying
Shes gone, gone, gone, gone---Lyrics submitted by eljko Dronjak.
