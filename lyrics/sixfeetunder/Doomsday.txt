we rise up form the tomb
bloody and covered with worms
today is the day of doom
a hunger for flesh is the cure
rise up form the ground
an army ready to kill
zombiefied nations of blood
have taken over the earth has died
a shallow giant grave
a blood soaked skull
a terror greater than death

tear away the skin
a skeleton exposed to be broken
in the ground but soon to live
the maggot infested dead
awaken form their rest
to kill again

we kill again to satisfy
our hunger will always be blood

death is now on its way waiting to end today
sludge of the human waste you will have died in pain
a plague has been let loose
sickness within us grows
death is now on its way waiting to end today

doomsday

death is now on its way waiting to end today
sludge of the human waste you will have died in pain
a plague has been let loose
sickness within us grows
death is now on its way waiting to end today

we rise up form the tomb
bloody and covered with worms
today is the day of doom
a hunger for flesh is the cure
rise up form the ground
an army ready to kill
zombiefied nations of blood
have taken over the earth---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
