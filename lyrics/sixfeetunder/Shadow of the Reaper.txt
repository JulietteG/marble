the shadow of the reaper, the shadow of the dead
entombs the lifeless
the darkest black is cast
the shadow of the reaper, will take its hand
the shadow of the reaper, the grave now calls to you

in the cemetery
you have been left unburied
the vultures pick at your eyes

the cold grasp, a blood hand
the skeleton it cracks
and its twitching
inside of your body
the brain retreats
the heart beats no longer
in denial
life no longer there
to comfort
to invigorate
to betray you
the rotten now await you
meet the devils keeper
in the shadow of the reaper
the rotten now await you
to invade you

the shadow of the reaper, the shadow of the dead
entombs the lifeless
the darkest black is cast
the shadow of the reaper, will you take it hand
the shadow of the reaper, the grave now calls to you

in the cemetary
you have been left unburied
the vultures pick at your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Brady.
