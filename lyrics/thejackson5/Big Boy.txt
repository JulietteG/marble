Fairy tales, fairy tales
I don't enjoy
Fairy tales and wishful dreams
Are broken toys

'Cause I'm a big boy now (Big boy)
That's looking for (Big boy)
Someone to love, oh yeah
Someone, someone to share my dreams, oh yeah

Mother goose, oh mother goose
Oh, won't you join
All I need is an ol' lovely girl
Holding my arm

'Cause I'm a big boy now (Big boy)
That's looking for (Big boy)
Someone to love, oh yeah
Someone, someone to share my dreams, oh yeah

Skating boards
And kiddie cars
Have had their day
Dating at the picture show with you 
Is here to stay

'Cause I'm a big boy (Big boy)
That's looking for (Big boy)
Someone to love, oh yeah
Someone, someone to share my dreams, oh yeah
Come on, baby
Come on, baby, ooh---Lyrics submitted by Allison.
