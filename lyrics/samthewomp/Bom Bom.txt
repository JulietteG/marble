I'm the cat with the bass and drum, 
going 'round like Bom Bom Bom! 

I'm the cat with the bass and drum, 
going 'round like Bom Bom Bom! 
What's grooving? I'm moving. 
I like you're style of Womping! 
How charming! Just a rapper 
load him up and eat that snapper! 
I want 16 pints of rum and then I go Bom Bom! 
Going up in the dark of the night 
and so I go ooh ah ah ah ah. I... 
I've brought a pie in my pocket, 
pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket. 
you got life, you got style, 
you got nothing on my mind. 
But I'm so cool, and I'm so groovy, 
when I go Bom Bom Bom!

Going 'round like Bom Bom Bom! 
I'm so cool, I'm so groovy, 
when I go Bom Bom Bom! 

I'm the cat with the bass and drum, 
going 'round like Bom Bom Bom! 
What's grooving? I'm moving. 
I like you're style of Womping! 
How charming! Just a rapper 
load him up and eat that snapper! 
I want 16 pints of rrrrum and then I go Bom Bom! 
Going up in the dark of the night 
and so I go ooh ah ah ah ah. I... 
I've brought a pie in my pocket, 
pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket. 
you got life, you got style, 
you got nothing on my mind. 
But I'm so cool, and I'm so groovy, 
when I go Bom Bom Bom!

I'm so cool, I'm so groovy,
when I go Bom Bom Bom!

Bom Bom Bom!

I'm so cool, I'm so groovy,
when I go Bom Bom Bom!---Lyrics submitted by Sophie Laurita.
