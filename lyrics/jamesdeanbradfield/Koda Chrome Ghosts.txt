I found some old photographs
In a box on a shelf
While I was looking for something else
We were smiling for the camera
On a street in a town
It's a place I can't remember now

When that hour comes around
How will you, how will you get through
My mind is already full of all the things
I never said, never said to you

History of Kodachrome Ghosts
I thought I had laid to rest
A dream half remembered
When, when you overslept

Pictures cling to my mind
1980's Christmas day
You were younger than I am today
Now I'm hear in this room
With you're life on my knees
A shoebox full of memories

Some things you gave me
I will take, I'll take to the grave
My mind's already full of the promises
We didn't think to make, didn't think to make

History of Kodachrome Ghosts
I thought I had laid to rest
A dream half remembered
When, when you overslept---Lyrics submitted by Tim Bustin.
