Beyond ability and control we could be weekend lovers
Steal a sentence and make a catch phrase parole for our revolution
Whispered all across the street about, about the new cool call
Or screamed at your face like a scab's payroll

Faces like angels, lick our fingertips
We don't have the patience to deal with it
With battered bodies and puckered lips
We don't have the patience to deal with it

A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way

Faces like angels, lick our fingertips
We don't have the patience to deal with it
With battered bodies and puckered lips
We don't have the patience to deal with it

Can I get a witness?
This I gotta see
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
One more time for me
Can I get a witness?
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
One more time for me
Go

We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience

Get down
Listen to him

A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
