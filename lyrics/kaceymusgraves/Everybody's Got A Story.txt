*Verse*
She had a couple different daddies
Could never make her mama happy
And her skinny little sister
Got all the attention
So she slept with half the town
And when the gossip got around
That she was fast
She blamed her past

*Chorus*
We all got our issues
A lot of life we gotta live through
A dozen different reasons to fall apart
So don't start with all that poor me
'Cause everybody's got a story 
That'll break your heart

*Verse*
You blame the drinking on your childhood
You blame the school 'cause you don't talk good
Blame the drive-thru for the weight gain
Your hot temper on your last name
You blame your ex for your divorce 
And the judge for the child support that you gotta pay
And you'd blame God if you prayed

*Chorus*
We all got our issues
All the shit we gotta get through
A dozen different reasons to fall apart
Don't you start with all that poor me
'Cause everybody's got a story 
That'll break your heart

*Bridge*
I could stand and talk for days
'Bout what the world has put me through
But when you point a finger
There's three more pointing back at you

*Chorus*
We've all got out issues
All the shit we gotta get through
A dozen different reasons I could fall apart
So I don't wanna hear that poor me
'Cause everybody's got a story 
And we've got all got a cross to bear
And nobody's life is fair
So don't start with all that poor me
'Cause everybody's got a story 
That'll break your heart

*End Verse*
Yeah everybody's got a story 
That'll break your heart---Lyrics submitted by Miranda Burton.
