Who needs a house up on a hill
When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow?
You don't ever have to mow the yard
Just hang a map and throw a dart
And pray to God the engine starts and go

Water and electric and a place to drain the septic
Any KOA is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you

Parking lots and county lines
And counting mile marker signs
Where the buffalo and antelope all roam
Greetings from Niagara Falls
One more postcard for the wall
Off in our own sweet home away from home

Water and electric and a place to drain the septic
Any KOA is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you

And Washington and Idaho
And Oregon and away we go
To Tennessee and Arkansas
No, we won't stop 'til we've seen 'em all
'Til we've seen 'em all

So what else could you ask for?
You don't even need a passport
To see the whole world from our living room
So come on hitch your wagon
To the happiness I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you

It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home---
