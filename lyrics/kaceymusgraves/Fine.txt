I pick those tomatoes we grew off the vine
They look out the window just in time
I reach for the phone just to make sure it's on
And I'm fine
I put on my makeup for no one at all
My heels on the hardwood echo down the hall
I open the wardrobe, put my face in your clothes
And I'm fine

I try to sleep, I just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

Just like the circus, you always leave town
I can't help but cry when that big top comes down
But I leave the light on and when you get back home
We'll be fine

And I'll try to sleep but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

They always say you don't get to choose
The same old cliche, love chooses you
So baby I'll wait just like I always do

And I'll try to sleep, but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine---
