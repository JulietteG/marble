Look around you, look down the bar from you
At the faces that you see
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
These are your friends, but are they real friends?
Do they love you as much as me?
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
You seem in such a hurry
To leave this kind of life
And you cause so many things
Misery

So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-bes
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

Please don't let my tears persuade you
I'd hoped I wouldn't cry
Although lately teardrops seem a part of me

So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-bes
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?---
