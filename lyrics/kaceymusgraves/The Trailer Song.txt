You say that youre watching the birds out the window
Well Ive got a bird you can watch
You aint gotta act like youre borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
Whats it to you if its Wednesday at noon
and Ive traded my iced tea for scotch

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we aint friends were just neighbors
Nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

You aint gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwears on the line
It aint mine
I aint gonna ask whose been mowing your grass
So you aint gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your many blinds

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we aint friends were just neighbors
There aint nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

Dont ask me if I go to church
I wont ask if your husbands still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street

So keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we aint friends were just neighbors
There aint nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
There aint nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer ---
