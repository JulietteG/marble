If you save yourself for marriage
You're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage
You're a whore-able person
If you won't have a drink
Then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk 
As soon as you down the first one

If you can't lose the weight
Then you're just fat
But if you lose too much
Then you're on crack
You're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
So you might as well just do
Whatever you want
So

Make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow 
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow 
Wherever it points

If you don't go to church
You'll go to hell
If you're the first one 
On the front row
You're self-righteous
Son of a-
Can't win for losing
You just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em
Don't mean you should join 'em

So make lots of noise
And kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow 
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow 
Wherever it points

Say what you think
Love who you love
'Cause you just get 
So many trips around the sun, yeah
You only
Only live once

So make lots of noise
And kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow 
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow 
Wherever it points---Lyrics submitted by Audrey Tombaugh.
