Maybe your jacket is a hand-me-down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares, maybe you're just round

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it bitter, some like it sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
Aww, you can't be everybody's cup of tea

Maybe you're working in a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it bitter, some like it sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please

Maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail or maybe you failed
Out of college, but hey, life goes on
We've all got the right to be wrong

Aww, you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black, some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please

Aww, you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it bitter, some like it sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite,
So you might as well just make it how you please
Aww, you can't be everybody's cup of tea

Why would you want to be?---
