I don't need a membership to validate
The hard work I put in and the dues I paid
Never been to good at just goin' along
I guess I've always kind of been for the underdog

Favors for friends will get you in and get you far
Shouldn't be about who it is you know
But about how good you are

Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you but no thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club

There's a million ways to dream and that's just fine
Oh but I ain't losin' any sleep at night
And if I end up goin' down in flames
Well at least I know I did it my own way

Favors for friends will get you in and get you far
But when did it become about who you know
And not about how good you are?

Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you but no thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
I don't wanna be a part of your good ol' boys club---
