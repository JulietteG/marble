Plays you like a fiddle
Shakes you like a rattle
Takes away your gun
And sends you into battle
Huffs and it puffs
'Til it blows your house down
And you don't know your heart
From a hole in the ground

Oh whoa oh whoa
Oh whoa oh whoa

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

Girl meets boy
And boy he's a looker
Can't separate the salt from the sugar
There's nothing in your pockets
There's footprints on your face
You can't tell anymore
If you're the rabbit or the snake
Hey!

Oh whoa oh whoa
Oh whoa oh whoa

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

I drink to feel
I smoke to breathe
Just look what love
Has done to me

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking so damn
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid---
