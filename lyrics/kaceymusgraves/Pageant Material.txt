There's certain things you're s'posed to know
When you're a girl who grows up in the south
I try to use my common sense
But my foot always ends up in my mouth
And if I had to walk a runway in high heels in front of the whole town
I'd fall down
And my mama cried
When she realized

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me
Life ain't always roses and pantyhose
And...

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

I ain't pageant material
The only crown is in my glass
They won't be handin' me a sash
And that's okay, cause there's no way
You'll ever see me in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't
Yeah I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't---
