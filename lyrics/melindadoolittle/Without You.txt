Open my eyes, sit up in bed
Remember all the things you said
Sticks and stones can break the bones
And words can leave you there for dead

Look in the mirror for the first time
Seeing the girl you left behind 
You think you've won, you think I'm done
You never knew the strength I'd find

I've made up my mind now
There'll be no crying over you 
I thought you should know that 
I will be just fine without you
I'll be fine - without you, without you

Get in my car, go down the road
I'm not the girl I was before
I'm on my own, but not alone
So glad you walked right out the door

I've made up my mind now
There'll be no crying over you 
I thought you should know that 
I will be just fine without you

I'll be fine without you, without you, without you 
I'll be fine without you, without you, without you 

I've made up my mind now
There'll be no crying over you 
I thought you should know that 
I will be just fine without you
--Repeat Chorus x 2--

I'll be fine without you 
I'll be fine without you
Without you---Lyrics submitted by TEAMMD.
