Stars on the river
Stars in the sky
Stars that are falling
Stars burning bright
Stars disappearing
Stars come to light out of the dark

I see stars in every headlight
And I wonder where they go
I see stars that are stranded by the side of the road
I see stars that look like raindrops sticking to the hood of my car
I'm seeing stars

Wishing on stars
Only when you see 'em
Is like asking God for help
Only when you need it
But I'm wishing anyway
I'm wishing anyway
Wishing on stars
Only when you see 'em
Is like asking God for help
Only when you need it
But I'm wishing anyway
I'm wishing anyway

Tonight there's stars on the river
Stars in the sky
Stars that are faded like the stars in her eyes
One lonely tear drop
One long goodbye
Hit me hard
I'm seeing stars

Wishing on stars
Only when you see 'em
Is like asking God for help
Only when you need it
But I'm wishing anyway
I'm wishing anyway

I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars
(Stars on the river, stars in the sky)
I'm seeing stars
(Stars that are faded, stars in her eyes, I'm seeing stars)---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
