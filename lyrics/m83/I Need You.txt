I fear it, you're after the feeling
And I am all alone
Hold to call the feeling senile
They unwrap the more
Going out the dusty roads
We are caught and see it

I need you

There's a reason after all
For the fields that I have gone
Pump the blood and leave it alone
Far away take me

See it all
Just go and solve it all---
