I woke up stronger than ever.
Driven by big waves of fire.
To run and yell all the way.
Nothing can hurt me today.

There's a magic inside.
Just waiting to burst out.
The world is a goldmine.
That will melt tomorrow.

I just can't recognize myself.
Tears of joy run all over my face.
My sensations reach the limit.
Nothing can hurt me today.

There's a magic inside.
Just waiting to burst out.
There world is a goldmine.
That will melt tomorrow.

Living for, living for a thrill...
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!
Just waiting! Just waiting!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
