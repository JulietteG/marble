Taking a foreign flight
Looking for signs of life
When you flashed upon my screen
Testing the atmosphere
Your silhouette appears
And I know I'm not alone

But empty haze
Is all that remains
I'm lost on the sidewalk
Just calling your name

I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway

I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway

Live via satellite
Checking my vital signs
Because it all feels so unreal
Everything good must end
But we can live again
In the glass simulacra

I can't replace
Your ethereal waves
I sleep on the concrete
And dream of days

I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away

I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway---
