Somewhere
Back in time
I left a part of me
I wanna see if you can try
To bring it back to me

You gotta go
Where I cry
I'm taking on the tears
I wanna see if you can try
Drink a little bit of it

No
No

Just a little lonely
Where I am
I'm ticking back in time
I wanna see if you can spot
You finally calm my head at night

I need you
No I don't
Just keep me one more time
While I try to be a friend
So it can be the end

No
No

No
No---
