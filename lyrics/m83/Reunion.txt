You came out of nowhere
Stealing my heart and brain
Flaming my every cell
You make me feel myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Will you stand in this land?
Will you stand in this land forever?

Across the time and space
A never-ending dance
A blooming and a trance
You make me feel my soul
There's no more loneliness
Only sparkles and sweat
There's no more single fate
You make me feel myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Will you stand in this land?
Will you stand in this land forever?

"My body is like a lightning rod
Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips and mine
Let's stay here forever"

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Will you stand in this land?
Will you stand in this land forever?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
