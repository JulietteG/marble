Small town, too hot
I'm going for a trip
A place where dreams are made like comic strips
I see colours and planes, laser guns and champagne
I feel strong and smart, ready for a new start
It got me too

And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
What it makes me do
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it

So let's go and get it
Everything we've been dreaming
So let's go and get it
All the things we've been missing

Now my blood is gone
And my face is drawn
Seven legs on top
And my heart just popped
People love me though
I'm their new Rambo
This is my kingdom
A different kind of home
You got me too

And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
What it makes me do
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it

So let's go and get it
Everything we've been dreaming
So let's go and get it
All the things we've been missing

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

All you can do is keep dreaming
It's up to you, the meaning
All you can do is keep dreaming
It's up to you, the meaning

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Take me on a rollercoaster
Up and down and up and down
Ride, ride on a rollercoaster
I'm going up, I'm going down
Take me on a rollercoaster
Up and down and up and down
Ride, ride on a rollercoaster
I'm going up, I'm going down---
