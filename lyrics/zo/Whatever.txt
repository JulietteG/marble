Whatever
Whatever you
Whatever i
Whatever dream
Whatever song
Whatever heals
Whatever feels right.

Whatever up
Whatever down
Whatever god
Whatever fix
Whatever need
Whatever i want.

And all the spiders in my mind
And all the things we never said.
Maybe the last day of my life
When i look at the world
Through the blue of your eyes,
Through the hole in your heart

Whatever peace
Whatever war
Whatever door
Whatever kiss
Whatever happens
We are the space men---
