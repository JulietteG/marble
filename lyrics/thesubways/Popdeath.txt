As you scrub away the halo
As you listen to the radio
Its always gonna be the same way
We're all hoping for a fadeaway
Can we bare to look now
As we see them fall down

And we can wait up all night
But nothings gonna change
Its just another pop death
Its on the TV all the time
This is how we change
Its just another popdeath

When I'm staring at the TV
Its like I'm looking at a memory
Its always gonna be the same way
We're all hoping for a fadeaway
Can we bare to look now
As we see them fall down

And we can wait up all night
But nothings gonna change 
Its just another popdeath
Its on the TV all the time
And this is how we change
Its just another popdeath
And we can wait up all night
Nothings gonna change 
Its just another popdeath
Its on the TV all the time
And this is how we change
Its just another popdeath

And you can care if you really want
Sing their songs when they're dead and gone
You can bleed for their tortured souls
Too much sex and rock n roll

[Solo]

And we can wait up all night
Nothings gonna change 
Its just another popdeath
Its on the TV all the time
And this is how we change
Its just another popdeath
And we can wait up all night
Nothings gonna change 
Its just another popdeath
Its on the TV all the time
And this is how we change
Its just another popdeath
Its just another popdeath
Its just another popdeath
Its just another popdeath
Its just another popdeath---Lyrics submitted by Levn Zozirashvi.
