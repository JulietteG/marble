You want someone to blame
The one who drives the rusted nail
But whos left will never care
Pretending becomes a chore
All you search for, a little piece of mind
To far, to deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

While awake
Whats still left
Sleep awaits the stranger in route
While awake
Always a stranger in route

Just this once
Listen to the words, I say
If you want, I will
Im there until the end of time

Leave the doomed behind
Search with different light
You wish trying to remember
But its all make believe

You are, you are, you are

(Why do wait for still a slave?)
Why do wait for still a slave?
Always a stranger in route

Just this once
Listen to the words, I say
If you want, I will
Im there until the end of time

Just this once
Listen to the words, I say
If you want, Im there

Just this once
Listen to the words, I say
If you want, I will
Im there until the end of time---
