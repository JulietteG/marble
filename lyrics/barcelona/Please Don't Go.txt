All those arrows you threw, you threw them away
You kept falling in love, and then one day

When you fell, you fell towards me
when you crashed in the clouds, you found me

Oh, please don't go
I want you so
I can't let go
for I lose control

Get these left-handed lovers out of your way
They look hopeful, but you, you should not stay

If you want me to break down and give you the key
I can do that, but I can't let you leave

Oh, please don't go
I want you so
I can't let go
for I lose control---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
