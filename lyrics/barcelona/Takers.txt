What makes these boys fall hard
over all the girls they have fought and won?
These kings work hard and long
just to ensure that their girls don't run

Oh no
nobody taught them to love slow
they're crying out at the streets below

(Chorus)
Why don't you stay with me?
I think you can save this beast
But I'll leave you with an empty road
Honey that's what takers do
I'm a thief, and I'll take you

What makes these monsters cry?
You can see the gold reflecting in their eyes
Yeah, their chests are heaving, skin stretched tight
greedy hands grab what feels right

Oh no
nobody taught them to let go
they don't know

Why don't you stay with me?
I think you can save this beast
But I'll leave you with an empty road
Honey that's what takers do
I'm a thief, and I'll take you

If you stayed, you would break
You're way too innocent to take
After these violent things
You still love, and I still take

Stay with me
I think you can save this beast
but I'll leave you with an empty road
Honey that's what takers do
I'll take you and you'll

Stay with me
well I think you can save this beast
But I'll leave you with an empty road
honey that's what takers do
I'm a thief, and I'll take you---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
