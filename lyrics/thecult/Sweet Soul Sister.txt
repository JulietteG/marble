All the hip young things
Trying to make a scene
Living out forbidden dreams
Star spangled banner
Flutters in the sky
Time hustles those
Who wait to die

Come on little honey
Come on now, please
Come on little honey and dance with me

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn, well
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on

Ooh, shes a dior girl
Twisting round the world
Midnight crush boogie scene
Firm fixed expression
Sensual, tender, smooth
Sexual panther, beautifully cool

Come on little honey
Come on now, please
Come on little honey and dance with me

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn, well, well, well, well
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on, yeah

Hustle and strut through paris at night
Hustle and strut
Hustle and strut through paris at night
Hustle and strut
Say na na na
Say na na na, yeah

City of sin
Come and let me in
City of sin
Come and let me in, ow

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on, yeah---Lyrics submitted by John.
