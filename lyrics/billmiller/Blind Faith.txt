Walk out into the streets
Tell everyone you meet, theyre dying
Does anyone really know
where the soul and spirit goes? Youre dying.
And ahhhh, youre dying.
And ahhhh, youre dying.

Now is the time and place
to look life in the face.
Youre dying
Sell everything you own,
Go walk out on your own.
Youre dying.

And ahhhh, youre dying.

So take a look around
See every sight; hear every sound.
Its all grace.
Though all things have a reason,
Their own time and their own season,
Their own place,
Any moment it could change
Like the sun turns into rain.

Blind faith.

So take a look around
Hear every sight; See every sound.
Its all grace.
Though all things have a reason
Their own time and their own season,
Their own place.
Any moment it could change
LIke the sun turns into rain.

Blind faith.

Walk out into the streets
Tell everyone you meet, theyre dying.---Lyrics submitted by Valerie Grimes.
