There is distance between us making me feel like
I'm about to take a bus, plane, train or bike
Just so I can have you right by my side
Even if it's only for one night, oh
I can't help it, I'm enamored by you
I can't wait to explore
Your touch, your kiss, where's the door?
Gotta find a way to you, eh
I gotta get to you
I'm gonna get there right away
I can't wait to see you again, yeah
(I gotta get to you)
When I see you, I'm not letting go
Never gonna leave you again, no
(I gotta get to you, you)
Everything that's in the way
Still nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna keep me from you
(I gotta get to you, you)
Yeah, I gotta get to you
(You, you)
I gotta get to you
I gotta get to you
This is too much to handle and I can't breathe right
Keep looking at my watch getting so uptight
I just wanna get there looking in your eyes
Even if it's only for a night, oh
I can't imagine, what we're 'bout to feel
Everything in my body tells me that this is real
Your lips, your hands, almost there
Gotta find a way to you, eh
I gotta get to you
I'm gonna get there right away
I can't wait to see you again, yeah
(I gotta get to you)
When I see you, I'm not letting go
Never gonna leave you again, no
(I gotta get to you, you)
Everything that's in the way
Still nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna keep me from you
(I gotta get to you, you)
Yeah, I gotta get to you
(You, you)
I gotta get to you
I gotta get to you
(You're all I want)
And I can't wait to get to you
(I, I, I, I)
Oh, I can't wait
(Gotta find a way to you)
I gotta get to you
(I gotta get to you)
I'm gonna get there right away, eh
And I can't wait to get to you
(I gotta get to you)
Oh, when you see me, I'm not letting go
Never never, no
(I gotta get to you, you)
Everything that's in the way
Still nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna keep me from you
(I gotta get to you, you)
Gotta get to you, babe
(You, you)
Gotta get to you
Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah
(I gotta get to you)
I'm gonna get there right away, eh
And I can't wait to see you again
(I gotta get to you)
Ooh, I'm not letting go
Eh, yeah, yeah
(I gotta get to you, you)
Everything that's in the way
Still nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna keep me from you
(I gotta get to you, you)
I gotta get to you
(You, you)
I gotta get to you
Gotta get to you---Lyrics submitted by remy.
