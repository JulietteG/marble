Verse
Lady love, come on listen to me.
I know you wanna turn away.
All that we been through
I'll never give up lovin you
so wont you give me one more chance
For romance and I'll show......

(More love, than you've ever known)
Straighten it out and make love the way it should be.
(One thing for sure love, the love we have will grow)
And if first you dont succeed, you got to love again.
just let me be

(chorus 2)

Baby love, if you sacrifice one minute to hear what i have to say

And the love i have for you wont disappear no,no......let me show you!

(More love, than you've ever known)
Straighten it out and make love the way it should be. oh yes.
(One thing for sure love, the love we have will grow)
And if first you dont succeed, you got to love again.
let me show you!
