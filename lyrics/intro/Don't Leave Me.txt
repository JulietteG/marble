(Talking Intro)

Hey baby
shhhhhhh
you dont have to say it,
i know, i know i havent been
there for you lately....Im sorry.
Its not that im runnin out on you.
i wanna be into you.....your all that i want,
your all that i need....so please.....
Dont Leave Me.....


Dont leave meeeeeee....heeeeeeyyy....

We were in love and now you tell me that you wanna turn and walk away.
All of my sunshine and happiness, turned to rainy days.
How could you be in love so strong, and throw it all away. 
Promise to love me never to leave me, forever and a day!

(chorus 1)
Sometimes I feel that im lost with out you lost without your love.
Sometimes i feel like im goin under, theres no one above you.
Sometimes i feel that i just dont know the words i need to say.
Dont you ever go away....baby dont leave me.....
(chorus 2)
Your all that i want
your all that i need 
and i just cant live 
without you baby 
dont leave me..
dont leave me.
(Repeat one time)

You know i need you in my life like a flower needs the rain.
I want you by my side, to keep my heart from pain....yes
No need for promises, no need for sympathy. all that i hope for
all that i pray for is......that you stay with me.....
