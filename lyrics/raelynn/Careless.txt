A relationship is a 50/50 thing
I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

If I had a hand that didn't want a ring
You wouldn't be cool with a five-month fling, yeah
What we have is just a rush, yeah
Just a touch but not enough

I let my heart out and then you wigged out
I gave my all to you, but if I said "see ya"
Just like that, would you be back?
All looking sad and trying to last

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

Whoa, a little more

Maybe I should care less and be careless
Maybe I should care less and be careless
Maybe I should care less and be careless

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone, yeah
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

Whoa, a little more
Yeah, yeah---
