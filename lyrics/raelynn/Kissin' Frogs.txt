I'm too young to think about forever
I'm just thinkin' 'bout this Friday night
I love not knowin' where we're going
And dancin' with the boy I kinda like

I want to make all my mistakes
While I'm young enough to make
Them once or twice
Or maybe three times

Cause I ain't looking for my
Prince Charming on a horse,
No once upon a time ain't
Where I'm at
Yeah I don't need a mr, tryin'
To fit that perfect slipper
On my foot there's always time for that

So I'm gonna spend all summer long
Sittin' on this river log,
Cause right now there ain't nothing
Wrong with having fun and
Kissin frogs

Right now the only thing that matters
Is the raidio and cherry lip gloss on
I'm happy without happy ever after
Yeah, a little makin' out don't hurt
No one

I wanna have a little fun
Someday I'm gonna find the one that's right
But not tonight

Cause I ain't looking for my
Prince Charming on a horse,
No once upon a time ain't
Where I'm at
Yeah I don't need a mr, tryin'
To fit that perfect slipper
On my foot there's always time for that

So I'm gonna spend all summer long
Sittin' on this river log,
Cause right now there ain't nothing
Wrong with having fun and
Kissin frogs

Yeah, kissin frogs

I want to make all my mistakes
While I'm young enough to make
Them once or twice
Or maybe three times

Cause I ain't looking for my
Prince Charming on a horse,
No once upon a time ain't
Where I'm at
Yeah I don't need a mr, tryin'
To fit that perfect slipper
On my foot there's always time for that

So I'm gonna spend all summer long
Sittin' on this river log,
Cause right now there ain't nothing
Wrong with having fun and
Kissin frogs

Yeah, I'm gonna spend all summer long
Sittin' on this river log,
Cause right now there ain't nothing
Wrong with having fun and
Kissin frogs---
