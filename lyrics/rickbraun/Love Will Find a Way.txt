There was a time
When our love flowed like water.
Nothing came between us.
Two hearts beat as one.

And over the years
We couldn't find the answers
To the many questions
That were pulling us apart.

Say that love will find a way
And I believe in that today.
So if I have to let you go,
I will do it.

As far as I can see
You still belong right here with me.

Love will find a way.

Bird and a fish
Will never live together.
No matter how they try,
They will never find common ground.

So if freedom
So if freedom is the answer,
Then I'll have to wish you well.
Maybe one day you'll turn around.

Say that love will find a way.
And I believe in that today.
So if I have to let you go,
I will do it.

As far as I can see
You still belong right here with me.

Love will find a way.
I believe in that today.
So if I have to let you go,
I will do it.

As far as I can see
You still belong right here with me.

Love will find a way.
Love will find a way.
Love will find a way.---Lyrics submitted by William Crouse.
