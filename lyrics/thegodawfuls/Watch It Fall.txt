Complacent working class get up and off your ass 
You say you'd die for freedom but the riot never comes
We need a revolution,
A social evolution
The socialites who wave the flag are holding smoking guns 
They say we have to fight, 
Unite!!, Unite!!, Unite!!
The same old men defile the earth and take away our rights 
The rules should more than bend, their world is gonna end 
'Cause I'm not going down a pawn in a global class war 

Chorus
We are the ones with the power to devour one and all 
Tear down the old foundation brick by brick and watch it fall

So damn us into hell with stories that you tell 
the time is now, the door is here, pass through it and you're free 
the rules should more than bend, 
their world is gonna end 
I'm not going down a pawn in a global class war

Chorus
We are the ones with the power to devour one and all 
Tear down the old foundation brick by brick and watch it fall

Solo

Chorus x3
We are the ones with the power to devour one and all 
Tear down the old foundation brick by brick and watch it fall---
