tirimigatiritoutou tigareritou tebaruparirupei tiropirouy tediridoudurou x2

Here we go.
tirimigatiritoutou tigareritou tebaruparirupei tiropirouy tediridoudurou x4

Thats it.

That's all there is to it.

Alright everybody now here we go.
It's a brand new version of the dosido.
Just stomp your feet and clap your hands.
Come on everybody its the hamster dance.
Bounce in time to the beat.
Hey You don't even have to move your feet.
Just shake your thang; let me see you move.
Now spin it around and feel the groove.

YEEHAA!!

Lets try it.

tirimigatiritoutou tigareritou tebaruparirupei tiropirouy tediridoudurou x3
You're catching on.

YEEHAA!!
Terrific.

Come on everybody.

Clap your hands.
Come on everybody.

It's the hamster dance.
Come on everybody.

Let's Clap you hands.
Come on everybody.

It's the hamster dance.

Here comes the music.---Lyrics submitted by manganmore.blogspot.com.
