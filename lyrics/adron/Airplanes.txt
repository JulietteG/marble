Verse 1:
Lookin up can be so fancy free.
Sideways is best ways
'Cause thats where youll be.

Chorus:
Airplanes goin by 
Airplanes in the sky
Airplanes goin by
Airplanes in the sky-y-y

Verse 2:
I see an airplane;
It dont see me.
You see us both as 
You laugh quietly.

Chorus

Verse 3:
They look kinda like animals
But the kind you cant handle.
Theyre kind of invincible,
But not really 'cause they explode 
All the time.

Verse 4:
Sometimes it's best 
When watching above. 
You might notice the contrails 
But not what they're made of. 

Chorus
