I can't love your eyes (Its all your fault) 
I'm pushing back for more (As time flies by you wait for it) 
And they paralyse (And for anything at all) 
I can't let you in (Lets break away tonight) 
Because that means that you win (The sands gone from the hourglass). 
And its forever (We're free at last) 

You're not the one to blame for this at all 
Must have burnt this down, ashes all around 
What were the questions that you had for me? 
I couldn't solve it all, so just let it be 

Waiting awake by the window and 
In my heart answers in the form of a question: 
Why don't we all end this with the quickness of breaking down the glass? 
Now your waiting and I am ready. 

Seasons are constantly changing 
(Waking up, waking up to your eyes) 
Time that we seem to be wasting 
(You cut me out; you cut me out completely this time.) 
Making up, breaking up for the last time (Time wont wait) 
The reflection of, your life tells me you're sleeping (Life wont wait) 
Runaway, run from this 
Cant be, cant be real. 
[x2] 

I can't love your eyes (And all you are) 
I'm pushing back for more (Are the mistakes that you make always) 
And they paralyse (When everything's all wrong) 
I can't let you in (Lets waste away tonight) 
Because that means that you win (The sands gone from the hourglass) 
And its forever (Our time has passed) 

You're not the one to blame for this at all 
Must have burnt this down, ashes all around 
What were the questions that you had for me? 
I couldn't solve it all, so just let it be 

Fingers that tap the windowpane 
Are to numb. Numb for you to feel the real pain 
The kind that waits in me 
Wanting something more than what this life has brought to me 
Now I'm running, now I'm running 

Seasons are constantly changing 
(Waking up, waking up to your eyes) 
Time that we seem to be wasting 
(You cut me out; you cut me out completely this time.) 
Making up, breaking up for the last time (Time wont wait) 
The reflection of, your life tells me you're sleeping (Life wont wait) 
Runaway, run from this 
Cant be, cant be real. 

Seasons are constantly changing 
Time that we seem to be wasting 
I'm leaving now (Time won't wait) 
Don't forget (Life won't wait)---Lyrics submitted by Kla.
