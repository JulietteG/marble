Sunshine.                                                              (Choir)
Sunshine, on my mind.
Looking for the perfect place to find.
Paradise.
On the beach. Dialing in for sun thats out of reach.
From the world. 
Gimmie yayayah                                                  (Choir)
Theres a place for you and me.
Gimmie yayayah                                                  (Choir)
 On the sand beside the sea.

What I need is sunshine, everyday some sunshine. I wanna feel the heat. Dance to the Soca beat.
What I need is sunshine, everyday some sunshine. I wanna run away from all the cloudy days.
What I need is sunshine.
Sunshine.                                                              (Choir)
 Makes the perfect world go round, and round. And you will see. 
Sunshine.
Sunshine.                                                              (Choir)
 Makes your body feel so free, so free. Come there with me.

Every day, Im dreaming how Im gonna get away, from this place.
 I know why.
 I have to find my freedom in some place, in the sky.
Gimmie yayayah                                                  (Choir)

Well dance until the light.

What I need is sunshine, everyday some sunshine. I wanna feel the heat. Dance to the Soca beat.
What I need is sunshine, everyday some sunshine. I wanna run away, from all the cloudy days.
What I need is sunshine.

Makes your body feel so free, so free. Come there with me.

Sun is shining everywhere and you can feel the groove. Listen to the Soca sound. It makes your body move. Leave the rain and snow behind cause now its party time. Sun, sun-shine.
