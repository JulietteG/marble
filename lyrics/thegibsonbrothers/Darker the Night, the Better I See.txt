Verse 1:
Ive honky tonked most all my life
My day begins at the end of night
I stay up late it dont bother me
The darker the night the darker the night
The better I see.

Chorus:
The lights I love are the lights of town
I thank the Lord above when the sun goes down
I find a shady spot and thats where Ill be
The darker the night the darker the night
The better I see.
(Last time ending)
You heard me right the darker the night
The better I see.

Verse 2:
My hit parade has a bad recourse
I guarantee that ya wont get bored
It starts getting good about a quarter til 3
The darker the night the darker the night
The better I see.

Instrumental

Verse 3:
I rest my case at the break of day
What some call work brother I call play
Cause I once was blind but now Im free
The darker the night the darker the night
The better I see.---Lyrics submitted by Mary McAfee.
