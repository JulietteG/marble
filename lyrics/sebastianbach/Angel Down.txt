Waiting for
For the battle cry
I took you into hell
Step aside, hide
Now I know
Lost souls looking dead
Without anything and nothing to say

Angel Down
Angel Down from the barrel of a gun

I don't feel the same today
This soothing makes me very afraid

Paint your eyes and bite your tongue
Fake lies I can't hear ya
Wrapped in lies, bathed in truth
If I could see I'd see nothing

I don't feel the same today
This soothing makes me very afraid

Paint your eyes and bite your tongue
Fake lies I can't hear ya
Wrapped in lies, bathed in truth
If I could see I'd see nothing---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
