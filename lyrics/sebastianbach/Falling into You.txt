Here I am
Slippin' back in time
Starin' in your eyes
Like it's all the same

Look at you
You haven't changed at all
The devil's deja vu
Has lead me down
and back into this deadly fall

You take me
Break me
Build me up and then forsake me
Our love is my world
Then you cut me down with one word
Strung out, it's true
Try to run but I'm falling into you
You're the devil's deja vu

Bring it on
Bend my will again
Undress the story's end
And make this heart believe

There's a light
In the darkness of my mind
Hangin' by a thread
Like a spider
Spinnin' out a brand new web

You take me
Break me
Build me up and then forsake me
Our love is my world
Then you cut me down with one word
Strung out, it's true
Try to run but I'm falling into you

Think about me
My love is your salvation
Taste my mind
Give in to all temptation
Embrace complete destruction
Wait wait wait wait wait wait

You take me
Break me
Build me up and then forsake me
Our love is my world
Then you cut me down with one word
Strung out, it's true
Try to run but I'm falling into you
You're the devil's deja vu---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
