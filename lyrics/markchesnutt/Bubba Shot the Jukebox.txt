We were all down out Margie's bar
Telling stories if we had one
Someone fired the whole jukebox up
the song, it sure was a sad one
a teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose
from the pain the song was inflicting
and all at once he jumped to his feet
just like somebody kicked him

Bubba shot the jukebox, last night
said it played a sad song, it made him cry
went to his truck and got a .45
Bubba shot the jukebox, last night

Bubba ain't never been accused
of being mentally stable
so we did not draw any easy breath
'til he laid that colt on the table
he hung his head 'til the cops showed up
and dragged him right out of Margie's
they told him don't you play dumb with us son
you know damn well what the charge is

Bubba shot the jukebox, last night
said it played a sad song, it made him cry
went to his truck and got a .45
Bubba shot the jukebox, last night

well the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
the confrontation was a tense one
he shook his head and said bubba boy
you was always a dense one
Now reckless discharge of a gun
that's what the officers are claiming
Bubba hollered "ah, reckless hell!"
"I hit just where I was aiming"

Bubba shot the jukebox, last night
said it played a sad song, it made him cry
went to his truck and got a .45
well he shot the juke box
stomped through it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox, last night

Well, he could not tell right from wrong
through the teardrops in his eyes
beyond the shadow of a doubt
it was a justifiable homicide

Bubba shot the jukebox
Stomped through it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox, last night..---Lyrics submitted by Morgan Dawson.
