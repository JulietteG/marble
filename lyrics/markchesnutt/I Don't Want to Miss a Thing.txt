I could stay awake just to hear you breathing watch you smiling while your sleeping while your far away and dreaming i could spend my life in this sweet surrender i could stay lost in this momment forever and every momment spent with you is a momment i treasure 

I don't wanna  my eyes i don't wanna fall asleep cause i miss you and i dont wanna miss a thing cause even when i dream of you the sweetest dreams will never do cause i still miss you babe and i dont wanna miss a thing

lying close to you feeling your heart beating and i'm wondering what your dreaming wondering if its me your seeing so i kiss your eyes and thank god were together i just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

i dont wanna close my eyes i don't wanna fall asleep cause i miss you babe and i  don't wanna miss a thing cause even when i dream of you the sweetest dream would never do  i still miss you babe 

i dont wanna miss one smile i dont wanna miss one kiss i just wanna be with you right here with you just like this i just wanna hold you close and feel  your heart so close to mine and just stay here in  this momment for the rest of time

i dont wanna close my eyes i don't wanna close my eyes cause i miss you babe and i don't wanna miss  a thing.---Lyrics submitted by Creston.
