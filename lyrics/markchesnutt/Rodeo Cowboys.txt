She was a pretty young lady and I thought she was crazy,
to fall for a rambler like me.
A rodeo cowboy but I saw in those blue eyes,
the young man I wanted to be.
She said I looked handsome, and if I was lonesome,
in her empty arms I could stay.
And a rodeo cowboy spent one night in heaven,
and a lady stole one heart away.

Rodeo cowboys and pretty young ladies
don't go together to well.
I knew the chances were just about hopeless,
right from the moment I fell.
She was looking to buy her a peice of the future,
a cowboy's got nothing to sell.
Rodeo cowboys and pretty young ladies
don't go together to well.

I don't regret it and I'll never fotget it.
We all have the right to our dreams.
It took a wild chance, on a paper back romance.
But it wasn't the way that it seems.
Nobody's dying, and nobody's crying.
My heart is back on the mend.
And a rodeo cowboy will always be looking,
for that pretty young lady again.

Rodeo cowboys and pretty young ladies
don't go together to well.
I knew the chances were just about hopeless,
right from the moment I fell.
She was looking to buy her a peice of the future,
a cowboy's got nothing to sell.
Rodeo cowboys and pretty young ladies
don't go together to well.

Rodeo cowboys and pretty young ladies
don't go together to well.---Lyrics submitted by Faye.
