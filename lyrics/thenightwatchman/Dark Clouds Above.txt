Never listened to the pain
Never listened to fortune or fame
Never listened to eagle or dove
Never listened to anger or love
But I listen to the dark clouds above
Never answered to the call
Never answered to nothing at all
Never answered when times got rough
Never answered to anger or love
But I answer to the dark clouds above
Never waited for dollar or sign
Never waited for signal or sign
Never waited when
They screamed enough
Never waited on anger or love
But I'm waiting 
For the dark clouds above---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
