It started in basements
And it started in sheds
It started in backyards
And was hidden under beds
I turned on the TV
Dont believe a word they say
We cant stay here
And we cant get away
There's a riot on Sunset
And fires burn in the park
The sun has set my friend 
And California's dark
And over the screaming
I heard a clear voice
I looked at my choices
And I made a choice
Smoke and ashes 
Tonight hide the stars
The stop lights are red now, love
We've come for what's ours
There's a riot on Sunset 
And fires burn in the park
The sun has st my friend
And California's dark
Come stand among the rattlesnakes
At the side of the desert road 
And close your eyes and listen 
To the music hard and cold
Tonight the moon is blackened 
Tonight the dorrs are shut 
Behind the shuttered windows 
We pray the sun will come up
For something walks
Across these fields
For which there is no name
You might have hear different 
But I was there when it came
it will start with a spark 
And a great fire will grow
Dont know how I know it
But I just know
There's a riot on Sunset
And fires burn in the park
The sets everywhere
And the whole damn country's dark
There's a riot on Sunset 
And fires burn in the park
The sun has set my friend
And California's dark---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
