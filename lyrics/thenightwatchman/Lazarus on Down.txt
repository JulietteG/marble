I been tearin'
And I've been torn
The temple steps
Are smooth and worn
What Judas been doin'
There ain't no knowin'
On the olive vines 
Somthin' different's growin'
Lazarus on down
Lazarus on down
Let's push on through
Nah, let's go around
Lazarus on down

One-eyed crow
Tappin' on the window pane
Little boy raised a cup 
In Caiaphas' name
In the Potter's field 
Blood beneath the tree
That money's gone, son
What's left you owe me
Lazarus on down
Lazarus on down
Let's push on through
Nah, let's turn around
Lazarus on down

Sound of thunder 
Smell of burnin' oil
What's that movin' 
Just beneath the soil
Street light's out
Dark shape on the ground
Lazarus on down

Is that hop
In the shepherd's eyes
Or just another
Little dark surprise
I'm just like you, Dad
Thin and cold
If you didn't know it
Well now you know---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
