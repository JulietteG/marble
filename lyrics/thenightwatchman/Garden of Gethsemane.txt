On th side of the dirt road
 An old Chevy wreck
 I climbed through the window
 I sat in the back
 I gathered my thoughts
 With my head in my hands
 My next of kin 
 My list of demands

 I slipped from shadow to shadow
 I saw things I should not see
 The moon rose high 
 Over the garden
 The garden of gethsemane

 I know who I'm for
 And who I'm against
 I pulled the shades tight
 I built me a fence
 I dug a tunnel
 A tunnel deep and wide
 I sit at the bottom and wait for the night

 I slipped from shadow to shadow
 I saw things I should not see
 The moon rose hiogh
 Over the garden
 The garden of gethsemane

 The morning has come
 Clean clothes on the line
 There'll be no tomarrow
 I rise and I shine
 If you swallow the coin
 From the wishing well
 Your dreams will come true
 In heaven or hell

 I slipped from shadow tro shadow
 I saw things I should not see
 The mioon rose high
 Over the garden
 The garden of gethsemane

 Take my hand 
 And down we go
 Take my hand, love
 And down we go
 Take my hand 
 And down we go
 Take my hand, love 
 And down we go---Lyrics submitted by Sydne.
