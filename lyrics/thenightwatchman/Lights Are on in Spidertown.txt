Stand Back Strom Troopers Attack
On a bright May Day 
Man I Must Be Getting Soft 
I dont know 
What do You Think Mister? 
Looks Like 10 Fat Pigs And a 9 Pig Troth
Hey 
Die
Die, Die, Die  
Die, Die, Die,
Die, Die, Die 
Hey, Hey 
Die 
Die, Die, Die 
And The Lights Are On In Spider Town
Sitting back and the Clash Of Iron Chains
Led Weights On Rope Holding Down My Hill 
I Dont Know What Do You Think Mister 
I Say We Do Anything Just To Take That Hill
I Dont Know What Do You Think Mister 
I Say We Do Anything Just To Take That Hill 
Hey
 Die
Die, Die, Die  
Die, Die, Die,
Die, Die, Die 
Hey, Hey 
Die 
Die, Die, Die 
And The Lights Are On In Spider Town
The Sky Is Falling 
Falling Down 
The Sky IS Falling Down 
The World Stops Turning 
Turning Round 
And The Lights Are On IN Spider Town
Silent Night and the Wind Catches Right 
Put A Wig ON The Heiress 
Rob The Bank and Pray 
Now I Dont Know What Do You Think Mister
Please Dont Do AS I Do 
Just Do As I Say 
Hey
 Die
Die, Die, Die  
Die, Die, Die,
Die, Die, Die 
Hey, Hey 
Die 
Die, Die, Die 
And The Lights Are On In Spider Town
Yeah The Lights Are On In Spider Town 
Hey---Lyrics submitted by Devon.
