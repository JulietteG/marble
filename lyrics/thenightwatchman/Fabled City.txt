Me And Javi Shouted Slogans In Spanish 
Like It Was Are World To Win 
Then They Moved The Plant Down Ojada
Time To Bite Your Tongue Again
Ive Seen The Fabled City 
Its Streets Are Paved With Gold 
But An Iron Fence Runs Round It
And Its Iron Gate Is Closed 
What Aint Right Aint Right 
He Told  
But Something Else Passed Behind His Eyes 
Now Hes Down Town On His Knees 
Washing Floors For Somebody 
And Quietly Biding His Time 
Ive Seen The Fabled City 
Its Streets Are Paved With Gold 
But An Iron Fence Runs Round It
And Its Iron Gate Is Closed 
At The Gas Station On Sunset and Crescent
I Met An Angel Sad And Cold
She Lived In The Alley 
Behind the Market 
Where The Shadows Could Be Hidden From The Lord 
And For A Dollar She Sings A Song 
Sounded More Like A Prayer 
I Wish That Her Dead Mother And Father 
Couldnt Look Down And See You There 
 Ive Seen The Fabled City 
Its Streets Are Paved With Gold 
But An Iron Fence Runs Round It
And Its Iron Gate Is Closed 
On A Wire Outside My Window 
There Sits 100 Swallows
And I Suspect 
That If One Flew 
99 Would Follow---Lyrics submitted by Devon.
