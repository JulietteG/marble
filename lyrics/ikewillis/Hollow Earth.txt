Up in the arctic
In the year of nineteen hundred twenty-nine
An expedition
That would settle who would find the Pole this time 
Just what Im seein
While the folks back home think Ive gone off my keel!
Evry man agreeing
That enormous mammoth they all saw was real

He must have had too much/It just cannot be so
It must have been the cold that made his mind go
He must have had too much/It just cannot be so
It must have been the cold that made his mind go

Hey, where the hell are we?/An what the hells the latitude?
We cant be seein this/So whos the joker
Cause I aint no jokin mood
Its sposed to be freezin/There aint a sign of ice in sight
And if you think its Siberia/You got another thought coming
Only one that must be right

It must be (well, I guess it must be)/I guess it must be
Cause I thought I heard Agharta crying out to me
It must be (well, I guess it must be)/I guess it must be
Still, I thought I heard Agharta crying out 
To meet me

Crying out to me

Must be some reason
Why this compass acts so strange on top of earth
Cant tell what season
It must be that place they call the Hollow Earth

The earth beneath your feet/The earth that surrounds you
The earth beneath your feet/The earth thats around you
The earth beneath your feet/The earth that surrounds you
The earth beneath your feet/The earth thats around you
The earth beneath your feet/The earth that surrounds you
The earth beneath your feet/The earth thats around you

Walter  on your new TeeVee screen/Interrupted yer program
For what they call a very special bulleteen
A disk has landed in every nation, everyland
And this reporters opinion is/
Somebody over here has overplayed their hand

It must be (well, I guess it must be)/I guess it must be
Cause I thought I heard Agharta crying out to me
It must be (well, I guess it must be)/I guess it must be
Still, I thought I heard Agharta crying out,
Crying out
Crying out
Crying out
To meet me

The earth beneath your feet
The earth crying out
To meet me

The earth beneath your feet/The earth that surrounds you
The earth beneath your feet/The earth thats around you---Lyrics submitted by Paulo.
