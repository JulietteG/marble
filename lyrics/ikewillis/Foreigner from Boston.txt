Imknown in certain circles as
The Foreigner from Boston
Im not too pretty
Seen a lotta better days
My occupation is I find em if you lost em
So dont you try to judge me
Its semi-honest and it pays
My biggest problem as a musical creation
Like that cartoon conscience
That you know is gonna come
And, technically, since Im a conscience-dumping-station
I get to ask the question
What exactly have you done?

Im in a rush,
My journey through the Styx of Kansas
Godz save the Queen 
There is no way that I could have planned this I?
No, I cant understand 
How these girls of such fame n fortune
Kidnapped at night/
Its just like a newspaper cartoon Why?
Why?

Wonderman, or Cyndi  Its so damn trendy
At least the heart is there
But the Richards and the Rogers  knucklehead dodgers
Im sure that they dont care

The leisure-suited ones have sent me on this deadly mission
To save the Queen (of all things) from the Iron Maidens clutch
This gig is Suicide and thats just what theyre wishing 
Cause now Im really threatening what I knows 
(for them) Too much
I just wish I could escape from all this silly ego
But its just not in my structure
Guess they made me much too well
But they dont even realize whats criminal or legal
The phone will ring and start the days
Excursion into hell

Im in a rush,
My journey through the Styx of Kansas
Godz save the Queen 
There is no way that I could have planned this I?
No, I cant understand 
How these girls of such fame n fortune
Kidnapped at night/
Its just like a newspaper cartoon. Why?
Why?

Macho man or Mister  grab yer little sister
Just whirl her round n dance
Cause the Foreigner is coming  
Why are you running?
You havent got a chance
