When you came in, the air went out
And ev'ry shadow, filled up with doubt
I don't know who you think you are but before the night is through
I wanna do bad things with you

I'm the kind to sit up in his room
Heartsick and eyes filled up with gloom
I don't know what you done to me, but i know this much is true
I wanna do bad things with you, Ok

(Guitar Solo)

-quietly spoken-
when you came in, the air went out
and all those shadows there, filled up with doubt

-back to normal-
I don't know who you think you are but before the night is through
I wanna do bad things with you
I wanna do real bad things with you

(Guitar Solo 2)

I don't know what you done to me but i know this much is true
I wanna do bad things with you
I wanna do real bad things with you---Lyrics submitted by Stuart.
