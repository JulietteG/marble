Late at night and all I can do 
Is walk these streets and think of you.
Time goes by but not for me,
So easy to preach, but hard to believe. 
I'm damned if I do 
And damned if I don't want you. 

To taste your lips, to touch your skin.
Pull you close and drink you in. 
I should let you go but I don't know how. 
I'm no good for you and I'm nothing without. 
Yeah, I'm damned if I do, 
But damned if I don't want you. 

It's late at night. All I can do 
Is walk these streets and dream of you. 
Yeah, I'm damned if I don't, 
Damned if I do, 
But damned if I don't want you. 

I see your face through that window pane. 
My lips don't move as I scream your name. 
I want you, my love. 
I want you. 
Call my name without a sound. 
I am on my way. 
I want you, my love.---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
