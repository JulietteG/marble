The house is quiet and you haven't called again
Are we still together?
You tell me you've been out all night with your friends
Baby i know better
It's getting ??? for you to hide behind these lies
I see the game that you running
And now you cant even look me in the eyes
You should have seen this coming
I'll be gone tomorrow
Did you get that message yet?

One more lie, i don't believe
And now I'm leaving you lonely again
And when you wake from your broken dream
I hope the pain in your world never ends
One more lie

Who's to say you are the only one to blame
I shouldn't payed more attention
I guess i never realized who you became
And its to late to erase it
And i be gone tomorrow
Oh did you get that message yet?

One more lie, i don't believe
And now I'm leaving u lonely again
And when you wake from your broken dream
I hope the pain in your world never ends
One more lie
One more lie

Oh, with one more lie, i don't believe
And now I'm leaving u lonely again
And when you wake from your broken dream
I hope the pain in your world never ends
With one more lie, i don't believe
And now I'm leaving you lonely again
And when you wake from your broken dream
I hope the pain in your world never ends
With one more lie
One more lie
One more lie
One more lie---Lyrics submitted by Joshua Fieck.
