I no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied

If the sun came up tomorrow 
And you lived in a perfect place 
That just wouldn't be good enough for you 
You could have a happy family, money, 
And the perfect face 
But that wouldn't be good enough for you 
Enough for you 

And I no I never wanna see you smile 
And I never wanna see you satisfied 
On a Sunday morning never moving on

I no I never wanna see you die 
But I never wanna see you satisfied 
Are you satisfied 

Are you satisfied how it came and went 
Satified when I pay your rent 
Will you ever regret all the things you said 
Satisfied oh 
I crashed and burned a thousand times 
Just to be your friend 
But you gave me nothing in return 
You played on my obsession for ya 
Until the bitter end 
I can't beieve I got what you deserved
What you deserve

I no I never wanna see you smile 
And I never wanna see you satisfied 
Are you satisfied 

Are you satisfied how it came and went 
Satisfied when I pay your rent 
Will you ever regret all the things you said 
Are you satisfied oh 
Are you satified in another man's bed 
Satified you left me all but dead 
How dare you ever deny all the things I did 
Satisfied ahhh 
Ohhh 

I no I never wanna see you die 
But I never wanna see you satisfied...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
