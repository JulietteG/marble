I am empty,I am done
there is nothin' wrong 
just a dry spell of the heart
you have been and you have gone
like my favorite song 
I caught the end but missed the start
you escape me one more time 
now my love feels like a crime
you ripped my world apart and leave me in the dark
          (chorus)
I know there's another side
that you nver show that I gotta find
it's not all in my mind
I'm here every night and day
I can be the one your love could save
baby you left your mark,but I'm still in the dark

I know how much you need your space
it's a lonely place
to find what you've been lookin' for
you strayed off the beaten path
and makin' your way back 
was harder than it was before
somebody got the best of you 
and left behind the rest of you
who took your heart and left you in the dark
        (chorus)
let me get this straight 
the reason why I wait
I know you've been through so much pain
baby do I wait in vain
if I could shed more light on you 
tell you what was right for you
you beauty passes,that's sure enough 
but my heart knows where to go
       (chorus x2)
I am empty,I am done---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
