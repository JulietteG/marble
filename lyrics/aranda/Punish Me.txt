Your condescending stare
You know its so unfair
I gotta ask myself why Im hanging around
This aint no good for me
Youre my insanity
I keep on wondering why Im hanging around
Baby Ill always be your fool

I bet you wanted to punish me
I know you wanted to punish me
Feels like you wanted to punish me
You got just what you wanted
I got just what I needed
You got just what you wanted from me oh Lord
And I think I like it

Our world is love and hate
Its just a twist of fate
That keeps me wondering why Im hanging around
You know Im gonna pay
For all you do and say
I keep on wondering why Im hanging around
Baby Ill always be your fool

I bet you wanted to punish me
I know you wanted to punish me
Feels like you wanted to punish me
You got just what you wanted
I got just what I needed
You got just what you wanted from me oh Lord
And I think I like it

Whatever you say, you know Ill do

I bet you wanted to punish me
I know you wanted to punish me
Feels like you wanted to punish me
You got just what you wanted
I got just what I needed
You got just what you wanted from me oh Lord
And I think I like it
And I think I like it, love it, I like it, love it, I like it love it---Lyrics submitted by Bianca.
