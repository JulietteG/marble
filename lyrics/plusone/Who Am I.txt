Who am I, that you know me by my name
That you call me friend
Invite me in to be with you
I don't know why
You love me this way
'Cause I'm nothing at all still you call
And make me new

[Chorus:]
Who am I without your love?
I cannot live without your touch
You hold my hand and
walk me through
All I need is you
Who am I without your love?
I cannot breathe without your touch
You make me complete
I bow at your feet
For me you came to die
Who am I?

You were there, creating the world
Put the stars in the sky
God of heavenly light what can I do
Now you're here, with a love
that's so real
And I give you my life as a sacrifice
To honor you
I'm overwhelmed and overcome
By what do you and all you've done
That you can count me one of your sons---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
