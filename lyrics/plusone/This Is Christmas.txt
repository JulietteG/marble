They wished upon a star
Three wise men traveled far to see
A babe who was born to be King

The dream in heavens dreams
That made the prophets words complete
And the angels begin to sing

They looked to the sky
Followed the light
Loves greatest gift
Had come to us that night

Can you feel the spirit in the air
Giving hope to people everywhere
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas
Hallelujahs echoing tonight
Now everything will be alright
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas

I know weve seen some times 
When joy has been so hard to find
And life seems to take more than faith
But we dreaming heavens dream
And finding hope within our hearts
To believe that theres more than we see

We looked to the sky
Followed the light
Loves greatest gift
Has come again tonight

Can you feel the spirit in the air
Giving hope to people everywhere
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujahs echoing tonight (tonight)
Now everything will be alright (be alright)
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas

Theres no greater gift 
Than the life that you gave 
All the hatred 
Rearrange it
Spread all the love
Spread all the love (the love, the love, the love)

Can you feel the spirit in the air (in the air)
Giving hope to people everywhere
This is Christmas
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujahs echoing tonight (tonight)
Now everything will be alright (be alright)
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas (Christmas)

Can you feel the spirit in the air 
Giving hope to people everywhere (giving hope)
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas (Christmas)
Hallelujahs echoing tonight (tonight)
Now everything will be alright (be alright)
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas

Can you feel
Can you feel the spirit in the air 
Giving hope to people everywhere (everywhere)
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas 
Hallelujahs echoing tonight (tonight)
Now everything will be alright (be alright)
Celebrate our Saviors here
This is Christmas---Lyrics submitted by john michael.
