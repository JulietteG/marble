If I close my eyes
I know you're near me
Always right there
When I need you the most

You are my shelter, my shoulder when I'm weary
But I'm the strongest man whenever you're close
With your loving, I'm something you need to know

If I could just reach a little higher
Become a little wiser I have just you to thank.
I only see clearly when you guide me succeed
When you're beside me
All I need is your helping hand
To be a little stronger than I am
A little stronger

Every step I take of this journey
I wanna share every moment with you
To know at the end of each day you will hold me
And even when it's hard to win i can't lose
Because of you this dream I'm living is true

If I could just reach a little higher
Become a little wiser I have just you to thank
I only see clearly when you guide me succeed
When you're beside me
All I need is your helping hand
To be a little stronger than I am

With your loving
I'm something and you need to know
(If I could just reach a little higher become a little wiser)
I have just you to thank
I only see clearly when you guide me succeed
When you're beside me
All I need is your helping hand
To be a little stronger than I am
To be a little stronger than I am---Lyrics submitted by Jason C.
