See you driving 'round town
with the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you! 
And forget her too! 
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that something?
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best so far
Forget you!

Well I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's an Xbox and I'm more Atari 
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
And oh she's a gold digger
Well
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
with the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you! 
I forget her too! 
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that something?
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best so far 
Forget you!

Well I know, that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.
Trying to keep ya, trying to please yaaaa
Cause being in love with you butt ain't cheap

Now I pity the fool that falls in love with you
And oh she's a gold digger
Well
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Oh, I really hate you right now.

I see you driving 'round town
with the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you! 
And forget her too! 
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that something?
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best so far
Forget you!

Now baby, baby, baby, why you, why you wanna hurt me so bad?
So bad
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me
this is one for your dad
Yes she did.
I was like oh
Why? Why? Why baby yeah
I love you
I still love you

Whoow
I see you driving 'round town
with the girl I love
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
wasn't enough I'm like 
Forget you! 
And forget her too! 
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that something?
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best so far
Forget you!
