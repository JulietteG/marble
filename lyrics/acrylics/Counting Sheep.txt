I've been tossin' and turnin'
Spent nights countin' sheep, my girl.
It's already mornin', I still can't sleep.
And it's hot in my room,
And I stuck to the sheets my girl.
I'm soaked from my head, down to my feet.

But you're here, lyin' next to me.
And the melody surrounds you, 
Encasing you in sound.
You're here, lyin' fast asleep
While the sky that hangs above you,
has been shaken to the ground.

I was restless like crazy.
And I made my mistakes, my girl.
I took every chance that I could take.
I was runnin' around town, 
When I smashed on the ground, so hard.
I got trouble believin' I'm still around.

As you would glide across the floor,
Can't deny it was graceful,
And darling, you implode.
If you had made it out the door,
You consider yourself grateful,
But you don't even want to know.

And the sound'll save you.

Ohhhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhhh, ohhhh
Go to sleep, my dear baby

You're here, lyin' down in bed,
While the dog that loves you dearly, 
Has been taken to the pound.
You sleep face down, like your dead.
These lovin' arms will hold you, 
Will only hold you down.---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
