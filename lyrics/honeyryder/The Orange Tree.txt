You laid it on the line
So gracefully
My heart was in denial
And now the sun is burning bright
So beautifully
I'm hiding from the light

And so I'll go to the Orange Tree
where the simple things in life are clear to me

And I will
stay until the morning comes
I will - wonder how I got it all wrong
Nobody knows how I feel
I'm gonna put a brave face on it
It's hard for me to climb this hill but I will
I'm coming back to where I'm from
I'm coming back to where I started
This is where I feel at home where I'll heal

My pride is in its place
And I'll keep it there
I'm done with losing face

And when I go to the Orange Tree
all the simple things in life are clear to me
