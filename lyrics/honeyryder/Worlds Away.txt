There's no ocean here between us
We're both in this room
How can I lie this close and still be
Worlds away from you

My arms are always reaching out it's
All I ever do
Another night and I'm left stranded
World's away from you

Oh I tried and tried I don't know why 
I just can't break through
I look into your eyes and I'm still
Worlds Away from you

Worlds Away
We're just strangers
Worlds Away
We can save this

Tell me how to get to where you are
Right now we're a million miles apart

It shouldn't be this complicated
This is me and you
I'll lose the little faith I have if
i can't find you soon
