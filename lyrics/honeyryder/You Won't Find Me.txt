Keep rolling down that river
You might reach the sea
I hope you find what you're looking for.
But you won't find me

It's only when I'm with you
That I feel used
I'm seeing things that I shouldn't see
i'm doing things that I shouldn't do

And now my sorry heart is aching
As I'm lying on the shore
As the salty water burns my skin
I can't take it any more

I thought that I knew you
I thought I was safe
You took away my innocence you took away my grace

I live to love another day
I live to love another day
I live to love another I live to love another
I love to live another way

You won't find me


Words have built a wall between us now
I don't see the point in talking anyhow
Every revelation gives me the motivation to begin again

Chorus

Keep rolling down that river.---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
