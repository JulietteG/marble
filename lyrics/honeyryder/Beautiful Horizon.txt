Where I'm going seems so far away
Like a distant sound
I'm not thinking of yesterday
I can't change that now

Life had got me thinking the times when I was sinking
I knew that this was right for me somehow
Forgetting all my troubles
Gotta find a way to be happy

Because every day I walk the wire
Far away from home following my heart's desire
And if the sky turns grey inside I'm smiling on my own
Out there on the road, who knows what I'll be finding its a 
Beautiful Horizon

Like a flower I lean
To the sun
i know the best is to come
I'm on the road and I belong here roaming free
There's nothing stopping me

Bridge
