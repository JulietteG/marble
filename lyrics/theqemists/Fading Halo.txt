I see the thorn in your side, Its bigger than I ever knew, 
Consuming all your pride, Splits you right up into two, 
No dancing in the night, Through the hole its pulling you, 
Gotta keep up the fight.

Fading halo, crashing to the floor, 
Fading halo, there must be something more

Bigger than I, I 
Bigger than I, I
Bigger than I, I, I, I ever knew

I see the thorn in your side, Its bigger than I ever knew, 
Consuming all your pride, Splits you right up into two, 
No dancing in the night, Through the hole its pulling you, 
Gotta keep up the fight.

Fading halo, crashing to the floor, 
Fading halo, there must be something more

Fading halo, crashing to the floor, 
Fading halo, there must be something more

Bigger than I, I 
Bigger than I, I
Bigger than I, I, I, I ever knew

I see the thorn in your side, Its bigger than I ever knew, 
Consuming all your pride, Splits you right up into two, 
No dancing in the night, Through the hole its pulling you, 
Gotta keep up the fight.

Fading halo, crashing to the floor, 
Fading halo, there must be something more---Lyrics submitted by Totsie.
