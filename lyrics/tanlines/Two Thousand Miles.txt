Maybe you wanna know, we will
Maybe you wanna know how it was
Maybe I'm not going anywhere
For a long time

The stars are real
Just look at the rainbows
Two thousand miles away
Many more to go
You ain't seen nothing yet
No, you ain't seen nothing yet

So why don't we
I'll go with you anywhere
When I already know the answer
It's the question I repeat, question I repeat, question I repeat

No, you ain't seen nothing yet
No, you ain't seen nothing yet---
