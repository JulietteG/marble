Was I running backwards, or was it all just a dream?
It was a beautiful morning, it was all I could see
Should I ask her when it's over, should I ask her to take it slow?
I don't know
I should offer an anecdote about some place I used to go
My MO

It's you, sometimes, it's you
It's you, sometimes, it's you, it's you
Babe it's true, sometimes, it's true sometimes
True, sometimes, it's true sometimes, it's true

We were just born slipping, slipping away
We were just born slipping, slipping away
We were just born slipping

Am I running backwards, or am I just asleep?
And I'm right in the middle, of a beautiful dream
You were listing all the stuff that's cool, asking me to take it slow
But I don't know
And I'm looking for an anecdote, something to speed it up or make it slow
Before you know---
