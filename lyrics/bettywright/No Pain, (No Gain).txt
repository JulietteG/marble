Ooh...ooh...ooh...

My baby and are back together again
Lovin' is better than it's ever been
If it weren't for the trials we've been through
I'd never have the courage to come back to you

We're all entitled to make a mistake
We got to prepare for some heartbreak
I as earnin' my man, while I was learnin' my man
Something you young girls might not understand

No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain], no
No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]

There was an old lady sittin' under a tree
She called me over and she said to me
My days left here may not be long
I wouldn't waste my time tellin' you nothin' wrong

But love is a flower that needs the sun and the rain
A little bit of pleasure's worth a whole lot of pain
If you learn this secret, how to forgive
A longer and better life you'll live'

No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain], mmm
No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]

Anything worth havin' at all
Is worth workin' for and waitin' for
Some of my closest friends
Have thought they had their thing on a string
Just cause that man was bringin' em flowers and candy and all kinds of gifts
Mmm, mmm, honey
Some gifts are just to make him feel better while he's on his guilt trip
About the night before
You know what I mean
Especially when you know you haven't been doin' the things you should do
Think about it
What is the man tryin' to tell you
Sometimes flowers mean Maybe we should just be friends'
Do you get my drift
Hang if you can hang
No pain, no gain

In order to get something
You got to give something
In order to be something
You got to go through something

Be a cook in the kitchen, a lady in the streets
You can't show your teeth to every guy you meet
It's alright to be a little sweet
But be a mama with the kids and you know what in the sheets

No pain [No pain]
No pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]

See, you can't give up cause times get hard
It's just that old evil devil trying to keep us apart
Say devil you ain't getting nothin' here
I'm holding on to my man and have no fear

No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain], oh
No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]

See you can't give up cause times get hard
It's just that old devil tryin' keep us apart
Say devil, you ain't got nothin' here
I'm holdin' to my man, and have no fear

No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]
No-no pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]

Oh, no pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]
No-no-no-no pain [No pain, no pain], no-no-no-no-no-no-no pain [No gain]
No-no pain, no-no pain [No pain], no-no pain [No pain], no pain [No gain], no pain

No pain [No pain, no pain, no gain]
In order to get something [No pain], give something [No pain]
To be something [No gain] you got to go through something
[No pain, no pain, no gain]

Oh...no pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no [No pain]
No-no-no-no [No pain, no gain]

No...no pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]
You're really not to gain anything [No pain, no pain]
Without [No gain] goin' through some pain

No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No-no [No gain]

[No pain, no pain, no gain]
No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No pain [No gain], no gain, no pain, no gain

Get something [No pain, no pain]
You got to go through something [No gain]
No pain [No pain], no pain [No pain]
No gain [No gain]

Hear me when I say no pain, no gain [No pain], no pain, no gain [No pain]
No pain, no gain [No gain]---Lyrics submitted by blue.
