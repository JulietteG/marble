Well, I couldn't resist the urge to tell you the end of my story
For all those who wanted to know was there life after the pain

After the pain
You come and love me
And I welcome you
You're a glad sight to see

And after the rain
And all that I have been through
I still can't explain
How I can still love you like I do
But I do, yes, I do

Still love you like I do [After the pain]
Though you still do me like you do [After the pain]

After the pain
We sit and we talk awhile
And I fight with all my might
To hold back the tears from falling with a pleasant smile

And after the rain
I can't believe you got the nerve to still call me, baby
And I try to tell you, "No, it ain't so"
But I guess "No" just ain't in me

'Cause boy, I still love you like I do [After the pain]
Though you still do me like you do [After the pain]

Yeah, I know you're laughin'
Those of you who heard "Pain"
Yeah, you're right, I sure did
I said I'd never take him back again
Well, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind isn't it? 
But we do it all the time
Don't laugh, you probably done the same thing too
It's just that you know me and I don't know you
You know one thing, time has taught me that
Havin' a piece of man is better than havin' no man at all
So I'mma just take what I got and work with it
You understand what I mean
And don't you remember thinkin' back just a few years
When people used to try to help you stay together
They find out you're on the verge of breakin' up
They used to cook up a little food and throw a little party
And whisper things in your ear like

"Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can"
I heard 'em say, "Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can"

That's why I still love you like I do [After the pain]
Though you still do me like you do [After the pain, the pain]

I know that you know it's true
After all I've been through
I should be through with love
But there's a God up above

That keeps sayin', "Betty try
Don't give up, you know why
The sun is gonna shine
'Cause you are mine, all mine"

You just keep doin' your best
And I will do the rest
'Cause I love you, love you, Betty, like I do

That's why I still love you like I do [After the pain, the pain]
Though you still do me like you do [After the pain, the pain]

My love is deeper than any ocean
And my love is higher than any mountain
It's, oh, it's full of emotion
My love is full of devotion

My love is in and out of season
And I love you with or without a reason
You see God is gonna bless me for lovin' you
For all the times that you treated me wrong and I kept bein' true

You see, God's eyes they're not closed
He's not asleep
Said He's watchin' every move you make
Every secret you keep

Boy, you better be careful
Hoo... hoo... hoo... hoo... 
Said if you treat me bad or make my sad
My Father in heaven is watching you

But I still love you like I do [After the pain]
And no-n-n-no-n-n-no-n-n-nobody's ever gonna love you like I do [After the pain]
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
I don't know why I do, but I do, yes, I do [After the pain]
Oh... there's a woman in me that keeps on lovin' you [After the pain, the pain]
I don't know why 
Oh, I don't know why (I don't know why, baby) [After the pain, the pain]
I don't know why (I don't know why, baby), but I do (I do)
Said I do (I do, I do, I do)
Said I... [After the pain, the pain]
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa) [After the pain, the pain]
... Do, I don't know why, baby [After the pain, the pain]
But I love you so... 
Yes, I do [After the pain, the pain]
Baby, don't you know it's true, yes, I do
Baby [After the pain], no strain [The pain]
Still love you after the pain [The pain]
