Ooooooh yeah
In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were sweet to catch him, to keep him, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were good to the last drop, dont stop keep it that way 

Give her breakfast in bed sometimes
Tell her that shes been on your mind 
Take a ride somewhere nice to eat 
Put a pair of Jimmy Choos on her feet 

Stop nagging on him all the time
Start bragging on him sometimes
Go some places he wants to go
And make him thinks that he runs the show

In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were sweet to catch her, to keep her, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were good to the last drop, dont stop keep it that way 

Make sure theres gas in the car
Give her money to go to the spa
And shell never forget who you are
In fact, youll be a superstar 

When his friends are watching sports in the den 

Get in the kitchen hook him up something 
And even if you cant cook nothin  
Have a little takeout brought in

In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were sweet to catch him, to keep him, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were good to the last drop, dont stop keep it that way 

Youd better (keep) it that way
You ought to (keep) it that way
Youd better (keep)
You ought to (keep)
Keep it that way 

Youd better (keep) it that way
You ought to (keep) it that way
Youd better (keep)
I said (keep)
Keep it that way

Why do they always have to change?
When youre wearing their ring and youre bearing their name
Woooooo
Why cant it stay like, when it was new
Cos if deserve me, preserve me, Ill be all that I can be to you

Ohhhhhhhhh!  
Ohhhhh (Dont change) 
Ohhhhhhhh!  (Dont change baby) 
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh wooooo

In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were sweet to catch him, to keep him, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, dont change the play
You know you were good to the last drop, dont stop keep it that way 
(You know you what it took to get him)
(You know you gotsa to keep it that way) 
(You ought to keep it that way)
(You know what it took to get that woman)
(Some adlib and riffs)

Dont change 
Dont  dont change  (x 3)

Dont change 
Dont  dont change  (x 3)
Dont you change baby

Dont change 
Dont  dont change  (x 3)
Dont you change baby
(Dont change in the middle of the game)---Lyrics submitted by Tee.
