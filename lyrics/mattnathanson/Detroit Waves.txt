So, we let it go to start again
Knowing now how all our best intensions
Never lit the world on fire
Lights, illuminate the exit signs
And over the wings the skies an open endless sea
Crowding up surrounding me

And all, Detroit waves
Goodnight
Spread out
Beneath
Me now
If I could, if I could change
Believe me
I would, I would for you
(my love)

And when, you're warm enough to share your sheets
Cold enough to make it seem that I was only there long enough to disappear
You know I'll still, say your name to fall asleep
Over and over a cynic saying rosary
A liar living make believe

And all, of Detroit waves
Goodnight
Spread out
Beneath
Me now
If I could, if I could change
Believe me
I would, yes I would
And Detroit waves

And Detroit waves, goodnight
Spread out
Beneath me now
If I could
If I could change
Believe me
I would
Yes I would
And Detroit Waves
