(feat. Sugarland)

[Verse 1 (Matt):]
I wanna watch you undress
I wanna watch you glow
Let your hair down
All around, cover us both
You come in a wave
We crash and we roll
You surround me, pull me, drown me, swallow me whole

[Chorus (Both):]
You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn 
Know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you

[Verse 2 (Jennifer):]
You pull me in close
You buckle my knees
I shake and I shiver just to feel you breathe
You trace my lines
(You trace your lines)
Stirring my soul
Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode (I watch you, I watch you)

[Chorus (Both):]
You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn 
Know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you

[Hook:]
[Matt]
Im amazing when youre beside me
I am so much more
[Jennifer]
And I feel your fingers
Pound like thunder
I am so much more
[Matt]
So much more

[Chorus (Both):]
Turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn 
Know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you

Turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn 
Know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you
Still I run, run, run, run right back to you
[Jennifer]
Turning me on
[Matt]
Like a slow fire burn---
