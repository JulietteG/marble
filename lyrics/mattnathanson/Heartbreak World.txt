Lets all pack up and move this year
Slip the liars and disappear
Leave memories for auctioniers
And those just standing still
They'll miss the taste of wanting you
Call out your name like I still do
They haven't said a word thats true
And they only hold you down

And this heartbreak world
Of just imagine
With tired talk of better days
And this heartbreak world
Where nothing matters
Come on lets make this dream that's barely half awake come true

Let's move out of Los Angeles
Just drive until this summer gives
And forget the lies we use to live
'cause we're gone

And this heartbreak world
Of just imagine
With its tired talk of better days
And this heartbreak world
Where nothing matters
Come on lets make this dream that's barely half awake come true

Ohhhh ohh ohhhh, woaaa oohhhh

And this heartbreak world
Of just imagine
With its tired talk of better days
And this heartbreak world
Where nothing matters
Come on lets make the dream that's barely half awake come true

And this heartbreak world
With tired talk
And this heartbreak world
Where nothing matters
Come on lets make this dream that's barely half awake
Come on lets make this dream that's barely half awake come true---Lyrics submitted by Kiera.
