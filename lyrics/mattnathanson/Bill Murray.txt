I fell asleep
Had a dream
Bill Murray and I were friends
We drove the world
From Boston to Japan
Blasting old Van Halen
And one night over drinks
Bill started crying

He said to me "Kid, of all the stupid things I ever did
You know, I let her go when I should have pulled her in"
And he handed me his cell phone

When I called you were on your plane
Moving back to Portland for the rain

I wont only love you when youre winning
Other fools pretend to understand
Come on take my hand and well go down swinging
Let me be your man, let me be your man

A hundred days
We hiked the coast
Of Galway in the rain
And Bill said something
Late one night in Spain
And its always just stuck with me
"You only get one person knows you best
And its temporary everybody else."

I wont only love you when youre winning
Other fools pretend to understand
Come on take my hand and well go down swinging
Let me be your man, let me be your man

Im done with sleep
Imagined things
Cause dreams arent dreams
Til you wake up
So wake up
Just wake up here with me

I wont only love you when youre winning
Other fools pretend to understand
Come on take my hand and well go down swinging
Let me be your man, let me be your man---
