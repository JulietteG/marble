Ohhhh oh, ohhhh ohhh oh (headphones on)
Cinderella's gone to New York City
Wants to shave her head and disappear
18 years of never feeling pretty
So she is finally, thinking clear

Ain't too proud to swim or drown now baby
Ain't too proud to sink or see it through

She said...
Everybody wants to be with me
I've got all I need
I feel invincible
My headphones on
Everybody pose for magazines
All just noise to me
I feel invincible
My headphones on

If anybody comes around to find me
If anybody asks for me she says
Tell 'em all I'm in the deep and singing
With this music, in my head

Ain't too proud to swim or drown now baby
Ain't too proud to sink or see it through

She said...
Everyone wants to be with me
I've got all I need
I feel invincible
My headphones on
Everybody pose for magazines
All just noise to me
I feel invincible
My headphones on
Ohhhh oh
My head phones on
I feel invincible
My headphones on

People talking in their sleep
Can't see the forest for the trees
It's all scratch ticket lottery (ohhh oh)
Brave new world, same old crowd
Good things whisper, bad things shout
I don't hear 'em now

She said
Everyone wants to be with me
I've got all I need
I feel invincible
My headphones on
Everybody pose for magazines
All just noise to me
I feel invincible
My headphones on

Ohhh oh ohhhh
My headphones on
I feel invincible
My headphones on
I feel invincible
My headphones on---
