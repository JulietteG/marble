This time I'll be sailing
no more bailing boats for me
I'll be out here on the sea
just my confidence and me

and I'll be awful sometimes
weakened to my knees
but I'll learn to get by on little victories

this time I'll have no fear
I'll be standing strong and tall
turn my back towards them all

and I'll be awful sometimes
weakened to my knees
but I'll learn to get by, I'll learn to get by on little victories

and if the world decides to catch up with me
it's a little victory---Lyrics submitted by Kiera.
