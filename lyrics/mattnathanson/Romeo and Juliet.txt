A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsus serenade
Layin' everybody low
With a love song that he made
Finds a street light
Steps out of the shade
And says something like
You and me babe, how about it?

Juliet says hey it's Romeo
You nearly gave me a heart attack
He's underneath my window
She's singing, hey la my boyfriend's back
Shouldn't come around here, singing up to people like that
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?"

Juliet
The dice were loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song 
When you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong
Juliet...

Come up on different streets
But they're both the streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean
Yeah even the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
So how can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
And you can fall for chains of silver
And you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers
And the promises they hold

And you promised me everything
Yeah you promised me thick and thin
Now you just turn away and say
Romeo, yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

And Juliet 
When we made love you used to cry
You said I'll love you like the stars above
I'm gonna love you til I die
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When are you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong
Juliet...

And I can't do the talk
Like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
All I can do is kiss you
Through the bars of Orion 
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you anytime

Juliet 
When we made love you used to cry
You said I'll love you like the stars above
I'll love you til I die
You said there's a place for us
You know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the timing was wrong
Juliet...
