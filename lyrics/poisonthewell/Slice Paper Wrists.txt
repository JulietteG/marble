When you read this
I will not be the same
I have let my true form show
this is my last
lost in all my guilt
for letting you fall
understand it wasn't me
but I can't dream without showing intentions
as I ask these questions
where were you
now I can't see through your eyes
I remember the day the sun went out
It halted all progression with all its beauty
it just sacrificed
we fell apart

Sincerely yours I've disowned you(x3)

Sincerely yours I've disowned us---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
