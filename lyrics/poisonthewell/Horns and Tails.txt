Gray chairs cold but here for me
thankfully I don't miss your skin
or the way that you always have something to say
lose myself in you
cut it in you
with my rusty fingers
what I'd do for one more day
without you
I'm leaving again on metal heart breaker
all I wanted to say was
fuck you
miles away but you still seem to be here
I never took your eyes out of my bag---
