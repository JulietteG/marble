I'm losing my mind
Way behind
I'm losing my mind
That's why I ain't fine

It's starting to get me
It's here to collect me
I can laugh if I have to but it won't make me happy
That's why I ain't fine
That's why I ain't fine

I'm losing my mind
Way behind
I'm losing my mind
That's why I ain't fine
That's why I ain't fine

I'm losing my mind
Way behind
[x 8]
(that's why I ain't fine, that's why I ain't fine)---Lyrics submitted by Benedetta.
