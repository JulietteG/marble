Bamboozled    Kent Dykes

Refrein				
Ive been hood winged  , Ive been bamboozled
Ive been left for dead,  ive been packed my refusal
Ive been hood winged, ive been bamboozled 
Dont foul around with the patching Jew .. 

Dont take a woman that make blue Loe 
dont play cards with a man named Doug
Hand      full of trouble   all you got

Ive been hood winged  , Ive been bamboozled
Left for dead,  packed my refusaaal
Ive been hood winged, ive been bamboozled

Tiny Checker has a doll,  its al its can, its down the hall
I was a monkey but a hurdy gurdy man
All       i got snikkels in a shoe shine can

Ive been hood winged  , bamboozled
Left for dead,  packed my refusal
Ive been hood winged, ive been bamboozled 

Ive     down in Hawkes Snakel ,  slam all the women
Dont know the liiine, know cheap swimming
Walk the steak the narrow, walk and talk mine 
Driving since. to many times

Ive been hood winged  , Ive been bamboozled
left for dead,  packed my refusals
Ive been hood winged,. ive been bamboozled    
Ive been hood winged  , Ive been bamboozled
left for dead,  packed my refusaaals
Ive been hood winged, ive been bamboozled---Lyrics submitted by freek.
