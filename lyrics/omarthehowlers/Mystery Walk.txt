Mystery walk

Down in Louisi-anna 
back in the big bayou
there are pass that you dont cross
pleases you dont go

So many happy lost there
a few have ever return
So many eyes watching you
You feel youre back begin to burn

(refrein)
They forget what you thought you saw
Said the big man with the law
He just smile as he crushed back his head

Mayabe it was just a dream
Sometimes things aint what they seem
Better not fool with things you dont understand
Said the big law man

Took a moonlight mystery walk
Cant fotget what i thought i saw


Back in Saint Johns Parrish
On the betterly puncher train
There are things youre not admit to hear
Things you are not admit to see
When the panter screams at midnight
Stop and say a little prayer
When the drums pound in the distance
With ever step you better beware

They forget what you thought you saw
Said the big man with the law
He just smile as he crushed back his head

(refrein)

Mayabe it was just a dream
Sometimes things aint what they seem
Better not fool with things you dont understand
Said the big law man
Took a moonlight mystery walk     2x
Cant forget what i thought i saw             aaa ahoooooeeeeehaaaaaa---Lyrics submitted by freek.
