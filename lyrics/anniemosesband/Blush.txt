I suppose a single rose is pretty as it gets
and when the lights go down at night, I love the quietness
I love shy glances, slow romances
and hats that hide a kiss
Let's you and me go back in time
and find the things we miss

When hands were gentle and words were kind
and love could wait a long, long time
and private matters held their hush
and grooms were gallant and brides would blush

Does it seem a silly dream played back in black and white?
Pearls and gloves and hymns of love
the lines of wrong and right
Well, let's hush the cynic for just a minute
and let the dreamers dare
to dream of love that never fails
Oh, won't you take me there?

When hands were gentle and words were kind
and love could wait a long, long time
and private matters held their hush
and grooms were gallant and brides would blush

Shut the shutters, power down
let the world spin back around
to deep respect and no regrets
the dignity of you and me

When hands were gentle and words were kind
and love could wait a long, long time
and private matters held their hush
and grooms were gallant and brides would blush---Lyrics submitted by John Coons.
