Hi we are not in right now
But if you leave your name and number
We'll get back to you

I've got all this love, waiting just for you
I just gotta know that your love is true
Can't keep running boy in and out my life
Wanna be your girl, not 'cause the mood is right

If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold
Baby don't misunderstand, I do want for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest you my love
Don't walk away boy, my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy, I'll be right there for you

You said all the things that I like to hear
You push all my buttons baby love to have close to me
Wanna feel your love wanna be for sure
That it's me you need baby each and every night

If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold
Baby don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest my love
Don't walk away boy, my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy, I'll be right there for you

Baby don't misunderstand, I want you for my man
I need a little time before I give you my love
Don't walk away boy, I'll be right there for you

Don't walk away
This is what is sounds like when we make love

Don't walk away boy
Don't walk away boy, I'll be right there for you
Don't walk away boy, my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy, I'll be right there for you
Don't walk away boy, my love won't hurt you---Lyrics submitted by Chierrha Bagget.
