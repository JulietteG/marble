Shoo doo doo wop, shoo doo doo woo
Shoo doo doo wop, shoo doo doo woo
Shoo doo doo wop, shoo doo doo woo
Shoo doo doo wop

You never have to worry about my love
As long as you're taking care of business
With my heart see I'm a kind of girl
To dedicate my world
And you gotta give me all you got
I need it all baby every drop

You got to show me
And mean the words you say
It's not a game for me baby
It's just not that way

I'm only one woman baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman baby
And I need a one woman man

Shoo doo doo wop, shoo doo doo woo
Shoo doo doo wop, shoo doo doo woo
Shoo doo doo wop, shoo doo doo woo
Shoo doo doo wop

You never have to wonder if I care
If you're sharing the way
I feel for love you know I'm real
I'm the kind of girl to dedicate my world
But you gotta give me all you got
I need it all baby, every drop

You got to show me
And mean the words you say
It's not a game for me baby
It's just not that way

You got to show me
And mean the words you say
It's not a game for me baby
It's just not that way

I'm only one woman baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman baby
And I need a one woman man

I'm only one woman baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman baby
And I need a one woman man

I'm only one woman baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman baby
And I need a one woman man

I'm only one woman baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman baby
And I need a one woman man---Lyrics submitted by janet.
