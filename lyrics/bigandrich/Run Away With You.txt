Sometimes it feels just like youre so far away
We dont take the time to say the thing we used to say
And I cant remember the last time together lost in each others eyes
And it just aint right
Come on baby lets leave tonight

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set Em On fire, crazy like we used to
It dont matter where were going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I miss your midnight kiss and loving you all night long
This lifes like a rip tide and were barely hanging on
Caught up in the worry, and always in a hurry and losing what were all about
Lets slow it down
Take our love and get out of this town

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set Em On fire, crazy like we used to
It dont matter where were going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I want to lay you down with nothing but the sound of my name on your lips
We can let it all go and move real close and find that place again

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set Em On fire, crazy like we used to
It dont matter where were going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I just wanna run away with you
I just wanna run away with you
I just wanna run away with you---
