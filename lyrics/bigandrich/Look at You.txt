Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,
cuttin' right through me.
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times,
when you couldn't get enough of me.
I guess I givin' myself away.
Sayin' all the things I never did say.
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do.
Baby, when I look at you.

Yeah, baby when I look at you.

Last thing I thought I'd see was,
you across the bar from me, and
holdin' on to that turkey bottle,
shootin' em down, and runnin' full throttle.
Oh I can still taste the last time,
you and me and nothin' but the tan lines.
Keeps runnin' through my my mind.
on and on and on and on and

Yeah, baby when I look at you.

Well I know you know I'm a watchin'.
Your low cut on the dance floor rockin'.
Got the whole place worked up and locked in.
With every move so sexy it's shockin'.
Girl you sure do know how to serve it.
The way I did ya Lord I deserve it.
You know my heart, you know how to hurt it.

Well, I could start a tab and run it up,
or close it out and head to my truck, and
drive away as fast as I can
and forget we ever bucked.

Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues,
they're cuttin' right through me.
