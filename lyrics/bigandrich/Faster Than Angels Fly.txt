A modern day Romeo and Juilet
American tragedy
Low rent, high-rise lovers who met at the end of 
Coronado Street
Crucifixes made in California gold
Two worlds bound to collide 
Heave can't help you if you go
Faster than angels fly

[Chorus]
Well they burn the candle at both ends 
As they danced into the flame
Making love and making plans 
Driving Mother Mary insane
Strong as the beads of a rosary 
Never too young to die
Some souls only know one speed
Faster than angels fly

Ghost-haunted barrio in Hollywood
Graffiti staind wailin' wall
Dead-end street gang up to no good
Out to make a retribution call
Sweet innocence caught in crossfire's fate
Too late to draw the line
Bullets can blow your dreams away
Faster than angels fly

[Repeat Chorus]

They were still holding hands
when all hell broke loose
They both left this world
with more than most true lovers do

[Repeat Chorus]

Strong as the beads of a rosary
Never too young to die
Some souls only known one speed
Faster than angels fly---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
