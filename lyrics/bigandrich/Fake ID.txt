Hey, I've been driving all over town 
On my cellphone wearin' it out
And I've finally tracked you down

Hey, everybody says you're the man
The final piece to my master plan
You got my world in the palm of your hand

Well I know that you got it
Come on and just sell it
Got the cash up in my pocket
You know I gotta get it

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID

Hey, don't even think about tellin' me no
It's only twenty minutes till the show
Hey mister turn it over let's go

No, I ain't gonna need a receipt
Just make sure that it looks like me
So the bouncer don't call the police

And don't tell my daddy
Stole the keys to his caddy
Don't dilly dally
I gotta get the hell out of this alley

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID

Here's my money, now get out of my way
Gonna push my luck right up to the stage

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister, hey mister

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
Hey mister, hey mister---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
