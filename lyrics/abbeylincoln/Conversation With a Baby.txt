We're really very lucky that you got here.
Nowadays they slay them at the door,
Wish that you could tell us where you came from,
But no one can remember from before,
If you could talk I'll bet you'd tell me.
Yes I know you gathered in the womb,
but where do all the little babies come from?
Do they tarry over there in the tomb?

It's only holy magic that could send you,
make you with that precious little face,
Look just like your daddy, like an angel,
living in this sad and lonely place.
I wonder if you've been to other planets;
Other worlds with other dreams to share?
Maybe in a twinkling of a moment,
Of a sudden you'll remember being there.

There's something else I'd really like to ask you,
Does the shining spirit reappear
Does it travel further through the distance?
Is it all by chance our being there?
They say that life is fleeting and we vanish.
Living here's not all that it could be.
But is it like a circle? A dimension?
a calculation measured by degree?

You're holding heaven's secrets little darling.
Never mind I saw that precious smile.
Maybe thought, perhaps one day you'll tell us
exactly where you've been all the while.
So where do all the little babies come from?
Were you really sent here on the run?
Did you ride a mighty beam of lightning?
You little rascal you, you came here
from the sun.---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
