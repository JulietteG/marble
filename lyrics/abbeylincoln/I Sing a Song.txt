I sing a song of winter,
I sing a song of spring.
I sing a song of new love,
Songs that the seasons bring.

I awaken with a feeling,
sometimes weary at a glance,
looking at my life's condition
in the mirror of by chance.
Sometimes demons come to visit.
I can see them in the trees
or an elephant with thunder
rolling gently through the breeze.

Sometimes thoughts of love come sailing
and I see you, see your face,
and I hear a voice that whispers,
that calls to bring me grace.
One that bids me sing another world
and helps me when I dare
To gather, in the darkness,
golden beads for my hair.
So the mornings bring the sunshine,
sometimes they bring the rain,
and when a feeling comes to me,
I sing a song, again.---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
