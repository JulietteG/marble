Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there

Did you go all the way just following the stream
Did you run to capture something from a dream
I'm coming for to get you
Never mind the tears
'cause you've always been my darling through the years

Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there

There you are, in the dark,
all by yourself alone.
Hold on while I carry
you and me on home.
Being lost is scary.
Yes I know you do,
just like  I love you,
you little rascal you.

Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there
Love, what you doing down there---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
