There's a sound comes from livin'
Somewhere in the past
When the grass was greener
And we found true love at last

It's the sound of sorry
Lookin' yonder with regret
Sorry 'cause of what you got
And what you didn't get

Could've been another song
Would've been a sing along
Could've been, would've been
Should've been

Could've been another world
Where true thoughts of love unfurl
Could've been, would've been
Should've been

But here we are, we are here
Here's to life, give a cheer
Here am I, here are we
Here's to you, here's to me

After all is said and done
There was laughter, we had fun
It was life, it was love
Should've been

But here we are, we are here
Here's to life, give a cheer
Here am I, here are we
Here's to you, here's to me

After all is said and done
There was laughter, we had fun
It was life, it was love
Should've been

It was life, it was love
Should've been---Lyrics submitted by Iki.
