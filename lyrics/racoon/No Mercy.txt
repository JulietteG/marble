She walks in and says come on let's have it
She brings out the worst you can be
That's a good day for a bad habit
Don't you dare to disagree

She passed this thing with something groovin'
Straight down from church, you wanna bet?
She play him like some kind of movie
Then smokes the last of his cigarettes

She's got no mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for no king
No mercy for no king
She picks his heart like it's a pocket
She wears her hair like it's a crown
She sees right through all his compose-yeah-yeah-yee-yeah
She'll hold the leash, good dogs stay down

She's got no mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the king

Ooh, there won't be any mercy
Not unless you've got a diamond ring
Oh no there won't be no excuse me
No mercy for the king of everything

No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for no soldiers
No mercy for no king
No mercy, ooh, no mercy

No mercy for the soldiers (3x)
No mercy for no king (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
