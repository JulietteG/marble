Lost the things that you thought you would never miss.
Let them out, miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here that will always live
And they can take them away, so they won't

Open this window, let the sickness out
Sleep softly, breath again
If there's a way then it'll find you and help you out
You're like a circle, there is no start and no end

Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
It's not all pitchblack in the back of your mind
Close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

And change I wish for I will, cause it's gonna work.
You can do this, it's your life
And if you are unhappy about something, stop jerking about.
Follow the clouds and dive right in.

Open this window, just let the wind blow in
And let it grab you and calm you down.
And if there is no way to find a way,
Don't go down the easy way,
And don't let any of them bastards hold you down.

Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
It's not all pitchblack at the back of your mind
Close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

Welcome to the show,
cause you're following at the man, with a million plan
And all your dreams are gone if you let it go.
And all the dreams you win, if your dare to make it so
If you dare to make it so

You Lost the things you thought you would never miss.
Let them out, miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here that will always live
And they can take them away, so they won't

Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
It's not all pitchblack at the back of your mind
Close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes---Lyrics submitted by linda.
