Clouds above go sailing by 
I found my meaning in this life 
Clear white is flying in my eyes, 
underneath a blue, blue sky 
The waves come rolling in with the tide. 
I've been away too long 
And every day I missed you more. 
You look like you did before, 
only prettier. 
Every day I love you more. 

All the people rushing by, by, by 
Looking for meaning in this life 
So used up, and blinded by lies, 
they're underneath the blue, blue sky 
The way they seldom seem to smile, 
I don't know why. 

'Cause I've been away too long 
and every day I missed you more. 
You look like you did before, 
only prettier 
Every day I love you more 
I love you more, 
everyday I love you more, 
and more 

Cause I've been away too long 
And every day I missed you more. 
You look like you did before, 
only prettier. 
And every day I missed you more, 
and more and more and more and more. 
I've been away too long 
And every day I missed you more. 
Oh you look like you did before, 
only prettier 
Everyday I love you more. 

I love you more. 
Everyday I love you more ---Lyrics submitted by Harry.
