Watch for the ones who want the war in you
Stick to the path inside you
Dont mind the minor detail
This one's as big as a whale 
Hang tight and rock and wreck and hold and hitch
Get with the fight the fix the fight the win
Can't see the final lines here?

I said i'd try to cross the ocean
Oh son that's not happening
You shot the moon 
And man its great
You've got the story

Why should i even itch the scalp that burn from recreation
Why should i plead to hush the bath of heat and education

Stick with the ones
Who do the work for you
Dont leave my side
I carry more than my own troubles
How taxing
Think of a day that wasnt waste to you
Concern the work involved
And was it really worth it

I said i'd try to cross the ocean
Oh son that's not happening
You shot the moon 
And man its great
You've got the story

Why should i hop the cracks that break my back from superstition
Why should i push to walk the path of heat and education

Tread and trek the tubers to where i'm resting
Walk the wrong way back until i'm exhausted
Beg the burden away from me
Beg the burden away from me

I said i'd try to cross the ocean
Oh son that's not happening
You shot the moon 
Of god you've got the glory---Lyrics submitted by Briana.
