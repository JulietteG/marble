Its New Years Day just like the day before
Same old skies of grey, 
same empty bottles on the floor
Another years gone by, 
and I was thinking once again
How can I take this losing hand and somehow win

Just give me One Good Year. 
To get my feet back on the ground
Ive been chasing grace. 
Grace aint so easily found
One bad hand can devil a man, 
chase him and carry him down
Ive got to get out of here, 
just give me One Good Year

Im burning oil, engines running rough
I drive from job to job, but its never enough
I cant find the will to just up and get away
Some kind of chain is holding me down and making me stay

Just give me One Good Year. 
To get my feet back on the ground
Ive been chasing grace. 
Grace aint so easily found
One bad hand can devil a man, 
chase him and carry him down
Ive got to get out of here, 
just give me One Good Year 

Its a bitter wind in your face every day
Its the little sins that wear your soul away
When you start giving in, 
where do the promises all go
Will your darkest hour write a blank check on your soul

Its New Years Day just like the day before
Same old skies of grey, 
same empty bottles on the floor
Another years gone by, 
and I was thinking once again
How can I take this losing hand and somehow win

Just give me One Good Year. 
To get my feet back on the ground
Ive been chasing grace. 
Grace aint so easily found
One bad hand can devil a man, 
chase him and carry him down
Ive got to get out of here, 
just give me One Good Year---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
