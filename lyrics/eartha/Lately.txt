Ordinarily you could tell me almost anything, anything
I'd embrace the world without ever even questioning, 
But I tell you lately I've changed my view of the world
Lately the darkness has been unveiled
Lately I am not the ordinary me
Lately I've been seeking a deeper life
Lately I've been walking in the Light
Maybe, maybe there is something wrong with me 
Lately

Could I possibly be moving into a brand new day,
I've been wondering if this just a seasonal display
But I tell you lately I just have not been myself
Lately I've been feeling like someone else
Lately I am not the ordinary me
Lately I've been feeling kind of strange
Lately going through some kind of change
Maybe, maybe there's something wrong with me

Who said something's wrong with you? (I think somethings wrong with me)
Maybe you're just growing new
Could be everything's alright
All good things, they come in time

Maybe this is reverie, 
Things may not be what they seem,
But if it's my imagination, 
Then nothing's really wrong with me

Lately I have changed my view of the world
Lately the darkness has been unveiled
Lately I am not the ordinary me
Lately I've been seeking a deeper life
Lately I've been walking in the Light

Maybe I can't describe this feeling; 
But I won't deny its being;
You see, it's settling deep inside me; 
Speaking to me as I sleep

Someone must be praying for me
Two or three they touch and agree
I say they've really got it working (really got it working)
Cause something's got a hold on me (hold on me)

Lately I just have not been myself
Lately I've been feeling like someone else
Lately I am not the ordinary me
Lately I've been feeling kind of strange
Lately going through some kind of change
Maybe, maybe there's something wrong with me

I tell you lately somethings wrong 
Lately I have changed my view of the world
Lately the darkness has been unveiled
Lately I am not the ordinary me
Lately I've been seeking a deeper life
Lately I've been walking in the Light---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
