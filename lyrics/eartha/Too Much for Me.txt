Could it be that this world is just a little too much for me
Without you, without you

Does my heart belong somewhere else, 
To someone greater than myself
Tender and delicate, 
There is no replicate

I sat down by the ocean, Lord I thought of you 
Cried with mixed emotions, I was feeling blue
Why does this world keep me so confused?
Why cant I live the life of a recluse?

Sometimes I wonder where I belong 
Feel so removed from what I call home
This present state of humanity
So much calamity

Looked up in the mirror and what did I see
Two big lonely eyes looking back at me
Then I heard a voice within me say
Youre not the only one who feels this way

Does my heart belong somewhere else,
To someone greater that myself
Tender and delicate, 
There is no replicate

So Ill keep my eyes with a view to find
A peaceful place thats yours and mine

Could it be that this world is just a little too much for me
Without you, without you
Could it be that this world is just a little too much for me
Without you, without you

So Ill keep my eyes with a view to find
A peaceful place thats yours and mine

You can take me there, you can take me there
Anytime you want to, you can take me there
Ill be waiting for you to come and take me there 
Anytime you want to, you can take me there

Take me there, you can take me there
Anytime you want to, you can take me there
Ill be waiting for you to come and take me there 
Anytime you want to, you can take me there

Take me there, you can take me there
Anytime you want to, you can take me there
Ill be waiting for you to come and take me there 
Anytime you want to, you can take me there

Take me there, you can take me there
Anytime you want to, you can take me there
Ill be waiting for you to come and take me there 
Anytime you want to, you can take me there---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
