Theres a mighty presence in the room right now
Descending upon the children in the building
Its coming down like the rain

Oh oh oh oh, your Shekinah glory 
Oh oh oh oh, your Shekinah glory 

Oh the beauty of exchange 
As our hearts to you ascend
Theres a sweet and gentile wind now upon us
As the cloud descends

Welcome Holy Spirit, show us your glory
Your Shekinah Glory, oh oh, your Shekinah glory 

Yes the glory of the Lord is in His temple, 
Lets praise him
He reveals Himself unto His holy people,
Who are called by His Name
Who will humble themselves and pray 
And will seek His face always

Oh oh, your Shekinah glory 
Oh oh, your Shekinah glory 

Let the glory of the Lord now come from on high
Let the presence of the Lord come and abide.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
