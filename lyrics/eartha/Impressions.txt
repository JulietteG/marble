Everytime I wake each morning 
Just to see a brand new day
I lift up my heart and remind myself 
To forever give my Father all the thanks

I witness all nature calling 
As the winter leaves are falling
Before they touch the ground reminds me 
Of my spirit floating on a cloud

These impressions, they remind me of 
The day I tasted Heavens glory
Light upon me as a gentile dove
It was both sweet and divine

It felt like the mornings dew 
Descending upon me anew
Sealed within my soul a song of love
One that Id never learned, and since not have heard

Ohhh

Everytime I wake each morning 
Just to see a brand new day
I lift up my heart and remind myself 
To forever give my Father all the thanks

These impressions, they remind me of 
The day I tasted Heavens glory
Light upon me as a gentile dove
It was both sweet and divine

It felt like the mornings dew 
Descending upon me anew
Sealed within my soul a song of love
One that Id never learned, and since not have heard

Ohhh

I witness all nature calling 
As the winter leaves are falling
Before they touch the ground reminds me 
Of my spirit floating on a cloud---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
