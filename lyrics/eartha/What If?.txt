What would I ever do 
if I couldnt spend my time with you?
My world wouldnt be the same, no
So Id do anything to be with you

What if I never knew 
That you love me quite way that you do? (way you do, way you do)
Had you not shown me so
I guess I would have never known, I would have never known

I cant fathom this complexed matter
Its a thing beyond my understanding
Its a rhapsody of love 
I cant fathom this complexed matter
I guess well talk about it when we get together
Cause weve got forever, aint no rush

What if you never cared, 
left me hanging in the middle of nowhere?
I would just lose my mind Jesus
I would be lost in time, delirious

So I made up in my mind
Thought about it just about a million times
No matter where you are, Ill find you
I wont be too far behind you

I cant fathom this complexed matter
Its a thing beyond my understanding
Its just a rhapsody of love
I cant fathom this complexed matter
I guess well talk about it when we get together
Cause weve got forever, aint no rush

What would I ever do 
if I couldnt spend my time with you?
My world wouldnt be the same, no
So Id do anything to be with you

What if I never knew 
that you love me quite way that you do? (way you do, way you do)
Had you not shown me so
I guess I would have never known, I would have never known

I cant fathom this complexed matter
Its a thing beyond my understanding
Its just a rhapsody of love
I cant fathom this complexed matter
I guess well talk about it when we get together
Cause weve got forever, aint no rush

What if you never cared? 
Left me hanging in the middle of nowhere?
I would just lose my mind Jesus
I would be lost in time, delirious

Made up in my mind
Thought about it just about a million times
No matter where you are, Ill find you
I wont be too far behind you

What if I never knew you? 
Couldnt find my way to you? (I dont know what I would do)
What if you never cared? (What if you never cared?)
What if you never even loved me? 
left me hanging in the middle of nowhere?   

I would just lose my mind, I would be lost in time 
What if I never knew you? Couldnt find my way to you? 
(I dont know what I would do without you)---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
