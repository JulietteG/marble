I remember late November
Pondering over all of the things in my life
You consoled me, came to hold me,
Showed yourself right and you kept me through the night

Got a bit of dj vu
Once I got you back into my view
Saw it like a matinee 
Didnt know it was coming that way

Got a bit of dj vu
Once I got you back into my view
Saw it like a matinee 

Theres no one to stand next to you
Nobody can do what you do
You really dont have nothing else to prove
The things you do, its just like you

You stand all by yourself
Cant be compared to no one else
Youre the first and only last premiere
Youve got so much savoire-faire

Youre amazing, keep me gazing, 
Youre my admiration and I thing you are so awesome
And you are second to none, never will you be undone
By any other power; you exceed all expectation

Got a bit of dj vu
Once I got you back into my view
Saw it like a matinee 
Didnt know it was coming that way

Got a bit of dj vu
Once I got you back into my view
Saw it like a matinee 
Didnt know it was coming that way

Didnt know what to do cause you caught me by surprise
Im sure you could tell when you looked into my eyes
Thought I knew you well until now
And I realize, I realized

No one, nobody can do what you do
You really dont have nothing else to prove
The things you do, just like you
Oh its just like you stand

By yourself
Cant be compared, no one else
Youre the first and only last premiere
Youve got so much savoire-faire

Next to you, nobody can do what you do
You really dont have nothing else to prove
The things you do, just like you
Oh its just like you stand

By yourself
Cant be compared, no one else
Youre the first and only last premiere
Youve got so much savoire-faire

Theres no one next to you
Nobody can do (no one)
Really dont have nothing else to prove
The things you do, just like you

Oh you stand all by yourself 
Cant be compared, no one else 
Youre the first and only last premiere
Youve got so much savoire-faire 

Theres no one next to you---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
