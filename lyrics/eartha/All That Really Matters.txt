When I close my eyes to say goodbye to life,
All I want to know is that Ive truly strived
Cause all that really matters anymore 
Is to love the one whom I truly adore
Hes the one that I am living for 
And with all of my heart I want to please the Lord

I know that Im not all I should be, 
But as long as his word abides in me, 
Hell cause me to stand
Im in his hand, He knows who I am

When that day comes for me to take my rest,
All I want to know is that Ive done my best
In spite of the obstacles Ive faced 
The countless times Ive fallen in this race 
Had it not been for his grace 
Gloom would have filled all of my days

All that really matters anymore 
Is just to please the Lord
I want to hear Him say 
Well done thy good and faithful servant, enter into my courts; 
Well done, enter into my joy

I dont know about you or what you want to do 
You can have the fame, you can make yourself a name 
But all that really matters anymore
Is to please the Lord

All that really matters anymore 
Is to love the one whom I truly adore
Hes the one that I am living for 
And with all of my heart I want to please the Lord.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
