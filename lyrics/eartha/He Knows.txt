It takes the Lord to give a melody
It takes the Lord to give a song
Only He knows what we really need to help us carry on
He knows yes indeed, and He knows everything

It takes the Lord to strengthen me each day
To carry my heavy load
It is His anointing that replenishes me; satisfies my thirsty soul
He knows yes indeed, and He knows everything

He knows everything; all about the pain
And the burdens we bear; just know He cares
There aint nothin He dont know
No place He wont go, nothing He wont do for me and you.

Yeah, there aint nothin He dont know
Yeah, He knows everything there is to know

The Lord, He has searched me 
And He knows me all throughout
My downsitting and uprising, all my whereabouts
Whether shall I go from Him, whether shall I flee
Take the wings of morning, fly above the deep
Yeah, there aint nothing He dont know

If I say to darkness cover, hide me in the night,
It wont make a difference, cause to Him theyre both alike
To ascend to heaven is my earnest prayer
Theres no doubt within me, He will meet me there

Yeah, there aint nothing He dont know
Yeah, He knows everything there is to know.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
