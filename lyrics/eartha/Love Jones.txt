Ive got a love jones for you Jesus
Something in my heart is going on
Ive got a love song for you Jesus
And Ill sing it all day long

It is so amazing the joy I feel inside
And its fascinating just to have you in my life
Everyone keeps wondering whats wrong with me these days
Aint got a clue about me and you; they just think Im in a daze

When my heart was broken, it was you who mended me
Bound it up with chords of love your tender remedy
If I could repay you I would anoint your feet 
And this girl would tell the world how much you mean to me

I must be in love, youre all I think of 
When I wake in the morning, 
Youre the only one thats on my mind 
In the noonday Lord I feel your embrace 
When the world surrounding me is so very cold and unkind
In the evening I hear you speaking to me 
Through your holy Word calling me your beloved
Ive been bought with a price
Lord thats sure mighty nice that you love me so much

Everyday is jubilee because of what youve done in me
Shown me how sweet life could be, youre the only remedy  
Everyday is a holiday since you came into my life to stay
Hear me Jesus when I say I never thought Id feel this way

Ive got nothin but love for you Jesus
Got a love jones for your love
Out of all the people in the world, 
Youre the only one that Im constantly thinking of.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
