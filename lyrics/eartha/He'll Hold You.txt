If you want Him just ask Him, Hell hold you
When you cant find your way Hell come to you
Hes the best kept secret if you only knew 
How sweet it is when He holds you

My friend I know sometimes we lose control of our lives
And it seems like our dreams all go crumbling down, down
You think youre walking in the light with all you see before your eyes
Its just like walking in the night where you keep stumbling

You just want some peace and you seek a bit of relief
Your boats rowing down the stream but not so gently
Row, row, row your boat
Its the middle of the week and you still cant get no sleep
I know exactly what you need
Hes the only way to get some peace, if you want Him, just ask Him

If you want Him, just ask Him, Hell hold you
When you cant find you way Hell come to you
Hes the best kept secret, if you only knew 
How very sweet it is when He holds you

Ive been where you are and I scrolled out my memoirs
And I sent it in a jar across the ocean
It was to symbolize all the turmoil in my life
And I used my pain to set my prayer in motion

It was definitely grace elevating all of my faith
I felt such a warm embrace in this experience
Heaviness lightened up with ease, suddenly I now could breathe
And I know that this is only because of His presence, so if you want Him, just ask Him 

If you want Him, just ask Him, Hell hold you
When you cant find you way Hell come to you
Hes the best kept secret, if you only knew 
How very sweet it is when He holds you

If you dont mind, He might come tonight
Everything will be alright
Things may not change the way youd like
At least youll have some peace of mind

If you dont mind, He might come tonight
Everything will be alright
Things may not change the way youd like
At least youll have some peace of mind

If you dont mind, He might come tonight
Everything will be alright
Things may not change the way youd like
But at least youll have some peace of mind

If you dont mind, He might come tonight
Everything will be alright
Things may not change the way youd like
At least youll have some peace of mind

If you dont mind, He might come tonight
Everything will be alright
Things may not change the way youd like
At least youll have some peace of mind

When he holds you---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
