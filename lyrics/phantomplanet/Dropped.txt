i can swear i feel the beating of a cold, cold heart,
and theres a chill,
cause its showing through your clothing,
and as far as i can tell,
nothing underneath your v-neck tee,
im begging,
im begging,
im begging you please,

now!
tell me that you want me,
tell me that you need me,
tell me cause I'd like to know,
won't you stop teasing me,
won't you take it easy,
tell me cause i'd like to know
you're never gonna go

drop
whatcha
got
now

drop
watcha 
got 
now

everybody knows the way the eye goes,
moving like a curtain closes over the finale,
from your head down to your toes,
up and down,
checking you out now,
beyond a doubt,
make a copy in the office,
for the desk with the windows,
in the ivory dome,
you've made it your home,
see you in your sills,
smiling ear to ear,
never gonna go,

do you want me,
tell me that you need me,
tell me cause i'd like to know,
wont you stop teasing me,
won't you take it easy,
tell me cause i'd like to know,
you're never gonna go,

drop
whatcha
got
now

drop
watcha
got
now

drop
watcha
got
now

won't you
tell me that you want me
tell me that you need me
tell me cause i'd like to know
wont you stop teasing me
wont you take it easy
tell me cause i'd like to know
you're never gonna go

drop
whatcha
got
now

drop
watcha
got
now

drop
watcha
got
now

tell me that you want me
tell me that you need me
tell me cause i'd like to know
now---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
