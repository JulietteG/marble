With fire to keep us warm
and tools we made from rocks and bones
A roof over your head
and walls to keep you safe in bed
There must be more than this
So God was born 
and we in his image of fear and love
looked down upon from up above

We gotta do much more than believe
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe
if we wanna see the world change

We crossed the oceans wide
built cities to the sky oh Lord
Looked up and we were flying
but will we not survive ourselves

We gotta do much more than believe 
if we wanna see the world change
We gotta do much more than believe 
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe
go on try it, go on try it
We gotta do much more than believe 
if we wanna see the world change

What will I say to my baby
Let me show you a movie
we landed a man on the moon
Now you could never believe it
ya we could do anything
We flew to the stars and back
down to the ground hard

Please wake up
Please wake up
Please wake up

(children singing)
We gotta do much more than believe
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe 
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe 
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe 
if we really wanna change things

(Children and Dave singing)
We gotta do much more than believe 
go on try it, go on try it
We gotta do much more than believe 
if we really wanna change things
We gotta do much more than believe 
go on try it, go on try it
We gotta do much more than believe
if we wanna see the world change

Oh my little baby
let me show you this movie
You know we landed a man on the moon
I know it's hard to imagine
but we could do anything
under the stars.---Lyrics submitted by Allison Boswell.
