Dont give up, I know you can see
All the world and the mess that were making
Cant give up and hope God will intercede
Come on back, imagine that we could get it together
Stand up for what we need to be
Cause crime wont save or feed a hungry child
Cant lay down and hope a miracle will change things
So lift up your eyes, lift up your heart
Singing, mercy will we overcome this
Oh, one by one, could we turn it around
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer
And Ill try to give you what you need
Me and you, and you, and you just wanna be free
But you see, all the world is just as weve made it
And until we got a new world Ive got to say
That love is not a whisper or a weakness
No, love is strong, so we got to get together
Yeah, gotta get, gotta get, gotta get
Til there is no reason to fight
Mercy, will we overcome this
Oh, one by one, could we turn it around
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer
And Ill try to give you what you need
Mercy, will we overcome this
Have we come too far to turn it around
Ask too much to be a little bit stronger
But I wanna give you what you need
Mercy, what will become of us
Oh, one by one, could we turn it around
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer
And Ill try to give you what you need ---
