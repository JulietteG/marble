Sitting on the sofa
Suckin' a bowl of crack
Thinkin' to myself about
My angel dressed in black

I know she went out hours ago
I hope that she's coming back
So I wait here patiently
For my angel dressed in black

I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain

I wish she'd come home right now
So we could interact
I've got a big surprise for her
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black

I'm getting kind of paranoid
I'm going off the track
I'm starting to hallucinate
My angel dressed in black

She might have been arrested
She might have been attacked
She might be lying dead somewhere
My angel dressed in black

I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain

Sofa
Crack
Thinkin' to myself about
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black---Lyrics submitted by Chucklehead.
