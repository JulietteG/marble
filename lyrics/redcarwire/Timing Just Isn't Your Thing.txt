She wrote in my yearbook
"Baby promise let's stay in touch" 
But I know she knows I know she didn't
Maybe we just grew up
'Cause it's been four years and a whole damn summer, and baby I just gave up
You lost your shot, your boy, you know it. 
Goodnight, goodbye
And I tell myself not to get too close
'Cause I trust you'll let me down
Unless of course I beg you to let me down

I'm sorry girl, I thought of you 
And all the things you do to me
'Cause you lost your shot, your boy, you know it
Goodnight, goodbye
Sorry girl who lost it all 
We had the world, you let it go 
With the hand held, lip locked, stargazed lovers 
Goodnight, goodbye

Well we've reached the end of this vacation 
There's nothing left to feel for you 
I watched and waited as you vacated
This love, my love
You can bat your eyelashes, pray to God
But honesty's not your calling card
And timing's just not your thing, darling
Girl you'll never get to me

I'm sorry girl, I thought of you 
And all the things you do to me
But you lost your shot, your boy, you know it
Goodnight, goodbye
Sorry girl, who lost it all 
We had the world you let it go 
With the hand held, lip locked, stargazed lovers
Goodnight, goodbye

I'm sorry girl, I thought of you 
And all the things you do to me 
But you lost your shot, your boy, you know it
Goodnight, goodbye
Sorry girl, who lost it all 
We had the world you let it go 
With the hand held, lip locked, stargazed lovers
Goodnight goodbye

I'm sorry girl, I thought of you 
And all the things you do to me 
But you lost your shot, your boy, you know it
Goodnight, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
