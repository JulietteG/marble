You're a mess
Your life's off track but your heart beats still
And you push away like I know you will
You go through the motions and lose motivation

You're lost and exhausted but wont stop fighting
You think that you're right but inside you're hiding it
I'm on your side and I'll fight and I won't stop, I never will
(Baby I can't wait forever, you can't stay forever we can't wait or stay the same)

This is the last thing that I'll ever say
I'll be there when the world falls down
And all your friends are gone forever

We've all moved on
We've gone our separate ways
But you were way to cool for us
But who needs us now

You're lost and exhausted but wont stop fighting
You think that you're right but inside you're hiding it
I'm on your side and I'll fight and I won't stop, I never will
(Baby I can't wait forever, you can't stay forever we can't wait or stay the same)

This is the last thing that I'll ever say
I'll be there when the world falls down
And all your friends are gone forever [x2]

Torn apart
Live alone everyday a mile away
And I don't wanna be alone again
When you're gone, gone when you're gone

Torn apart
Live alone everyday a mile away
And I don't wanna be alone again
When you're gone, you're gone
Oh my God their gone

This is the last thing that I'll ever say
I'll be there when the world falls down
And all your friends are gone forever [x2]---Lyrics submitted by haley.
