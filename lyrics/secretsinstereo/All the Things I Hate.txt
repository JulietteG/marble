Yesterday everything was fine,
We were good,
We were happy,

But today, you really blew my mind,
Same fight,
Same old story,

Here we go again, chasing down our words,
Do you really want to go again?
'Cause I don't want to

Be the one that doesn't say enough,
And I don't want to,
Be the one that always says to much,
And I don't want to,
Pick up the pieces when we break,
I'm waiting for you to stop being all the things I hate,
But you don't want to x2

You think you're messing with my head, 
But I think you're missing something,

'Cause I've got you figured out, oh yeah,
Your words, they don't mean nothing.

Here we go again, stupid little games,
Do you understand,
That I don't to,

[Chorus]

But you don't want to, I don't want to,

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
