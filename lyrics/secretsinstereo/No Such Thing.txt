Hello Hello
Is this thing on, I got something to say

Hello Hello
We've been carrying on, but I found the point today   

[Chorus]
There's no such thing as tomorrow
It's just a promise from a stranger
a promise from a stranger

It's upside down, get lost in the now
forget what you thought you knew
Breathe in breathe out,  you're coming around
This is the time that belongs to you

[Chorus]

It's not a guarantee,  it's a place we're not meant to be
A dream just out of reach
Always a date away, but you got this beautiful day
This is a dream
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up

There's no such thing as tomorrow
It's just a promise from a stranger
There's no such thing,  no such thing
It's just a promise from a stranger
a promise from a stranger

Hello Hello
Is this thing on
I got something to say

Hello Hello
We've been carrying on
but I found the point today---Lyrics submitted by Matthew Davis.
