verse1:]

i put your picture on mirror
so i could blush when ever someone say your name,
in my stomach theirs a pain
see you walking in my direction l go the other up way
i start to studder when i speak
so i just stand an let my knees go weak
what happening to me in the dark can you tell me what it mean
i lay my head on my pillow ,caught me starring out the window
show a star for a sign
this is the reason why

[chorus:]

your always on my mind 
when you come around i get shy
baby   when i see you, see you ,when i see you, baby when i 
never know when you might walk by 
so i gotta be right on time
 when i see you , when i see you


verse2:]

i scibble X and O's in my note book 
checking how my hair and nails is look
i feel my self in the zone
i get nervses when  you call
so i say am not home
i see your face when i hear my favorite song
should i send an e-mail at home
your the numder 1 topic on the phone
i wonder if you know,or do you have a clue yeah ?
i lay my head on my pillow,you got me starring out the window
show a star for sign
this is the reason why,yeah

[chorus:]

some thing now is taking over me 
yeah,yeah,yeah, yeah,yeah yeah 
i'm not going to run now ,just go to stand here,yeah
ooo
yeah---Lyrics submitted by lindell.
