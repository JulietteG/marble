Everynight in my dream i see you i feel you
That is how i know you go onnnnnn
Far across the distance and spaces between us
You have come to show you go onnnn

Chours1
Near far were ever you are 
I belive that the heart does go onnn
once more you open the door
and your here in my heart
And my heart will go on and onnnn

Love can touch us one time and
Last for a life time
And never let go till were gone
Love was when i loved you
One true time i hold to
In my life will always go on

Chours2
Near far were ever you are 
I belive that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door 
And your here in my heart
And my heart will go on and onnn

Your here there nothing I fear
And i know that my heart will go on
Will stay for ever this way 
You are safe in my heart and my heart will go on and on
