(feat. Big K.R.I.T.)

[Verse 1:]
You've been like seeing the sun the first time,
Like I just did a hard time.
And no one to protect, just will
You make my problems disappear.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh, this is love, boy
You're too much.
Oh, this is love boy, and you're too much
And we're in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me.

[Verse 2:]
And you'll be reading my mind
And all you've seem it's my lines.
You take your time, you don't rush me
The clock don't move when you touch me.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh, this is love, boy
You're too much.
Oh, this is love boy, and you're too much
And we're in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me.

[Chorus:]
I'm a lady, I'm a woman,
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter.
But when I'm with you I have powers,
Supernatural, the love is ours.
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel,
Baby, this how you make me feel,
Baby, this how you make me feel,
This what you do to me.

[Verse 3:]
And you've been changing our lives
A love like gold, but we shine.
It's like you take control of me
The clock don't tick till you will touch me on.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh, this is love, boy
You're too much.
Oh, this is love boy, and you're too much
And we're in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me.

[Chorus:]
I'm a lady, I'm a woman,
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter.
But when I'm with you I have powers,
Supernatural, the love is ours.
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel,
Baby, this how you make me feel,
Baby, this how you make me feel,
This what you do to me.

[Verse 4:]
K.R.I.T
I'm done to go to war for this love we got,
Fight on the field of light
Fly, but all the shots that haters take.
Why bring formation, we own the field
This is ain't rocket science, we should just do the math, one plus one
It equals the world and all those things beyond
If it gets harder to breathe, I'll be the air in your lungs.
Put my life on the line, I do you right every time
Cause what we got is sublime and you shine
Like the sun heals later
But if you ever need each other from the worries of the world
I'm the one that you should run to, baby.
You make me sing the beats
It's power in our fingertips
There ain't no other love like this.
I prove it we do it like none all the time ships
And it's just that our rhythms are undercover
I know you're the type of queen that I take to meet my mother
And the type of freak that give me in right...

[Chorus:]
I'm a lady, I'm a woman,
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter.
But when I'm with you I have powers,
Supernatural, the love is ours.
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel,
Baby, this how you make me feel,
Baby, this how you make me feel,
This what you do to me.
That's what you do to me, baby. ---Lyrics submitted by Jackie Evans.
