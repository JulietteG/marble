Verse 1 
Nothing I ever did was good enough for you 
Nothing I ever did could ever seem to please you 
You always tried to make me feel small 
And all I did was give you my all 
Never felt pretty enough 
Never felt sexy enough 
Never felt good enough 
You tried to keep me down on my knees 
I got myself back up on my feet 
Found the strength to set myself free 

Chorus 

And I feel beautiful, beautiful 
I feel beautiful, beautiful 
You could not crush my soul 
Crush my soul 
Nothing you can do 
make you take away my right to feel 
Beautiful, beautiful 
I was down so low down so low 
But I wont be 
Wont be brought down anymore 
I stand with my head held high 
I feel beautiful 

Verse 2 
use to make me feel like I did nothing right 
Use to make me feel like I meant nothing in your life 
Always gave all I had to you 
All I wanted was for you too 
See me as pretty enough 
See me as sexy enough 
See me as good enough 
But all I did was waste all my time 
I woke up and open my eyes 
Finally took back hold of my life 

Chorus 
And now I feel beautiful, beautiful 
I feel beautiful, beautiful 
You could not crush my soul 
Crush my soul 
Nothing you can do 
make you take away my right to feel 
Beautiful, beautiful 
I was down so low down so low 
But I wont be 
Wont be brought down anymore 
I stand with my head held high 
I feel beautiful 


Bridge 

You tried to make me feel worthless 
Now I know Im not 
My worth is priceless 
I got back my pride 
I took back my life 

chorus 
And I feel beautiful, beautiful 
I feel beautiful, beautiful 
You could not crush my soul 
Crush my soul 
Nothing you can do 
make you take away my right to feel 
Beautiful, beautiful 
I was down so low down so low 
But I wont be 
Wont be brought down anymore 
I stand with my head held high 
I feel beautiful 

I feel beautiful 
Nothing you can say to me because I feel 
beautiful---Lyrics submitted by April.
