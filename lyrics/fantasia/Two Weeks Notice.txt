the love that me and you shared expired 
so there will be no renewing our contracts no
i aint got nothing since i been hired
so i cant take you back
i don gave you love and got no commission
so give me one reason why i should stay here
i thought compared to all the other guys you were different
but i don cried the same old tears
and baby baby i cant do this
i cant take it no

this is my two week notice 
i resigned my postion cuz you aint treatin me right
i been working on the job just busting my ass
pleasing you everyday and night 
i get no raises or no benefits to stay with this establishment 
im gone this is my two week notice

i'll be a fool if i took you back boy 
even tho i love you i cant be that dumb
cuz i can do bad all by myself i dont need no help
the day is over and done
its just a matter of if i leave you now 
maybe you didnt recognize the good you
aint it ashame that you took advantage of me and you should not be mad
i dont want the job no more she can have it

CHOURS

Packing up and im walking out
aint no stressing you cuz its over
must be gone as we finished
because i did my best now its ended
