Faking ish gone kill you boy I know the real you (repeat 4 times)

Verse 1:
You really gone make me 
Expose you for exactly what you are, you are
And Im feeling alittle wavy, 
So right now I dont mind pulling your card, yeah

Chorus:
And as hard as you try to hide reality
Why, we know the truth
So act brand new if you want to
But what would you be without me 
And where would you be without me

So what you blowing up just a little 
They knowing you a little
Dont give a finger in the middle
cause bumb nigga you would never be 
Without me

Where would you be without me
So what you blowing up just a little 
They knowing you a little
Dont give a finger in the middle
cause bumb nigga you would never be 

Oh na na Oh na Oh na na Oh na (repeat twice)

Verse 2:
You tell me that you make big moves 
But tell them what you really 
Do you really wanna play this game
(game game game game game game)
You should tell' em what you really like 
Tell'em you aint bout that life
I put you on... I let you shine
Now you so fly, shit blows my mind
Na, oh ooh oh 

(Back to Chorus)

Verse 3:
Boy you think Im stupid, what you think I'm clueless
You keep chasing them girls, boy you get the dueces
I'm sick of your excuses, without me how can you do it
Do bad all by myself, boy yo dick useless
Dude I dont need your sex, I'm moving to the next 
You frontin man you stuntin man you worse than my ex
Hahaha..ha..ha you think that ish funny
We know the truth boy keep it one hundred
