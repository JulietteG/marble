You come creeping in six in the morning like ain't nobody supposed to know,
say you been working but get in bed smelling just like a fresh bar of soap,
asked you about it you just turn your back get mad and then fall asleep got
a lot on your mind and an arguement is the last thing you need
(Chours) 
Baby you trippin' it dont go that way 
this ain't no movie or a Tyler Perry play 
if you really wanted to mess around thats 
all you had to say but i ain't going be itty bitty 
silly me so dont waste your energy, expect me 
to listen when all i keep hearing is you spitting 
nothing but game, Expect me to stay when all you 
can say one day everything will change wanna believe (wanna believe
that you won't do me wrong but you starting to bore me (bore me, Bore me mmm..Yawn 

I aint yelling or telling ya nothing about how i heard you getting down in the da there 
was sister way up on the other side of town aint got no but yall mid as well had be walking 
right in to me aint no way in the hell i a let slide how could you do it to me 
(Chours) 
Now baby girl i refuse to let it go down like this  baby girl you must of bumped your head 
every time you go assuming you know you make a fool out of you got them other girls out of 
my world and your the only one trying to make it clear hope you feel me my dear.....
