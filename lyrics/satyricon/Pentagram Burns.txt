Hellbent and raw
Armed to the core
Walks with the wind
Determined and strong
Inherit his laws
Adopt and obey

Rise my friend - march to war
Time is up - shadows dance
Fight my friend - tyrants pull
Time is up - burn the world

Driven by sin
Let the scavengers loose
Power from hell
Siege and advance
Silence the foe
Fire and smoke
From the slumber arise
Triumphant Beast of forgotten times

The Pentagram Burns
and the clock strikes the hour
The Final Hour---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
