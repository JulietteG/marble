[Ludicrous]
Yeah we right back at you between the sheets
Making sure you get a good night sleep
We gonna send this next one out to the ladies
So get a firm grip and hold on tight as the home boy Sean Garrett take you on a ride
(Oooo)Luda! (Oooo yeah) I dont think they ready dog (ay!)

[Sean Garrett]
Look at you
Girl remember what you said that I could not have when I met you
When I told you one day girl up in my bed id get you
Now you wont stop asking when Im coming through again
Tell me Tell Me Tell Me now

When I walked up on you, you told me that I didnt know you 
Said their aint no point getting your number cuz I cant call you
Told me that you liked them boys and big toys and little boys you dont do
Wait a minute stop stressing shawty couldnt have said that now let me bring that back
I keep it low just for girls who think they like you
Thinking you get no paper just cuz you aint flashing no jewels
Baby girl my bank account stuffed like that pillow that youre squeezing on
Dont you know how many of my songs are running on the radio

[Chorus]
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed 
Grippin on the bed grippin on the bed
I told you girl this you werent ready for
Grippin on the bed girl what you cant take no more
We got the neighbors and them complaining about the banging of the headboard
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed
Grippin on the bed grippin on the bed
I told you girl this you werent ready for 
Grippin on the bed, look at you grippin on the bed
We got the neighbors n them complaining about the banging of the headboard 

Now you screaming now you need me please dont leave me I cant get enough
All the things you said youd never do your doing to me all too good
Your even doing things to me I cant tell even if I thought you would
[Woo woo woo woo, woo woo woo woo slow down]
Take it easy baby, before you can let go
Cuz Im a beast when I go in girl Im telling you
and heres a lesson baby, never say what you wanna do
Cuz I got you Grippin on the bed in your Birthday suit

[Chorus]
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed 
Grippin on the bed grippin on the bed
I told you girl this you werent ready for
Grippin on the bed girl what you cant take no more
We got the neighbors and them complaining about the banging of the headboard
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed
Grippin on the bed grippin on the bed
I told you girl this you werent ready for 
Grippin on the bed, look at you grippin on the bed
We got the neighbors n them complaining about the banging of the headboard 

(Ludicrous)
Yea I hear them complaining but look here its Luda
 I got you grippin on the bed loving when u make that face cuz u like the way I do it
Bust through the doorway rip off your top and bottom and then I get right to it
Then Im all neck I get rite through it
You can call it jack and coke
Wrap your legs around my waist squeeze tight then I grab your ugh 
Neighbors complaining
Hating the headboard we gonna make it bang
So sit your five dollar ass down cuz Im gonna make some change
Then Im really gonna make it rain
Then u really gonna take some pain
I dont let it whoop me I whoop that booty like BANG BANG BANG BANG

(Chorus)
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed 
Grippin on the bed grippin on the bed
I told you girl this you werent ready for
Grippin on the bed girl what you cant take no more
We got the neighbors and them complaining about the banging of the headboard
Grippin on the bed look at you grippin on the bed
Grippin on the bed grippin on the bed
I told you girl this you werent ready for 
Grippin on the bed, look at you grippin on the bed
We got the neighbors n them complaining about the banging of the headboard---Lyrics submitted by shawna.
