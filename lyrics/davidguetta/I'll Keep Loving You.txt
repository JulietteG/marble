(feat. Jaymes Young & Birdy)

I've known from the start
You would break my heart
You are Who you are
But I keep loving you
I want you to know
I'm not perfect soul
I'm a Rolling Stone
But I keep loving you

For the rest of my life
I promise that I
I'll keep loving you
Oh I will stand by your side
I promise that I
I'll keep loving you

I know you can see
I'm not what you need
My spirit's free
But I keep loving you
You are so wild
You, the restless smile
I'm wondering why
But I keep loving you

For the rest of my life
I promise that I
I'll keep loving you
Oh I will stand by your side
I promise that I
I'll keep loving you

I' m only a man
I give you my love
But I make mistakes
'Cuz its in my blood
The wild is so fun
The flaw is in the flesh

For the rest of my life
I promise that I
I'll keep loving you
Oh I will stand by your side
I promise that I
I'll keep loving you---
