So good to be bad
Getting what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad?

You see, why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Cause if it's struggle that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am

Oh baby, here I am

I say so why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad

So good to be bad
Getting what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad?

You see, why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Cause if it's struggle that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am

Oh baby, here I am

You see, why does it feel so good?---
