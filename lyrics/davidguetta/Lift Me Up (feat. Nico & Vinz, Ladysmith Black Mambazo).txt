Inside a soul, there's a hero to discover
There's no way we can't triumph with our struggle
I'm just like you, are you tryna bring me down?
I'm just like you, help me turn this thing around

I dream at night of a better day
You and I in a better place
Don't know how but I know that I'll reach it
Don't know where but I know that we'll meet it

Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up to higher ground
Not too proud to say I need you now
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down

We are meant to be here for one another
Don't forget you're my sister, you're my brother
I'm just like you, I've got troubles on my own
I'm just like you, I am tryna make it home

I dream at night of a better day
You and I in a better place
Don't know how but I know that I'll reach it
Don't know where but I know that we'll meet it

Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up to higher ground
Not too proud to say I need you now
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down

Don't bring me down
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Don't bring me down
Oh oh oh
Ah oh ah
Yeah yeah yeah

Inside a soul, there's a hero to discover
There's no way we can't triumph with our struggle
I'm just like you, are you tryna bring me down?
I'm just like you, help me turn this thing around---
