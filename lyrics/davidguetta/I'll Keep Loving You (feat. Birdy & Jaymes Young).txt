I've known from the start
You would break my heart
You are cruel, you are
But I'll keep loving you
I want you to know
I'm not perfect, so
I'm a rolling stone
But I'll keep loving you

For the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
I, I'll stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving you

But no, you can't see
I'm not what you need
My spirit's free
But I'll keep loving you
You are so wild
You've a restless mind
I won't renounce
But I'll keep loving you

For the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
I, I'll stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving you

I'm only a man
I'll give you my love
But I make mistakes
Cause it's in my blood
The world is so full
Of flaws and of rules
I promise that I
Will love you for you

For the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
I, I'll stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving you---
