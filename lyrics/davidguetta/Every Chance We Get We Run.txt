The way I love you
I can't get to know you
I could try
But I don't want anyone but barely sweet tonight

Your bed, before you
Your trust, you know you
I could choose
But I don't want anything bad to come of you

We are born
We love this on our own
But any chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run

We are shown
We live this on our own
But any chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run

And yes, it's been on you
It seems we love you
You could try
But you don't want anyone, together spend the night

A stage before us
How strong I caress
We could try
But we don't want anything to change our mood tonight

We are born
We love this on our own
But any chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run

We are shown
We live this on our own
But any chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run ---
