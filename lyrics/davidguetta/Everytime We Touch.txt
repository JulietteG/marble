Everytime, everytime
Everytime we touch, I feel it

I feel it
Everytime we touch

Everytime we touch
Emotions that I cant contain
Are sweeping over me again
Everytime we touch
Sensations I can not explain
Are washing all away my pain
Everytime we touch
A magic spring from deep inside
Comes into me like breathe of light
Everytime we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Everytime we touch

Everytime we touch
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me

Everytime we touch (yeah)
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch

Ohh

Everytime you're near
And I feel so good inside (yeah)

Everytime we touch
The secrets of my beating heart
Are breaking free out of the dark
Everytime we touch
All the things I can't express
Feel me with such happiness
Everytime we touch
All the changes that helped me father
Broke and crumbling to the ground
Everytime we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Everytime we touch

Everytime we touch
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me

Everytime we touch (yeah)
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch

And it feels so good inside
And I feel it, so alive and
Everything that feels so right
And I feel it so alive
Everything that feels so right (yeah yeah)---Lyrics submitted by juiw.
