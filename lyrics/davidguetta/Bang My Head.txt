(feat. Sia)

I was bound, was tired
Hadn't seen a light for son
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn't my way back home
And I found daylight stepping out of me
I was bound, and tired
Waiting for daylight

Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed, I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all

When you think you're giving up
Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't
And you the feel the love, something out of you
But when you think of giving up, don't

Bang your head against the wall
You may feel light headed, but you won't crawl, no, you won't fall
You will rise above it all
You'll find what you're searching for
And you may feel light headed
You think you're gonna hit the floor
Instead you rise above it all

Oh, oh, oh
Bang your head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead you rise above it all

I have broken wings
I keep trying, keep trying
No one get out
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying

Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed, I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Bang my head against the wall
Instead I rise above it all---
