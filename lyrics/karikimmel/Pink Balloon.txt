VERSE I
Sing me a song, buy me a pink balloon                                                
Tell me your dreams, I'll make 'em all come true  
You don't have to wait too long, we could set out tomorrow morning 

VERSE II
Bring me a kiss, bring me the sun and moon
Maybe some roses,that would be nice, too 
And I'll be your favourite girl, and we'll run around the world forever

CHORUS
   And we will fall in love     forever
   And we will fall in love     forever  
   La la laa, la la laa

VERSE III
Out in the rain, we'll find a big elm tree

Sip on champagne, we'll do whatever we please
We'll dance and then we'll lay under the moonlit haze forever

         Yeah, yeah, yeah

Chorus
   And we will fall in love     forever
   And we will fall in love     forever
   La la laa, la la laa,     forever
   La la laa, la la laa,     forever, yeah
   La la laa, la la laa,     forever---Lyrics submitted by saira.
