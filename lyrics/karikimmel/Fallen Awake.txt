Not another lonely night
Not another restless time
What happened to the days when we used to care
It used to hurt, I used to break
The silence almost made me crazy
It didnt matter then, why should it matter now

How long can we try, can we keep holding on
Were too scared to give up but weve been here so long
Are we fooling ourselves
Have we fallen awake
Is it too late

I cant remember why were here
I cant remember when you last touched me
I hate the way this feels, but I dont know how to change

Chorus

Cause I dont wanna go
But I dont wanna live like this hopping someday youll wake up
Somethings gotta change
Someones gotta give
Cause I cant keep waiting here wondering what were missing
I just wanna know---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
