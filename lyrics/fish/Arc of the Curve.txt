Do you remember the magic of the moment, 
When forever was only words away,
When we believed everything was certain,
And all we had to do was fulfill promises we'd made,

And cherish hope between us and our dreams were always safe,
We'd always be together and in that I had my faith
I put a ring upon your finger, and that smile upon your face

And I told you, that I couldn't love you more,
And we longed for the arc of the curve.
We launched on the arc of the curve,

We touched the stars.

The fairy tale, the breathless rush of romance,
If love is blind then I will never see again,
When we awoke the spell remained unbroken,
Our souls entwined, in afterglow, you held my beating heart,
Blew away my shadows, you kissed the tears from my eyes,
And you told me that you couldn't love me more,
We sailed on the arc of the curve,
We flew on the arc of the curve,

And touched the stars.
And touched the stars

The days are long the nights are longer,
In every minute there's a thought of you,
I can't forget the magic of the moments,
I stare into the mirror to pretend I'm not alone,
It takes everything I have not to call you on the phone,
Just to tell you that I couldn't love you more,
That I'm lost on the arc of the curve,
Careering on the arc of the curve,
Crashing on the arc of the curve.
This arc of the curve.

I could never contemplate that you would ever walk away---Lyrics submitted by Raul.
