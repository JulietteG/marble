Hey girl
I'm through it
Don't know how I'm supposed to get home
Blow up blow up and do up
Hey girl
So glad you picked up the phone
Sick and tired of being alone
Yeah listen
Ay ay ay ay ay

Several cups of the rose
I think I need the patron
I heard you got a new guy
What the hell girl
You done moved on
But you ain't even tell me
So what am I supposed to do now
Just let you go and be happy
Hell naw girl
You and him cut it out

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
We broke up but girl I want you back
Fuck that nigga that you think you've found
And when I see him girl it's going down
I ain't playing with him no
I'm just saying you can do better
We were better
And though we've fussed and fight
We can make it through whatever
So why you playing with him yeah

Fuck it yeah
I'm getting in my car now
I'm swerving to your condo
Concierge better not be tripping
I'm a fuck shit up like pronto
I'm waiting in the lobby yeah
They say they calling 911
But I don't care girl
They can hall me away I'm love drunk

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
We broke up but girl I want you back
Fuck that nigga that you think you've found
And when I see him girl it's going down
I ain't playing with him no
I'm just saying you can do better
We were better
And though we've fussed and fight
We can make it through whatever
So why you playing with him yeah

Don't get me wrong girl I like to party
Flirt a little bit take shots off a body
But I'm a compromise cause I don't want another nigga sliding inside what's mine
Damn my stomach hurt
The thought of that shit got a nigga feeling sick
Damn my stomach hurt

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
We broke up but girl I want you back
Fuck that nigga that you think you've found
And when I see him girl it's going down
I ain't playing with him no
I'm just saying you can do better
We were better
And though we've fussed and fight
We can make it through whatever
So why you playing with him yeah---
