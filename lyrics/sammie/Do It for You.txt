Girl what is this magic I feel inside?
Why cant I breathe when you're nearby?
My heart is pounding so hard,
I think of you so much that I cant see.
You're like a rose that blooms in spring, 
you're like the snow that winter brings,
and i'd give anything just to have you talk to me.

Oh girl I, I get so excited when I see you passing by
Oh girl I, I get so excited when we make contact eye to eye

I'll take detention time for you
Give all my allowance all to you
Do your chores and homework too
I would do it for you
Trade in a trip to Disneyland
Just for a chance to hold your hand
Just as sure as my name is Sam,
I would do it for you
Oh girl I, I'd do it all for you.

Girl forever is still not enough time
 for me to spend with you
But I would walk a thousand miles just to have a chance to look into your eyes
You're like a dream when i'm awake 
I dont know how much I can take 
I wish that I could find the perfect words to say

Oh girl I, I get so excited when I see you passing by
Oh girl I, I get so excited when we make contact eye to eye
"
I'd take detention time for you
Give all my allowance all to you
Do your chores and homework too
I would do it all for you baby
Trade in a trip to Disneyland 
Just for the chance to hold your hand
Just as sure as my name is Sam
I would do it, all for you baby

Oh girl I, I get so excited when I see you passing by
Oh girl I, I get so excited when we make,when we make contact eye to eye
I'll take it

Detention time for you, 
Give all my allowance all to you.
Do your chores and homework too
I would, do it for you
Trade in a trip to disneyland
Just for the chance to hold your hand
Just as sure as my name is Sam
I would do it for you

Oh girl I, I'd do it all for you....---Lyrics submitted by darian.
