Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know that you powerful lovin' is soothing to me
Soothin' to me

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
You know your powerful loving is
Soothing to me

Listen Jerry, I used to have a lot of girls
I had 'em big and small
But since I met that woman of mine
I don't need no other girl at all

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know that your powerful lovin' is
Soothing to me

Lord, I did at lot of gambling
I drink liquor and stay out all night long 
But ever since I met that woman of mine
I keep around at home

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know that your powerful lovin' is 
Soothing to me

Soothe me baby, soothe me 
Soothe me with you kindness
For you know that your powerful loving is
Soothing to me

Soothe me baby, soothe me 
Soothe me with you kindness
For you know that your powerful loving is
Soothing to me---Lyrics submitted by Invisible.
