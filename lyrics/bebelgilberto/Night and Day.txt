Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

Day and night, why is it so?
That this longing for you follows
Wherever I go

In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me

And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making
Love to you
Day and night, night and day---
