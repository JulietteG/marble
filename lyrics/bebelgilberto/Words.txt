Words...
I need some words
To explain my pain
And describe my misbehave

close...
Come close to me
And give me something worth
Something true I must believe

why we always have so much held inside
Why does love never end
Oh why we always go so far all the way
Where there's nothing to say

sente...
Perto de mim
Escuta aqui o que ninguem viu nem quis ouvir

vem...
Vou te levar
Vou te encostar-te de l
Ser com esta cano

why we always have so much held inside
Why does life won't never change
Oh why we always go so far all the way
Where there's nothing to say

oh why...---
