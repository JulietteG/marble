The tides are turning, there rolling in,
The seas of past lives tell me where Ive been.
Ive seen the shelter from deep inside,
And watch my spirit come out and fly.

Chorus
Here with me in this drifting story of our lives,
Ill follow you down to the places lost but never found.

So as the telling goes, I wonder what was shown,
To you will be living in this number.
In the deepest part of night I lie awake in awe,
Of paths that lie in front of me.
Are they blocked by fear or apathy,
Unlike an eagle getting water.

Chorus
Here with me in this drifting story of our lives,
Ill follow you down to the places lost but never found.

(Double intro lick) ad lib lead

Here with me in this drifting story of our lives,
Ill follow you down to the places lost but never found.
Youre here with me, youre here with me, youre here me
Youre here with me in the places lost but never found.---Lyrics submitted by Dean.
