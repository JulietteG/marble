Walking through a sharpen center
On the very screech adventure
I tilt my head to the gap you walked on before
Shifting through the magazines
Crawling out a bag and cheat
Looking at the pile of all the things we took
As it bounces out, we couldn't give a fuck

Where do you go
When your arms are 'neath the rainbow?
Write a letter to yourself
And you, you got to let go

Take a walk outside
The rain is never ending
We don't want you in your space
It's time to stop pretending

We rise above the clouds
We rise above the clouds

Never kissed me, accusations
I'm down in conversation
I can't control my laughter
When you're so sincere
Take control, my life going so slow, tempting

Where do you go
When your arms are 'neath the rainbow?
Write a letter to yourself
And you, you got to let go

Take a walk outside
The rain is never ending
We don't want you in your space
It's time to stop pretending

We rise above the clouds
We rise above the clouds---
