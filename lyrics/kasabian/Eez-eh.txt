Eez-eh, I'll make you mad  
'least I ain't sleazy  
I'm just trying to pull the world to rights  
And if you want to,  
I'll take you high  
An' I got the feeling that I'm-  
Gonna keep you up all  
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Night!  

Tired of taking orders  
Choking with disorders  
The wrong men have the power  
It's turning my milk sour  

We're tired of taking orders  
Coping with disorders  
The wrong men have the power  
It's turning my milk sour  
It's turning my milk sour
It's turning my milk sour

Eez-eh, I'll make you mad  
'least I ain't sleazy  
I'm just trying to pull the world to rights  
And if you want to,  
I'll take you high  
'cause I got the feeling that I'm-  
Gonna keep you up all night!  

Eez-eh, I ain't that mad  
No rhyme or reason  
I'm just trying to set the world alight  
You got problems,  
and so have I  
An' I got the feeling that I'm-  
Gonna keep you up all  
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Night!  

There's Cobras in the mosh pit  
Finally we lost it  
Everyday is brutal  
Now we're being watched my Google  

Gotta keep it simple  
Sending out a signal  
Everyday is brutal   
Now we're   
Being watched my Google  
Being watched my Google
Being watched my Google

Eez-eh, I'll make you mad  
'least I ain't sleazy  
I'm just trying to pull the world to rights  
And if you want to,  
I'll take you high  
'cause I got the feeling that I'm-  
Gonna keep you up all night!  

Eez-eh, I ain't that mad  
No rhyme or reason  
I'm just trying to set the world alight  
You got problems,  
and so have I  
An' I got the feeling that I'm-  
Gonna keep you up all   
Gonna keep you up all
Gonna keep you up all
Night!---
