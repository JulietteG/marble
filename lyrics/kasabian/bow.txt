What is this? If it ain't love
Then it's over
Understand me when I tell you
That we just can't keep on holdin' on to this

And all your friends
They are saying that I'm no good
Are you kiddin'?
This is mental cause you know what we had
Was broken from the start

And we're both standing here
I'm double up the feeling
The harder is the worse you try
But this love has got to stop

Take a bow and say goodbye
Let the hours pass on by
That you get to feel so high
And it's over, it's all over now

What is this? If it ain't love
Then it's over
And understand, nothing lasts forever

And now I say to you
As loud as the silence
We just can't carry on
And in the morning I'll be gone

Take a bow and say goodbye
Let the hours pass on by
Now you get to feel so high
It's over, it's all over now
Take a bow and close your eyes
For a moment fantasize
That you get to feel like, get to feel like
It's all over now

You tell me that I'm free
So I can see it all
Not my tears, this is the end
If I don't kiss and dance

Take a bow and close your eyes
For a moment fantasize
Now you get to feel like, get to feel like
It's all over now, it's all over now
It's all over now, it's all over now---
