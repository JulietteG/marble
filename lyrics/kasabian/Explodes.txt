I barely made it alive
I came incredibly close
Jumped in a swimming pool
Its there I saw my ghost

He said listen up
Boy, now heres the squeeze
Youd rather die on your feet
Than live a life on your knees

On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes

I think alone at night
I find it hard to sleep
Reliving memories
Im sick of counting sheep

I have my bag and baggage
To keep me warm
I zip my coat up tight
As I walk into the storm

On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes

I aint scared of the dark
Its where I see her the most
Questioning my thoughts
Like a talk show host

So whered I go from here?
Now entertainments wrong
Cant let the viewers decide
I know, Im done
Im done

On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head implodes---
