Drowning in the lake!
I only left her for
A couple of seconds.

And now she's gone.

Waking up for what?
As I pace back and forth.
Maybe it's time to move away.
But what would that prove anyway?

Listening to the answering machine,
Over and over.
Only to hear your voice one more time.
Just one more time!

"It's not your fault"
That's what they all keep saying.
Blaming my sight,
There's nothing left.
Why do I bother praying?

Beg me for directions,
Like I have all the answers.
I neglected her life,
So now what,
What do I do with mine?---Lyrics submitted by Andisaurus.
