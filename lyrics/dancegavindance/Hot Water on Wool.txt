If we could only be in different places,
Among the same faces we can't forget,
I'd debt to the very distinction of love and hate
They're both in our hearts, we choose an imbalance
Oh, the thought, we are the force that make us
That must be why we're suffering

Interaction, delayed reaction
I've got taxes, and bills to pay
Somethings flapping, it's wings at me
Someone's clapping, I guess we're on t.v.

slow down, you broke down,
slow down
stop now? [x4]
indefinitely

Moving in the right direction
I'm waiting to see if it comes to me,
or if it's tied to a safe that just hit the sea floor
Maybe I'll sleep, maybe I'll sleep through the century
I'm waiting to see if it comes to me,
or if it's tied to a safe that just hit the sea floor
What was going through my head?

Touch the pressure point on my neck
My head will snap off and fall into
The secret passage we built for enjoyment
Don't bring this to the picture
Did you manage your time?
Do you know how I do?
Downpour [x4]
On the point of your fucking patience

So I'll make this up, so we could proudly sign
Shit has come to this, it feels like no body's home
So my cover is blown, [x2]
And I won't forget what it means---Lyrics submitted by R.
