Stop! The first one to hit the cop wins.
His death was so obvious.
Make up the things that you did.
I hid in the bushes,
I was tripping on thizz.
Description, of no sir, you can't ignore.
The lights- they are blinding,
and you, man, are such a bore.

Please smas the target! [x3]
Right wear the heart sits.

Whoever said we had to stop this from happening?
My plans changed abruptly and you chose to flee
this unstable setting.
And I'll only survive if it's you by my side.

I got that necklace.
I got that watch.
I copped that blow torch
off your front porch.

And I'll only survive in this life...

I got that bottle opf jack.
I got five on that sack.
If this fails, then I'll bail you out of jail.
T's so obvious.
You're constantly blocking me from rational thinking.

Maybe I look good in leather.
In my bed, I pluck your feathers.
We should fucking be together.
No look alive and say you've gotta go.
Brace me honey, I need friction.
Slur my words. Correct my diction.
It's not always fact or fiction.
I made the plan; I'll make my own plan.
You've gotta go.
Well, don't it feel good?
You got what you paid for. [x2]

Period colon grammar arsenal,
I think we need some brand new barstools,
a new decor.
Oh man! That car's cool!
I changed the plan; I bought my own plan.

The night was innocent, 
but she'll never believe that I was alone.
The night was innocent!
Reciting words I never meant to write.

You want a piece of my mind? That's fine! [x3]

Just keep your arms around me,
And I won't let your body touch...
won't let it touch the ground.
Just keep your eyes on me,
And let me be your gravity.

Until you can, can sleep sound. [x5]---Lyrics submitted by Cynthia.
