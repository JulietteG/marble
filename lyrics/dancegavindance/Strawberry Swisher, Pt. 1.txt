Please girl, stay to the early morning.
We can have some coffee, you can do my laundry.
Please girl, stay, don't mind the clutter.
Get back in bed yeah,
Mickey Mouse covers, oh girl, on your body.

Please girl, stay.
Oh darling, please girl, stay.
Oh sugar, please girl, stay 'til the early morning.

And I'm not really sure what we did last night,
so let's explore each other's minds.
And I know that you can find the time, indulge me.

Your cherry lips linger on mine,
I took the plum right from the vine.
Oh girl, I wouldn't waste your time, indulge me.
And I'm not really sure what we did last night, (please girl, stay)
So let's explore each other's minds, (please girl, stay)
And I know that you can find the time, (please girl, stay 'til the early morning)
Indulge me.

All along the watchtower,
they'll be singing our song forever.
All along the watchtower,
they'll be singing our song forever.

One day, you'll see what it means to bleed.
One day, you'll see what it means..

(Entire song x2)---Lyrics submitted by R.
