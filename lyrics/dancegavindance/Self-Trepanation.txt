One day I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything.
One day I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything.
One day I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything.
One day I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything.

No one believes me
No one believes me

They're always on your side, every time
And are you right?
And are you right?
Backseat driver, you're driving me insane
I happen to know exactly where I'm going

What's your agenda?
What's your agenda?
What's your agenda?

No one believes me
No one believes me
No one believes me
No one believes me---Lyrics submitted by R.
