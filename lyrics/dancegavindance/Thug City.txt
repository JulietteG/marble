Haha!
Dance Gavin Dance baby!
Downtown Battle Mountain Two!

First it's the casting call, but I'm playing basketball
My wife she notifies that I missed a call on my phone
Now why are you snooping, when you should be cooking?
If you read my texts one more time!

If you fill the pageant bowl I will be masterful
Well full of liquid comedy, namaste, your baller bag is on its way
Red full of lexicons, polishing mega tron
If you beat the ho, you'll tell your friends, "I need this, yo!"

Stop and don't panic. I've got a plan,
Let's both pretend you didn't take that one night stand, oh
So hide you face, collect your things;
This is what we call the walk of shame
Oh, pretty lady, I know the cost at the gate, you're almost there

Next, it's the pinnacle of me being cynical
Can I be the lynch pin compelling to judge a lottery?
Baggy and awfully, bumpy and blistery
Brutally, homeless and fluffy

Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in your head
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside
(So nice, so nice to meet you)

Lift your head for the last time
Lift it higher and higher and high

How can you love something you can't see?
How can you love something you can't touch? x3

Ohh, ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in your head
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide.
(So nice, so nice to meet you)---Lyrics submitted by Jordyn Sykes.
