Sunrise wake up stand up look into red eyes
Stayed up all night thinking of reasons why 
I can't feel your skin
Is this plaguing your brain?
Is this plaguing your brain?

Couldn't brace yourself for the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learn to heal with take time

Close the hatch (Now breathe in wide)
And lock us inside (I'll forgive you later)
Close the hatch (Come on it's time)
And lock us inside (Just stand aside)

All these reasons why
I am reaching wide
I am sticking to all these one liners
And all this means, and all I have to say

Stay till my word
Because I can stand you to the side
Cut off these ties, till this is why
We were holding to one night

Breathe in without love
Here me form these lines
Falling in love 
I have been reading lies

Watch this turn to dust
I won't know when you've fallen
Now it all takes shape
I won't go until you follow

Couldn't brace yourself for the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learn to heal with take time

I don't even get the movie
Cold ice feels so soothing 
I don't even get the movie
Cold ice feels so soothing

Watch this turn to dust
I won't know when you've fallen
Now it all takes shape
I won't go until you follow

I don't feel anything, stuck in the passing lane
I don't feel anything, stuck in the passing lane

Break, wait, stop back off the bitch!
Break, wait, stop back off the bitch!
Break, wait, stop back off the bitch!

Block out the sound of the police beckoning
Duck in the back and the lights will shut off again
You can go for it, just don't ignore it
Ration the wine, laughing in revelry
You can go for it just don't ignore it
Caution i'm drug well here comes the symphony---Lyrics submitted by Brissa.
