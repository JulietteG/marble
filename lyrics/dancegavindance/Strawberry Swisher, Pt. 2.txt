Could you stay a little longer?
I could really use the extra time.
I don't know why I even care.
'Cause I'm never really there.
I'm sure he must be a real nice guy.

What a relief, he'll carry you to sleep.

And I don't know what we could have done.
And maybe this time I will learn to love again.
I will always be your friend.

See, this is why we don't talk anymore.
'Cause you'll always be waiting to settle the score.
And every second could be the next meltdown.
If I wasn't leaving you wouldn't make a sound.

So this is why we don't talk anymore.

Now I don't have to be a real nice guy, what a relief.---Lyrics submitted by R.
