You gave me wings to fly above
The crowded streets where there's no love
You gave me ways to figure out
What this life is all about
You let me hear your voice, that softly speaks
Guiding me  and gives me peace

You let me make my own mistakes
So I can learn what it takes
And I will love the best I know
Thank you for the ways I grow 
Showing me the place where I can stand

[CHORUS:]
And I will not forget you gave you life for me
Not a gift too small to recognize
Standing at your door you give your hand to me
The worth of souls, is great in your eyes.

This life you've given me
Sure has  tasted sweet
And now I know  through all the noise
I sing out loud  you hear my voice
I feel that I've been blessed beyond my needs

[CHORUS:] 
( x2 ) 

Is great in your eyes. 
Great in your eyes. ( x2 )---Lyrics submitted by Aubree Bates.
