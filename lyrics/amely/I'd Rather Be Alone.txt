Well Ill be fine
Just laying here tonight, thinking about the world
If you don't mind, then let me be so I can feel alive again

For Ive been hiding, Ive been searching for a reason to escape 
But I am trying, no Im lying to myself cause Im a fake
Theres no other way to go
Oh I'd rather be alone
'Cause I've been trying but I'm dying now 
So please give me some hope

Tell me what you meant when you said you missed me
Tell me how you felt when you dared to kiss me
Oh ah oh, oh ah oh, I'd rather be alone
Tell me what you meant when you said you missed me
Tell me how you felt when you dared to kiss me
Oh ah oh, oh ah oh I'd rather be alone

Well dear, I mind
Now that you say you're trying, it's only getting worse
So leave my side, I don't need your lies to write another verse

For I've been hiding, I've been searching for a reason I should stay
But I am trying, no I'm lying to another the same way.
There's no other way to go 
Oh, I'd rather be alone
'Cause I've been trying, but I'm dying now
I've given up on hope

Tell me what you meant when you said you missed me
Tell me how you felt when you dared to kiss me
Oh ah oh, oh ah oh, I'd rather be alone
Tell me what you meant when you said you missed me
Tell me how you felt when you dared to kiss me
Oh ah oh, oh ah oh I'd rather be alone

With no one right here by my side
I'll live a cold and lonely life
I'd rather be this way then give my love to just anyone

Tell me what you meant when you said you missed me
Tell me how you felt when you dared to kiss me
Oh ah oh, oh ah oh, I'd rather be alone
Tell me what you meant when you said you missed me
Tell me how you felt when you dared to kiss me
Oh ah oh, oh ah oh I'd rather be alone---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
