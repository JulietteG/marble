If this were a book,
Itd start with the line,
I once knew a man,
I was his and he was mine,
Its so predictable,
Im so confused,
Im at a loss for words to explain my mood,

I stitch this poem to the bottom of my dress,
The one that touches me directly on my legs,
Ill wear that poem up until,
It sits over my heart,
And I hold it tight,
And dream
Away La La La La Li

If this were a book,
Itd start with the line,
I once knew a man,
I was his and he was mine,
Its so predictable,
Im so confused,
Im at a loss for words to explain my mood,

I stitch this poem to the bottom of my dress,
The one that touches me directly on my legs,
And dream
Away La La La La Li

Baby wont you help me be my best,
Baby, help me find a way back to our nest,
And dream

All away La La La La La x3---Lyrics submitted by Shontai Simic.
