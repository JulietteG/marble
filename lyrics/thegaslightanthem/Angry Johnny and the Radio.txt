Don't think twice, I still believe it John.
We lived those nights, like we were dying...
On the long haul drives, for our Amaria...
With the ragged sails high, and the radio on.

And I always have remembered, in case you're wondering,
84 takes a lifetime, and Bobby does it better.
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria.
I don't drive nowhere, without the radio on.

And I'm still here singin'... Thinking 'bout the government.
In my old man shoes, and how you'd understand that.
Are you hiding in a basement, mixin' up the medicine?
Every April Fool's I say your name.
I know you name.
I still know your name.

[Chorus]---
