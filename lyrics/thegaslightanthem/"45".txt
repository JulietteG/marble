Have you seen my hands, just look at 'em shake
And the song just keeps on repeating, drop the needle again
And I dance with your ghost
Oh but that aint the way
I cant move on and I cant stay the same
And all my friends say

Hey, turn the record over
Hey, I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet

But have you seen my heart,
Have you seen how it bleeds
And the nights are so long baby
Out here in the deep
The tick-ticking of hours lonely
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms
But better sense says

Hey, turn the record over
Hey, I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet

And all my friends say:
Hey, turn the record over
Hey, I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let her go, let somebody else lay at my feet
Where you used to be
Where you used to be
Where you used to be
Here with me---Lyrics submitted by Jan Ballerstein.
