See I've been here for 28 years
Pounding sweat beneath these wheels
We tatooed lines beneath our skin
No surrender my Bobby Jean
X2

We've been burned by all our fears
Just from growing up around here
Our father's factories marked our cars
While Eden burned against the stars

And Sally said,Sally said
"I can't take no more regret.
It cut us deep into our souls
Came & climbed into our bed."
And Sally said, Sally said
"Meet me by the rivers edge
We're gonna wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again."

You know I had these ballroom dreams
That as a child came to me
I was a boy in Grandma's arms
A mother's pride & a wounded heart
And I was full with fiery wonder
You wore Audrey Hepburn pearls
You were the only one who understood me then
And the only one who will

And Sally said, Sally said
"I can't take no more regret.
It cut us deep into our souls
Came & climbed into our bed."
And Sally said, Sally said
"Meet me by the river's edge
We're gonna wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again."

And now I drive the 101 on the California night
And I'm amazed at all the stars beneath that old Hollywood sign
And they waltz a ballet on the boulevard to a place we never kept
And I'm not sure if we belong here, if I ever really left, or if I can go home

And Sally said, Sally said
"I can't take no more regret
It cut us too deep into our souls
Came & climbed into our bed."
And Sally said, Sally said
"Meet me by the river's edge
We're gonna wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again."

Now no retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
Meet me by the river's edge
