And in the first year of my former life
I was 17 and a wildfire burning
If I stretched out my hands I was convinced I could conjure angels
And yeah I was pretty sure she was bulletproof
At least I never saw anybody ever get to you
I used to wonder all the time if you made it out
to the point of ritual,
to the point of a ritual

And I used to die every night
All in your honor,
in your honor, oh, in your honor
While you were gone,
While you were gone

And in the last hours before sunrise
Im not sure if I passed out or closed my eyes
I woke into a dream where I know I knew,
somebody had just got their claws in you
And your breath heaves in silent anythings,
like a subconscious ritual

Yeah, yeah

And I used to die every night
All in your honor,
in your honor, oh, in your honor
While you were gone,
While you were gone

And if youre gonna break my heart, it might as well be tonight
And if youre gonna break my heart, it might as well be tonight

I used to die every sweet, sweet night
All in your honor
And I used to die every night
All in your honor,
in your honor, oh, in your honor
While you were gone,
While you were gone
In the throes of rebellion
In the throes of rebellion
In the throes of rebellion---Lyrics submitted by Jan Ballerstein.
