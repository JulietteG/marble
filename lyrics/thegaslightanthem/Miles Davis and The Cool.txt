Like Miles Davis, I've been swayed by the Cool.
There's just something 'bout the summertime.
There's just something 'bout the moon.
So I'll lay a kiss on this stone, toss it upside your window, by the roof.
Before you change your mind, Miles bring in the Cool.

Now honey put on your red dress & your diamond sole shoes.
Climb on down from that window.
Climb on outta your room.
Cuz I never had a good thing
And I've always had the blues.
And I heard that you always kinda wandered, Miles strike up the Cool.

Don't wait too long to come home.
My how the years & our youth pass on.
Don't wait too long to come home.
I will leave the front light on.
If the night is all wrong, don't wait too long.

Look, poor Mr. Pitiful, I can't turn you loose.
You move like a dream I had,
Woke up sweatin' in my room.
But your mama's got plans,
And your daddy's aim is true.
She never understood that it ain't no good,
Papa never heard the Cool.
So now I've got up my nerve, & I found me a stone
With a flick of the wrist & a turn of the key
You'll just fall in my arms.

Don't wait too long to come home.
My how the years & our youth pass on.
Don't wait too long to come home.
I will leave the front light on.
If the night is all wrong, don't wait too long.

So why don't you sing to me on this long drive home.
Let the sound of your voice sway sweet & slow.
As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground.
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground.
We might always be blue.

Jackson!

So don't wait too long to come home.
My how the years & our youth pass on.
Don't wait too long to come home.
I will leave the front light on.
No don't wait too long to come home.
My how the years & our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home.
I will leave the front light on.

As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground.
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground.
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground.
Down, down, down, down, down.---Lyrics submitted by Jan Ballerstein.
