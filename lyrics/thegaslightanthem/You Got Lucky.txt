Originally by Tom Petty

You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl if you can do better than me
Then go, go
Yeah go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky baby
You got lucky babe
When I found you

You put your hand on my cheek
And then you turn your eyes away
If I don't make you complete
If I don't take you all the way
Then go, go
Yeah go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky baby
You got lucky babe
When I found you

Oh go, yeah go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky baby
You got lucky babe
When I found you---Lyrics submitted by Jan Ballerstein.
