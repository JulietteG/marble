Don't write me no more letters.
My mailbox is full of bombs.
Between you & the crooks on my block.
I don't remember the good times.
I wasn't there when you were kind.
And my wife had some dogs in our yard.
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun.
We were strangers many hours
And I missed you for so long.
When we were lions, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned.

But I am older now & we did it when we were young.
I am older now & we did it when we were young.

There are no reasons to believe
I buried my faith in another plot
Where your heart & your claws will not find.
And I don't feel you or recall
I put your bones out in the yard
For someone else to be called & caught by.

And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun.
We were strangers many hours & I missed you for so long.
When we were lions, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned

But I am older now & we did it when we were young.
I am older now & we did it when we were young.
