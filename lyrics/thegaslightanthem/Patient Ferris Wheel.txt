Not tonight, not tonight
Honey I, am on fire
I can't feel a single thing but the weight of the wires
Cracking electric line
Remember baby we were a stone
And we would sleep where we've fallin'

We would fight about it (fight about it! )
We would fight about it (fight about it! )
We laughed about it (laughed about it! )
And we ride on, ride on
Ferris wheel lights on!

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the Jersey rain
Thinking about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the pounding rain
Thinking about what my mother once said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

N-n-not tonight, not tonight
Honey I, am on fire
If we don't go through, they gonna bury us alive
It is great, all of this
Or just what, might have been
Where we could take a seat at the bar with the other broken heroes

Where they talk about it (talk about it! )
Just talk about it (talk about it! )
Do nothing 'bout it (nothing 'bout it! )
Ride on, ride on
Ferris wheel lights on!

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the Jersey rain
Thinking about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the pounding rain
Thinking about what my mother once said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the Jersey rain
Thinking about what wagin' Matty said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the Jersey rain
Thinking about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

I've never felt so strange
Standing in the pounding rain
Thinking about what my momma always said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

Carnival lights!
4th of July!
Boy won't talk!
In the dead of the night!
Always made you smile!
Always made you smile!
Always made you smile!---
