I don't think I'm goin' out anymore
You better find some other body to comfort
When I was trembling baby you was a diamond,
but you ain't a diamond no more

So what you wanna say is my head is a hurricane
Well l-l-l-let me sleep on that, uh huh, alright
You say I'm hopelessly devoted to misery
Well I don't wanna be so devoted no more, aw yeah

And all of my friends wanna get into heaven
And all I keep thinkin is "I wish you were here"
And I heard that they been callin me "the great depression"
Rollin and tumblin, breakin my own heart again

Shimmy shimmy shake baby right in my blood stream
I don't know what it was that got in my room
My ticker-tape heart broken, everything shook in here
But I learned it could be worse

So what you wanna say is my head is a weathervane
Spinning with the wind chime, right
Baby I was born on the fourth of July,
exploding like a firework

And all of my friends wanna get into heaven
And all I keep thinkin is "I wish you were here"
And I heard that they been callin me "the great depression"
Rollin and tumblin, breakin my own heart again

And all of my friends wanna get into heaven
And all I keep thinkin is "I wish you were here"
And I heard that they been callin me "the great depression"
Rollin and tumblin, breakin my own heart again

So should I take everything, all the temporary medicine?
Should I take your reds, your blues, and your cocaine?
Should I take something to try on the weekend?
Should I take anything, or did you mean everything?
When I hit the wall, wrecked from it all
You put flowers down on the cold ground,
And cry me a river
And assure me I'm crazy
While you question the answers
And then we lean on our best friends
Until you find other weather
And you take a vacation
I heard you got all my letters,
I signed "the great depression"
Baby rollin and tumblin---
