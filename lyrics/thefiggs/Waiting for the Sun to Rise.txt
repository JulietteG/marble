steppin out, growin old
walkin out into the cold
leavin traces on the street
they're seein how you drag your feet

walk a mile or two or three
walk until you can't be seen
if you needed nothin more
why'd you leave an open door
haven't you been here before

	patiently
	waitin for the sun to rise
	hopefully
	but when it comes you'll run and hide
		you'll disappear
		we'll disappear
	in the heat

shut your eyes you can sleep
if you lay down in the street
in the gutter lay your head
and never mind you're seein red

with your lover you can sleep
nothin left but I'll never leave
sittin there across your knee
now it's so far out of reach
and no-one hears you when you speak

	patiently
	waitin for the sun to rise
	hopefully
	but when it comes you'll run and hide
		you'll disappear
		yeah we'll disappear
	in the heat

(instrumental verse)

	patiently
	waitin for the sun to rise
	hopefully
	oh when it comes you'll run and hide
		you'll disappear
		yeah we'll disappear
		we'll disappear
		we'll disappear
	in the heat---Lyrics submitted by hibtone.
