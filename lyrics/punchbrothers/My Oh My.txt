Rise up blinking in the sun 
Wrapped in invisible wire 
Something beautiful's gonna come 

Out from underneath our thumbs 
To let freedom vibrate not ring 
'Cause we can't listen to (listen to (listen to)) everyone 
If we wanna hear ourselves sing 

My oh my what a wonderful day we're having... 
Why oh why are we looking for a way outside it... 

I see the green grass below 
I feel the warmth of the screen 
Is it beautiful (maybe not (maybe not)) but maybe so 
Whatever keeps us singing 

My oh my what a wonderful day we're having... 
Why oh why are we looking for a way outside it... 
How long O Lord can you keep the whole world spinning under our thumbs... ---
