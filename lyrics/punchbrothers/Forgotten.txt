Help is on the way I guess it wasn't mine to say we're too far gone
But I've been here before and though it's changed I know the door locks on the outside

I wolf nipped at my heels I tried to reinvent the wheel with sticks and straw
And the wrong half of the hourglass was full when I heard her voice on the outside...

Hey there
It's all gonna be fine
You ain't gonna die alone
You ain't gonna be forgotten---
