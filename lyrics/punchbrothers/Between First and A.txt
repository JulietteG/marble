I've never dwelled on leaving
Only getting somewhere

But darling I'll miss these evenings
In my fourth floor walk-up
Villagers stumbling below
Trying to catch each other
On the very street where I caught you

With three drinks
Maybe more
Four blocks
In the summer rain
And one kiss
At my door
We brushed
Off the cabs
Looked up
Past the fire escape
To find us
Looking back
At what we're leaving to get somewhere

Darling I'll keep that apartment
In some loud
And reckless
Recess of
My heart

I moved
There alone
To leave
With a girl like you
Your love
Drives it home
And I might look over my shoulder
But I'll never dwell on leaving
If I'm getting somewhere---
