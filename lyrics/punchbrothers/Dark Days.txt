Mother listen to my heart.
Mother listen to my heart.
Just as one beating ends another starts,
And you can hear no matter where you are.
Sister hide our love away,
From the evil we both know.

It can see you through these dark days
Lord they seem to darken as I go.
Our love will see us through these dark, dark days sister.
Til it lights the way back home.
Sister hide our love away.
It can turn the whole world upside down.

Shake it til the sky falls to the ground.
But we dont have to reap the fear they sold, friends
As long as we hid our love away.
In the good theyll never know.

It can see us through these dark days
Lord they seem to darken as we go.
Our love will see us through these dark, dark days sister
Til it lights the way back home.
Sister hide our love away.
Mother listen to my heart.
Just as one beating ends another starts,
You can hear no matter where you are.---
