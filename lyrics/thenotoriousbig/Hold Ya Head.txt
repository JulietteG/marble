[Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

(Notorious BIG)
When I die fuck it i wanna to go to hell
cause im a piece of shit it aint hard to fucking tell
it dont make sense going to heaven with the goodie goodies
dressed in white, i like black timbs and black hoodies
god would probley have me on some real strict shit
no sleepin all day no geting my dick licked
hanging with the goodie goodies loungin in the paradise
fuck that shit i wanna tote guns and shoot dice
all my life ive been considered as the worst
lying to my mother even stealin out her purse
crime after crime from drugs to extortion
i know my mother wish she got a fucking abortion


[Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Notorious BIG]
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the beds, completely red
I'm glad i'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha-head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad i'm gone
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

[Bob Marley X2]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son has been shot down in the street and died

[Notorious BIG]
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
Call My Nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (talking..talking..) (fade)---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
