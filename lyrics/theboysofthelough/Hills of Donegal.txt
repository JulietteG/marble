You may talk about Atlantis, how its lost beneath the sea
Or the grave of the unknown soldier and the cry of the old banshee
Who was the man in the iron mask, was Jack the ripper set free?
But ask them all wheres Donegal, and its still a mystery

And if I could Id build a wall around old Donegal
The north and south to keep them out, my god Id build it tall
Casinoes, chicken ranches, Id legalize them all
Wed have our own Las Vegas in the hills of Donegal
Yeah!! Las Vegas in the hills of Donegal

Lay by clubs and all night pubs, black jack and roulette
Mel Gibson, Brigitte Nilsen, Mike Tyson having a bet (bite)
Iniseoghain would then be known for its multi-millionaires
Where Donald Trump would have a chunk to live in solitaire

And if I could Id build a wall around old Donegal
[ From: http://www.elyrics.net ]
The north and south to keep them out, my god Id build it tall
Casinoes, chicken ranches, Id legalize them all
Wed have our own Las Vegas in the hills of Donegal
Yeah!! Las Vegas in the hills of Donegal

To stand on top of fairy hill would give me such a thrill
Ive heard them say in Dublin theres gold in them there hills
So dont despair, cos if you dare, the answer lies with me
Theres a wall thats steep and its going cheap somewhere in Germany

And if I could Id build a wall around old Donegal
The north and south to keep them out, my god Id build it tall
Casinoes, chicken ranches, Id legalize them all
Wed have our own Las Vegas in the hills of Donegal
Yeah!! Las Vegas in the hills of Donegal---Lyrics submitted by Aerny Connorq.
