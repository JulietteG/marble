World a reggae music on yah-eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter eh-a
World a reggae music on yah-eh
Never lef ya, never no sah-eh-a

Now just be nice and hold your soace
I wont entertain no more disgrace
Out in the street the call it merther
When rhythm spacing out your head

World a reggae music on yah-eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter eh-a
World a reggae music on yah-eh
Never lef ya, never no sah-eh-a

Man showing how man feeling
Man singing goodness gracious I
Then thousand rydims peeling
It makes the spider kiss fly

World a reggae music on yah-eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter eh-a
World a reggae music on yah-eh
Never lef ya, never no sah-eh-a

World a reggae music on yah-eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter eh-a
World a reggae music on yah-eh
Never lef ya, never no sah-eh-a---
