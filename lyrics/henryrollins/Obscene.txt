I'm so confused
Can't find the line
Between what I use and abuse
So unreal
How I lie and try to deny
The things that I feel

I'll love you and hate you both at the same time
Heal you and hurt you and laugh as you cry

Why I don't know
Right at you right in you
Right through you right past you I go

Can't you see
First it's him then it's her
Then it's us then it's you
Then it's me
Misery, depression, elation all mine
Refine confinement all my design

You and me
Pathetic we cling
We think that we're free
Ugly
You and me
You see, you see the real me

So obscene
Flapping wildly
You see what I mean

Keep away
Can't see why you do what you do
And say what you say---Lyrics submitted by E.
