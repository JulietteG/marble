Fate - we say goodbye on this day
a Potter's field angel lay
the sunlight fills from your grace -
and so much love gives this place the feel of warmth inside
I hear the words of your life
an angel gone....... moved on

its a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful night to a beautiful day
its a beautiful end to a beautiful life
A beautiful soul gone this day

the flame - a candle burns in yoru stead
rose line white and red
you rose up high above us when
we felt a strength pass through us then
your love goes on and on

its a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful night to a beautiful day
its a beautiful end to a beautiful life
a beautiful soul gone this day

surrender, rest here angel rest
make us strong, calm all the oceans

it was a beautiful end to a beautiful life
November said goodbye
rest angel rest---Lyrics submitted by rommel setosta.
