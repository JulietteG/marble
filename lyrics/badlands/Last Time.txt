Love, love love love

Oh my sweet, young child 
Livin' heartache alone 
Pictures cry on the wall 

Whispered sins, never `prise me to fall 
Now you're twistin' it all 

Wasted days are bringin' me down 
Oh girl I'm losin' you 

Shattered dreams 
Spinnin' me `round 
Oh girl, what can I do

The last time 
I said I'm fallin' in love 
Girl, it's the last time 
I said I'm fallin' in love 
No, no, no, yeah

I remember that night 
And that very blind kiss 
You knew I'd never love on a lie 

But time after time 
I'd be down on my knees 
Beggin' like never before

Wasted days are bringin' me down 
Oh girl, I'm losin' you 
Shattered dreams 
Spinnin' me `round 
Oh girl, what can I do

The last time 
I said I'm fallin' in love 
Girl, it's the last time 
I said I'm fallin' in love 
No, no, no, yeah

(Solo)

Girl, it's the last time 
I said I'm fallin' in love 
Yes, it's the last time 
I said I'm fallin' in love 
You know, it's the last time 
Baby, said I'm fallin' in love 
The last time 
I said I'm fallin in love 
No, no, no

Girl, it's the last time, yeah
I said I'm falling for your love 
Last time for love---
