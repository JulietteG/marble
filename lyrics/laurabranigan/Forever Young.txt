Let's dance in style, lets dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but, expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but, we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is won
As we turn our faces into the sun
Praising our leaders we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever
Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like the fading walls
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams waiting in the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever
Forever

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young (I want to be forever young)
Ever and ever
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever and ever---Lyrics submitted by Christi Latte.
