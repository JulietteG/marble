Hot summer day in the neighborhood
Being a good girl, like I should
While all my friends are off to the lake, I stay
Hey hey

I lend a hand with what my mama brought home
She says she can't lift nothing heavy alone
And when my friends ask me "Where have you been?"
I say, Helping mama bring the groceries in

"You're growing up" I hear my mama say
She tries her best to drive those boys away
She calls my name and I run from the sound
Oooh hoo Can't be found

I take her lipstick and go up to my room
Try on her dresses and her sweet perfume
Dream about the day when I can help out my man
Instead of helping mama bring the groceries in

Gotta go now, gotta get a way
Gotta find my place and where's my power?

Where am I going now is anyone's guess
I make my living doing what I do best
Trying to keep the well from running dry
Oooh hoo  We'll get by

Mama tried to teach me better, I know
My reputation's on a down hill slope
Another stranger, here I go again
Helping mama bring the groceries in

I'm just helping mama bring the groceries in---Lyrics submitted by Christi Latte.
