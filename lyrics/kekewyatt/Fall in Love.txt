Tell me I am ready for what I got and how I gotta planned out
Tell me that you want it and you can wait me to put my hands on you
Boy you feel that you will love my body
Make you wait and going
It is so deep, and your bodys waiting on me

Give me a reason to put my hands on
Your bodys calling me, you got to handle
Tell me where and how you want it
You dont know the best but you aint meet me yet
And when we finish making sweet love baby
Then you fall in love with me
And baby tonight, you will fall in love with me

Baby put your hands on me
Cuz I wanna feel good
Is the way that you grab my waist and the place that you should
Boy you know my body is calling your name
Every night do something thou your touch is not the same
You can be excited and surprise every day
I can wait for you to put your hands on me

Baby wait for me to put my hands on
Your bodys calling me, I got to handle
Tell me where, and how you want it
You dont know the best but you aint meet me yet
And when we finish making good love baby
Then you fall in love with me
And baby tonight, you gonna fall in love with me

Baby I feel it, I know you feel it too
Baby I want it, I know you want it too

Give me a reason to put my hands on
Your bodys calling me, you got to handle
Tell me where and how you want it
You dont know the best but you aint meet me yet
And when we finish making sweet love baby
You gonna fall in love with me
baby tonight, you gonna fall in love with me
baby dont give me now, gonna fall in love
You gonna fall in love with me
You gonna fall in love with me
You gonna want more and more, more and more, more ---
