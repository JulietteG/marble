Verse One:
Im sure that ya heard the rumors about me
Word on the street is Im happy
But ya didnt care nothing about that
Said I was the one you had to have
Knowing that I wasnt into to no games
Wasnt tryna take nobody's last name
But you changed my mind
Took me off the grind
Now Im yours for life.

Pre-Chorus:
What if I never met you?
What would it take to?
This thing that you do, that cant nobody else do
What if you was still on the block?
Will this love we got make ya stop?
I dont wanna ever think about, cant do without it.

Chorus:
Who Knew?
It would be you changing my plans, stealing my heart?
Who knew?
You were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my babydaddy?
Spending all ya hard-earned money on me
You came out the blue; boy Im glad its you
Tell me who knew?

Verse Two:
Aint nobody gonna take me
But youre the only one that ever shown me what its like to know real love
What its like to get that good love
Getting turned on and getting turned out
Doing it so good that theres no doubt
There aint never gonna be a time that Im not here and he aint mine

Pre-Chorus:
What if I never met you?
What would it take to?
This thing that you do, that cant nobody else do
What if you was still on the block?
Will this love we got make ya stop?
I dont wanna ever think about, cant do without it.

Chorus:
Who Knew?
It would be you changing my plans, stealing my heart?
Who knew?
You were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my babydaddy?
Spending all ya hard-earned money on me
You came out the blue; boy Im glad its you
Tell me who knew?

Bridge
It coulda been you with some other chick
And it coulda been me with some other man
You coulda walked by and none of this would happen
Now were shopping for baby's shoes
Now its rings, bells, and a preacher too
Now were forever
Tell me who knewwwww

Chorus:
Who Knew?
It would be you changing my plans, stealing my heart?
Who knew?
You were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my babydaddy?
Spending all ya hard-earned money on me
You came out the blue; boy Im glad its you
Tell me who knew?
