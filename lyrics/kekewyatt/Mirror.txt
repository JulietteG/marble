(feat. Kelly Price & Tweet)

Look me in my eyes mirror
Cuz Ive seen that look before
Tell me whats inside mirror
Cuz we both agreed no more

We were so close to getting over him
Now youre telling me were going back
Again  in

How could you
Betray me
And take My heart back through that door

Oh mirror
Please tell me
We both deserve so much more

How could you
Oh Mirror
What Pleases you is hurting me

Tell me mirror
How could it be

Oooh

Look into my eyes mirror
Cant believe the things he said
See through his disguise
Mirror
Come with me, Lets run away

We were so close to getting over him
Now youre telling me Were going back again

How could you
Betray me
And take My heart back through that door

Oh mirror
Please tell me
We both deserve so much more

How could you
Oh Mirror
What Pleases you Keeps hurting me
Tell me mirror

Theres no way new love can find us
If we keep looking behind us
No More Heartache
That ain't the way loves supposed to be

Theres no way new love can find us
If we keep looking behind us
So this time mirror
Listen to me

How could you
Betray me
And take My heart back through that door

Oh mirror
Please tell me
We both deserve so much more

How could you
Oh Mirror
What Pleases you Keeps hurting me
Tell me mirror
Oh ooo ohh

How could you
Oh Mirror
What pleases you keeps hurting me
Tell Me Mirror ---Lyrics submitted by meemee.
