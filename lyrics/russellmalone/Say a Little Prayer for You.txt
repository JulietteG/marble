the moment I wake up
before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you,
While combing my hair now
And wonderign what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you,

Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh how I love you
Together, forever that's how it must be
to live without you 
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus dear
While riding I think of us dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh how I love you
Together, forever that's how it must be
to live without you 
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I say a little prayer for you

I say a little prayer for you

My darling believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you 
Please love me too (Answer his pray)
And I'm in love with you (Answer his pray)
Answer my prayer now babe (Answer his pray)

Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart 
and I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh how I love you
Together, forever that's how it must be
to live without you 
Would only mean heartbreak for me---Lyrics submitted by Argelia.
