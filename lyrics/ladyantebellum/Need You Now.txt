Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor.
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore.

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me, it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one.
I'm all alone and I Need you now.
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control.
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without.
I just need you now.

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you come sweeping in the way
You did before.

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me, it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one,
I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control.
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without.
I just need you now.

Ooh Oooohhhh.

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.

It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without. 
I just need you now.

I just need you now.

Oh baby, I need you now.---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
