Alright
Yeah it's been a bumpy road
Roller coasters
High and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You wont have to go that far

You wanna give up cuz its dark
We're really not that far apart
So let your heart, sweet heart
Be your compass when your lost
And you should follow it where ever it may go
When it's all said and done
You can walk instead of run
Cuz no matter what you'll never be alone (never be alone) oh oh
Never be alone oh oh

Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night I can't wait til you arrive
Follow stars you'll be alright

You wanna give up cuz its dark
We're really not that far apart
So let your heart, sweet heart
Be your compass when your lost
And you should follow it where ever it may go
When its all said and done
You can walk instead of run
Cuz no matter what you'll never be alone (never be alone) oh oh
Never be alone oh oh
You wanna give up cuz its dark
We're really not that far apart
So let your heart, sweet heart
Be your compass when your lost
And you should follow it where ever it may go
When its all said and done
You can walk instead of run
Cuz no matter what you'll never be alone (never be alone) oh oh
Never be alone oh oh

When its all said and done
You can walk instead of run
Cuz no matter what you'll never be alone ---
