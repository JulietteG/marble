She hails from boston, she hates the sounds of goodbyes, wait
She loves some days in champagne
She can't stand the winter
She can't stand anything that
She can't change, all that she can't change

She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world in her fingertips
And she makes good(?) look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is

When we talk for hour
And she wrote the book on how to get nowhere
Don't matter what I say
I could buy her flowers
That's just too cliche to impress
A girl like her, but you know I kinda like it that way

She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world in her fingertips
And she makes good(?) look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is

All I think about and I can't do without
The good, the bad, the somewhere in between
Oh, cuz I want everything she is
She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world in her fingertips
And she makes good(?) look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is---
