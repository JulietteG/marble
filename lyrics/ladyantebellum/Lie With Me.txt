I felt this comin' for a month or two
You don't look at me like you used to do
Still when you leave's gonna be too soon
Give me a minute, why we're still livin'

Lay with me, hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're lovin' only me tonight
Lay with me, feel like gettin' old
Grow a lil slower, baby one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on, lay with me

Go put your favorite Motown record on
Do what we need to feel it all night long
Make me believe you ain't already gone
Let's make our last time our best time

Lay with me, hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're lovin' only me tonight
Lay with me, feel like gettin' old
Grow a lil slower, baby one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on, lay with me

Baby, lay with me
Love me like you mean it
Like you meant it
You owe me that much
Don't leave me here with nothin'
Give me somethin'
Baby, what's the rush now?

Lay with me, hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're lovin' only me tonight
Lay with me, feel like gettin' old
Grow a lil slower, baby one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on, lay with me---
