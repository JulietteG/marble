She's no good for me
I know that shes
a wildflower

She's got a restlessness
a beautifulness
thing about her

But here I am again
callin her back
lettin her drive me crazy 

Chorus:
It's like I love this pain 
a little too much 
love my heart all busted up 
somethin bout her
it just don't work
but I can't walk away 
it's like I love this pain

It's just an on again 
and off again
situation

It's a strikin match
a tank of gas
combination

But here I am again
lightin it up
knowin that she'll just burn me 

Chorus

Its like I love this lie
but nothings right
and somethings wrong
Its like Im just not me
if I cant be
a sad sad song

Chorus

Oh yeah
its like I love this pain
I cant walk away
oh no
its like I love this pain---Lyrics submitted by Sierra.
