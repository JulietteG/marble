I remember riding shotgun in daddy's Chevrolet
We'd crank up the Pioneers and we'd sing away
Sometimes he's let me take the wheel and we'd drive through town
Couldn't wait to hear my favorite songs coming back around (back around)

And the radio played the theme I'll still be loving you
Promise come true and country wasn't cool
Forever may never enough
Always on my mind again and again

Swinging and smoking mountain rain
He stopped loving her today
We laughed, we cried the 80's away
And the radio played

Bobby was the first boy that I ever kissed
I can still taste the root beer on his lips
We turn up the stereo from that bedroom
Climb through the window and make out on the roof

And the radio played on rock, the jukebox and we danced
Strawberry wine, a brand new man
Love without ending, honey
Top notch was on again and again

Meet in the middle and amazed
Does he love you? Independence Day
We laughed, we cried the 90's away
And the radio played

I was raised on the radio, raised on the radio, raised on the radio
And the radio played
I was raised on the radio, raised on the radio, raised on the radio

And I hear him now
I'm right back in that place
And 28 years from now
I'll back on today

When the radio played I hope you damn sure think of me
World hurts the lost before we cheat
I don't want this night to end
The house that build me, remember when

That story she's my kind of range
She's country forever for our way
She don't bring I saw God today
And the radio played

I was raised on the radio, raised on the radio, raised on the radio
And the radio played
I was raised on the radio, raised on the radio, raised on the radio

Weren't you raised on the radio, raised on the radio, raised on the radio
I was raised on the radio, raised on the radio, raised on the radio---
