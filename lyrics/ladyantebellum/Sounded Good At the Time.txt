Standing by the door checking my hair
Waiting on you to take me nowhere
We were always looking for a rock and roll Saturday night
We're sitting on hold with a radio station
Listen all night to hear my dedication
A song to tell the whole town you were mine

We sing, like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing
Like nothing would ever change and we danced
Like time was really slipping through our hands
Oh, when you said I love you, you might have been lying
But it sure sounded good at the time

Just a hand me down Pontiac
See how many friends we could pile in the back
Saved all summer for a ticket on the front row
Didn't have a plan and we ran out of money
Car broke down but it's still kind of funny
Cause we hitched a ride with some hippy guy
And barely made it to the show

We sang, like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing
Like nothing would ever change and we danced
Like time was really slipping through our hands
Made it back alive, made up a good lie
But it sure sounded good at the time

We did some wrong, but we did it right
But it sure sounded so good at the time
You were mine, alright, whoa oh, alright

We sing, like we wrote every word to the whole damn thing
Like nothing would ever change and we danced
Like time was really slipping through our hands
So we'd never say goodbye, sure sounded good at the time

It's a melody, on my mind
So we'd never say goodbye
We sing on and on and on (on and on) ---
