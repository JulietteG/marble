Well, all the parties on the streets are talking,
Store front mannequins sleeping in lights.
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night.
Knew the bands so we never paid our cover.
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles.
We never dressed to impress all the others,
They would let us in on a laid back kind of style.
But boy you know it's been a while.

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease.
I'm only countin' on your cancellation,
When I should be countin' on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Oh, anymore.

I got some platforms sitting in the corner.
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk.
I got a dress that'll show a little uhh uh
But you ain't getting uh oh if you don't come pick me up (damn),
Show me off (wow), you might be tired but I'm not!

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease.
I'm only countin' on your cancellation,
When I should be countin' on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.

(Oh, anymore)
Yeah, don't know why you don't take me downtown,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
I just don't get it.---
