Home for the holidays,
I believe I've missed each and every face
Come on and play on easy, let's turn on every light
in the place
It's time I found myself totally surrounded in your circles of all my friends
Please celebrate me home, give me a number
Please celebrate me home, play me one more song
That I'll always remember
That I can recall whenever I find myself alone
I can sing me home

An easy highway travel when westerly winds fly
Somebody tried to tell me, but the man forgot to tell me why
I gotta count on being gone
Come on mamma, come on daddy please what you want from me?
I'll be strong! I'll be weak!
Please celebrate me home, give me a number
Please celebrate me home, play me one more song
That I'll always remember,
That I can recall whenever I find myself too alone
I can make you believe that I'm never gone
Baby, let me know where I belong
Sing me home!

Play me one more song - hmmm

Well I'm finally healed, but I'm bound
Celebrate me home
Well I'm finally healed, but I'm bound
Celebrate me home
Well I'm finally healed, but I'm bound
Celebrate me home
Well I'm finally healed, but I'm bound
Celebrate me home

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Celebrate me, celebrate me home
Please, celebrate me home!---
