Bound to your side I'm trapped in silence
Just a posession
Is this sex or only violence
This feeds your obsession?
You send me to a btoken state
Where I can take the pain just long enough
Then I'm numb - then I just disappear

[Chorus:] 
So go on infect me 
Go on and scare me to death
Tell me I ask for it
Tell me I'll never forget
You could give me anything but love
Anything but love

Does it feed good to deny
Hurt me with nothing
Some sort of sicle satisfaction
You get from mind f*cking
Stripped down to my naked core
The darkest corners of my mind are yours
That's where you live
That's where yiu breathe 

So give me your warnings
Give me your maddness and shame
(Anything but love)
Dare me to leave you
Swear that I won't get away
(Anything but love)
You could give me anything but love
Anything but love 

Without any faith
Without any light
Condemn me to live
Condemn me to lie
Inside I am dead

[Chorus:] 
So go on infect me 
Go on and scare me to death
(Anything but love)
I'll be the victim
You'll be the voice in my head
(Anything but love)
You could give me anything but love
Anything but love---Lyrics submitted by Mindy.
