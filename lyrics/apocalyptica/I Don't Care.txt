I try to make it through my life, in my way, there's you
I try to make it through these lies, that's all I do

Just don't deny it
Just don't deny it
And deal with it
And deal with it
You try to break me, you want to break me
Bit by bit, that's just part of it

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
And all the things you left behind
I don't care, I don't care

I try to make you see my side
Always trying to stay in line
But your eyes see right through
That's all they do

I'm getting tired of this shit
I've got no room, when it's like this
What do you want of me?, just deal with it

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
And all the things you left behind
I don't care, I don't care

I'm taking care of it, I'm taking care of it
You won't be there for me, you won't be there for me

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
And all the things you left behind
I don't care, I don't care

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
(I'm taking care of it, I'm taking care of it )
And all the things you left behind
I don't care
(You won't be there for me)
I don't care at all---Lyrics submitted by Alejandra.
