I travelled the way that you showed me
Left all my sorrow behind
I'm living with rules you once told me
Expecting myself to be fine

So why the fuck am I lonely
There's no one inside I can call
To give up the fight is a warning
The one day to stand you will fall

I left my sorrow behind
(Voce / Precisa / Protecao)
Warning not to give up the fight
(Me diga a verdade / Protecao)

Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me protection
Helped me deal with you
So for now our days are through

Nothing left
Nothing rests
Nothing grasp

You declared what your faith is
But you still have the fear
The way you've left your life open
Will no bring your destiny here
Do I continue my journey
Confusion is wrapped in my mind
So when your gone with your martyr
You can continue your lies

(Voce / Precisa / Protecao)
(Me diga a verdade / Protecao)

Your words that gave me direction (Protecao)
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted (Me diga a verdade)
Fists that gave me protection (Voce / Precisa / Protecao)
Helped me deal with you (Precisa / Protecao)
So for now our days are through (Me diga a verdade)

I left my sorrow behind
I left my sorrow behind
Warning not to give up the fight
Warning not to give up the fight

You declared what your faith is
But you still have the fear
I will continue my journey
I need your lies nomore

Your words that gave me direction (Protecao)
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted (Me diga a verdade)
Fists that gave me protection (Voce / Precisa / Protecao)
Helped me deal with you (Voce / Precisa / Protecao)
So for now our days are through (Me diga a verdade)

(Direcao / Protecao)
So for now our days are through
(Me diga a verdade / Direcao / Protecao)
So for now our days are through

Nothing left
Nothing rests
Nothing grasp

Never underrate the man with nothing left inside
Never underrate the man with nothing left inside---Lyrics submitted by aBiP.
