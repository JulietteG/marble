Touch, touch me Lord Jesus
With Thy hand of mercy
Make each throbbing heartbeat
Feel Thy power divine
Take my will forever
I will doubt Thee never
Oh, cleanse, cleanse me dear Saviour
Make me wholly Thine

Guide, Guide Me Jehovah
Through this veil of sorrow
I am saved forever
Trusting in Thy love

Bail me through the current
O'er the chilly Jordan
Lead, lead dear Master
To Thy home above

Bail me through the current
O'er the chilly Jordan
Lead, lead dear Master
To Thy home above ---Lyrics submitted by patricia edward.
