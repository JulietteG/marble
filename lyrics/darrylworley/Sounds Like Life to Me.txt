Verse 1:
Got a call last night from an old friends wife
said i hate to bother you
but johnny ray fell off the wagon hes been gone all afternoon
Well i no my buddy so i drove skullys and i found him at the bar
i said hey man whats goin on and he said i don't know where to start
saras old car starts to fall apart and the washer quit last week
we had to put mama in the nurseing home and the babys cutting teeth
i didnt get much work this week and i've got bills to pay
i said i no this ain't what you want to hear 
but its what im gona say

Sounds like life to me
it ain't no fantasy its just a common case of everyday reality
man i no its tough but you've got to suck it up
to hear you talk you got caught up in some tragedy
it sounds like life to me

verse 2:
Well his face turned red and he shook his head
and said you don't understand
3 kids and wife depend on me and i'm just 1 man
to top it off i just found out saras 2 months late
i said hey bartender set us up a round we need to celebrate

Sounds like life to me
aint no destiny
ya the only thing for certain is uncerinty
you got hold on tight and just enjoy the ride
get used to all this unpredictability
Sounds like life

man i no its tough but you've got to suck it up
to hear you talk you've been caught up in some tragedy
Sounds like life to me

Sounds like life(sounds like life to me)
Sounds like life to me
Sounds like life to me
Sounds like life to me---Lyrics submitted by mason.
