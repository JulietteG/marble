Baby,
What's the matter?
Why are you looking so sad?
Come here, what's the matter?
Tell me!
If you have a problem, then I've got a problem.
Cos' I'm your woman, and I love you.

Boy if ever things are going wrong
for you,
You will see that I'll be strong.
And you can count on me,
for sure.
Because I'm your baby.
I can see that you don't feel secure.
Baby, my love is strong and pure.
Whoa, Let me,
I'll show you I'll be,
there for you,
Forever and always.

(Chorus)

I'll, take care of you
Because your my baby
And more (and more)

It has been a while since I have seen,
A smile, upon your face.
Baby don't be sad.
I ain't going no place without you.
Baby, I'm coming at.
Boy come over here and hold me tight.
You feel so warm, you feel so right.
Cant you see, all this love in me, is for you.
For now and always.
