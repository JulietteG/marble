I walk a fine line between coping and insanity
The right pills right now would be the wrong time
I have a hard time between flying and sobriety
The wrong thrill, strong will to keep myself alive
Watch this rip apart my family
Fuck that, I'd rather die with honor
But when the tide is running through me, I can feel no pain
It's not worth the price I pay

It's so hard to be together
And I try, and I try
But it won't get better
Forever
Days go, days go by
I won't die, I won't die cause
I must, I must try
Forever

I missed a phone call from a friend I knew the other day
It's strange, it changed my life forever
A couple days go by, I found out that he passed away
The right drug, the wrong time, he'll be remembered
There's two wolves battling us all right now
One's good, the other one's evil
If you're wondering which wolf inside will succeed
Simple, it's the one that you feed

It's so hard to be together
And it won't get better
Days go, days go by
But I must, I must try
Forever---
