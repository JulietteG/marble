So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh

You've got pep in your step
You live your life with no regret
How you look when you are wet
Is something I can't forget
I just wanna kiss your lips
The ones between your hips
If I cash in all my chips on you
Then baby I'd be rich

So come on
Sexy, please text me
I'm ready for you
So come on
Waiting, I'm begging
So please get here soon

So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh


Ooo lala, What lovely curves
Baby I get off by getting you off first
Sorry girl if this is quick
So please just take it in *** and suck my ***

So come on
Sexy, please text me
I'm ready for you
So come on
Waiting, I'm begging
So please get here soon

So why do good girls like bad guys?
