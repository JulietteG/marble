My heart is on fire again
From the depths of hell and it swallows me in
The demons are all in my head
Pulling me in pulling me in

Here I go
Sinking below sinking below
All I know
Fading away fading away from me now

This can't be happening
I've watch my whole world fall apart

So long farewell to the best of me
It's so far away
And I'm my own worst enemy
And it's so hard to say
There's no way out
You are way too late
Say goodbye to the rest of me

Bound
By the Demons they doubt me
My whole world is around me is drowning
and the demons I hate
Are the monsters
I always create---
