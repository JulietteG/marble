God cannot save my soul
It's straight to hell for me, I know
And when I get there,
At least I've found a place to call my home
They say the truth will set you free
Then why am I still here?
I've got no truth left, can't you see?
Am I making myself clear?

Resolution, no solution
God, if You are above...
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, well, I have lived my life the way that I could!
The way that I should!

The spirit's stuck between two roads
And waiting there on me
The first path is the way to go
The life I wanna lead
The second road's my crazy path
The darkest ones I try to mask
The drugs, the guns, the lies, the lows
The dreams I had
I'm waking up!

Resolution, no solution
God, if You are above...
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, well, I have lived my life the way that I could!
The way that I should!

Don't tell me I'm not worth the time!
I will be fine
All these prayers have gone unanswered...
Where were you?
Where were you?!

God, if You are above...
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, well, I have lived my life the way that I could!
The way that I should!

God, if You are above...
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, well, I have lived my life the way that I could!
The way that I should!---
