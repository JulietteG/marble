There is a price that we all must pay,
I'm never sorry for the mess that I have made.
Can you tell me, what will you do,
when everything you know turns right around on you.
I will throw out all of these lies, you let them nail me to your cross
No matter, how, what, where or when.
I will always lay down for all your sins

My daddy told me not to bite my tongue,
I hate my momma, 'cause she left me with no love.
I bottled it up, I sweep it under the rug (Hate my mother)
If all the good things got to come to an end,
Then we're living in a world where the evil wins.
A lobbyist, a pessimist, a cynical, hypocritical mess.

Self-destruct personality,
Won't discuss my responsibility.
I'm always walking on the final verge.
I'm killing myself, but I am not a murderer.
I will throw out all of these lies, you let them nail me to your cross.
No matter, how, what, where or when.
I will always lay down for all your sins.


My daddy told me not to bite my tongue,
I hate my momma, 'cause she left me with no love.
I bottled it up, I sweep it under the rug (Hate my mother)
If all the good things got to come to an end,
Then we're living in a world where the evil wins.
A lobbyist, a pessimist, a cynical, hypocritical mess.

Never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life,
When everything around me has failed.
Who know what the future brings, but eventually the truth will prevail
It's moments like these where you really got to think
About the broken dreams you sell.
Tick, tock in your head it goes, where it stops who knows
Like a carousel

Never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life,
When everything around me has failed.
Who know what the future brings, but eventually the truth will prevail
It's moments like these where you really got to think
About the broken dreams you sell.
Tick, tock in your head it goes, where it stops who knows
Like a carousel

OH.... GO.

Never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life,
When everything around me has failed.
