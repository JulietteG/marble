Don't waste your time, you will
Never win, don't try and
Fight, it only makes you worse,
You'll remember me the one
You can't defeat, believe in me
'cause I was born to lead.

I want to stay, you'll never leave!
We are fighting for what helps
Us win and never lose.
You're whats hoisting me back,
We know what your about.

Don't waste your time, you will
Never win, don't try and
Fight, it only makes you worse,
You'll remember me the one
You can't defeat, believe in me
'cause I was born to lead.

I've got your back, so fight the same,
Stand up and fight, don't lose your pride
Stand your ground, I've got your back.
You're whats hoisting me back
We know what you're about.

Don't waste your time, you will
Never win, don't try and
Fight, it only makes you worse,
You'll remember me the one
You can't defeat, believe in me
'cause I was born to lead.

Show 'em what you're made of!

Don't waste your time, you will
Never win, don't try and
Fight, it only makes you worse,
You'll remember me the one
You can't defeat, believe in me
'cause I was born to lead.

Don't waste your time, you will
Never win, don't try and
Fight, it only makes you worse,
You'll remember me the one
You can't defeat, believe in me
'cause I was born to lead.---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
