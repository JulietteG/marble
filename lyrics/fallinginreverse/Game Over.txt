My life is like a video game
Trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Trying hard to save the girl
Obstacles, I'm jumping hurdles
Im growing up to be a big boy

A battle with a evil place
I travel far and try and say
Sorry but your princess isn't here
I take a rest, I push the pause
Level up and move along 
In hopes that the next stage I will clear
(I fucking passed, asshole!)

I'm just trying to keep from dying

It's just a game that we play 
And for heavens sakes
Looking for a better way
To play it
Life is more keeping score
And forever more
stop complaining and start changing it

Ahem
Today I went to therapy
told him my Embarrasing
Issues that I'm having with my life
He told me that I need to change
Life is not a video game
So stop playing and open up your eyes

I'm just trying to keep from dying

It's just a game that we play 
And for heavens sakes
Looking for a better way
To play it
Life is more keeping score
And forever more
stop complaining and start changing it

Dont talk about it
Just be about it
Dont ever doubt it
Even when your brain is clouded
I may be crazy
But lifes amazing
And through it all and even with your problems facing
So just know that its ok

My life is like a video game
Trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins

Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start.

It's just a game that we play 
And for heavens sakes
Looking for a better way
To play it
Life is more keeping score
And forever more
stop complaining and start changing it

Life is just a game that we play 
And for heavens sakes
Looking for a better way
To play it
Life is more keeping score
And forever more
stop complaining and start changing---Lyrics submitted by Amber Burch.
