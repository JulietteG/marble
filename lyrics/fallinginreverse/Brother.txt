Brother, why'd you have to go?
You left us all so soon
Remember that song I wrote about your family years ago
Well they're waiting for you to come home
What do I do? What do I say?
And dad tells me to pray
So I prayed and prayed but the hurt won't go away
The pain gets worse, it never stops
And I've asked the lord for us to swap
I beg and plead cause you have kids to feed

Why is it always stormy weather
And brother, tell me if it all gets better
Why did you leave? Why did you die?
You finally made your brother cry
I know you're watching over us tonight
And I hope you're watching over us tonight

I'm sorry I missed your call
I wasn't there for you at all
And know I thought it through
Maybe if I answered you
That you would still be here all along
Now no more calls, can't you see
I took for granted family
And once they're gone, you'll never get that back
No more laughs, no more hugs
So hold on to the ones you love
Your soul is free, I love you Anthony

And why is it always stormy weather
And brother, tell me when does it get better
Why did you leave? Why did you die?
You finally made your brother cry
I know you're watching over from above
So hold on to the ones you love---
