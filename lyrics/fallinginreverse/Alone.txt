Come on!
Oh! this is the end of everything that I've known
Oh! this is the end of everything that I've known

(so come on!)

White boy on the beat rocking Gucci sneaks
All I do is win, Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me

Came from the lowest of lows
Rose to the top with a vision
My haters talking shit while washing
Dishes for a living

Fuck you bitches I'm a business
I'll be kissing on your Mrs.
What you spend in 15 months is what I spend in 15 minutes
Oh! Don't give a fuck about you
You hear me talking motherfucker and there's nothing you can do
You're a bitch, you're a bitch
Don't make me pull the plug

Oh this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I've got a lot of people talking nothing but chatter,
Why'd you switch your style up and that I don't matter
Man I've been in rap since I was shitting in pampers
Climb the ladder to the top and now I'm shitting on rappers

All I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossing the line
I find it kind of funny the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face to face you ain't got nothing to say to me!

(oh you)

So fuck you too!
You better take a step back before I call up the crew
You talk a lot of shit but you spread nothing but lies
You keep on running your mouth
You better open your eyes

Oh! this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh! And if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone! Alone!

I'm on that rack! Fly like a jet!
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a Vette
Oh, I'm on that next! Girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world break your neck!
So break your motherfucking neck

I'm on that rack! Fly like a jet!
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a Vette
I'm on my that next! Girl loves sex
No doubt now I'm top of the world, break your neck

I'm on that rack! Fly like a jet!
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a Vette
I'm on my that next! Girl loves sex
No doubt now I'm top of the world, break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck

Oh! this is the end of everything I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh! and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

Oh! this is the end of everything I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh! and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

Yo! 2013 motherfucker! Falling In Reverse!---
