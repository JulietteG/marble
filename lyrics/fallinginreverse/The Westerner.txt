I was born one morning in December
On the coldest day
Abandoned by my mother
By my father I was raised
My father raised my brother and I
With a stubborn heart
My mother left me her good looks and not much else.

Well I spent most of my teenage years
Searching for her love
I could not find it anywhere
So I turned to drugs
And after all the smoke had cleared
And it was said and done
I found myself addicted by the age of 21

I tell the truth
I've been beaten
I've been bruised
I was left for dead as well
I was wrongfully accused
You left me locked inside a cell.

I've been cheated
I've been sued
But I have lived to tell
The more you kick me when I'm down
The more it truly helps.

I feel the madness creeping slowly
Loved by many I'm still lonely
Paid the price for your mistake
The music died the day I walked away.

No, I wont let you win!
Not this time my friend,
You know that I'm better in the end.

No, you wont take my pride!
I'll keep my head held high.
Cause I know that I'm better in the end.

Woaaah,
I know you're jealous
And you wish you could be me
I'm so smart and clever with my lyrics can't you see?
There's nobody better in this Music Industry!
And in case you think you are, go ahead, give me a ring!

Woaaah
I deserve a purple heart
From all my fucking wounds!
Lacerations to my ego,
Pride that I consume.

And in your final hours
When you are looking back
You'll find that I'm the best at what I do
And that's a fact.

No, I wont let you win!
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better in the end.

No, you wont take my pride!
I'll keep my head held high.
Cause I know that I'm better in the end.
And all got to say
(Do do do do do do do do, bah bah bah da,
Do do do do do do do do, la la la la la la)

Take it or leave it
But you best believe me it's true!
There's no mistaking, please stop thinking I'm through!
You know I'm better than you!

No, I wont let you win!
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better In the end.

No, you wont take my pride!
I'll keep my head held high
Cause I know that I'm better in the end.
In the end.
(Do do do do do do do do, bah bah bah da,
Do do do do do do do do, la la la la la la)---Lyrics submitted by Rachael.
