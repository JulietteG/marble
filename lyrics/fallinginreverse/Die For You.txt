I admit it that I'm far from perfect
Who are you to judge me like I'm worthless
I will not conform or be your puppet
I will never trust cause the loyalty is dead

I would have died for you
I'm killing myself hanging on your lies
And it goes to show how bad it hurts
For what it's worth
Somethings are better left unsaid

You won't destroy me
This is your warning
I have a dark side, I have an army
Within me, a secret
A thousand years of torment
Caged up like a monster
Forever I will wander

Break it up
I'm no longer able to believe in what you are fighting for
Your lying soul will burn below and I hope that it happens slow
Tell that bastard that you call your father if you bother that he should have raised you with a heart and taught a bit of honor

The world as we know it is a motherfucking battleground---
