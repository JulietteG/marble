What if the devil was a lie?
What if God did not exist?
So, with all due respect
Tell me, what is death?
If life is just a bitch

I see the evil in their eyes
I hear the lies behind their grin
They wander in the dark
They do not have a heart
Don't let them take it away

Brace for impact!

You will pay the price
For betraying me
You will pay the price
You will pay the price
For betraying me
You will pay the price

So save yourself!
Cause the tide is rising high

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard!
Man overboard!

Do you believe in ghosts?
Conducting from the grave
We are nothing but pawns
To move to where they want
Cause life is just a game

I wrapped my hands around your throat
With a smile upon my face
Squeeze until you choke
Cause I will not let go till I feel no pulse

You will pay the price
For betraying me
You will pay the price
For betraying me

So save yourself
Cause the tide is rising high

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard!
Man overboard!

I bid farewell,
To you fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve (you deserve)
And after all,
The bridges you have burned
I forgive you for the things you have done!

I bid farewell,
To you, fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve (you deserve)
And after all, (And after all)
The bridges you have burned
I forgive you for the things you have done! (You have done)

So save yourself
Cause the tide is rising high

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard!
Man overboard!

So save yourself
Cause the tide is rising high

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold

It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard!
Man overboard!

Man overboard!
Man overboard!
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
Man overboard!
Man overboard!
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
Man overboard!---Lyrics submitted by Juan.
