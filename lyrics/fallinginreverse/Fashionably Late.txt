Its 9 oclock on the dot,
At the spot,
And Im hanging with her friends again
Great taste,
Beautiful place,
And youre fashionably late (Hey!)
And I dont wanna be that guy,
That makes you sad,
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about,
Making out with your friends (Go!)

I love the way that this began,
Started off right,
So innocent
Im letting you know,
Im letting you go,
I want your best friend
Im giving it up and asking why,
You seem so shocked and so surprised
Im sorry it hurts,
Im surely a jerk,
I understand why youre mad

Dont talk that crap when you call me back,
As a matter of fact,
Dont act like that
Everybody knows youre right,
Everybody knows Im wrong (Wrong!)

Its 9 oclock on the dot,
At the spot,
And Im hanging with her friends again
Great taste,
Beautiful place,
And youre fashionably late (Hey!)
And I dont wanna be that guy,
That makes you sad,
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about,
Making out with your friends (Mwah!)

Its got nothing to do with how you look,
Just another excuse to write a hook
Im letting you know,
She liked my post up on my Facebook
And after all youre not my type,
But all your friends are pretty nice
You know what I mean,
Stop making a scene,
And take some want of advice

Dont talk that crap when you call me back,
As a matter of fact,
Dont act like that
Everybody knows youre right,
Everybody knows Im wrong (Right?)

Its 9 oclock on the dot, at the spot,
And Im hanging with her friends again
Great taste,
Beautiful place,
And youre fashionably late (Hey!)
And I dont wanna be that guy, that makes you sad,
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about,
Making out with your friends

And Ive got the topic conversation now,
And I know Im running out of time (Yeah!)
Its on an honest demonstration now,
Youre not the only one,
Not the only one

Dont talk that crap when you call me back,
As a matter of fact,
Dont act like that
Everybody knows youre right,
Everybody sing along (Ahhh!)

And I dont wanna be that guy,
That makes you sad,
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about,
Fucking all your friends (What?)

Its 9 oclock on the dot,
At the spot,
And Im hanging with her friends again
Great taste,
Beautiful place,
And youre fashionably late (Hey!)
And I dont wanna be that guy,
That makes you sad,
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about,
Making out with your friends

Making out with your friends
Making out with your friends

Without a doubt,
Sorry about,
Having sex with all your friends
(Hahaha!) ---
