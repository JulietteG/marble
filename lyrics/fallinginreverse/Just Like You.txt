Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na

I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
Na, Na, Na, Na
I got nothing to prove
Na, Na, Na, Na
But honestly I'm just like you

I've got a bad case of ADD
I've been this way since seventeen
I got a fucked up brain and a really bad attitude
And I blame it on my drug abuse

So you don't want to be too close to me
Cause you might see my broken heart

I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that honestly, I'm just like you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Just like you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Just like you

I've been so lonely for the longest time (uh huh)
They tell me that I'm such a lovable guy (yeah right)
Could it be because I'm off my meds
Or could it just be something I said?

And I'm always stuck with some bad luck
I'm just a boy who's angry at his mom
And I hope in that she breaks her back
The moment I step on this crack
Don't tell me I'm not worth it
Cause you are far from perfect

I am aware, that you are all assholes
Who the hell cares, about all of that though?---
