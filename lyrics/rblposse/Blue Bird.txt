There's a blue bird on my shoulder
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Back on the scene Crispy and clean
Theses two niggas with a glock 17
Can I give a fuck cuz u might catch a buck
You fucking with a nigga doing pussy like chuck
Me I'm a G triyin to stay sucka free
The nigga nigga Black from the P-O-doubleS-E
Test me

When I'm on the jacket
One time when was rolling deep when it's time for some action
Now I'm actin, shhh
Keep it on the down low, 
Run yo run yo, ass out the motha fucka town yo
And there's a blue bird on my shoulda so I gotts to drop it to the beat and
Run this bitch ass over

Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

It still gets deeper and deeper
The deeper in this game that they get they got these young niggas
Up in six
Letting loose on a nigga
Even if they figured you was bigger they will still be your grave digger

Time keeps on ticking
My babys getting older and her momas steady tripping
Saying I'm alwasy with my click
And she be like "you make me, you make me sick"
From rags to riches
Now a lot of niggas don't fuck with no bitches
Riding with a fifty block glock
Sellin folder a soldiers with a blue bird on the shoulder

Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder


I watch you slip, slip, slip, slip then fall
And make my hand go into your pocket and into some market store
Cuz a nigga gota keep some long nubs so I be in the projects like a does Like my name is Jail
So what the hell
I think I gotta let that shit go trying to make a rapper
Come up off a funky floor
I didn't know, yo
That shit wouldn't come that easily, shit record companys think I'm pussy cuz They all try to beat me
Excuse me
Ladys hood rats do it daily
Coppin my niggas fame and tellin my homies "baby"
This shit don't got nobody gettin hurt
And best beleive my first visit is gunna be that punk ass blue bird

Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Patrolling city bustin putting niggas into cust.
Bunch of sucka trying to ask "where they pick up shit"
Like deoterant be tellin I be holding it
I beat that out like clean clothes and watch me start folding shit
And cut that out like bender twice
I'm nothing nice
I'm still stressing cuz of the frisk cold ice
But the better have they nike shoes on
Cuz them high tech boots in the wrong shoes for the drugs
On the go
You wont catch me, so don't let me
Pull out my gat on you dogs that you sent to fetch me
I'll have them puppies dropping like chirps and come back out the corner Store and start busting at the blue bird

Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
Man there's a blue bird on my shoulder can I kill it
There's a blue bird on my shoulder---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
