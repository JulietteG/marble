I never had to say goodbye
You must have known I wouldn't stay
While you were talking about our life
You killed the beauty of today

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
(People love and let go)
Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever's gonna slow you down

{2X}
You'll never gonna see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you
You'll never gonna see me again
No matter what you do

You never heard me break your heart
You didn't wake up when we died
Since I was lonely from the start
I think the end is mine to write

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
(People love and let go)
Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever's gonna slow you down

{2X}
You'll never gonna see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you
You'll never gonna see me again
No matter what you do

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
(People love and let go)
Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever's gonna slow you down

{2X}
You'll never gonna see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you
You'll never gonna see me again
No matter what you do

Forever and ever
Life is now or never
Forever never comes around
