You
Don't wanna have to hear your name
Don't wanna see your smile
Cause baby I'm still cryin
Girl, its time for u to get out
I'm sick of standin my ground
Cause i'll just end up runnin
And I go to sleep and leave it in tomorrow
But I wake up screamin' halfway though the night

Chorus:
You know i can't get over
And i don't know why
U know i cant get over
No matter how i try
And i don't know why

We
Will always be the same
You say its time for a change
But i can see one comin'
So i found that out in the darkness of your lovin'
But i end up fallin back into your room

Chorus

From beginning to end
Was again right back to where we started 
I know im right
We were wrong along

You know i can't get over 
And i don't know why
U know i can't get over
No matter how i try

You know i can't get over 
And i don't know why
U know i can't get over
No matter how i try
And i don't know why

You know i cant get over---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
