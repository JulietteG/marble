our poise is set, strike now, don't rest
hesitation can kill the best
these words cannot get through
these teeth lock in the truth
they scream of murder at bodies bruised

we gotta get it right
just wanna get this right
we gotta find our way back to the light
we gotta get it right
just wanna find our way

stand up to the urgency
the emergency is why we sing
together, one voice
we have made one choice
this is it, this is it
this is who we want to be, whoa

lover step in and take the poison that sets in
when silence screams catastrophes
we'll begin the masterpiece
crisis calls for reaction so let's take this action
stop hiding 'cause we think it's safer than words

we gotta get it right
just wanna find a way
we gotta find a way back to the light
we gotta get it right
just wanna find our way

stand up to the urgency
the emergency is why we sing
together, one voice
we have made one choice
this is it, this is it
this is who we want t o be, whoa
who we want to be, who we want to

we wanna get it right
we wanna find our way
we wanna get it right 

stand up to the urgency
the emergency is why we sing
together, one voice
we have made one choice
this is it, this is it
this is who we want to be, whoa

this is who we want to be, whoa
and i know, i know---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
