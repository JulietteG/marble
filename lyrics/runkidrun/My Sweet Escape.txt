This is it 
Confidence is all i need 
This is how your going to save me from myself 
From all that fails 

I see you and me and everything in between 
And I know I'm wrong but you long to fuel 
There beneath these tired bones as i dance 
this road to Run back to you 

A place of sweet escape 
I fell into My everything will always sing your glory 
Progress I confess is way overdue 
I get caught up in the things that i've held on to For too long

I've been alone I'm stronger every step 
I take back to Run back to you 
A place of sweet escape 
I fell into Familiar taste that you have made inside this Refuge 

I can't create All back to you 
A place of sweet escape i fell into Your glory 
Your glory Sing hallelujah 
I'll forever sing to lift you up You are my king---
