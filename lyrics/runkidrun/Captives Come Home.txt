now you're lost but found
this sinking sand has closed you in
and brought you down
a struggle that's beyond yourself

don't you know you gotta get up
get up and find a way back home
so hold on tight, lets go
leave behind false sense of hope
where creeping shadows call your name

as i'm waiting for the world to end
i'm clinging on to oxygen
i'm pulling captives by the hand
come home, come home, come home

words come and go
but how will your actions unfold
your character will be shown
when lights go down

now creeping shadows call your name
possession is their claim now
turn it around, turn it around

as i'm waiting for the world to end
i'm clinging on to oxygen
i'm pulling captives by the hand
come home, come home

i'm waiting for the world to end
i'm clinging on to oxygen
i'm pulling captives by the hand
come home, come home, come home

the world is falling faster, falling
so take this step and leave
to bring you home from the other side

as i'm waiting for the world to end
i'm clinging on to oxygen
pulling captives by the hand
come home, come home

there's hope inside that box you close
that only opens when your life explodes
on the other side, come homne, explodes
on the other side, come home, come home
come home, come home, come home, come home---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
