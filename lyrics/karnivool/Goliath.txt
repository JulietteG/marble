I'm on to you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And re-write these wrongs

I'm on to it
I've watched you
Patiently
Guiding the light that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

Sinner
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you all enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you see?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!---Lyrics submitted by Mitchell Gibson.
