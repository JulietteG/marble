That this don't amount to a fall from grace
She wants to know can I replace
This tired wool with satin lace

Says you're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast
Put it in the past, put it in the past

If this is a race then I hope you come last
You're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast

Pressure builds till it breaks the dome
You can build a house, you can't build a home
And it's a fool who believes love is bred in the bone
And there's no guarantees that you won't get stoned

Yeah, I'm a fool who believed love is bred in the bone
And there are no guarantees that I won't get stoned

Says you're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast
Put it in the past, put it in the past

If this is a race then I hope you come last
You're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast

I don't know where it leads, oh, no
All I know is that I don't wanna breathe
This chemical breeze, no more

So another day breaks and the last one's gone
You dig deep just to carry on
Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone
So you slip out the back and you're moving on

She says you're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast
Put it in the past, put it in the past

If this is a race then I hope you come last
You're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast

Yeah, you're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast
Put it in the past, put it in the past

If this is a race then I hope you come last
You're on a bridge to nowhere
And you're gettin' there fast---Lyrics submitted by Angus.
