And they call him the son of the morning

I am the rival, I am the one who speaks in whisper
hear me now dear weak forgiver.

hear me now dear weak forgiver,
dont send an angel to face the devil
your wasting power on grace.
A maggot will always seek to feed from the grave
where ill lead them and teach them to feast
on the skin that defeats them 
the skin i crave

If you could see like me youll see you havnt won anything
if you could see like me youll see it by my grace your breathing

every night i start my rise
climbing high into the morning sky 
but soon after i lose your bride 
and i damn your son for stealing my light
this world is mine

they call me the son of the morning 
they call me the son of the morning 

I can mound all your fallen 
past the clouds as they roll in
and when i do i will claim your throne 
for all these cowards you call your son
I am the lord of air and my dawn will last forever 
go on pouring out cause in the end i will have them 

If you could see like me youll se you havent won anything 
If you could see like me youll se its by my grace your breathing

If you could see like me youll se you havnt won anything 
If you could see like me youll see your precious light is fading 
your light is fading---Lyrics submitted by skye.
