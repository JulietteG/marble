I drop a stone into the ocean
Every choice another turn of the screw
Another wheel set in motion
With every single thing i do
It's there in the air that i breathe
It's in my whisper and scream
Inside everything i believe
And it's all gonna come around someday

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love i give to another
You know that i believe it comes back to me

There is no absolution whether i'm the garden or the rose
If i ain't part of the solution, yeah you know how that goes
You can always leave but you bring it all back home someday

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love i give to another
You know that i believe it comes back to me

Every single thing i say, everyone that i betray
Any love that i take when i do not make it in return
Every thing i do and every time i've been unfaithful too
All the things that i believe are lessons i must learn

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love i give to another
You know that i believe it comes back to me


As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love i give to another
You know that i believe it comes back to me---Lyrics submitted by Harrison.
