It's no big deal 
Not worth the trouble
This serves the last time
I walk out of the rubble
I watch my heart
in your delicate hands
slammed against my kitchen wall
It bursts like a bubble
I look in the mirror and I see
the living, breathing proof
and I think it's time that I, 
That I face the truth

Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up
Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up

Love Potion #9, 
shucks I must have missed it
Jesus tell me is that
what got me so twisted
and all the hippies and the magazines and  tv
keep selling true love
Like it really existed 
I want to drink from that picture perfect loving cup
but I'm only human
So I fuck it up

Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up
Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up

Oh, love screws me up
And our little thing 
shot down before it starts
swept up in the cans and the bottles and the busted hearts

Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up
Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up
Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up
Love (na, na, na, na, na, na ,na, na, na)
Screws me up---Lyrics submitted by Dale Blegen.
