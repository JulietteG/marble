He walked down a busy street
Staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lover at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat
In respect of her presence

Presents her with the pictures and says
These are just ghosts that broke
My heart before I met you
These are just ghosts that broke
My heart before I met you

Opened up his little heart
Unlocked the door that kept it dark
And read a written warning
Saying Im still mourning
Over ghosts, over ghosts
Over ghosts, over ghosts that broke
My heart before I met you

Lover please do not fall to your knees its not
Like I believe in everlasting love

He went crazy at nineteen
Said hed lost all his self esteem
And couldnt understand why he was crying
Cry, crying, crying

He would stare at empty chairs
Think of ghosts that once sat there
The ghosts who broke his heart
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts that broke his heart
The ghosts that broke my heart

The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts
The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts
The ghosts that broke my heart before I met you 

Lover please do not fall to your knees
Its not like I believe in everlasting love

He says Im so lost, not at all well

Do as though there is nothing left to be
Well, it turned out Id been following him
And hed been following me
Do as though it was over
We were just two lovers crying
Over each others shoulders

And I said, lover please do not fall to your knees
Its not like I believe in everlasting love 

Lover, please do not fall to your knees
Its not like I believe in everlasting love.---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
