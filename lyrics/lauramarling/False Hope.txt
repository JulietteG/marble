Is it still okay that I don't know how to be alone?
Would it be okay if I'd just came home tonight?

We stay in the apartment on the upper west side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope

A storm hits the city and the lights go out
Before I can prepare
The whole downtown looks dark like no one lives there

She'll be alright tomorrow
Neither of us is gonna sleep tonight
We've false hope
I hear you begging through the wall
A dying animal's last call

Is it still okay that I don't know how to be at all?
There's a party uptown but I just don't feel like I belong at all
Do I?---
