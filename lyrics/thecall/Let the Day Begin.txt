Here's to the babies in a brand new world,
Here's to the beauty of the stars.
Here's to the traveler on the open road,
Here's to the dreamers in the bars.
Here's to the teachers in the crowded rooms,
Here's to the workers in the field.
Here's to the preachers of the sacred words,
Here's to drivers of the wheel.

CHORUS:
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin....
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin. the day begin.

Here's to the winners of the human race,
Here's to the losers in the game.
Here's to the soldiers of the bitter war,
Here's to the wall that bares their names.

CHORUS:
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin....
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin. the day begin... the day starts.

Here's to the doctors & their healing words,
Here's to the loved ones in their care.
Here's to the strangers on the streets tonight,
Here's to the lonely everywhere.

Here's to the wisdom from the mouths of babes,
Here's to lions in the cage.
Here's to the struggles of the silent war,
Here's to the closing of the age.

CHORUS:

Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin....
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin....
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin....
Here's to you my little love, with blessings from above, let the day begin.... the day begin....the day starts.---Lyrics submitted by Mark Allen.
