"i'd do anything for you, for you i'd change the world, no more wars, no more poverty, no more hurt, no more pain, you showed me how to love again, for you, i would change the world."

chorus:
If i could change the world,
i would be the sunlight in your universe,
you would think my love was really something else,
if i could change, if i could change, if i could changee the world, the world.

oh there would be no more wars,
oppurtunity knockin' on doors,
for uus, forus
 nobody aint known eachother,
haters turn into lovers
for us, for us.

oh the moonlight changes to sunshine,
everybody wakin' up to a better dream,
cause everybody need what they want,
but don't want what they need,
lets talk about you, let's change.

chorus:
If i could change the world,
i would be the sunlight in your universe,
you would think my love was really something else,
if i could change, if i could change, if i could changee the world, the world

if i could change the world i order,
for the one to be erased by the border,
this day (everyone deserves an oppurtunity)
there'd be no new world order,
if nobody wouldnt never get slaughtered that way,
that means so much more love and unity.
dughters would be close to their mothers, sons would be raised by their fathers,
today a good family aint nothin greater,
race crimes, hate crime ,that aint never exist,
i'll turn every bullet into a hershey kiss,
and we can eat away our fears,ohh.

chorus:
If i could change the world,
i would be the sunlight in your universe,
you would think my love was really something else,
if i could change, if i could change, if i could changee the world, the world

there will be no self hate,
we will know how to love everything about ourselves, 
so we can love everyone now,
nothing would hold us down,
 cause all of us would walk around,
with a smile and never a frown,
and every move don't clown,
there will be no more self loathin,
everyone will know when their hearts that they just found,
and that's when the light's gonna shine,
everyone will understand had it on a tip,
have some peice you must believe, believe, 
the best in you.

chorus:
If i could change the world,
i would be the sunlight in your universe,
you would think my love was really something else,
if i could change, if i could change, if i could changee the world, the world.---Lyrics submitted by carly.
