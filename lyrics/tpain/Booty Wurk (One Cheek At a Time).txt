(feat. Joey Galaxy)

Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your truck, let the base beat
Go ahead, go ahead
You gotta walk up in the club bare-footed
I like that booty, you know where to put it
Go ahead, go ahead

Mama you look so professional I'm followin' you sweating you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doing, what is wrong with my head, go ahead
Cause baby I like how you're working it, I'm watching you, you're twerking it
I'm trying get you out of this club and get you off in my bed
Oh, go ahead, yeah

Now let me see that booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo boo booty work
Go ahead, (left cheek, right side, double cheek, do it)
Go ahead
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek

(Floss...)
Black car, black rims, black shirt, black Tims
Let's go, let's go, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Let's go, let's go, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing

Holy moly, look at her, she got the boots with the fur
Let's go, let's go, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Let's go, let's go, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing

Now mama I can see that thong on you, the DJ play that song for you
I'm trying to drive my stick shift all over them curves, say word
If you keep playing with my feelings we're gonna get it, get it, get it, girl
I represent the nappy boy clique, so I know that you heard (ohhoh), say word
(Nappy Boy!)

Now let me see that booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo boo booty work
Go ahead, (left cheek, right side, double cheek, do it)
Go ahead
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek

Girl it must be a crime to be as fine as you (as fine as you, aha)
You know exactly what I'm tryna do (tryna do), you see me
I'm trying to keep it jumping (jumping)
Girl I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you're reminding me of it (of it)
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening (what's happening)
Round of applause, keep that booty clapping (clapping)
Them other girls lacking what you're packing (packing)
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents (parents)
I'm trying to see them shorts (see them shorts) spread apart
I ain't coming up short (up short) Kevin Hart (Kevin Hart)

Now take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Move your feet (move ya feet) cut a rug (cut a rug),
Put your hands up if you're the baddest in the club
Ah!

Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Girl I'm tryna get you next to me but first you gotta let me see that
Booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo boo booty work
Go ahead, (left cheek, right side, double cheek, do it)
Go ahead
Now let me see that booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek ---
