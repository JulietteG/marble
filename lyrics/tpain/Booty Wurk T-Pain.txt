ohh, gotta be cool baby, you know what im sayin? 

Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your trunk, let the bass beat. 
Go ahead (x2)

You gotta walk up in the club bare footed
I like that booty and you know where to put it, 
Go ahead (x2)

Now mama you look so professional
Im followin you, sweatin you
I cant believe im doing what im doing,
What is wrong with my head? Go ahead,

Cuz baby I like how you workin it

Girl i got a chevy with hydrolics and you remindin me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know whats happenin,
round of applause, keep that booty clappin.  
Them other girls lackin what you packin, and you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents. 
Im tryna see them shorts spread apart, i aint comin up short, kevin hart. 

Now take off, come on baby keep on doin watcha doing, come on baby keep on doin watcha doin.
Move ya feet, cutta rug, put ya hands up if you the baddest in the club (HAH)
