Nappy boy, Heyy, Pretty boy, Heyy, Nappy boy, Heyy, Pretty boy

T-Pain: Turn up the bass, turn up the treble, 
I'm about to take you to a whole other level! 
Dj turn off what you're playing, 
I want the whole club to hear what i'm saying! 
Because this girl means so much to me, 
And now we're on the floor and she touching me. 
And if I wanna take her home 
It's gotta be better than what they do on the radio! 

Chorus: It's gotta be the crunkest 
It's gotta be the loudest 
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
I gotta tell her how I feel 
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smiling, 
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby 
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh eh eh eh (contiunsly)

Chris Brown: Turn on the lights, give me a mic 
I'm about to sing it to her just how she like
Jump off the stage, oh bombs away, crowd surfin all the way, Cowabunga! 
You know it's right, just do the wave, 
Girl just move your body like a snake 
And if you wanna get with me 
Put your hands in the air, show me the energy 

Chorus: It's gotta be the crunkest 
It's gotta be the loudest 
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
I gotta tell her how I feel 
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smiling, 
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby 
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh eh eh eh (contiunsly)

T-pain and Chris Brown: Homie kiss your girl 
Shawtyy kiss your man 
We can see you on the kissin cam 
Now show me some love 
Show me some love 
Now look her in the eye, say baby I love you 
I'd never put no one above you 
And if you feel that way 
Go ahead and kiss your baby 
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
eh eh eh eh  
And if you feel that way 
Go ahead and kiss your baby 
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like 
Eh, eh, eh, eh 
Oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Jocelyn.
