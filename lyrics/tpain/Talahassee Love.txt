They Thought I Left Man
Yeah, T - P A I N, Lets Go Man
T-Pain Man, I'm Back In This Thang
You Already Know What Is 
Tallahassee Got My Back tho This How I Went

I Used To Hit The Stage Wit My Shades On
40 Brought Me To The West Coast
Now It's Khaki Suits Wit My Shades On
I'm On The S*** Game On

But On Sundays I'm Like Diddy Grown Man Wit One Chain On
When I Come Back, N**** See My Group
They See Mamma's Two Cars And Both Of My Daddy's Boats
They See Sean Jean Coats, And My Wife Hoppin' Out
The Lamborgini Wit The Coach Bag

I'm Gettin' Paid For Nuttin', Sittin' Back, Drinkin' Lemanade
Chillin' In The Shade, I'm Stuntin' Makin' Hits When I Graze 
The Button
Go Ahead And Put Them Baby Seats In My Escalade, It's
Nuttin'
I'm Gettin' Money

Learned From The Past And The Furtrue
Learned Not To Never Stab a N**** That Shot Ya
Even Tho my Pockets Gettin' Fatter
I'm Still Gettin' Tallahassee Love And Thats All That Matters
J-lyriq Get ' Em

I've Been There I've Been Back
But Somthin' Here Always, Brings Me Back
So When I'm Here I Get That Tallahassee Love

If You Love Me, Then I Love You
My People Love It, When I Come Thru
So When I Do, I Get Tallahassee Love

It Shoudn't Have To Be Like This Man
I Dont Know How I Did It Either Man
I Know You Haters Hatin' This Right Here Boy

(Tallahasse Love)

Second time Around, Man Let's Go---Lyrics submitted by Frank.
