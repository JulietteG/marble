[T-pain]
Yeah...yeah, yeah yeah

Tebunon, pedalofigus,
From the planet Telaguson... yeah

Alutium pew 36 explosive space modulater
Going on a trip I'll be back home boy I'll see you later
Going back to a time where know everything was straighter
And everythings great now but back then it was greater
And I don't need no clothes, I'll go in just what Im wearing
Matter fact I'll just go back to what I'll use to where then
No matter how bad the weather, everything back then was just so better
I can dream its a simple thing, I'm building a time machine

[Hook]
Back back back back back back back, back in time
I can dream ita a simple thing
I'm building a time machine
Back back back back back back back, back in time
I can dream it's a simple thing
I'm building a time machine

[T-pain]
Yeah, going back to a time when this music shit was more than business
Back to a time when I knew my niggas was down and if they still is
And I didnt have to worry 'bout what I got on when I go outsizid
And I didnt have to worry 'bout what kinda car I got when I rizid
And I didnt have to have 22s, 24s, or 26s
And I didnt have to be forever surrounded by a million bitches
No matter how bad my life was, I still got love no matter how mad my wife was
I can dream it's a simple thing
I'm building a time machine
