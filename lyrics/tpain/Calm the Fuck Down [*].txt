(Ohhh, Yeah) (x2) 
I don't know (I Dont No)
Say I'm doing no thing but its something no matter what i do
You can go 
Oooo, Pack your bags and run and get the money girl its all up to you
I cant stay ooh(stay home) 
Not with all this fussing and this arguing and cussing at me
Go away ooh(away ooh)
Hundreds dollars fifties when them twenties get to busting you'll see

(Chorus x2)
But baby girl i cant take all of this fussing and hollering,
moving and tossing shit around
And you best not throw them pots and them pans in here 
Im the man in here 
You Betta calm the fuck down

Now I know (Now I know)
All your friends want me and you to break up 
To make up

Tell them hoes to just FACE Up
Cuz were in love (love)
They don't wanna see us happy walking, talking doing our thang
But hold up (uuuup)
Oooh You cant disrespect me bitch get outta and give me back all my change

(Chorus x2)
But baby girl Im not goin take all of this fussing and hollering moving and tossing shit around
and you best not throw them pots and them pans in here 
Im the man in here 
You betta calm the fuck down

Now I see(Now I see)
That you and me shouldn't be
