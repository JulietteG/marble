It's 4am baby
And you've been out all night
But you got home just in time
To hear me say "Goodbye"

My mind's made up
And I swear today
That this time my heart won't get in the way

I don't doubt that you're sorry
Not for one moment
And that now you see the error of your ways
And those tears (that's a nice touch!)
Sliding down your face
But it's too little ...too late
It's too little ...too late

Grab your hat and coat
While you're talking
You can call a cab
Or you can take out walkin'

My advice is simple
Find another fool somehow
'Cause all the tears in China won't change my mind now

And I don't doubt that you're sorry
Now you've seen the error of your ways
And those tears (ah! that's a nice touch!)
Sliding down your face
But it's too little ...too late
It's too little, a little too late

It's 4am baby! you've been out all night!
But you got home just in time
To hear me say "Goodbye"
My mind's made up
And I swear today
That this time my heart won't get in the way

I don't doubt! I don't doubt that you're sorry!
Not for one moment
And now you see the error of your ways
And all those tears (well ...that's a nice touch!)
Sliding down your face
But it's too little ...too late
It's too little and it's too late

You're always late
But this time you're too late ...too late ...too late.---Lyrics submitted by Frank Spurs.
