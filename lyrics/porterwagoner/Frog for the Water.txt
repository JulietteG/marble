A Frog for the water
Porter Wagoner
He had a mind the world might call slow
But he knew more than we will ever know
He never won a metal or a race
But he knew all the words to Amazing Grace
He never had money for the collection plate
But every Sunday morning he always gave
Momma said Son you cant give the lord a frog
And whats he gonna do with that marble and them rocks

 And he said Build mansions of marble and stone
Heavens got a lot of angels gonna need a lot of homes
Dont worry about it momma me and Jesus know 
A frog for the water where the river of life flows

When he was born the doctor said he wont live very long
He was just ten years old when Jesus called him home
Just before they laid his sole to rest 
His momma filled her sons last request
She placed beneath his hand one of his rocks
And in his pocket a marble and his frog
And with tears streaming down her smiling face
And in her broken heart she could still hear him say

Build a mansion of marble and stone
Heavens got a lot of angels gonna need a lot of homes
Dont worry about it momma me and Jesus know 
A frog for the water where the river of life flows

Lets build a mansion of Marble and stone
Heavens got a brand new angel he needs a new home
Dont worry about it momma me and Jesus know 
A frog for the water where the river of life flows
Dont worry about it momma me and Jesus know 
A frog for the water where the river of life flows---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
