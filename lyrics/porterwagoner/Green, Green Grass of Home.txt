The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
There to meet me is my Mama and Papa
And down the road I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherry
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Yes they've all come to meet me
Arms a-reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
There's that old oak tree that I used to play on
And down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherry
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and a sad old heartbreak
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
When again I'll touch the green green grass of home

They'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home---Lyrics submitted by John.
