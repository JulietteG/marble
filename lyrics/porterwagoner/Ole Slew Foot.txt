High on the mountain, tell me what you see
Bear tracks, bear tracks lookin' back at me
Better get your rifle boys, 'fore it's too late
'Cause a bear's got a little pig and headed thru the gate.

CHORUS
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
Ain't never been caught, he ain't never been tree'd
Some folks say he looks a lot like me.

I saved up my mon' and bought me some bees
And they started makin' honey way up in the trees
Cut down the tree but my honey's all gone
Ole Slew-Foot's done made himself at home.

CHORUS

Winter's comin' on and it's twenty below
And the river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chase him up the gulley then we'll run him to the well
We'll shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell.

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by F.
