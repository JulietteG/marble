I've known you from somewhere,
Tell me where have we met,
I should have remembered, 
How could i forget,
I thought as i kissed you,
I could hear your heart cry,
Please remember, remember, remember,
And don't ask me why.

Please help me remember,
Did i meet you in May,
Was it June or December,
Or just yesterday,
Oh i've known you from somewhere,
So don't go away,
I'll need you tomorrow my darling,
Like i need you today.

I've known you from somewhere,
But my memory's not clear,
Be patient my darlin',
You know i'm sincere,
Oh i want to remember,
For your love's so divine,
And i know that i love you, I love you,
Oh won't you be mine.---Lyrics submitted by Jud.
