Come on Balthazaa I refuse to let you die
Come on fallen star I refuse to let you die
Cos that's wrong and I've been waiting far too long
It's wrong I've been waiting far too long
For you to be...be...be...be...be mine... for you to be mine...be mine...for you you to be mine.
And it't worong, I've been waiting far too long
It's wrong I've been waiting far to long
For you to be...be...be...be

All the centerfolds that you can't afford
Have long since waved their last goodbyes
All the centerfolds that you can't afford
You've long since faded from their eyes
So be...be mine
So be..be mine---Lyrics submitted by thanasis.
