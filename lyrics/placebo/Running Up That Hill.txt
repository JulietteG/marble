It doesn't hurt me
You wanna feel how it feels?
You wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You wanna hear about the deal I'm making?

You
(If I only could be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could be running up that hill)

If I only could make a deal with God 
And get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building, if I only could

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies?
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
There's a thunder in our hearts, baby 
There's so much hate for the ones we love
Tell me we both matter, don't we?

You
(If I only could be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could be running up that hill)
You and me won't be unhappy

If I only could make a deal with God 
And get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building, if I only could

Come on, baby
Come on, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience  

If I only could make a deal with God 
And get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problem 

If I only could make a deal with God 
And get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problem 

[x7]
If I only could be running up that hill---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
