Who let the cat out of the bag?
who told the world that I was older?
Who laughed at all I had?
who said the race was over?

I am a small and gentle man
who carries the world upon his shoulders
kindly lend a helping hand...
Come over

And hold onto me,
hold onto me,
and hold onto me,
hold on

And my behavior is hard to understand
When I'm like a phone with no connection
But I'm still doin' all I can
To try and get me some redemption
And I'm knee deep in sinking sand
Crying out for your attention
Kindly lend a helping hand
For once defy convention

And hold onto me,
hold onto me,
hold onto me,
hold on

And hold onto me,
hold onto me,
hold onto me,
hold on

[Dialogue]
Our task is to transform ourselves,
into awakened multidimensional beings
Thus fulfilling our dream.
The 4th and 5th dimensions to the third.
It is the inner meaning between Earth [?] and Heaven [?]
This sacred magic has already been achieved by many of us.
The nameless others are awakening daily
as the cause steadfastly intensifies.
We are the claiming of divine birthright and heritage
Remembering that we are angels incarnate;
Vast starried beings of light.
We are no longer limited and bound by the illusions of time, space, and matter
We are ready to join as unimensions? of the one
The [?] doorways cannot be opened or passed by any of us
still operating as individual units of consciousness.
They are brought into manifestation from our unified presence;
Through our focused intent;
Through our total commitment to serving a higher purpose.
This is the bridge to an entirely different energy pattern.
It is the step beyond the mound dimensional universe.
It is a journey into the unknown which shall lead us ever closer to home. ---
