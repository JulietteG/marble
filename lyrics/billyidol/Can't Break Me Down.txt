The devils house in the shape of a chapel
You hid the knife in the core of an apple
Burn me, try to hurt me
Try to hit me when my back was turning

I saw you wait when the shadows were growing
Youre talking straight
But your colors are showing
Burn me, try to hurt me
Try to get me when my head was turning

You want to rain on my survival story
Youre crazy baby cause Ive never had a doubt
Im singin songs about love and glory
Oh oh oh

Your gun went
BANG BANG BANG
You shot me to the ground
But you cant break me down

BANG BANG BANG
You tried to knock me out
No, you cant break me down

Its just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
Im the original assassin
I come up for more

You put me up so you can watch me crumble
I always knew you were some kind of trouble
Lurking, you cant hurt me
cause I see just how your evils working

A silver tongue with the best of intentions
But youre a child with the cruelest inventions
Burning, youre just hurtin
I know somewhere deep in hell youre workin

You want to rain on my survival story
Youre crazy baby cause I never had a doubt
Im singing songs about love and glory
Oh oh oh

Your gun went
BANG BANG BANG
You shot me to the ground
But you cant bring me down

BANG BANG BANG
You try to knock me out
No, you cant break me down

Its just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
Im the original assassin
I come up for more

You dont know what you started
You hit but missed the target

BANG BANG BANG
You shot me to the ground
But you cant break me down

BANG BANG BANG
You tried to knock me out
No, you cant break me down

Its just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
Im the original assassin
I come up for more---
