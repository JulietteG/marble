I feel this pressure weighing down, weighing down on me
I can't complete a thought, its hard to breathe
It keeps me awake
I'm walking fearfully through everyday, through every place
But I, I just cannot turn away

Failing at conversation
But I wanted you to show me
I wanted just to know me like you do
Failing at conversation
But I'm never giving in
Can you take away this pain I'm living in?

I feel this silence raining down, raining down on me
All my weaknesses for you to see
I lost track of days
Right back where I started from
Face to face with what I've become
But I just cannot turn away

Failing at conversation
But I wanted you to show me
I wanted just to know me like you do
Failing at conversation
But I'm never giving in
Can you take away this pain I'm living in?

Failing at conversation
But I wanted you to show me
I wanted just to know me like you do
Failing at conversation
But I'm never giving in
Can you take away this pain I'm living in?---Lyrics submitted by Kendra.
