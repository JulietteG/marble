No place to hide
Nowhere to lead us
I wanna take it down
Saramona said

No great reprise
I will abandon
I want to bastardise
This entire state

Lets start a fire
It's like a big freight train
Lets start a fire
We are defeated

The TV lies
It makes me anxious
I want a dictator
Saramona said

Lets free desire
Be unconnected
I wanna pop this pill
Cause I'm a free man

Lets start a fire
It's like a big freight train
Let's start a fire
We are defeated---
