Will I drive out
In the night
Never come back
In a mighty fright
Stay out longer while I can
Picking fossils in the sand

I admire all the games
Another asshole lights the flame
Rusted clotheslines in the sun
Noise control, I'm sunken

I will smile
The greatest written smile
No one to complain
Written in chrome and gore
It's all the same

YEAH YEAH YEAH x5

All I ever wanted was a piece to myself
All I ever wanted was a nine to five
People hide what they feel inside
So they'll cover it up till it's grey and dry

A pussy is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Raise their arms to the leader outside
Praising the devil they said
Hell fuck yeah

YEAH YEAH YEAH x5

I can't fight it
I can't hide
Will you take me over
Little devils run around outside
Will you take me under
I can't breath if I cannot see
I can't see if I can't breathe

All I ever wanted was an afternoon
A middle class and an open sky
They rushed in the square with a paper alight
Pushed down a statue and spat on it's side

A feeling is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Raise their arms to a leader outside
Praising the devil they said
Hell fuck yeah

YEAH YEAH YEAH x5

I can't fight it
I can't hide
Will you take me over
Little devil run around outside
Will you take me under
I can't breath if I cannot see
I can't see if I can't breathe

Yeah, yeah, yeah,fuck yeah

Take me down x3---
