[NOTE: The following lyrics, slightly varied, are what Jack Blades sings on the official music video.]

==============

I WAS BORN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SAND
TO A GYPSY MOTHER AND A GUITAR-PLAYING MAN (OH YEAH)
RAISED INSIDE THE AMERICAN DREAM
DESERT PARTIES, HAD IT ALL, SO IT SEEMED (HELL YEAH) 
YET THERE WAS SOMETHING DRIVING ME WILD, DRIVING ME CRAZY
DEEP INSIDE, LIKE A KNIFE CUTTIN ON ME
SO I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU GOT ONE LIFE SITTIN ON THE SHELF
GET OUT (OHHHHH YEAH)

GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA [x2]
GOT THE SUN, GOT THE BEACH
AND ITS ALWAYS CALLING ME (OH YEAH)

SO I HEADED NORTH, SAN FRANCISCO BAY
THERE WAS MUSIC ALL NIGHT, IT WAS A PARTY EVERY DAY (OH YEAH)
I FOUND MYSELF IN A FUNKY BAND
LED BY A FAMILY STONE HORN-PLAYIN MAN (HEY, HEY YEAH)
YET THERE WAS SOMETHING PULLING ME HARD, DRIVING ME CRAZY
I NEEDED MORE  TOO MUCH MUSIC INSIDE OF ME
SO WITH MY FRIENDS, WE HAD A PLAN
START OUR OWN ROCKIN BAND  THATS RIGHT (OHHHHH WOW)

GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA [x2]
PRETTY WOMEN YOU GOTTA SEE
AND THEYRE ALWAYS CALLIN ME (OH YEAH)

HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, RAINBOW BAR & GRILL
LOTS OF GOLD RECORDS, I STILL LOVE IT HERE
PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, FILLMORE WHERE THE MUSIC LIVES,
WINE COUNTRY, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE I KNOW
SIERRA MOUNTAINS, SOUTHERN BEACHES, INLAND CITIES, ROCK-N-ROLL

[Guitar solos]

IN CALIFORNIA [x2]
CHECK OUT THE SUN, CHECK OUT THE BEACH
AND ITS ALWAYS CALLIN ME (OH YEAH, OH YEAH)
GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA [x2]---Lyrics submitted by MattHilgaertner.
