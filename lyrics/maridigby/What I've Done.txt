In this farewell
Theres no blood
Theres no alibi
Cause Ive drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

[Pre-Chorus:]
So let mercy come
And wash away
What Ive done

[Chorus:]
I'll face myself
To cross out what ive become
Erase myself
And let go of what ive done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

For what Ive done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
Im forgiving what Ive done!!!

[Chorus]

What Ive done
Forgiving what Ive done---Lyrics submitted by Tanielle Williams.
