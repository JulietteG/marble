Won't you walk me around Lake Harriet
and hold my hand

Whisper those sweet nothings
like no other man can

And when the sun goes down in Minneapolis
I see the master plan

Won't you walk me around Lake Harriet
and hold my hand

Movin' too fast, think I never can stop
I've been runnin' from the past
trying to beat it to the top

The miles add up, I hate to see another town
I try to look up but all I feel is down

Baby it's the only one
that makes me come undone

REPEAT CHORUS

Gravity pulls too much
I buckle underneath the weight
memory of the country calls a higher state

Where the sea is calm, I know right from wrong
And there's love in every minute
I'm loving every minute

Baby it's the only one
that makes me come undone

REPEAT CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Bob Wennerstrom.
