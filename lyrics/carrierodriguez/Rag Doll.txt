You make it hard to love you
and everytime I do it just turns bad
and I try to stop this feeling
knowing you're the best I'll ever have

I've become a floppy rag doll
for you to toss aside when you grow bored
you make it hard to love you
now it's all I seem to know

I make it hard to love me
everytime you do I lose my head
and I try to do it better
remember all the good things that you said

You've become my toy soldier
for you to toss aside when you grow bored
I make it hard to love me
now it's all you're living for

I've become a floppy rag doll
for you to toss aside when you grow bored
you make it hard to love you
but I just do it even more

Oh, you make it hard to love you
but I just do it even more---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
