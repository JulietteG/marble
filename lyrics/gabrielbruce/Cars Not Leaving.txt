There's a game that's always played
And always won by fools
But everyone I know
Would rather never play than lose

There's a place where the innocent stand
Proud before the firing squad
There's a church at the end of the path
Where the sign reads "Beware of the God"

And there's you in the alley
And there's me walking away
Those three words still hang in the air
That I swore I would never say

So hold on now, just hold on a minute
This car's not leaving if you're not in it
You've no idea how lucky we are
A wound that deep would normally scar
[x2]

I heard there was a place where the light
Managed to cut through the dark
But that was just a story for children
And my chest is just a grave for my heart

There's a phone that's always ringing
Answer and a child will say
"I'd rather take my own life
Than give it away"

And there's you under the west wing
For to hide from the rain
And I'm taking your picture
To be sure that I'll see you again

So hold on now, just hold on a minute
This car's not leaving if you're not in it
You've no idea how lucky we are
A wound that deep would normally scar
[x2]

But I've seen willows holding hands
Heard birds sing in harmony
The bodies of water are caressed by land
And the river's mouth is kissing the sea

So hold on now, just hold on a minute
This car's not leaving if you're not in it
You've no idea how lucky we are
A wound that deep would normally scar
[x2]---Lyrics submitted by Jesus Landa.
