Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and thats all...)
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil and thats all right

Now Im there depending on where you've been
The futures for you to see, and doubt in your mind
You may be unsettled by what you see
What actually comes to be
In your life

Theres things that none of us can control
Theres fish that could eat you whole
Without even trying

And I may be just like Claudius
And Ill take your crown; Ill take your queen
Suffocate myself in incestuous sheets
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and thats all...)
(Yeah...) And thats all right

Its this way no matter what you say
With the nightmare that it is today
But its been alright

Theres nothing worse than picturing what I've seen
One of the many screams
They continue to shine

Ive seen a house on fire and swept out to the sea
Yeah whilst youre struck with fear
Ill pour this puzzle in your ear coz...

I am just like Claudius
And Ill take your crown; Ill take your queen
Suffocate myself in incestuous sheets
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and thats all...)
Summon all your villagers and just take my life
You got to rid yourselves of evil
You got to rid yourselves of evil (and thats all...)

Dark lights
Dark lights shine loud
The dark lights are out
Lights lights away
Lights lights away
