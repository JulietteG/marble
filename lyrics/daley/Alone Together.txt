(with Marsha Ambrosius)

Baby
Ahh yeah
I dont wanna be alone

[Daley:]
A definite silence
Youre almost exactly what I need
A definite maybe
Is sure to entice my curiosity
I can't help but think that this doesn't add up
I'm trying to separate the facts from all the fiction
Were living in a world of contradictions
And if baby youre the truth then Im lying next to you

[Chorus:]
And youre the desert sand, Ill be your water
And youre the perfect plan I never thought of
I dont wanna do this on my own
And you shouldnt have to be alone
I would rather be alone together
Be alone together.

[Marsha:]
Well my hearts been racing, chasing after you
Youre the sweetest dream my incredible you
Youre the star so bright, you're eyes the lightest blue
I cant help but stare at you
So soft your lips, the wind blow in my hair, yeah
Come closer let me whisper in your ear
cause what will be will be every chance you give to me
You will see yeah yeah

[Chorus:]
Youre the desert sand, Ill be your water
And youre the perfect plan I never thought of
I dont wanna do this on my own
And you shouldnt have to be alone
I would rather be alone together
Be alone together.

I always keep you safe in my arms
I will guarantee that I will never break your heart
Ill always put you first cause you deserve the world
I wanna know you
I wanna hold you baby
I wanna show you

Youre the desert sand, Ill be your water
And youre the perfect plan I never thought of
I dont wanna do this on my own
And you shouldnt have to be alone
I would rather be alone together
Be alone together.

You shouldn't have to be alone
I would rather be alone together
Be alone together baby. ---Lyrics submitted by Tara Kayy.
