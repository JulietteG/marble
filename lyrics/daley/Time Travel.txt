They say live within the moment
Cause there's nothing else but now
But I'm sleepless and it's over
So somebody show me how

I can get back to a feeling
That existed in the past
Find somebody with some meaning
Try to equal what we had

I wanna go
All the way, all the way
All the way back...
All the way, all the way
All the way

All I really need
Is time travel and you
Don't know what this is
We're travelling through
All the memories
Unravel with you
So all I really need
Is time travel
And you...
And you...

It's the silence that will save us
Now all too much has been said
We no longer know the people
That we cling to on the bed

Is it beyond reparation?
Does this have to be the end?
In an alternate dimension
Maybe we could start again

I wanna go
All the way, all the way
All the way back...
All the way, all the way
All the way

All I really need
Is time travel and you
Don't know what this is
We're travelling through
All the memories
Unravel with you
All I really need
Is time travel
All I really need
Is time travel
All I really need
Is time travel ---
