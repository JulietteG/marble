When I was a boy
I was always caught in the middle
I was never a winner
Just a loner in the crowd
Looking for a way out

Then I grew a little older
And a little bolder
I grew impatient
The future I was chasing
Never seemed to be within my reach
Til I heard somebody say

(Slow, slow down)
Nothings gonna happen before its time
(Slow, slow down)
Let the pieces fall into place and youll be fine

chorus
Take your time
So Im waiting,
Cause I know Im gonna be
Next in line
To claim my prize, and be all that I wanna be
I work so hard to earn my place
And good things come to those who wait

So made it out, eventuallyI took the leap
And I landed on my feet
Yeah I found my team, my family
And as I chase this dream
I know that they believe in me
And were onto something good (I know)
Were bout to conquer this world
Im so glad that I
Took my own time

Im glad I did it the right way

(Slow slow down)
Now I listen to my instincts when I lose my way
(Slow slow down)
And thats when they say

chorus
Take your time
So Im waiting,
Cause I know Im gonna be
Next in line
To claim my prize, and be all that I wanna be
I work so hard to earn my place
And good things come to those who wait

Now I know if I died tomorrow
I wouldnt regret a single thing
I wanna look back on where Ive been
And know that I made, my own way
That I lived each day, and owned it
Working for that good thing, that good thing

chorus
Take your time
So Im waiting,
Cause I know Im gonna be
Next in line
To claim my prize, and be all that I wanna be
I work so hard to earn my place
And good things come to those who wait

Good things, those who wait
I appreciate those who wait
Thank you to those who wait                                                            Good things come---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Parada.
