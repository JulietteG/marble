(feat. Fabolous)

Boy, I see you looking at me, looking at you
Now I already know what you want, 'cause I want that shit too

It don't matter if you're single, single
Either way I just wanna take you home, take you home
And it don't matter if you got a past, got a past
'Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that
Do with that, do with that
So I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
We ain't gotta waste time going out on dates
We ain't gotta count down 'till you come to my place
We ain't gotta, we ain't gotta
We ain't gotta, we ain't gotta
You ain't gotta waste time sending me roses
They gon' die anyway, man them shits boring
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta
'Cause I want you right now

Look you need to stop playing with yourself (what?)
Like I ain't who you playing when you playing with yourself
You playing the shy role, I was playing it myself
But it's no good for you, now you playing with your health like
I ain't who you thinking 'bout
When you layin' by yourself
Know you heard it was a movie
Better stop role playing with yourself like
Like, like, stop frontin'
Know they coming at your neck like a top button
You need to go ahead and drop it for a nigga
So I can come behind and like, 'miss you dropped something'
And fuck is these roses for, what all these clothes is for
I wanna close the door, fuck till we dozin' off
Wake up and go again, what's the Mimosas for
You got the juicy things, champagne toast to yours
Cheers shawty, yeah shawty
Time to face your fears shawty
Climb up on it and hit them gears shawty

Got my heart like likes, looked at her like psyche
Looked at her like psyche
You ain't gotta
Hey T stop playin' with me

The last nigga broke my heart
You probably break it too, no baby
I'd rather just play my part than to play a fool, no

So it don't matter if you're single, single
'Cause baby boy, I'm just trying to take you home, take you home
It don't matter if you got a past, got a past
'Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that
Do with that, do with that
So I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
We ain't gotta waste time going out on dates
We ain't gotta count down 'till you come to my place
We ain't gotta, we ain't gotta
We ain't gotta, we ain't gotta
You ain't gotta waste time sending me roses
They gon' die anyway, man them shits boring
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta
'Cause I want you right now
