If I tell you, you belong to me 
Would you be mine in reality? 
And not just in my mind 
I'm so tired of being invisible to you 
I'm so tired 

How could a boy like you, ever want a girl like me? 
You're way outta my league, way outta my league 
'Cause boys like you, won't ever want a girl like me 
You're way outta my league, way

I can't believe you stay
Surprised that you even look my way
Fuck it
I find it, you want it
There's so many reasons to be on it
'Cause I"m a realist, so you feel this
And I don't blame you, no

Good boy like you, won't ever want a girl like me 
You're way outta my league, way out of my league
'Cause boys like you, won't ever want a girl like me 
You're way outta my league, way

No, I don't like making mistakes
'Cause my heart so easy to break
That's a risk I don't usually take
Got this feeling I hate to lose
That's the feeling when I'm with you
Doing things I don't usually do, no

Boy like you, won't ever want a girl like me 
You're way outta my league, way outta my league 
'Cause boys like you, won't ever want a girl like me 
You're way outta my league, way outta my league
How could a boy like you, ever want a girl like me? 
You're way outta my, outta my, out my league

You're way outta my league---
