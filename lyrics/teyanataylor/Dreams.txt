I heard that you feelin' Teyana
You said she a fly lil mama
I heard that you feelin' Teyana
You swear she a fly lil mama

Dreams of sleeping with a R&B; chick, B chick
I heard your little bars about my cleavage, dream shit
Don't waste my time, if you comin' nigga, come right
Got a couple niggas on my line
Nigga all I'm tryna say
You know that I hear you, boy
Niggas talk that shit all day
Tell me you something different, boy
Boy, I want different
Boy, I want something different
So you better come with it
Boy you better come with it
'Cause whoever get in it
Is automatically win it

Dreams of sleeping with a R&B; chick
This pedestal so high, niggas can't reach it
And yet I hear you runnin' game
You're not the first to sing my name
Everyone wanted Teyana
A singer, a dancer, designer
I heard you in love with a Harlem
Ass doesn't shake when she walkin'
No need to send me no bottle
Nigga I pay for my order
Should be accustom to customs
Had that ass crossin' the border
Had yo ass crossin' the border

Dreams of sleepin' with an R&B;
And I know you got them dreams of fuckin' me
So stop wastin' time, if you comin' nigga, come right
Got a couple niggas on my line
But boy, you know that I'm taken
Boy, you know that I'm taken
I don't really wanna play again
And I'm gone and I'm taken
'Cause you know that I'm taken
I apologize, apologize
That I got ya hype but blow my mind now
I apologize but I'm taken
Apologize, but I'm taken

Fantasy girl, a fantasy world---
