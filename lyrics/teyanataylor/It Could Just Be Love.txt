Give me your love love, give me 

You knock me down, my pride hits the ground 
Don't know if this is going away 
My heartbeat jumps to the tip of my tongue 
I think you're wanting to say, come over here 

Give me your love love, give me 
Give me your love love, give me 

Boy you don't know what you're doing to me 
Just give me your love love, give me 
Right here, don't care 

It could just be love, or something like it 
Boy I don't know, but I need you right now 
It could just be love, or something like it 
I think I like it, and I'll know soon enough

I take you in, sweet blissful sin
I'm questioning if you were my religion, no
My heart skips only to the beat of your drum
I can feel your, your rhythm calling me say, yeah

Give me your love love, give me 
Give me your love love, give me 

It could just be love, or something like it 
Boy I don't know, but I need you right now 
It could just be love, or something like it 
I think I like it, but I'll know soon enough

Struck down, surely there are other victims
Shot down. I'm another victim
Cold blood, you and me here or there
No, I wasn't the only one victim
Peace one, I've never been it
Bible, bible with good intentions

It could just be love, or something like it 
Boy I don't know, but I need you right now 
It could just be love, or something like it 
I think I like it, but I'll know soon enough

Give me your love love, give me 
Give me your love love, give me 

Give me your love love, give me 
Give me your love love, give me---
