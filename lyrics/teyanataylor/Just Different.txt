I swear, I swear, Im hurt babe
I just don't understand
No, no

In a dream, my heart, somewhere in the dark 
In the drop, missed a couple parts then it stopped 
But the beat changed, I cant think straight, yeah 
Like a work of art looking at my heart 
On the wall, tell me what it mean to you, he say she say 

I tried to explain the words are just words, no difference 
The love in my heart is not the same, its just different 

And you break my heart, you got it to start
No surprise, do it every time
Then you go for a joy ride, on your side
Acting like I'm not loving every drop
Doing for well over the top
Going wild on the freeway
If they see me

I tried to explain the words are just words, cant quit this 
The love in my heart is not the same, its different 

Know you, know you hurtin' baby
Just don't understand
I swear, I swear
Just don't understand
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna---
