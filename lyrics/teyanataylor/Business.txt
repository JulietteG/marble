Ever since the first time I laid eyes on you, I saw the truth
No questions, just proof
They talk, but I ain't hear a thing they said about you
Ever since the first time we laid down, everybody want details
I don't say nothing, I won't say nothing
If you don't say nothing, 'cause this is between us
Yeah, we gon' fight, but I'mma love you till it's alright
Ain't gon' find these answers outside
Boy, we don't need nobody's advice
Give me a shoulder to cry on, and I'll be alright
I'll be the one you rely on this love

Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
It's ours, all ours, nobody else's
None of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Boy it's ours, baby it's ours

Don't ask me, "how was the sex?"
That's between me, my man, and our bed
Plus I know how you hoes get
I ain't tryna lose a friend
Telling you how my man do it the best
And the same goes for you, baby
I know how niggas do
Your friends be talking crazy
Acting like bitches too
You know they do

Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Boy it's ours, baby it's ours

So we don't need nobody else, all we need is us
Opinions get involved baby, fucks up all the trust
The bond, the love
You're scared, me too
He hurt me, she hurts you
You taking a risk, well me too---
