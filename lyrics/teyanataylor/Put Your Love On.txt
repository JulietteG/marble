Right, baby come and do my body right
I don't care about who's on my line
We should be alone, just you and I
Time, look at how we're losing track of time
That's what happens when you spend the night
You get on my bed, you hold me tight

Boy, boy you know, that I love it, love it
When you're in control
I return the favor to you nice and slow
You know how we do, baby, my love is on you
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all baby
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all baby

Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, yeah, I love you some
Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, boy, I love me some you

So right, baby don't forget to hit the lights
So right, baby don't forget to hit the lights
Creeping through the back door
I see you every morning
Put the rock on, shining bright
Give me more

Boy, boy you know, that I love it, love it
When you're in control
I return the favor to you nice and slow
You know how we do, baby, my love is on you
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all baby
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all baby

Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, yeah, I love you some
Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, boy, I love me some you---
