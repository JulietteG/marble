(feat. Chris Brown) 

So I got this feeling 
You and I need a moment 
I want you to love me, babe 
Make me know it 
I need you to want me, babe 
Come and show it 

Let me satisfy you tonight 
Go inside sit on my couch, oh 
I know what you like just sit back 
Let me ride, hear it all out, uh 
I want you right now 
Not another minute later, so come on 
Put your money where your mouth is 
Give you what you paid for, so come on 
I know its real how my body feels on yours, oh 
And I want to spend some time 
No answer sign on the door, oh no 
Please dont disturb me, no 
Dont disturb, no 

So I got this feeling 
That you and I need this moment 
I want you to touch me, baby 
Let me feel it 
I need you to hold me, baby 
If you in it 

Let me satisfy you tonight 
Go inside sit on my couch, oh 
I know what you like just sit back 
Let me ride, hear it all out, uh 
Baby, I want you right now 
Not another minute later, so come on 
Put your money where your mouth is 
Give you what you paid for, come on 
I know its real how my body feels on yours, oh 
And I want to spend some time 
No answer sign on the door, oh no 
Please dont disturb me, no 
Dont disturb, no 

Like a copper Im cuffing, cuffing the field 
Little mama got ass and she walk in them heels 
She love when I eat it, she making a meal 
Baby girl screaming 
I give her the pillow so no one can hear 

Oh, he biting my neck and my legs in the air 
Tell me you love me, then pull on my hair 
I like it rough, dont be gentle with me, nigga 
It aint rocket science, its simple, my nigga 

Oh, please dont disturb me, no 
Dont disturb, no
Please dont disturb, no---
