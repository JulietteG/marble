You're so fragile I know
Some things we cannot control
I am so selfish it shows
I just can't let go
Tell me three little lies
Everything is alright
It tears me all up inside

[Chorus]
If I talk to God
I don't know if He's listening
When I speak out loud
I don't know if He's home
I'm talking to myself
' Cause no one else is listening
Stay another day
And will it all go wrong?
If I talk to God

I hate the words that I said
They lay so still in my head
I hope I never regret
If I just let go

Goodbye to time well spent
I've got nothing to defend
And is this really the end?

[Chorus]

And you can feel me when you fall
When your backs against the wall
And you know this town we live up in
Is the loneliest of all
And you can feel me when you're down
And when your world turns upside down
I know this place we're living in
Is the loneliest of all

[Chorus]

I will be the colors in the rain
When you're lying up and wide awake
Hold on, hold on, I will for you
I will be the truth inside your lies
When you close your eyes at night
I will, I will, hold on, for you---Lyrics submitted by anne.
