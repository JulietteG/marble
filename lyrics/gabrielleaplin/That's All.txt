Just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong, when I thought it was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day and you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
Always the same it's just the shame that's all

I could leave but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you when you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time

I could leave but I won't go, it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
Why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who
Makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together till the end

I could leave but I won't go, it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who
Makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together till the end

Just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day and you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

That's all---
