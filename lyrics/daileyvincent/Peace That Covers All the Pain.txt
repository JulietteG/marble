When you've cried countless tears, and nights are long
When you fallen below bottom, your last ounce of hope is gone
You are not forsaken, He has known your strife
And promised with the dawning, joy to fill your life

He gives peace, that covers all the pain
He brings a calm, in the middle of a hurricane
When you feel forgotten, and no one knows your name
He gives peace, that covers all the pain

When the winds of life have sailed and faith has swayed
When dark clouds hang around you, you can't find the words to pray
He is there beside you, holding to your hand
He will send a comforter, through the storm you'll stand

He gives peace, that covers all the pain
He brings a calm, in the middle of a hurricane
When you feel forgotten, and no one knows your name
He gives peace, that covers all the pain

It's a peace that you can't fathom
It's a peace you can't explain
Though you're broken and abandoned
His peace, will take the hurt away

He gives peace, that covers all the pain
He brings a calm, in the middle of a hurricane
When you feel forgotten, and no one knows your name
He gives peace, that covers all the pain

He gives peace, that covers all the pain---Lyrics submitted by Kimberly Block.
