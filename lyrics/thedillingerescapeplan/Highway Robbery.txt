You'd never imagine us bringing a loaded gun to the ballroom this party's about to kick off Tonight is the wrong night the devil's own are only starting up the first round of the fight so hang on tight 
Dear mother the needle is jabbing the womb draw back and release this child of disease This mob is a riot the outlaw youth are only emptying the first round of the night 'cause everything's not alright 

I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs wool over our eyes 
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth wearing your disguise 

It's pretty apparent this boy is a curse the christ of the moment so blow him away hey come on 
And take the new number if you're next in line then kid I got a really
Big fucking surprise there won't be a next time

I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs wool over our eyes now
Your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth wearing your disguise---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
