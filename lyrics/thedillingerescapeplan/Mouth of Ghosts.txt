Our trust runs out tonight
Everything we said dissolves
And now we say our last goodbye
Nothing to resolve
I never imagined you'd turn into this
But then the end was always close
We could feel it all along

Don't you know where(repeat)
We could hide the lies

You were a mouth without a heart
An action without meaning
And you walk afraid
Reaching for the hands that turned closed---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
