Flowers open, winter's spoken 
The same world but the view has changed 
A veil has lifted, the ground has shifted
What you only longed for is here 

A moment mends a broken heart 
If you'd only known it from the start 
The moments form just who we are 
You were always here 

Eyes so open, kindness spoken 
The same words but their sound has changed 
It's clear as crystal, a perfect picture 
A landscape that you only dreamed 

A moment mends a broken heart 
If you'd only known it from the start 
The moments form just who we are 
You were always here 
Always here 

A moment mends a broken heart 
If you'd only known it from the start 
The moments form just who we are 
You were always 
A moment mends a broken heart 
It was burning for the circumstance 
A beautiful coincidence and love 
Always here---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
