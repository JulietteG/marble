I knew exactly, I knew exactly what this would feel like
I knew exactly this day was coming, I knew it right from the start

I could see it in your eyes, but I just didn't care
I knew the days were numbered, but I fell anyway

I knew exactly, I knew exactly what you would be to me
A scar on the horizon, a perfect dim illusory light

And I held it in my hands to protect it from the wind
But the more I held on, I knew I'd lose it again

You blew in like a breeze and rolled out like a storm
I know you didn't think it'd do any harm

I knew exactly, I knew exactly what this would feel like
To hear the same voice that said 'hello' say 'goodbye'---Lyrics submitted by Victoria June.
