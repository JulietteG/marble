i wanna rock and roll
i wanna give my soul
wanting to believe, im not too old
dont' wanna make it up
don't wanna let you down
i wanna fly away
im stuck on the ground

so, help me decide
help me to make up
make up my mind
wouldn't that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you

watch it all go by
was it really true?
is that what it was
was that really you?
looking back again
chasing back the threat
said it was a miss, was it just in my head?

so help me decide
help me to make up
make up my mind
oh wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you

so help me decide
help me to make up
make up my mind
oh wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you ooooohhh

something's gotta break
u gotta swing the bat
too many years of dying
why is that?

so help me decide
help me to make up
make up my mind
oh wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you

and so help me decide
help me to make up
make up my mind
oh wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you

and so help me decide
help me to make up
make up my  mind
oh wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you

wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you
wouldnt that save you...save you 
wouldnt that save you---Lyrics submitted by melika.
