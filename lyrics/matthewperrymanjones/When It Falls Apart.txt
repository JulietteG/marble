Here we go again
It's all the same
A familiar scene
But we call it by a different name

It's an aliby of innocence
We work so hard for all
To just make sense
But it won't make sense

When it falls apart
The pieces fit
But you won't see it
Til your blinded

You can let it go
Or hold it tight
When you lose your life
You will find it

Ohh - la de de da de de da 
Ohh - la de de da de de da
Ohh - la de de daaaa da

Another day begins
Oh it's nothing new
These lessons come to me
Dressed in deja vu

I thought I had it all
Sort of figured out
But she striped me clean
And disposed my doubt
That's what it's all about

When it falls apart
The pieces fit
But you won't see it
Til your blinded

You can let it go
Or hold it tight
When you lose your life
You will find it

Oh, in the dark
On my knee,
When I hear her sing to me

Oh, why is the truth
So hard to take
The heart can not go free
Til it breaks

When it falls apart
The pieces fit
But you won't see it
Til your blinded

You can let it go
Or hold it tight
When you lose your life
You will find it

Yeah, When it falls apart
The pieces fit
But you won't see it
Til your blinded

You can let it go
Or hold it tight
When you lose your life
You will find it

You will find it, 
You will find it yeahh

Ohh - la de de da de de da 
Ohh - la de de da de de da
Ohh - la de de da de de da
Ohh - la de de da de de da---Lyrics submitted by Becca.
