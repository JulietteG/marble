She thinks I'm much too thin
She asks me if I'm sick
What's a girl to do 
With friends like this
She lets me drive her car 
So I can score an eighth
From the lesbians 
Out west in Venice

Oh, California in the Summer
Ah, and my hair is growing long
Fuck yeah, we can live like this

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be 
A holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks 
Beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains 
And say it's so much fun out here
But when it's all over
I'll come back for another year

I'll look for work today
I'm spilling out the door
Put my glasses on 
So no one sees me
I never thought that
I'd be living on your floor
But the rents are high 
And LA's easy

Oh, it's a picture of perfection
Ah, and the postcards gonna read
"Fuck yeah we can live like this...
We can live like this"

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be 
A holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks 
Beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains 
And write it's so much fun out here

Hey Madeline (hey Madeline)
You sure look fine (you sure look fine)
You wore my favorite sweater
Being poor was never better
A safety buzz (A safety buzz)
Some cheap red wine (Some cheap red wine)
Oh, the trouble we can get in 
So let's screw this one up right

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be 
A holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks 
Beneath the sun
We'd lie and tell our friends
It's so much fun out here
But when it's all over
I'll come back for another year

When it's all over 
I'll come back for another
When it's all over 
I'll come back for another year---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
