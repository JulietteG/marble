There's a lot that I don't know
There's a lot that I'm still learning
But I think I'm letting go 
To find my body, it's still burning

And you hold me down
And you got me living in the past
Come on and pick me up
Somebody clear the wreckage from the blast

Yeah, I'm alive
And I don't need a witness
To know that I survived
I'm not looking for forgivness

Yeah, I just need light
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution

And the bars are finally closed 
So I try living in the moment 
'Til the moment it just froze
And I felt sick and so alone

I can hear the sound
Of your voice still ringing in my ear
I'm going underground
But you'll find me anywhere I feel

Yeah, I'm alive 
And I don't need a witness 
To know that I survived 
I'm not looking for forgivness 

Yeah, I just need light
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution
I need light in the dark as i search for the resolution

(Tomorrow back from hell)
Resolution
(Some stories I will never tell)
Resolution
(And yeah, I'm almost home)

And you hold me down 
Yeah you hold me down

Yeah, I'm alive 
And I don't need a witness 
To know that I survived
I'm not looking for forgivness

Yeah, I'm alive 
And I don't need a witness
To know that I survived
I'm not looking  for fogivness

Yeah I just need light
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution
I need light, I need light

I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution
(Resolution)
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution
(Resolution)
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
