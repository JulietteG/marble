I am looking for a sign
My spirit's faded
She holds on like a vine
Patterns in traffic
They sound just like my heart
Race in the dark
In time to catch you.
No one should let you
Go wandering off into the night
You're not an orphan.

I keep waiting for my breath
To come back never
So take what I have left
Patterns in traffic
That pulls just like my heart
Race in the dark
In time to catch you
No one should let you
Go wandering off into the night
You're not an orphan.
Right there to catch you
I won't forget you.
Now you're wandering to the night
But you're no orphan
You're not an orphan

I never thought the day would come
(you're not an orphan)
They tell me that you've finally run
(you're not an orphan)
I guess you always said you would someday
(you're not an orphan)

I never thought the day would come
(you're not an orphan)
They tell me that you've finally run
(you're not an orphan)
I guess you always said you would someday
(you're not an orphan)---Lyrics submitted by michael.
