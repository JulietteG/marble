I'm caught
Somewhere in between
Alive
And living a dream
No peace
Just clicking machines
In the quiet of compazine
The walls caved in on me

And she sings
My bird dressed in white
And she stings
My arm in the night
I lay still
Still I'm ready to fight
Have my lungs
But you can't take my sight
And the walls caved in tonight

Out here
I watch the sun circle the earth
The marrows collide in rebirth
In god's glory praise
The spirit calls out from the caves
The walls fell and there I lay
Saved

The walls are caving in
As far as I can see
The walls are caving in
The doors got locked for sure
There's no one here but me

Beat my body like a rag doll
Stuck your needles in my hip
Said we're not going to lie
Son you just might die
Get you on that morphine drip
Drip

The walls are caving in
As far as I can see
The walls are caving in
The doors got locked for sure
There's no one here but me

I fought a war to walk a gangplank
Into a life I left behind
A window's leading to the past
Think it's time I broke some glass
Get this history off my mind

And what if we were buried forever
Like the past never happened
And time did not exist for us at all
I think we'd still be traveling together
Through all kinds of weather
Everything's a piece of everyone
As far as I can see

The walls are caving in
As far as I can see
The walls are caving in
The doors got locked for sure
There's no one here but me

The walls are caving in
As far as I can see
The walls are caving in
The doors got locked for sure
There's no one here but me

There's no one here but me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
