I'll give you this confession,
I am taking you with me.
Where we can contemplate our chemistry.
And your eyes were lined with questions,
with the blood rushing the way.
To take this feeling with us to our graves, to our graves.

Chorus:
I got the feeling were still misdirected,
I get the feeling we have lost control.
Tune in,
I'll turn you to the new religion.
We're dropping out into the so unknown.
The so unknown.

And we won't wake up on Sundays,
so I'm building us a church.
Where we can sleep in with the gods at work.
And our friends will write us letters,
they'll never understand why we don't call.
We're hiding out until the empire falls,
let it fall.

{Chorus}

If we have lost control,
we're drifting slow.
Into the so unknown.
If we have lost control,
we're drifting slow.
And so we drop out.


And I'll give you this confession,
I am taking you with me.

{Chorus}

I got the feeling we got disconnected.
I got the feeling we have lost control.
Tune in,
I'll turn you to the new religion.
We're dropping out into the so unknown.
The so unknown.---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
