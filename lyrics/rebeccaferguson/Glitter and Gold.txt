How good or bad
Happy or sad
Does it have to get?
Losing yourself
Don't cry for help
You don't think you need it
And old friends are just a chore
But now you need 'em more than ever before

All that glitter
And all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bored and sore
Riding wild horses
You can't control
With all your glitter
And all of your gold
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul
Soul, soul, soul

How high, how low
How on your own
Does it have to get?
Losing your soul
Will cost you more
And that life you're paying for
And all those friends that are just a chore
You're gonna need 'em more than never before

All that glitter
And all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bored and sore
Riding wild horses
You can't control
With all your glitter
And all of your gold
Take care of your soul

One day you're gonna wake up and find that
No dream is losing it's shining
Nobody is by your side
When the rain comes down 
And you're losing your mind
So who you're gonna run to?
Where you're gonna hide
Glitter and gold won't keep you warm
All those lonely nights
And all those friends that were such a chore
You're gonna need 'em more than ever before

All that glitter
And all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bored and sore
Riding wild horses
You can't control
With all your glitter
And all of your gold
To care of your soul

Take care of your soul
And all of your gold
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul
Soul, soul, soul
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
