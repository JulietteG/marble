I used to hate you so easily
Look into your eyes so eagerly
And where there was cold
I wouldn't walk away
'Cause when there's money love is blind
He's so blind

But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go

I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she is kind
I hope that she is kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

'Cause after a time you realize that it ain't easy
'Cause after a time you realize that you should've believed me

I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Loving ourselves comes so easily
Forgiveness was like the biggest sin to me
And where there was war
I wouldn't walk away

But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go

I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she is kind
I hope that she is kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope

Used to hate you so easily
Look into those eyes so eagerly
And where there was cold
I wouldn't walk away ---
