Looking for drugs in all the wrong places
Wanted to be famous but ended up nameless
Love is not the answer I'm in love with this stuff
I spent every last dime in a stranger's trunk

It's alright
It's okay
I'm alright
I'll be okay

First time I felt like I was gonna die
but I've gotten pretty good at telling myself it's fine
Anna talks me down and gives me sips of her beer
Head pounding reveille
"How did I get here?"

It's alright
I'll be okay

Let it go
Let it go 
All the way down
'Til there's nowhere left to fall
It's a shame all the ways we build ourselves up
Just to let each other down

Looking for drugs in all the wrong places
Felt a change coming but I couldn't face it
Tried to keep my cool when I finally made it home
I had a bloodshot excuse for every lie I told

It's alright
It's okay
I'm alright
I'll be okay

Let it go
Let it go
All the way down
'Til there's nowhere left to fall
It's a shame all the ways we build ourselves up
Just to let each other down

Last night is all a blur to me
I don't remember anything
But I vaguely recall
Being alone

(Oooooooh)

It's alright
It's okay
I'm alright
I'll be okay

Let it go
Let it go
All the way down
'Til there's nowhere left to fall
It's a shame all the ways we build ourselves up
Just to let each other down 

A'Let it go
Let it go
All the way down
'Til there's nowhere left to fall
It's a shame all the ways we build ourselves up
Just to let each other down---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
