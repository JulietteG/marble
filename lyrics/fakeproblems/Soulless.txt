This mess is not to be ignored, vilified, or abhorred
So take these words for what they truly mean to me
And I may not have the same kick as some of the other spices
But I am burning up inside
And I am still losing my mind for you

I was soulless, soulless
Broken down
Hollow as a ghost
But you have brought me back to life
And revived the hope
Take me home
Take me home

I will pretend to be asleep
So that no one will notice me
When everybody leaves
That's when I'll be able to dream
And I'll rearrange the room
The only thing I'll keep is you
And I hope you realize
What you truly mean to me

I was soulless, soulless
Broken down
Hollow as a ghost
But you have brought me back to life
And revived the hope
Take me home
Take me home

I am made of mistakes
I don't believe in fate
And I refuse to fail again
I will not let them win
I am much more than human
But just as insignificant

Soulless, soulless
Broken down (so soulless)
Hollow as a ghost
But you have brought me
Back to life (so soulless)
Revived the hope

I was soulless, soulless
Broken down
Hollow as a ghost
But you have brought me back to life
And revived the hope
Take me home---Lyrics submitted by Liliana Tovar.
