It started out as a feeling
Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word
And then that word grew louder and louder 
Until it was a battle cry 
I'll come back 
When you call me
No need to say goodbye
Just because everything changing
Doesnt mean its never been this way before
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
As you head off to the war
Pick a star on the dark horizon
And follow the light
Youll come back 
When its over
No need to say good bye
Youll come back
When it over 
No need to say goodbye



*instruments*



Now were back to the beginning
Its just a feeling 
And no one knows yet
But just because they cant feel it      to
Doesnt mean that you have to forget
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
Until theyre before your eyes
Youll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye
Youll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye
