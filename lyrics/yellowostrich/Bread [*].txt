To go away for quite a while
If that is what would make you smile
Its something I would gladly do
Because I am in love with you
To go without a piece of bread
Because of something that I said
If that is what its going to take
Then that is what its going to take
(x2)

Brother wont you sing a song for me
Sing along and then follow me
Take your chance to bring your news to me
Tell me how shed look if I could see
(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Annie Thomas.
