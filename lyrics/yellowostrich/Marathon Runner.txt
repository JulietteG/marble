When i was a boy of seventeen
I know it's mean but I
I told my friend to give up on her dreams
She hated me but I
I knew the dreams were for the best of us and for the rest of us
And I
I didn't wanna share with anyone

I need a way to see me greatest dance and make them laugh
I could win the wars or lose the battles, too
Whichever's true
I can live in other people's lives
I can't stop putting on other people's clothes
I love them until i leave

I am a marathon runner
And my legs are sore
And I'm anxious to see what I'm running for
I am a hot air balloon
On a sailboat
I wouldn't make this my home if i learned to float

So take my trash
Just take my earthly life
I'll try to cry
I will live without the things i love the best
So hold them to your chest
I lose my face
Just lose my stolen wings
The heads of kings
I will run until i know what to believe

I am a marathon runner
And my legs are sore
And I'm anxious to see what I'm running for
I am a hot air balloon
On a sailboat
I wouldn't make this my home if i learned to float

I am a marathon runner
And my legs are sore
And I'm anxious to see what I'm running for
I am a hot air balloon
On a sailboat
I wouldn't make this my home if i learned to float---Lyrics submitted by Mackenna Mayfie.
