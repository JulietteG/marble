I got chills, they're multiplying, and I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplying, it's electrifying
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you
You better shape up, better understand, to my heart I must be true

You're the one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh
Can't you see, oh yes indeed, oh yes indeed

If you're filled with affection, you're to shy to
call me, meditate my direction, feel your way

You better shape up, cause you need a man, who can keep me satisfied
You better shape up, you better prove, that my faith is justified
But I'm sure down deep inside

You're the one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh
Can't you see, oh yes indeed, oh yes indeed---Lyrics submitted by syria.
