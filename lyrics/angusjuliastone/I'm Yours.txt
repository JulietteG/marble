Wait
wait on the corner
i'm coming for ya
nothing will change
Life
life is a mistake me made
wasn't a price
i wanted to pay

i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours

How 
Oh what a funny word
wasn't a guy I was expecting, 
falling down
and I 
sit by the window
watching the air you bretah
so far away

I'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours
i'm yours---Lyrics submitted by amy.
