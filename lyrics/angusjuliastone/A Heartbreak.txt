I met your parents
They were lying about falling in love
I met your parents
They were dying but falling in love

Girl, you're just a child: A heartbreak
Girl, you're just a child: A heartbreak

I saw your friends at the drive-in
They were falling in love
I met your friends
They were lying about falling in love

Girl, you're just a child: A heartbreak
Girl, you're just a child: A heartbreak

Girl, you're just a child
Falling in love

Girl, you're just a child: A heartbreak---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
