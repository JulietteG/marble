so much pain, we don't know how to be but angry
feel infected like we got gangreen
please don't let anybody try to change me
me, just me in the middle of a sea full of faces, full of faces
some laugh some salivate, what's in your alleyway, recycling bins or bullet cases?
it's not equal it's not fair we're different people but we're not scared
we aint never scared to pave a new path, make a new street, build a new bridge
say can you see by the dawns early light
free slaves run as songs words weren't right 
now a new day has come, the fews days done while the many are handsome
your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
the bass drummin' is the anthom 
we step to the heartbeat of our granddaughters and grandsons

               [chorus]
Rise together we,
Rise together we, 
Rise together we, 
Rise together we,
Rise together we,
Rise together we,
Rise together we,
Rise together we,
                [chorus with crowd]

lost hope and found the ground, by your surrounding
do the walls scream university's, well you and i verse the T's
react automatic and we bust the sqeeze
and make 911 each emergency, ergency
ambitts arret like the term that leads, oh please let the hearin' cease
don't let apolie police the poppulas we will march across those stereotypes 
that were marked for us
the, answers obvious, we, switch the considents in
change the story to words and live continent

                     [chorus]


                      [chorus]

if you believe in redemption, calln' to you from another demension(from another demension)
if you believe in redemption, calln' to you from another demension(from another demension)
if you believe in redemption, calln' to you from another demension(from another demension)
if you believe in redemption, calln' to you from another demension(from another demension)---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
