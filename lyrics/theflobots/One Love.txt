I just wanna say 
welcome to the part of the show
where the base drum hits hard and slow
your face becomes aware that Im starting to flow
and it sounds like a song that you already know
you might have heard it at 11th and Fillmore
A sort biggish building with a littlish a billboard but
Whats everybody staying still 4,
3,2,1 If youre happy, Gillmore
then act like youre knowing it clap
And move like youre in a kayak and youre rowing it
And if you dont wanna clap then snap 
Whatever floats your boat just go with it
Cause Im hoping thisll get you open 
Its a bit of spoken word a little joking heard hear and there
Lemme clear the air
This is not a competitionLord, hear my prayer
So if anybody listening is feeling scared
We wanna make your spirit aware that
You are not alone
You are not alone

Chorus:
You are (you are) not alone
You dont have to do this on your own
One Love Agape One Love Agape 
Solo(w) it can feel like were coming apart
Together were much more than the sum of our parts
One Love Agape One love Agape 


Some of out parts are just about busting
Some of our parts are rusty but these
Lips voice sentiments begun in our hearts and
Heal wounds with the songs that are sung in the dark
So if youre feeling like a Pimp take a moment just to hold it off 
My role model will not only brush ya shoulders off
But wash your feet, give his life as the soldiers watch
And forgive his torturers below the cross
So when youre slapped and youre told to fight back
And they taunt you over the phone to incite smack
Get back! Get back in the zone despite that
And rely on the strength that the bonified have
But if you act like you know me like that
Call me cheesy like macaroni I might snap snap
But only like that and get on the microphone and recite raps

CHORUS
You are not alone
You dont have to do this on your own
You wont have to prove yourself to get through this
Dont have to lose yourself to this music
In fact you might find yourself
In a room full of strangers trying to help
In a flashback to the last time you felt
The presence of something divine well, this is
Hip-hop its not just for profit anymore never was 
Its too easy to live your life waiting for change to arrive if it ever does
It will come from a source thats infinite, not from a middle man
You cant measure its force but youve got a sense of it, and its bigger than
Hip-hopits larger than life/death.much greater than us/them..
Everybody One love/agapeCHORUS---Lyrics submitted by cody.
