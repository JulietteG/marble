I've.. been.. 
Traveling the land from gravel into sand. 
Not knowing where I'm going never having any plans. 
Anything I wanted had to grab it in advance 
Abracadabra there's a rabbit in my hands cause, 
Ive got the magic stick bust the baddest tricks 
Fished for a whale brought a ship up out of it 
Whats that I just saw? A platypus? Naw. 
Maybe its a rat crawling flat on his paws 
or a baby dragon just dragon his claws 
It doesn't really matter 
because its Saturday, 
so look that-a-way 
3 o'clock matinee, 
lets collaborate 
and Ill pay you back soon 
with a crazy rap tune. 
But for now were just gazing at the moon 

(chorus)
but for now im just gazing at the moon (x7)

Wander and ponder the pale blue yonder 
To infinite and beyond the city 
Beyond the city, we all want to see serenity 
But some times you've gotta hop the fence to see. 
That all sidewalks must end eventually. 
I sit still at the bottom of the sea, 
brainwaves chill i can see an anemone, 
sentient entity 
Let the spirit enter me 
Patient, pervasive, how I was meant to be 
A stone worn smooth by the swift currents of chaos 
A place to lay a smooth array of lush moss 
I'm parlaying on my day off 
floating way off on my thought balloons and snacking on macaroons 
But for now I'm just gazing at the moon.  

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Izzy.
