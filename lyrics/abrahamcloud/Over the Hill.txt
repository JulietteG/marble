If I do what I wanna do,
Ill go to jail for a year or two.
If I stay in my living room,
Ill never get over the hill.     

Sherman Oaks, they got a lot to do,
Shopping malls, swimming pools,
A lotta pretty people
an they all wanna screw,
But I never got over the hill.   .

I tried to analyze this fear inside
breakin through.
If you agree to run off with me ,
Well run in the sun
til the sun finally finds its way out,
check it out,

Met a girl under somebodys table,
Shared a smile an a mashed potato,
Said she loved me but she just wasnt able,
She couldnt get over the hill

Thinking back to the days
spent in high school,
Science teachers would always
eyeball you,
Wish Id seen the left side of the menu,
I might gone over the hill---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
