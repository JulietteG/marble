when I saw myself standin' next to me
I couldn't help but see the similarity
had faded like somebodys  two week summer tan
one had a problem and one had a dog he called Man

when the king came down to the truck-stop town
there was a big parade and a big let-down
we thought that an answer was there in his uncalloused hand
one had a problem and one had a dog he called Man

meanwhile outside,  noone walked alone at night
the missionaries left on ferries bound for foreign sanctuaries
one held a sign that said, " Its Time
to forget your problems and find food for that dog called Man

From the mountain tops to the corner bar
the word went out, it was happy-hour
we all went searching for meaning in tiny little cans
to help solve the problem we called on that dog he called Man

It was a giant dog, almost 40 feet
as the day went on we knew it had to eat
we offered our lemons we offered our tasty homemade pies
the dog ate religion with soda and large order fries---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
