I wake up in a panic every morning, like there was something I'm supposed to do . 

Something so important I start shaking.   It takes a lot of coffee to calm me down

I'm living in an old abandoned drug store.  Probably couldn't compete with the CIA

I should've listened to Jim Morrisson.  Only lawyers survive the heat in LA


       another smoke , another drink, another dirty magazine

       another slow suicide attempted

       anothet successful breakfast


There's someone laying in my doorway.  They appear to be breathing but who really cares.

Summer sun can't cut the fog of air polution.   We're all being cooked for breakfast today.

       another smoke , another drink, another dirty magazine

       another slow suicide attempted

       anothet successful breakfast


A dollar-thirty-nine,  gets me three eggs. potatoes and time,

Time to figure out a place to stay,

A quarter buys a paper. New statistics on tne Homeless.

There's not a whole lot left to say.

       another smoke , another drink, another dirty magazine

       another slow suicide attempted

       another successful breakfast---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
