Im just lookin  for a job,
Maybe I could mow your lawn,
Cool lemonade in the warm suburban sun,
After the job was done, cause

I WAS IDEAL EMPLOYEE #743
I KEEP MY EYES OPEN
AND MY MOUTH SHUT
AND I DONT TAKE FROM THE TILL
YOU GAVE ME A NUMBER     
BUT MY NAME IS BILL

Im just lookin for a job,
Somethin to keep me occupied,
I wanted to save the world,
But that doesnt pay,
Im back on the streets today,

I WAS IDEAL EMPLOYEE #743

I CAN PASS YOUR PISS TEST
THEN YOU CAN PISS ON ME
IM UNDER THE GUN  
IN THE LAND OF THE FREE

And Ill do a good job for you,
 Yeah Ill do my best,
And  Ill do everything for you,
  Ill do my best

I WAS IDEAL EMPLOYEE #743

THEY PROMISED THE WORLD TO ME
BUT I DIDNT GET ANYTHING
PROGRESS MARCHES ON,  AN SO SHOULD I
UNDER THE GUN IN THE LAND OF THE FREE
I WAS PROUD TO BE 743
HERES TO YOU 744.---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
