These hours of chasing days
Cause I let go of yesterday
And how I long to see
What this life could be

And I don't know how we will find
When I'm standing here by your side

And it won't take much, just what we need
For all we got is love and that's enough for me
Got all that I want, got all that I need
As long as there is love, then that's alright with me
That's alright with me, That's alright with me

You know me know, I know I'm this
Cause I had to find myself
When I lost an empty place
You kissed her away on my darkest days

I'm drowning in the waves and I love you
You know that ain't hard to see
And heaven knows when I am around you
It's the only place I wanna be---
