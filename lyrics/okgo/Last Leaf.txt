If you should be the last autumn leaf hanging from the tree
I'll still be here waiting on the breeze to bring you down to me
And if it takes forever, forever it'll be...
And if it takes forever, forever it'll be.

And if you should be the last seed in spring to venture forth a leaf
I'll still be here waiting on the rain to warm your heart for me
And if it takes forever, forever it'll be...
And if it takes forever, forever it'll be.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
