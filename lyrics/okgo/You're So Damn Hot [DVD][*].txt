I saw you sliding out the bar. 
I saw you slipping out the back door, baby. 
Don't even try and find a line this time, it's fine. Darling, you're still 
divine. 

You don't love me at all, but don't think that it bothers me at all. 
You're a bad-hearted boy-trap, babydoll, but you're... 
You're so damn hot. 

So now you're headed to your car. 
You say it's dinner with your sister, sweetie. 
But darling look at how you're dressed. Your best suggests 
another kind of guest. 

You don't love me at all, but don't think that it bothers me at all. 
You're a bad-hearted boy-trap, babydoll, but you're... 
You're so damn hot. 

So who's this other guy you've got? 
Which other rubes are riding hot-shot, sugar? 
I could have swore you said before, "No more, for sure." What'd I 
believe you for? 

You don't love me at all, but don't think that it bothers me at all. 
You're a bad-hearted boy-trap, babydoll, but you're... 
You're so damn hot.---Lyrics submitted by Kate.
