(Oh no)
Oh lately it's so quiet in this place.
Your not 'round every corner. Oh!
(Oh no)
Oh lately it's so quiet in this place.
Oh darling if your not here haunting me,
I'm wondering, who's house are you haunting tonight?
Oh who's shapes you twist?
Oh who's face you kiss?
Oh who's house are you haunting tonight?

(Oh no)
I don't think much about you anymore.
(Oh no)
Your not on every whisper. Oh!
(Oh no)
I don't thing much about you,
but if your not lurking behind every curtain,
I'm wondering, who's house are you haunting tonight?
Oh who's name you hiss?
Oh who's clenching fist?
Oh who's house are you haunting tonight?

Now who's house are you haunting tonight?
Oh who can't resist?
Oh who's crying?
Who's house are you haunting tonight?
Oh who's name you hiss?
Oh who's shapes you twist?
Oh who's house are you haunting tonight?
