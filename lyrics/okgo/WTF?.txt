I've been trying to get my head around,
what the fuck is happening? (Clap Clap, Clap)
I'm trying to make some sense out of,
what you're doing with my head. (Clap Clap, Clap)

It's like a skydive
or getting high
The kinda thing'll maybe kill you.
It's like I'm eye-to-eye
with a wild lion.
Oooohh,
I don't know what to tell you.

There's just this thing about 'cha.

Maybe you can help me clear this up,
cause me myself I just can't tell.
Are you some kind of dark sorcerer
Am I under some kinda of spell?

'Cause I could go on for days,
just crazy about it, oh,
You're so respectable,
a little animal.

It's like a skydive
or getting high
The kinda thing'll maybe kill you.
It's like I'm eye-to-eye
with a wild lion.
Oooohh,
I don't know what to tell you.

There's just this thing about you,

So are you gonna tell me what comes next,
or am I just supposed to know? (Clap Clap, Clap)
Do I make my own decisions here,
or am I under your control? (Clap Clap, Clap)

'Cause I been like this for days,
just crazy about it, oh,
and it's startin' to get, you know,
a little uncomfortable,

It's like a skydive
or getting high
The kinda thing'll maybe kill you.
It's like I'm eye-to-eye
with a wild lion.
Oooohh,
I don't know what to tell you.

Do you think I'm out of line?
Do you think I'm out of line?
Well maybe it's fine, maybe it's alright it's like I'm eye-to-eye with a wild lion,
yeah I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to tell you.

There's just this thing about 'cha...---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
