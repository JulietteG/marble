In your fitted raincoat and tangled winter hair.
Cheeks a little rosy in the February air.
And running through the subway, to catch the uptown train
Spend the night just dancin'.
And running through the subway, to catch the uptown train.
Spend the night just dancin'.

I want 'cha, yeah I want 'cha.
I want 'cha, yeah I want 'cha bad.
So bad I can't think straight.
So bad all my bones shake.
So bad I can't breathe.

And in the midnight quiet, outside the world away.
We could have just one more, maybe you could stay.
And in the light of morning for 21 days straight.
There you are beside me.
And in the light of morning for 21 days straight.
There you are beside me.

And I want 'cha, yeah I want 'cha.
I want 'cha, yeah I want 'cha bad.
So bad I can't think straight.
So bad all my bones shake.
So bad I can't breathe.

So won't 'cha, oh won't 'cha say yes.
So won't 'cha, oh won't 'cha give in.
So won't 'cha, I won't cha come on.
(Various sounds of "Ahs"...)
I can't breathe...

'Cuz I want 'cha here, I want 'cha.
I want 'cha here, I want 'cha bad.
So bad I can't think straight.
So bad all my bones shake.
So bad I can't breathe.

Ooooh, I want 'cha here, I want 'cha.
So bad I can't breathe.
Oooh, I want 'cha here, I want 'cha.
So bad I can't breathe.
Oh, I want 'cha, I want 'cha.
I want 'cha here. (I won't 'cha.)
So bad I can't breathe, so bad I can't breathe...
I, I can't breathe.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
