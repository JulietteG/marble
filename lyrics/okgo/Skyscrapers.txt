Skyscrapers please forgive me.
I didn't mean a word I said.
Skyscrapers, I was just tangled up in my own head.

And so how in all the madness,
I thought that I was seeing straight.
It ain't always pretty but it seemed there was no other way.

And I guess,
All I ever loved
Was standing right before my eyes.
And I, oooh I,
I was blind.


So, skyscrapers, please forgive me.
I stand here a penitent man.
Oh, skyscrapers, I'll never look down again,
Again.
Oh, 'cuz I guess, all I ever loved,
Was standin' right before my eyes.
Oh, yeah I've got, all I ever loved,
Standin', oh standin', oh standin' here all the time.
And I, yeah I...I was blind.
I was blind.
I was...blind.

Oh, you were here all the time.
You were right, here all the time! 
I was blind! I was blind! I was blind.
Oh, I was blind.
Oh, oooh I was blind.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
