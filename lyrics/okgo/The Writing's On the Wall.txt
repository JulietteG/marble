Listen I know its been hard
You know its no different for me
Were less than a zero-sum game now
And baby, we both know thats not how its supposed to be

The writings on the wall
It seems like forever
Since we had a good day
The writings on the wall

But I, just want to get you high tonight
I, just want to see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

I go too high, and you go too cold
And we both fall apart
Then you bring your mind, to rest against mine
But the mind has no say on affairs of the heart

The writings on the wall
It seems like forever
Since we had a good day
The writings on the wall

But I, just want to get you high tonight
I, just want to see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

Then you bring your mind, to rest against mine
But the mind has no say on affairs of the heart

The writings on the wall
It seems like forever
Since we had a good day
The writings on the wall

But I, just want to get you high tonight
I, just want to see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

I, just want to get you high
Just want to get you high
Just want to get you high
Even if its the last thing we do together

Even if its the last thing we do together---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
