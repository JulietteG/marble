Miss Antoinette, she went out with a song
Selling booze and silver shoes
And singing right along
Shotgun and a limousine while the baby dolls march on
Miss Antoinette, she went out with a song.

And it's the long way down
Yeah, it's the long way down.

Down at the Maple Leaf they pack 'em in
We all get sauced, turn down the house so we start all over again!
And tonight we'll all get reborn to a couple fifths of gin
Here we go

The rich boys get their money back when the banks go belly-up!
But if you're downtown when the levees break, well you're shit out of luck.
Shit out of luck.

And over at the place they train the gods
With Stanton on the drums, you don't need no one on guitar
And sometimes all it takes is going way too far.

And it's the long way down
Yeah, it's the long way down
Aw, it's the long way down
A long way down

And the rich boys get their money back when the banks go belly-up!
But if you're downtown when the levees break, well you're shit out of luck.
The penthouse paupers need your help,
So everybody lend a hand.
And maybe they'll get you a real sweet price of Louisiana land.

Now Kroft down on the street with his trombone
And even though the 12 year olds have got it in their bones
Above these 20 blocks no one's alone

And the rich boys get their money back when the banks go belly-up!
But if you're downtown when the levees break, well you're shit out of luck.
The penthouse paupers need your help,
So everybody lend a hand.
And maybe they'll get you a real sweet price of Louisiana land.

It's the long way down (Louisiana land) [x4]
Shit out of luck.---Lyrics submitted by Chad.
