All of the astronauts
Champagne in plastic cups
Waiting for the big hero to show
Outside the door he stands
His head in his hands
And his heart in his throat

What can he tell them now
Sorry I let you down
Sorry it wasn't quite true
But don't get hung up on it
Just solider on with it
And good luck with shooting the moon

Shooting the moon
Shooting the moon, the moon
Shooting the moon

All of the principals
Generals, admirals
And the podium lit with the spotlight
The crowd buzzes quietly
Waiting expectantly
Like it's opening night

What can he tell them now
Sorry I let you down
Sorry it wasn't quite true
But don't get hung up on it
Just solider on with it
And good luck with shooting the moon

Shooting the moon
Shooting the moon, the moon
Shooting the moon ---Lyrics submitted by Torqiu.
