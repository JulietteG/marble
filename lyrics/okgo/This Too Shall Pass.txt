You know you can't keep letting it get you down
And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around
Is it really all that much to lug around
Better run like hell when you hit the ground

When the morning comes
When the morning comes

Can't stop those kids from dancing but why would you want to
Especially when you are already getting good?
'Cause when your mind don't move then your knees don't bend
But don't go blaming the kids again

When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes

When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes

Let it go, this too shall pass
Let it go, this too shall pass

(Let it go, this too shall pass)
You know you can't keep letting it get you down
No, you can't keep letting it get you down

(Let it go, this too shall pass)
Oh, is it really all that much to lug around
And you can't keep letting it get you down

When the morning comes
Oh, you can't keep letting it get you down
No, you can't keep letting it get you down
(When the morning comes)

Oh, you can't keep letting it get you down
No, you can't keep letting it get you down
(When the morning comes)

Oh, you can't keep letting it get you down
No, you can't keep letting it get you down
(When the morning comes)

Oh, you can't keep letting it get you down
No, you can't keep letting it get you down
(When the morning comes)---Lyrics submitted by judy.
