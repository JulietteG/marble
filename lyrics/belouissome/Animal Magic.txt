Girl hurt she's afraid of the dark,
Afraid of being used afraid of going back again.
A girl know's she's so lost.
The boy she use to love is screaming for her love again.

You're not so wild you can't be tamed
you're not so free that you can't be framed

(Chorus)

I could use this magic too
I could see your mystery through

It's animal, it's passion, it's magic
It's animal, animal magic

The things you do to me
The way you make me feel
It's animal, animal....

Girl smiles and hesitates
Her hand is steady but her heart can't wait
It's not the sorrow it's not the pain
There's a hundred different reasons that she can't explain

You're not so wild you can't be tamed
you're not so free that you can't be framed

(Chorus)


Fade: 

.. its passion, its tragic, its animal, animal magic.. the things you do to me, the way you make feel,

the things you make me say, 

the things you made you do, the way you made me feel, the things you made me say.. its animal ohhh yeah!!---Lyrics submitted by vic tuazon.
