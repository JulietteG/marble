You must be a special lady
(Billy, you sing the first verse)
[Come on, Herb, sing, sing it, man]
And a very exciting girl
(Al, bring that bass out, man)
[Hey man, I'll bring it out a little bit more)
You gotta be a special lady
(Let's get down once more, come on)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world

Somehow I knew it would be you
To change my gray skies to blue
And it was strange when you called my name
Ever since that day I haven't been the same, ooh

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a suddenly you slipped up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind

A sweet special lady
And a very exciting girl (ooh, so exciting)
You gotta be a special lady (what a lady)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world

I was like a song so out of key
Then you came and gave my soul a melody
Thanks to you, for pullin' me through
I've always lost but now I win with you

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a suddenly you slipped up from behind
Pop (pop) went the reason in my mind

(You must be a special lady) you're a lady
(And a very exciting girl) so exciting, woo
(You gotta be a special lady) you're a lady
('Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world)
Oh, sittin' on top of the world
You're a lady
(Sittin' on top of the world)
(Sittin' on top of the world)

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a suddenly you slipped up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind---Lyrics submitted by Michael Spence.
