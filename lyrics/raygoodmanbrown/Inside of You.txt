Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh..
Ooh...ooh...ooh...

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

You and I are as close as two is to three
And we're growing closer together
Top40db: The most accurate lyrics site on the net.
We found that magic seed, better than love
And it will grow forever and ever

Every day love grows (Every day love grows)
Deeper and deeper
I just want to get inside of you
Oh...I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

Our love is like a house on a firm foundation
That's standing on solid ground
We build a wall of trust and love all around us
And no one can tear it down

Every day love grows (Every day love grows)
Deeper and deeper
I just want to get inside of you
Oh...I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
Ah...ah...ah...

Every day love grows (Every day love grows)
Deeper and deeper
I just want to get inside of you
Oh...I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just (Seems like I just)
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much (Ah...)

Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you (To you)
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much (Ooh...)
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much (Ah...)

It seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much ---Lyrics submitted by Michael Spence.
