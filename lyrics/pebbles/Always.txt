Cherelle?
Yes, Pebbs
Have you ever loved someone so much 
That you feel it deep down in your soul?
Girl, I truly have
Well, this is how I feel about the one I love
Let's sing it together

Always. boy, I never knew a love like you before
You came into my life and gave me more
You are my friend, also my man
And I'll love you always

You, you just dont know what you've done for me
You gave me love and now I'm complete
You are the sun, the only one
And I'll love ya always

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert me
I promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't leave me 
Don't ever desert me
I promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

I, wish I had know that you'd come for me
I was a soul that was lost and imcomplete
You are my friend, and now you're my man
And I want you always

Baby, don't ever leave me
Don't ever desert me
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert you
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

My friend, you're my man
I do, I do, I do
I do love you

You, you should know now that I'll never leave you
Well, I've searched the land and now I've found you
You are my man
My only man
And I'll love you always
Always

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert me
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

Baby, dont leave me
Don't ever desert me 
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert you 
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll promise my life to you

Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert me
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't ever leave
Don't ever leave me, please
I promise unselfishly
To love you always

Baby, don't you ever go
Don't ever leave me, no
All the things that we've been though
Still love you always

Baby, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go
Never leave you, no
You must stay always
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't ever leave
Don't ever leave me, please
I promise unselfishly
To love you always

Baby, don't ever go
Don't ever leave me, no
All the things that we've been though
Still I love you

Baby, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go
Never leave you, no---Lyrics submitted by alicia.
