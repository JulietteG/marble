Its in the eyes of the children
As they leave for the very first time
And its in the heart of the soldier
As he takes a bullet on the front line
Its in the face of a mother
As she takes the force of a blow
And its in the hands of the father yeah
As he works his fingers to the bone yeah

Im standing under a white flag oh
Can you see me oh, can you see me oh
Im standing for everything we have oh
Can you hear me oh, can you hear me

This is why we do it this is worth the pain
This is why we bow down and get back up again
This is where the heart lies, this is from above
Love is this, this is love

Love is why we do it love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down, get back up again
Love is where the heart lies love is from above
Love is this, this is love

This is love (x3)

Its in the soul of a city
What it does after it crumbles and burns
And its in the blood of a hero
To know where he goes he may never return yeah

Im standing under a white flag oh
Can you see me oh, can you see me oooh
Im standing for everything we have oh
Can you hear me oh, can you hear me

This is why we do it this is worth the pain
This is why we bow down, get back up again
This is where the heart lies this is from above
Love is this, this is love
Love is why we do it love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down, get back up again
Love is where the heart lies love is from above
Love is this, this is love

This is love, this is love ..

Bridge (rap)
If you could be anywhere that you wanted to be
With anyone that you wanted to be with
Do anything that you wanted to do
What would it be and who would it be with you
Time flies but youre the pilot
It moves real fast but youre the driver
You may crash and burn sometimes

This is why we do it this is worth the pain
This is where we bow down get back up again
This is where the heart lies this is from above
Love is this, this is love
Love is why we do it, love is worth the pain
Love is why we fall down get back up again
Love is where the heart lies love is from above
Love is this, this is love
