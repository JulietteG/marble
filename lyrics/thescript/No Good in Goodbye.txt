All the things that we've lost
Breaking off comes at a cost
And know I miss this mistake
Every word I try to choose
Either way I'm gonna lose
Can't take the ache from our break
Oh but as you walk away
You don't hear me say

Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the "nice" in nice try?
Where's the answer and trust gone?
Where's the soul in "soldier on"?
I'm alone and lonely
Cause I don't own the only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak
Can't take the ache from heartbreak

No matter how it falls apart
There's a "not" in breaking hearts
But there's no fair if you will, no
When I see you in the street
Afraid to God
You don't see the silent hail and I wish you well

Oh but as you walk away
You don't hear me say

Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the "nice" in nice try?
Where's the answer and trust gone?
Where's the soul in "soldier on"?
I'm alone and lonely
Cause I don't own the only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
I can't take the ache from heartbreak

If I could turn back time then I would re-write those lines
If I could turn back time then I would re-write those lines
If I could turn back time then I would re-write those lines
If I could turn back time then I would re-write those lines

Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the "nice" in nice try?
Where's the answer and trust gone?
Where's the soul in "soldier on"?
I'm alone and lonely
Cause I don't own the only
I can take this mistake
But I can't take the ache from heartbreak
I can't take the ache from heartbreak---
