My head, my head is full of things I should've done
My heart, my heart is heavy, here it sinks like a stone
She said, is this the life you've been dreaming of
Spinning half through the way from the things you love
It's not too late, to do something new
She said, it's not enough trying to live your life
But not following your dreams makes you dead inside
If you don't love what you do

It's not right, it's not right for you
If you even have to think about it
It's not right, it's not right for you
If you really have to think about it
You got one life, got much to do

My hands, my hands are scarred by things I should've done
My feet, my feet are weary from all the miles that I've run
She said, open your mind take a look within
Are you happy with the world that you're living in
If not, you gotta change what you do
She said, and lately I don't see you smiling love
Are you happy here with me and the things we've got
If you can't say that it's true

It's not right, it's not right for you
If you even have to think about it
It's not right, it's not right for you
If you really have to think about it
You got one life, got much to do

If we don't do something now then
We'll never know
If we stay here too long then we'll, we'll never grown old
So before it's too late and it's killing you yeah
We've only one life to live
So love what you do

It's not right, it's not right for you
If you even have to think about it
It's not right, it's not right for you
If you really have to think about it
You got one life, got much to do---
