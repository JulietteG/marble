And I know youre missing home
Its been so long since youve left
And that life you had in Dublin
Now aint nothin but a dream

To be right there in that moment
Youd give anything to be
Its alright
Cause tonight
Were gonna paint the town green

And your friends are on the phone there
Were so close to Paddys Day
And it kills you not to be there
But life got in the way
If I had to break the pig
Spend every penny on your dreams
Its alright
Cause tonight
Were gonna paint the town green

Just like home
Lets color the streets like our own
Lets make this place feel like our own
Its just you and me
Its alright
Cause tonight
Were gonna paint the town green

And we travel on the subway
Like a wise man knew his life
Shes a heart set to the river
Where we kissed for the first time
Shes a way into Dublin
Yea wherever we may be
Its alright
Cause tonight
Were gonna paint the town green

Just like home
Lets color the streets like our own
Lets make this place feel like our own
Its just you and me, so right
Tonight Im gonna paint the town green

Just like home
Lets color the streets like our own
Lets make this place feel like our own
Its just you and me, so right
Tonight Im gonna paint the town green---
