Late to bed
We're early to rise
Wipe the sleep from our eyes
We head to work, we catch a lift
We have a smoke and
We start the shift

We open up
We start to wake
Maybe it's gonna be our day
And suddenly, we start to smile
The sun is up for a while, and

You may see this place and find no worth
But it's our little piece of Heaven here on Earth

Yeah we always have a good time
Whether it's hail, rain or it's sunshine

We reach the top
We took the fall
But we laugh through it all
Cause dreaming of them better days
Has always been our way, and

You may see this place and find no worth
But know I'm never gonna change them for the world

Yeah we always have a good time
Whether it's hail, rain or it's sunshine
Yeah we're all living the good life
Whether it's hail, rain or it's sunshine

Yeah we always have a good time
Whether it's hail, rain or it's sunshine

Always have a good time
Whether it's hail, rain or it's sunshine---
