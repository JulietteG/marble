When love's a battle and life's a war
When I just can't go on fighting anymore
When I'm surrounded and they're closing in
When I feel the bullets graze against my skin

This world's a war zone, but I've got a shield
I won't surrender, cause your love feels
Like an army of angels, like an army of angels
Like an army of angels, like an army of angels

If hate is poison, then love's the cure
And it's you that drives the demons from my door
When they've got me cornered, close to giving in
Oh I feel you round me like a second skin

This world's a war zone, but I've got a shield
I won't surrender, cause your love feels
Like an army of angels, like an army of angels
Like an army of angels, like an army of angels, angels, angels, angels

To the flames in the fire I will go
Cause I know that I know that I'm not alone
For the flames in the fire I will go
Cause I know yeah I know that I'm not alone

Oh what a beautiful sight, whoa
A hundred thousand soldiers in the sky, whoa
I don't need to worry tonight
With you by my side, yeah

Like an army of angels, like an army of angels
Like an army of angels, like an army of angels, angels, angels, angels

To the flames in the fire I will go (like an army of angels)
Cause I know that I know that I'm not alone (like an army of angels)
For the flames in the fire I will go (like an army of angels)
Cause I know yeah I know that I'm not alone (like an army of angels)---
