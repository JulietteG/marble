Press my hand on your shoulder 
Just to tell you that I am there
As you feel the chill of an icy cold stare
I've been hiding in the shadows 
'cause your next on my list
And when you see my face 
you will cease to exist
The moments coming at you like a runaway train
down the track that terminates in your brain
That's what I'm here for
To help you cross the line
the place where your at
and the end of time

Don't you even look my way 
if you don't wanna see
The face of what you were and are going to be
Then I slip into your house on an evening breeze
and all I leave behind is a sweet melody
I'm the real black angel
I'm the real black angel
I'm the real black angel
I'm the real black angel

Take a close look and tell me
what you see in my eyes
The reflection of crow in a cloudy grey sky
You drop to your knees and begin to cry
all the tears that will fall on the day I fly

sample: (woman's voice)
sample: (man's voice)

In a moment you will know what it's like to be free
In a life of sorrow and a world of mystery
Close your eyes and you might begin to see
that you came here alone but you are leaving with me
I'm the real black angel
I'm the real black angel
I'm the real black angel
I'm the real black angel---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
