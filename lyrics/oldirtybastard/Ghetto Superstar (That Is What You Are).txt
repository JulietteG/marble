[Ol' Dirty Bastard] 
Man man look at the sky 
All the stars man the stars is beautiful tonight 
Look at em 

[Mya] 
Ghetto supastar that is what you are 
Comin from afar reachin for the stars 
Run away with me to another place 
We can rely on each other uh huh 
From one corner to another uh huh 

[Pras Michel] 
Some got hopes and dreams 
We got ways and mean 
The supreme dream team always up with the scheme 
From hub caps to sellin raps, name your theme 
My rise to the top, floatin on this cream 
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt 
A million refugees with unlimited warranties 
Black Ceaser, datin top divas 
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a visa 
I just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one 
Got five sides to me somethin like a pentagon 
Strike with the forces of King Solomon 
Lettin bygone be bygone and so on and so on 
I'ma teach these cats, how to live in the ghetto 
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go 
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo 
P-p-p-politic with ghetto senators on the d-low 

[Mya] 
Ghetto supastar, that is what you are 
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars 
Run away with me, to another place 
We can rely on each other, uh huh 
From one corner to another, uh huh 

[Ol' Dirty Bastard] 
My eyes is sore, bein the senator 
Behind closed doors hittin truths to the seafloor 
The rich don't know, ignore, this tug of war 
While the kids are poor open new and better drug stores 
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more 
I'ma reveal everythin change the law 
I find myself, walkin the streets 
Tryin to find what's really goin on in these streets 

[Pras Michel] 
Now every dog got his day, needless to say 
When the chief away, that's when them cats wanna play 
I told you, messin around you fools like Cassius Clay 
Stretch my heater make you do a pass de bourree 
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet 
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway 
Get applaud like a madator, cry yellin ole 
Who the hell wanna see me, from B.K. to Cali 

[Mya] 
Ghetto supastar, that is what you are 
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars 
Run away with me, to another place 
We can rely on each other, uh huh 
From one corner to another, uh huh 

[Pras Michel] 
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place 
Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race 
Two face, gettin defaced out, like Scarface 
Throw your roll money let me put on my screw face 

[Ol' Dirty Bastard] 
And I'm paranoid at the things I said 
Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day 
I'm hangin out, partying with girls that never die 
See I was pickin on the small fries, my campaign tellin lies 
I was just spreadin my love, didn't know my love 
Was the one holdin the gun and the glove 
But it's all good as long as it's understood 
Let's all together now, in the hood 

[Mya] 
Ghetto supastar, that is what you are 
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars 
Run away with me, to another place 
We can rely on each other, uh huh 
From one corner to another, uh huh 

[Pras Michel] 
All stars 

[Mya] 
Ghetto supastar, that is what you are 
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars 
Run away with me, to another place 
We can rely on each other, uh huh 
From one corner to another, uh huh---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
