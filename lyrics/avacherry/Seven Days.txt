It's been seven days
Since you've been gone
Seven days 
Took too long
It's been seven days and lonely nights
Won't you please come home
Won't you please come home
Seven nights
And its been so long
Seven nights
Felt so wrong
It's been seven days and lonely nights
Yes it has
Won't you please come home
Won't you please come home
I'm feeling lost
Every time you are gone
And baby it's a toss 
Whether I'll survive that loss
And then the pain makes me want to stop
Oh yes it does
Won't you please come home
Won't you please come home
I'm feeling lost
Every time you are gone
And baby it's a toss
Whether I'll survive that loss
And then the pain makes me want to stop
Won't you please come home
Won't you please come home---Lyrics submitted by Kari Anne.
