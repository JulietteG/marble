Well Im.Gettin ready, my friends are comin over.

Everybody, weve got some time to play. The sun is shining, weve got no where to go.

I think were gonna have some fun today. I think were gonna have some fun today.

We couldsing a new song on my guitar. Were in outer space, I see a shooting star.

Playin football in the front yard.

I think were gonna have some fun today. I think were gonna have some fun today.

We could build our own lemonade stand. Or maybe play a game of kick the can.

Catch me if you can.

Watch a movie, make some popcorn. Build a treehouse cause we dont have one.

Catchin fireflies as the sun goes down.

I think were gonna have some fun today. I think were gonna have some fun today.

Gettin ready, my friends are comin over. Everybody, were gonna play all day.

The sun is shining, weve got no where to go.

All the people in the neighborhood are havin fun just like they should.
All the people in the neighborhood are havin fun just like they should.
All the people in the neighborhood are havin fun just like they should.

All the people in the neighborhood are havin fun today.

Gettin ready, my friends are comin over.

All the people in the neighborhood are havin fun today.

The sun is shining, weve got no where to go.

All the people in the neighborhood are havin fun today.

I think were gonna have some fun today. I think were gonna have some fun today.---Lyrics submitted by Matt MacAdams.
