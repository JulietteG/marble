Keep your head there on my shoulder.
Let's just lay here for awhile.
We can hurry when were older.
Girl don't worry about tomorrow.
That just seems so far away.
Luckily me and you, all that we have to do is follow,
Just follow.

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been,
Oh and baby then,
You can let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end.
I wanna be that man, if you let me.
Come on baby let me.
Baby leave those candles burning,
Slide on over here to me.
If you run with me girl, you know we'll make this world stop turning,
Just stop turning.

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been,
Oh and baby then,
You can let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end.
I'd like to be that man, if you'd let me.
Ohhhhhh, ohhhhh.

Let me be the one who sets your feet up on a road where you've never been.

Yeah! Let me take these arms and wrap you up inside a night that will never end.
I wanna be that man, if you let me.
Sweet baby let me.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
