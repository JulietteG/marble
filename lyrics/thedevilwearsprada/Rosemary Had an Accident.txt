You were nothing but an obstacle in my pathway. 
tripping me with my own trust without your hood of falsification. 
your beauty is found to be nothing. 
nothing but true revulsion. 
and that's the only true thing about you. 
this melody of my heart points to the composer of my regret. 
look north, the sun is still gleaming. 
and the moon and the stars still retain these eyes. 
you're falling now as I move forward. 
fueled by the hope you couldn't take from me. 
and scarred by knowedge of painful winters. 
Christ still stands perfect in my mind. 
Christ still stands perfect in my heart. 
Jesus is the beautiful structure of love. 
repent me. 
to hope and love. 
beware nihilists. 
you shall fall by the sword. 
[oh God] 
bringeth the day of judgement
