These writings are to those who have wept
These writings are to those who havent
Looked deeply enough into the correct resolution
Wrong again but stronger now, we can face this
Fight life with life
All glory to the one in existence
Bring upon your name, your grace, your everything
Hold hands and stare into the circle what are we looking at?
Rumors and rumors and rumors
Assembly: Disintegration
Perish
Tombstones serve as mirrors and the graves are infinite
Take a look through the lens and through your eyes
End the partitioning
Wrong again but stronger now, we can face this
Fight life with life
Enemies, well go for your throat---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
