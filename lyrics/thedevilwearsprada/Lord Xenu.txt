Gravity, 
Teach me the ways of retaliation.
I'd like every backbiter to know that audience is always priority, rather than the stage
It all comes down to this.
Look elsewhere for books of narcissism.
Pride is a trend that is far past swollen.
Death through windows.
No longer can i live a life of no control.
These stories we've been writing are water-thin.
It's disheartening because i know that we are capable of vision.
Blemishes are warnings so simply concentrateand apply pressure.
And its branches will be broken.
The city to be punished.
So many never listen 
and i drown in disgust.
when you will you ever remember?
When will you realize (that) false statements fall to the feet of dead gods?
False statements fall to the feet of dead gods.---Lyrics submitted by makenna.
