Oh, and yet I've been cleansed.

And yet I've been cleansed with the water. 
 A purity no mind can grasp. 
 A purity so cool upon my fingertips.

  The vision that I have seen.  
  This is the action that spawns from the end. 
  Fot the longest time I've been watching the world breathe against.

  What lies here.  
  What lies here.
  Are mountains.
  Composed of.

Tombstones!!
Tombstones!!
Tombstones!!
Tombstones!!

Examine these. 
These beautiful faces.
Keep singing now.

Keep singing now! Examine these beautiful faces.
Keep singing now! Examine these beautiful faces.

Will we cause,
Bedlam noise,
To a state of,
Blissfullness?!?
Display her,
Beauty to the people!
To the people!!

OH!!
A PURITY!!
A PURITY NO MIND CAN CRASP!!---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
