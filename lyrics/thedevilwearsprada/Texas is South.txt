Goooooooood eeevvveeeenniiinnngg(x2)

(Singer)I'm looking to put a bullet into the tile floor.It's do or 
die I'm looking to put a bullet into the tile floor. It's obvious.
(AT THE SAME TIME)
(Screamer)All I ever do is wish things were different. 
This envy is destroying me, and it is obvious. (x2)
Its obvious(x8)

Mark this.(x3) 

I want to say something: 
We were blessed, but now I wet my lips and wait for them to dry. 
The lust of the dress. 
The thought of her lips. 

The lust of the dress. 
The thought of her lips. 
Reverent smile. 
These letters I've wrote are shackled to my chest.
shackled to my, shackled to my chest, shackled to, my chest. shackled to my, shackled to my chest, shackled to my death
Her tantalization. 
She is misconception. 
Good evening,good evening, good evening, miss (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
