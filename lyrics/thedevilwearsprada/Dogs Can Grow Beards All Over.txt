Welcome to the war,
welcome to the war,
a martyr's challenge.

Chainsaw brutality, tornado strength,
Chainsaw brutality, tornado strength,
Chainsaw brutality, tornado strength,
Chainsaw brutality, tornado strength.

King of the diamond; King of the grave,
King of the diamond, King of the grave.

Lawlessness stains black on whitewashed tombs.
We're to strong to compromise.
Don't be ashamed of your faith.

Dear Lord - deliver me from hypocrisy and surcease.
The scarlet desire,
The scarlet desire.

He wears a slick jacket and gold watch.
Her dishonesty has scarred hands.
Has scarred hands.
He wears a slick jacket...
Yeah, a slick jacket.---Lyrics submitted by Haley.
