I would like to burn this down.
i would like to see this melt into yellow and observe a cloud of blackness rise.
watch it rise as it is wrath himself.
watch it rise.
Crows will flee the scene as if to remind me how long its been since i have seen a dove.
Melt in yellow as i do.
Exhaustion and tribulation wound by wound.
I torture myself.
wound by wound, I Torture myself.
Whiteness, present yourself, as i know you are the sky and anchor of my being,
What we've known turns into paper.
What we've is like cigarettes.
formaldehyde fingers---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
