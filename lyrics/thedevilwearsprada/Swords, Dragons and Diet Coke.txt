Be gone with you, you articles of nothingness.
I don't know what i have to do to prove myself.
This audience is stern.
Grey is what has risen from the pits.
Choose a new medicine to control it.

You thought you had me fooled the grey
Is what has risen from the pits.
You thought you had me fooled the grey
Is what has risen from the pits.
my lady, let us waltz.
we can ignore the firearms.
guns manufactured by fear.

I will never be forgotten.
I will never forget you.
And I will never forget you.
I will never forget you.
I will never forget you. 

With dead tongues and lonely hearts, we cough the poison out.
And yet i sing a song of hope.
With dead tongues and lonely hearts, we cough the poison out.
And yet i sing a song of hope.
Your final days approach.
This will be our final confrontation.
This will be our last.
This will be our last.---Lyrics submitted by Olivia.
