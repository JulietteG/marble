Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you be?
When you forever sleep?
When you leave me?
If we could just stay here
Lose track of time
I would be just fine
In a galactic sea

Across the universe I am floating, apart from the ordinary
Do my friends miss me? Do they recall my name?
As I'm one with the supernova!
Light curves the sky, light curves the sky
No prediction, no anticipation
Light curves the sky

Where will you go?
Where will you be?
When you forever sleep?
When you leave me?
If we could just stay here
Lose track of time
I would be just fine
In a galactic sea

I'll never understand
I can't wrap my head around it
An explosion, disintegration
Radiates so beautifully

Where will you go?
Where will you be?
When you forever sleep?
When you leave me?
If we could just stay here
Lose track of time
I would be just fine
In a galactic sea

A stars core collapses
A black hole might formulate
So much energy, I feel you burning up
I feel you burning up
I feel you burning

Where will you go?
Where will you be?
When you forever sleep?
When you leave me?
If we could just stay here
Lose track of time
I would be just fine
In a galactic sea
Where will you go?
Where will you be?
When you forever sleep?
When you leave me?
If we could just stay here
Lose track of time
I would be just fine
In a galactic sea---
