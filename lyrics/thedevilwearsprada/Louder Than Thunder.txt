What would it take for things to be quiet
quiet like the snow
and I know this isn't much, 
but I know I could, I could be better
I dont think I deserve it, selflessness 
find your way into my heart 
all stars could be brighter, all hearts could be warmer
what would it take for things to be quiet 
quiet like the snow
are we ment to be empty handed 
I know I could I could be better
I dont think I deserve it selflessness
find your way into my heart
all stars could be brighter all hearts could be warmer 

What would it take for things to be quiet x2
(find your way into my heart)

What would it take for things to get quiet---Lyrics submitted by Caleb.
