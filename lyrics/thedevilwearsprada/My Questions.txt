Something has got to give!

When did I start choking?
When did I start drowning?
Is this what's to become?
All thoughts left to wait.

Is this what's to become?
Is this?

My questions (my questions)
Unanswered (unanswered)
I wish, this would break,
I wish this would break.

What am i doing here?
These waters extend for miles!
My heart remains the same!
Will I ever, ever stop choking?
Will I ever, ever stop drowning?
Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot!
I should not have put that on you!
Leave my body at the river,
Let me pass along!

Is this what's to become?

I breath in your shadows and sleep in your disinterest. (x2)
Let the tears fall,
Let me write some sad songs,
That you don't deserve!
That you don't deserve!
Let the tears fall!
Will I ever, ever stop choking?
Will I ever, ever stop drowning?---Lyrics submitted by Deccota Overley.
