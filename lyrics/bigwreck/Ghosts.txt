So faint the walls behind me now
I know where they stand
I know the way home
Outrun the storm above our heads
Every other day 
I know the way home

And if the stars all align
And my hands were untied
If these ghosts let me go
I would set fire to them all

Beware the dust gets in your eyes
Can't see through the lines
I know the way home
'Cause the horizon greets another day
A shame we couldn't stay
I know my way home

And if the stars all align
And my hands were untied
If these ghosts let me go
I would set fire to them all

And if my scars were tattoos
I could hide them in plain view
If these ghosts let me go
I would set fire to them all

And if the stars all align
And my hands were untied
If these ghosts let me go
I would set fire to them all---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
