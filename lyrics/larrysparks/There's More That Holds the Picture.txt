Theres 60 years of marriage in that picture
Theres grandpa with his darling by his side
He is standing proud and his smile is shining
Grandpa & Grandma must be there with pride

Theres lots of things you dont see in that picture
The lines on Grandmas face dont show the pain
The little Tombstone out behind the cabin
Theres more that holds that picture in that frame.

Chorus:
See that bible on the bedside table
See that homemade quilt there on the bed
See those callous hand around my Grandma
They always worked to keep his family fed

Look close and you will see that old wax candle
At times I almost feel the warming flame
And listen you can almost hear them praying
Theres more that holds that picture in that frame.
Chorus
