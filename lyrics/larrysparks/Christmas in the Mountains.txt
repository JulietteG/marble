The fountains and the meadows are covered up with snow.
Home fires are burning bright, the winds of winter blow.
Christmas bells are ringin', the lights are on the tree.
It's Christmas in the mountains, that's where I want to be.

chorus
Oh see the Christmas colors, there's silver and there's gold.
See the light glisten upon the fallen snow.
The family's all together, singin' 'round the tree
It's Christmas in the mountains, this is the place to be.

A candle lights the window, there's wood upon the fire.
The clock is striking midnight, this is the Christmas hour.
The children are a sleepin, the gifts are 'neith the tree.
It's Christmas in the mountains, That's where I want to be.
