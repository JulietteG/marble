EVERYBODY - ANTHONY HAMILTON

WE HAVE SEEN SOME THINGS IN OUR LIVES 
WE'VE HAD SOME LONG AND SORROWED ROADS
THAT'S HOW I KNOW IT'S ALRIGHT TO CRY 

GO ON AND EASE THE HEAVY LOAD 
PRAY HARD, WALK TALL, DO RIGHT 
FIND LOVE, HOLD ON, FOR LIFE 

LORD I KNOW THAT YOU ARE THERE 
AN I FEEL A BURNING IN MY BONES 
FREE US FROM THE LION'S DEN 
AND TAKE US HOME 

EVERYBODY NEEDS LOVE IN THEIR LIFE 
EVERYBODY NEEDS A LITTLE SUN TO SHINE 
GO'N LET LOVE COME INSIDE YOUR LIFE 
SHINE DOWN ON ME, ON ME 

THE SHEPARD AND HIS ANGELS GUARD OUR LIVES
GO ON JOY COMES EARLY MORN
THE WAYS OF MAN WILL SURE SUBSIDE
CANT WALK AWAY CAUSE HEAR COMES LOVE
SMILING, FAITHFUL, ALRIGHT 
FIND LOVE HOLD ON FOR LIFE 

LORD I KNOW THAT YOU ARE THERE
I FEEL A BURNING IN MY BONES
FREE US FROM THE LIONS DEN
AND TAKE US HOME
EVERYBODY NEEDS LOVE IN THEIR LIFE,
EVERYBODY NEEDS A LITTLE SUN TO SHINE
GO'N AND LET LOVE COME INSIDE YOUR LIVE
SHINE DOWN ON ME, ON ME.

LORD RAIN DOWN ON ME 
AND LET YOUR JOY EASE MY PAIN 
TAKE ME FROM THIS LION'S DEN 
AND MAKE ME SMILE AGAIN YEH
EVERBODY NEEDS LOVE IN THIER LIFE
EVERYBODY NEEDS A LITTLE SUN TO SHINE
GO'N LET LOVE COME INSIDE YOUR LIFE
SHINE DOWN ON ME, ON ME

EVERBODY NEEDS LOVE IN THIER LIFE
EVERYBODY NEEDS A LITTLE SUN TO SHINE
GO'N LET LOVE COME INSIDE YOUR LIFE
SHINE DOWN ON ME, ON ME---Lyrics submitted by lataish.
