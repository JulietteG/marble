It's simple, I love it, having you near me, having you here  
Our conversations, outrageous,  
You smile, and I smile then I say  
Oooh, this getting personal, personal, personal  
Let's stay for a while and play  
Girl let's make this a moment (ooohhhhh!)  

Giving you the best of me, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, oh!  
Having you close to me, amazing, outrageous  
Give your best to me  

Good morning, here's breakfast  
Lost track of time but, we had a ball  
Let's catch a movie, then dinner  
Tonight's the night we'll  
Just unwind, and stay, hey  
Let's stay personal, personal, personal  
Let's stay for a while and play  
Such a beautiful moment  

Giving you the best of me, amazing, amazing,  
Having you close to me, amazing, outrageous  
Give your best to me  
Giving you the best of me, amazing, amazing,  
Having you close to me, amazing, outrageous  
Give your best to me---
