Bells will be ringing, the sad sad news
Oh what a Christmas, to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
o wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing, Oh Silent Night
Christmas carols, by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Years Night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes this is Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love

So won't you tell me, you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Years, will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again

There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy, once again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
