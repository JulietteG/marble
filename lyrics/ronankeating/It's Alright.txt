I get up, go to work, put a smile on my face
Don't know if the world's gonna deal me an ace
But it's alright if you're with me
I look up to the sky, see the rain up ahead
Didn't bring my umbrella so I'm bound to get wet
But it's alright if you're with me

[Chorus]
It's alright when I know that you're with me
It's alright when I know that you're close
I can't handle the world trying to ruin my mood
'Cause it ain't gonna work

Back up, take a train all the way out of town
Can't breathe when there's so many people around
But it's alright, you're with me
Stroll up to the door and get into the car
Turn my hand on the key but it ain't gonna start
But it's alright if you're with me

[Chorus]
It's alright when I know that you're with me
It's alright when I know that you're close
I can't handle the world trying to ruin my mood
'Cause it ain't gonna work

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
It's alright when I know that you're with me
It's alright when I know that you're close
I can't handle the world trying to ruin my mood
'Cause it ain't gonna work

[Chorus]
It's alright when I know that you're with me
It's alright when I know that you're close
I can't handle the world trying to ruin my mood
'Cause it ain't gonna work
