I've been heading in a wrong direction
Hiding from my own protection
Running but my heart was standing still

I guess you say the light inside me
You're love has been a torch to guide me
I hope I can be all that you deserve

Well I'm no superman
But I'll love you the best I can
And you know, I'm just flesh and bone
But with you I feel I'm flying
Don't you know, I'm no superman
But I'll always be your man

I was searching for a heart that's beating
As fast as the way I'm feeling
Trying to find some peace there in my soul

You know it was your love that saved me
The answer to my prayer you gave me
And I hope I'll be all that you deserve

I'm no superman
But I'll love you the best I can
And you know, I'm just flesh and bone
But with you I feel I'm flying, flying
Don't you know, I'm no superman
But I'll always be your man

I'd fight for you, I'd die for you
You know I would, yeah
Hod back the night, light up the sky
O if I could

I'm no superman
But I'll love you the best I can
And you know, I'm just flesh and bone
But with you I feel I'm flying, flying
Don't you know, I'm no superman
But I'll always be your man

I'll always be your man
I'll always be your man---Lyrics submitted by Marco.
