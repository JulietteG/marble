Come on, yeah
Uh come on, yeah
We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a blast
Yes baby, I need you here

Girl I'm on a mission
To cure my condition
Cos without your kissin'
My heart's just a prison
So I'm hopin' and wishin'
That girl I'm forgiven
Say yeah

Cos' every time you leave me I'm sad
The moment you're returning I'm glad
So let's not go forgetting what we have
Cause it's bad
So damn bad, yeah

We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby, I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a laugh
Please baby I need you here

If I hurt your feelings
Then baby we're even
Cos I've been bereavin'
Since you said you're leavin'
But now you're by my side...
Let's not fight
Cos you're right

That every time I lose you, I'm lost
No more you versus me girl, there's just us
Cos anything without you's just a bust
Baby trust
You're a must

We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby, I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a laugh
Please baby, I need you here

So don't go throwing our love away
It's here to stay
I'm telling you
There's nothing that can stop us anyway
Our love is an ocean
Let's get it in motion

We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby, I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a laugh
Please baby, I want you right here next to me
I need you here
I need you here
I need you here---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
