And who's to say we're an one house town
And who's to say yeah we can't get down
And who's to say that the best day has past
We're coming back, yeah we're coming fast

Shakin' it up like we used to, 
We're headin' to town were the whole crew
We're kissing all night, yes I mean you
See I, I wanna do it every night

You make me feel like, you make me feel like
I'm nineteen again and I'm out with my friends
You make me feel like, you make me feel like
We're dancing in bed and the night never ends

So who's to say that you're over the hills?
It's when a fire just start in the fields
Who and the gang we're an all night show
It's fun to game when you just let go

We're shakin' it up like we used to, 
I'm falling in love again it gets good 
We're out on the floor we're going whowho
See I, I wanna do this every night

You make me feel like, you make me feel like
I'm nineteen again and I'm out with my friends
You make me feel like, you make me feel like
We're dancing in bed and the night never ends

Don't start now baby, this DJ's crazy
You look amazing, we're flying in, we're flying in
No questions baby, it makes me crazy
Yeah, I wanna do it every night

You make me feel like, you make me feel like
I'm nineteen again and I'm out with my friends
You make me feel like, you make me feel like
We're dancing in bed and the night never ends

You make me feel like, you make me feel like
I'm nineteen again and I'm out with my friends
You make me feel like, you make me feel like
We're dancing in bed and the night never ends

Don't start now, baby, 
this DJ's crazy, 
don't start now baby---Lyrics submitted by Juliane Sofie Norheim.
