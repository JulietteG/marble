Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

(Hey, baby)
You've really got my tail in a spin
(Hey, baby)
I don't even know where to begin

But, baby, I got
One thing I want you to know
Wherever you go tell me
'Cause I'm gonna go

We found love so don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster just gotta ride it
I need you so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery girl, let's get inside it

(Hey, baby)
You've really got me flying tonight
(Flying tonight)
(Hey, sugar)
You almost got us punched in a fight
(That's all right)

But, baby you know
The one thing I gotta know
(Know, know)
Wherever you go tell me
'Cause I'm gonna show

We found love so don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster just gotta ride it
I need you so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery girl, let's get inside it

Listen
Can't you feel my heart
  (Feel my heart)
Can't you feel my heart
  (Feel my heart)
Can't you take my heart

We found love, oh, so don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster just gotta ride it
(All night long)
I need you so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery girl, let's get inside it

Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na na na na na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na na na na na)

Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na na na na na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na na na na na)

(Na na na na na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na na na na na)

(Na na na na na)
Love is a mystery girl let's get inside it
