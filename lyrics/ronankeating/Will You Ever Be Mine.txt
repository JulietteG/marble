Will you ever be mine
Will you ever be mine

It ain't no secret I adore ya
But did you know I'm living for ya
The only one that ever gets me
No idea how that affects me
But I can't live on fairy tales
'Cause when you're near, inside I will
I'm at the dock and want to sail inside

[Chorus]
(Will you ever be mine) Oh, please
You've got me on my knees
(Will you ever be mine) Oh, please
Don't tease, I'm dying to know
Will you ever be mine, mine, mine
Will you ever be mine, mine

So tell me, baby, do I bore ya
What would it take for me to floor ya
I'd take two decades off my life
If that would make you be my wife
We're just friends but when you're near
The pain inside's too strong to bear
Say the word and I'll be there tonight

[Chorus]
(Will you ever be mine) Oh, please
You've got me on my knees
(Will you ever be mine) Oh, please
Don't tease, I'm dying to know
Will you ever be mine, mine, mine
Will you ever be mine, mine, mine

Oh, I can't seem to get you off my mind, my baby
Go, I'd change my mind, no, whoa
Will you ever be mine
Will you ever be mine

[Chorus]
(Will you ever be mine) Oh, please
You've got me on my knees now
(Will you ever be mine) Oh, please
Don't tease, I'm begging to know
Will you ever be mine, mine, mine
Will you ever be mine, mine, mine

(Will you ever be mine, mine, mine) Oh, please
(Will you ever be mine, mine, mine)
(Will you ever be mine, mine, mine) Oh, please
(Will you ever be mine, mine, mine)
