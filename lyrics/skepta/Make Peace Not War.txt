Its cold outside
Its burning up in the club
I know youre feeling the heat
I know you feel the rush

Everybody dance now!

Ugh
Black snap back, black beanie
and my chain so bright, they can see
I do it how they see me do it on the TV
But youre just saying, looking the same on 3D
Youre living a lie, Im living a dream
Table full of champagnes, chillin with the queen
Razor sharp blade, Im a guillotine
Soon as I get ahead, Im bringin the team
BBK, Im bringing the team
Hundred percent UK, were killing the scene
Now they hooked on the sound like its nicotine
Got their arms stretch out like a limousine
I got my shades on, tell em I still see em
Tell em my haters, I wouldnt want to beat em
My teams strong like the bricks in the colliseum

Everybody dance now

Yeah
So lets make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more
(DJ replay give me more)

So lets make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Its cold outside
Its burning up in the club
I know youre feeling the heat
I know you feel the rush

Everybody dance now

Huh
Bad karaoke and good melodies
Bad hangovers and good memories
But right now Ima do it how I say I do it
Ima jump that hurdle when I get to it
Im looking at her looking at me
Im the gingerbread man, come and catch me
Talk of the town, you could be my TT
A housemate in my celebrity BB
Youre looking like a star, wheres your manager?
10 out of 10 from the front now back it up
These other guys just ain't just got the stamina
Me, I rock and roll like Noel Gallagher
So why they hatin on the king for, huh
So why they hatin on the king for
Im just living my life as I live yours

Everybody dance now

Yeah
So lets make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more
(DJ replay give me more)

So lets make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Its cold outside
Its burning up in the club
I know youre feeling the heat
I know you feel the rush

Everybody dance now ---
