Will you meet me?
-In a field of whispering Dandelions.

You are, you are
The most magical and fragile flower in the garden.
Fragile.
If I whispered I love you you might get scared and fly away.
And Magical?
From the butterflies in my stomach and the way they play

Cant say Ive ever met anyone here before.
Cuz you hold the key to the garden door.
Think I wanna build a house here-
And paint it with our smile 
cuz heaven knows its my favourite colour 
Of all in the emotional dial

Tell me,
Someday can we fly away?
I have a pocket full of places, and noones ever been there

Will you meet me?
-In a field of whispering Dandelions.

You are, you are
The most beautiful flower in the garden.
I think Ive fallen, in a good way.
And as long as the sun shines I think Ill stay.
No
I know Ill stay 
In the field of whispering Dandelions.

Will you meet me?---Lyrics submitted by moby.
