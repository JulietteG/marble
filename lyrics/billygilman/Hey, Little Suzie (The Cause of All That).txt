I remember her
Shakin' off the dust
She could walk the walk
She was one of us
When she went away
I went down that day
Tryin' to cheer her up
Said you won't be missin' much
And all that I remember
When I think of her back then
Is a fast-talkin' fun-lovin' girl we called a friend

Hey little Suzie just got back
She's still wearing her baseball hat
Struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on a count of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
Thinkin' that life just couldn't get better
And when she walked away I noticed
She was lookin' back
I hope I'm the cause of all that

An accidental touch
Never meant so much
Makes me realize that we're not close enough
She used to talk so loud
Now she's whispering
Trying to draw me in
I'm listening
She was always after somethin'
Now I wonder if it's me
Maybe I'm just dreaming
But I call em' as I see em'

Oh hey little Suzie just got back
She's still wearing her baseball hat
Struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on a count of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
Thinkin' that life just couldn't get better
And when she walked away I noticed
She was lookin' back
I hope that I'm the cause of all that

The look that she shares
When she's playin' with her hair
Tells me where she's coming from
That it's going somewhere
(somewhere, somewhere)

Well hey little Suzie just got back
She's still wearing her baseball hat
Struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on a count of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
I swear no uniform ever looked better
When she walked away I noticed
She was lookin' back
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
(the cause of all that)

Hey little Suzie just got back---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
