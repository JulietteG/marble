That's right, pleased to meet you
I still won't tell you my name
Don't you belive in mystery
Don't you want to play my game
i"m lookin for a man to love
Like i never been loved before
I'm lookin for a man that'll do it anywhere
Even on a limousine floor 'cause

Tonight i'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
Do you think i'm a nasty girl
Tonight,I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think I'm a nasaty girl

I guess I'm just use to sailors
I think they got water on the brain
I think they got more water upstairs
Than they got sugar on a candy cane
That's right, it's been a long time
Since I had a man that did it real good
If you ain't scared, take it out
I'll do it like a real live nasty girl should

Tonight I'm livin in a fantasy world
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
Tonight I'm livin' in a fantasy 
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think i'm a nasty girl

Tonight I'm livin in a fantasy 
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think i'm a nasty girl
Tonight, I'm livin' a fantasy 
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think i'm a nasty girl

Please, please
Please, please

Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Do you think I'm a nasty girl

Oh (do you think I'm a nasty girl)
Oh  (nasty girl)
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
Oh
I don't like this groove
Try and give me something I can croon to
Catch my drift

That'll work

That's right,  I can't control it
I need 7 inches more
Tonight, I can no longer hold it
Get it up, get it up, I can't wait anymore

Uh, it's time to jam
Dance nasty girls, dance
Everybody, uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance (Yeah)

Everybody, uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance

(Are you gonna come)
(Are you gonna come)
(Are you gonna come)
(Are you gonna come)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Uh
Is that it
Mmm, wake me up when you're done
I guess I'll be the only one having fun---Lyrics submitted by annemarie.
