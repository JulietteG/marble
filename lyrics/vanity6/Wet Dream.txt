Oooh- look at me...I'm a cadillac...I'm a brand new convertible child.  I've never been driven baby your the first, come on baby drive me wild.  Oooh-  
Oooh- look at me I'm a telephone...whatever you want just dial.  Come on honey please its soft and clean...do it baby drive me wild.
Come on baby do it- Drive me wild. 
Do it baby- Drive me wild. 
(repeat)
Oooh- look at me I'm a radio call me up and make a request.  I'm anything just name it and I'm bad baby and the best. 
Come on baby do it- Drive me wild.
Do it baby- Drive me wild. 
(repeat)
Oooh- look at me I'm a babydoll...just pick me up and I'll smile...I may be young but I'm a whole lot of fun...come on baby drive me wild. 
Come on baby do it- Drive me wild.
Do it baby- Drive me wild. 
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
