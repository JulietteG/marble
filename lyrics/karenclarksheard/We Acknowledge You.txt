(Verse 1)
Holy Spirit You are welcome
Come on in, take a seat, inhabit our praise
God of Zion, Judah's lion
We acknowledge Your presence o Lord

(Verse 2)
God of mercy show Your glory
As we enter this place show us Your face
God of peace, give us peace
We acknowledge Your presence o Lord

(Chorus)
Oh...oh...oh...
We acknowledge Your presence o Lord

(Bridge)
Come on in, take a seat
Come on in, take a seat o Lord

(Key Raise) 
We acknowledge Your presence
We honor Your presence
Inhabit our praise o Lord

(Bridge)
Come on in, take a seat
Come on in, take a seat o Lord

Oh...oh...oh...
 We acknowledge Your presence o Lord---Lyrics submitted by Rob Major.
