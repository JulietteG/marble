There is a sweet anointing in the sanctuary
There is a stillness in the atmosphere
O come lay down your burden you have carried
For in the sanctuary, God is here.

He is here, God is here
To break the yoke and lift your heavy burden
He is here, God is here
To mend the brokenhearted and bless the broken

O come lay down the burdens you have carried, 
For in the sanctuary God is here.

Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord

O come lay down the you have carried,
For in the sanctuary God is here.---Lyrics submitted by Vantresia.
