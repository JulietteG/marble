this world sometime seem cruel and cold
and pain doth pierce my very soul 
but theres a place a secret place  a  place where i can go


a place of peace
where love abide
where justice reigns
and god resides

there is a place
a secret place
a place where i can go

for you shall hide me in your tabernacle
from the rain and storm
an even when my enimies pursue me 
you'll keep me safe from harm

and when my heart  is filled with pain 
no peace it seems i'll find again

i find that place
a secret place
that place where i can go

for you shall hide me in your tabernacle
from the rain and storm
and even when my enimies pursue me
you'll keep me safe from harm

there is safety in your tabernacle
there is protection in your tabernacle
there is security in your tabenernacle
there is sanctuary in your tabernacle

lord take me
to your tabernacle
i want to go i gotta go i must go to your tabernacle

oh lord lord lord lord lord lord lord lord lord

take me to that place
father you riegn

hide me safely in your dwelling place
there is a place  a secret place a place wgher i can go
oh a secret place a dwelling place i want to go iwant to go---Lyrics submitted by crystal hale.
