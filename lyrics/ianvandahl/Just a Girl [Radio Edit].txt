I'm just a girl
Looking for a heartbeat
[in the night...]
Won't stop until I find it,
To know how it feels..
3x
I'm just a girl...

I am ready for love..
I am ready for love!
I am ready for love..
I am ready for love!
I am ready for love..
I am ready for love!
I am ready for love..
I am ready for love!

I'm just a girl
Looking for a heartbeat
[in the night...]
Won't stop until I find it,
To know how it feels..
2x
I'm just a girl...!
I'm just a girl...---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
