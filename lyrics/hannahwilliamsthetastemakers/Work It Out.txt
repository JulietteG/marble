What happens when the curtain falls
And the last note is struck
Who in world do I wake up for
And to who do I make my love

I cried for you with the forest
Beg my soul but nobody heard
I cried a thousands songs for you 're all into one
And now i can't remember a single word

Music stops and the world keeps spinning round
I favour you and I should work it out
Wish we could work it out
Come on baby
Wish we could work it out
Let's work it out
Wish we could work it out
I ditch you darling
Work it out
I think we should work it out

Well it's clear you've lost your love for me
And you lost for another girl's heart
But who's gonna clean your mess or put you to bed
When you've been drinking too much

I'm hoping any moment i wake to find this is all this is all been a dream
You all over in your king size bed
Babe I'm your sleeping I'm your sleeping queen

Music stops and the world keeps spinning round
I favour you and i should work it out
Wish we could work it out
Come on baby
Wish we could work it out
We can work it out
Wish we could work it out
I need you darling
Wish we could work it out
Come on work it out
I wanna scream
Babe I wanna scream---Lyrics submitted by Alrune.
