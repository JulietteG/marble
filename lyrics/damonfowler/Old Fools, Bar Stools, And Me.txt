Through the neon lights I can see
Green and blue bottles that came between you and me
Moonshine moments that won't set me free
Old fools, bar stools, and me

At noon when I wake up the fog hasn't cleared
I stumble through my kitchen as I hold back my tears
Just give me an hour and you shall see 
Old fools, bar stools, and me

I don't read my mail I sure don't answer the phone
I'm not good with people but I can't stand being alone
So you wanna to find me? You know exactly where I will be
With old fools bar stools and me---
