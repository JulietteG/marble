Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same

Let the leaves fall off in the summer 
and let December grow in flames

Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico

These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suits 

(chorus)
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Take a chance 
Let your body get a tolerance

I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants

Pull a breath like a another cigarette 
Pawn shop heart, trading up

I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Let it out, shut your mouth 
Ain't love on the streets but in the alley and it ain't that cheap

I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Said I don't care (I don't care)
Said ah I don't care (I don't care)
Said ah I ah don't ah care
I ah  don't care ( no I don't)
I don't care (I don't care)
I don't care

I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery---Lyrics submitted by Matty.
