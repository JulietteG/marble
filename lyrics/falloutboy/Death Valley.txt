I wanna see your animal side
Let it all out
I wanna see the dirt
Under your skin
I need your broken promises

I want the guts and glory baby
This town is wasted and alone

Cause we are alive
Here in death valley
But dont take love off the table yet
Cause tonight
Tonight its just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
We are alive

I wanna see your animal side
Let it all out
Oh there you go; undress to impress
You can wear the crown but youre no princess

Lets put the D in dirt now baby
Lets get you wasted and alone

Were gonna die
Its just a matter of time
Hard times come
Good times go
Im either gone in an instant
Or here til the bitter end
I never know
What Ive got will make you feel more alive
Ill be your favorite drug I will get you high
I will get you high---
