I just want to be better than your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your head's only medicine
A downward spiral just a pirouette
Getting worse til there's nothing left
What good comes of something when I'm just the ghost of nothing?

I'm just the man in the balcony singing
Nobody will ever remember me
Rejoice, Rejoice and fall to your knees

(For a)Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic
Their faces are dancing, they're dancing til
Til they can't stand it
Composer but never composed
Sing all the symphonies of the overdosed
Composer but never compose
Singing I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have

Hearaled as a king before I had a birthday
With double (double) digits (digits)
Fit the crown to my head
But I was only a kid
Yeah I was only a kid
Yeah I was only a kid

I'm just the man in the balcony singing
Nobody will ever remember me
Rejoice, Rejoice and fall to your knees

Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic
Their faces are dancing, they're dancing til
Til they can't stand it
Composer but never composed
Sing all the symphonies of the overdosed
Composer but never compose
Singing I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have

To be better than your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your head's only medicine

I'm just the man in the balcony singing
Nobody will ever remember me
Rejoice, Rejoice and fall to your knees

Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic
Their faces are dancing, they're dancing til
Til they can't stand it
Composer but never composed
Sing all the symphonies of the overdosed
Composer but never compose
Singing I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have
I only want what I can't have---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
