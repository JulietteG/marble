Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take, well go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Hey-ya, hey
Hey-ya

Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, its nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the storys all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Those bruises on your thighs, like my fingerprints
And this is for tonight
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take, well go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Hey-ya, hey
Hey-ya

Remember me for centuries

And I cant stop until the whole word knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as theres a light, my shadows over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And youre a cherry blossom
Youre about to bloom
You look so pretty, but youre gone so soon

Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take, well go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Hey-ya, hey
Hey-ya

Remember me for centuries

Weve been here forever
And heres the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We're the poisoned youth

Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take, well go down in history
Remember me for centuries
