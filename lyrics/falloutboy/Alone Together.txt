I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin
And we're starting at the end

Say yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs

Cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it's broke in
Do you wanna feel beautiful
Do you wanna

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yea I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet

I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin
And we're starting at the end

Say yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs

They love it more when it's broke in
Do you wanna feel beautiful
Do you wanna

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yea I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, yeah

Yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs

I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin
And we're starting at the end ---
