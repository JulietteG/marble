Do you do, do you remember 
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night 
And we danced, we danced 
To whimsy, and we danced, we danced 

And I confessed, confessed to you 
Riding shotgun underneath the purple skies 
And we danced, we danced 
With windows down, and we danced, we danced 

You were the song stuck in my head 
Every song Ive ever loved 
Played again and again and again 
And you can get what you want but its never enough 

And Ill spin for you like your favorite records used to 
And Ill spin for you like your favorite records used to 

And I cant, I cant, I cant remember 
Just how to forget, forget the way that we danced 
We danced, to ??? and we danced, we danced 

And when you asked, you asked me how Im doing 
Like you know, you know how much better off I am 
And when we danced, we danced, with windows down 
And we danced, we danced 

You were the song stuck in my head 
Every song I've ever loved 
Played again and again and again 
And you can get what you want but its never enough 
And Ill spin for you like your favorite records used to 
And Ill spin for you like your favorite records used to 

Ill spin, Ill spin, Ill spin, Ill spin 
For you, for you, for you, for you, for yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
