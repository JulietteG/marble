No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate
No graphics and no f**king powerpoint presentation
So they just DIYd that sh*t and built their own bombs
Shes his suicide blond, shes number than gold

Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was not as I am
And I said Ill check in tomorrow if I dont wake up dead,
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition and shed let it go to my head

Rat a tat tat
Rat a tat tat tat hey
If my love is a weapon
Theres no second guessing when I say
Rat a tat tat
Rat a tat tat tat hey
If my heart is a grenade
You pull the pin and say:

Were all fighting growing old
Were all fighting growing old
In the hopes
Of a few minutes more
To get on St. Peters list
But you need to lower your standards
Cause its never
Getting any better than this

We are professional ashes of roses
This kerosenes live
You settled your score
This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
This is what we do, we nightmare you

Im about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heart beat in reverse
Our guts cant be reworked
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert
Getting burned
But Ill take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
Im the lonelier version of you
I just dont know where it went wrong

Shes sick and shes wrong
Shes young dirty blonde
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb
He says Ive seen bigger
She says Ive lit better
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Go boy, run for your life

Talk less
Mean more
Lets be electric
Like we were before---
