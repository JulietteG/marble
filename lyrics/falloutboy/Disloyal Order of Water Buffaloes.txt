I'm coming apart at the seams.
Pitching myself as leads in other people's dreams.
Like buzz, buzz, buzz.
Doc, there's a hole where something was.
Doc, there's a hole where something was.

Fell out of bed.
Butterfly bandage,
But don't worry.
You'll never remember,
Your head is far too blurry.
Put him in the back of a squad car
Restrain that man
He needs his head put through a cat scan.
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match: I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet

So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
Perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
Wants to here you sing about tragedy

Little girl
You got my staring odd
Or was it just a telescopic camera nod
Pa pa painted dolls in the highway
Truck stop stalls
Lot lizard scales cool your nightlife moods
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk when you leave the room

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match: I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet

Boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy

Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox

So boycott love
So boycott love

So boycott love
Detox just to retox
I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
Perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
Wants to hear you sing about tragedy
Wants to hear you sing
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
Wants yo here you sing about tragedy---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
