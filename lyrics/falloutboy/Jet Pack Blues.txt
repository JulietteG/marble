I got those Jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm tryna to find that peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"

I've got those Jet pack blues,
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to slip a drink?
It never mattered what it was
I think our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasted, no

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing "Baby, come home"
