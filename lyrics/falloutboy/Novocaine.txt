This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare

If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you, you would never sing along
Cast them out cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
And leave me, don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I'm just a problem that doesn't wanna be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare

If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you, you would never sing along
Cast them out cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
And leave me, don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I said one day the bell is gonna swallow me whole
I feel like a photo that's been overexposed

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
And leave me, don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
