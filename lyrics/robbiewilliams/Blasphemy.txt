The Egyptians built their pyramids
The Romans did what they did
Now everythings come down to this
Its just you and I, our kin
We could send a million to the moon
But why cant I get on with you?
Cellophane around my mouth
Stops the anger sipping out
Our deaf and dumb dinners
Gravy in the mud
No singles, just fillers
Sometimes I wish I could
But I cant behave
Though its not the heathen in me
Its just that Ive been bleeding lately,
Internally

Dont turn to me,
Bite your tongue, the torrid weapon
You could learn a useful lesson
Whats so great about the Great Depression
Is it a blast for you?
Blasphemy

Words cut like a knife in Vaseline
You cant really mean what you mean
When you say what you say
So tourettes make them come out that way,
Wish I was here well I wish you werent
Your gift of angers better burnt
If nothings said then nothings learnt
I though I wasnt but Im really hurting

Our deaf and dumb dinners,
Theres gravy in the mud
And I cant behave
No, its not the heathen in me
Its just that Ive been bleeding lately,
Internally

Dont turn to me
Bite my tongue, the torrid weapon
We could learn a useful lesson
Whats so great about the Great Depression
Was it a blast for you,
Blasphemy

A great adventure Christmas in the snow
Seen our dimension baby, what a way to go
I wont behave
And though its not the heathen in me
Its just that Ive been bleeding lately,
Internally
So turn to me
Bite your tongue, your torrid weapon
We could learn a useful lesson
In a greatness great depression
Its not a blast for me,
Its blasphemy---Lyrics submitted by Damon.
