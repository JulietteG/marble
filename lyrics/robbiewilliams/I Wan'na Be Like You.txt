(feat. Olly Murs)

I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P
I reached the top and had to stop
And that's what bothering me
I want to be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town
And be just like those other men
I'm tired of monkeying around

Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be like you, too

Don't try to kid me, man-cub, I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dream's come true
Now give me the secret, man-cub, come on, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower so I can be like you

Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be like you, too

Now I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P.
I reached the top and had to stop
And that's what bothering me
I want to be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town
And be just like those other men
I'm tired of monkeying around

Swing to the left, swing to the right,
put your hands up if you loving life
Swing to the left, swing to the right,
put your hands up if you feeling nice

Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be like you, too
Can learn to be someone like me ---
