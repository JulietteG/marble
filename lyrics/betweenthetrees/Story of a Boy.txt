I was in love, at least I thought I was
I had that funny felling in the pit of my stomach
When my fingers started tingling every time we kissed
But the problem wasn't kissin' 
It was that it happened much too often 
Neither of us could grow, no
The best was a painful part, and this broke my heart
But the pain had to heal, and I had to get back up
If she was for real, I know she's worth the fuss

This is a story of a boy who fell in love
This is a story of a boy who grows up
This is a story of a boy who fell in love, and the man he becomes

Which led me to a life of love never lovable 
Outwardly affection was the only connection I could make with those I used
But I gotta take this heart and make a change for the better
By letting go of her I'm movin' on 
Darlin' look out below 'cause there's a lot to let go
The pain had to heal, and I had to get back up
If she was for real, then I know she's worth the fuss

This is a story of a boy who fell in love
This is a story of a boy who grows up
This is a story of a boy who fell in love
This is a story of a boy who grow up

She tells me I'm her only one
And loves the man that I've become
Despite the boy I was
And all at once this tip-toed love is bigger then the both of us
And greater then life's greatest rush

This is a story of a boy who fell in love
This is a story of a boy who grows up
This is a story of a boy who fell in love, and the man he becomes 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

This a story of the boy who fell in love
This is the story of the man he becomes---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
