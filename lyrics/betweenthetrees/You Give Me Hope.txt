I look at your smilin' face
your so weak
and yet you have such strength
You take a glance around this place
You make the best of everything

You give me hope in spite of everything
You showed me love even with so much pain
So I'll take this life and live like I
Was given another try
(Mmmmm)

We laugh
We cry
Sometimes we're broken and we don't know why
I'm tired and I lose my way
You help me find faith Oh!

You give me hope in spite of everything
You showed me love even with so much pain
So I'll take this life and live like I
Was give another try
Just give me another try

You give me hope in spite of everything
You showed me love even with so much pain
So I'll take this life and live like I 
Was given another try......---Lyrics submitted by Kara.
