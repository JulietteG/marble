shes upset, bad day
heads for the dresser drawer to drive her pain away
nothing good can come of this
she opens it,
there's nothing there
is only left over tears
mom and dad had no right she screams
the anger runs down both of her cheeks

then she closed her eyes,
she found relief in a knife
the blood flows as she cries

all alone the way she feels
left alone to deal with
all the pain-drenched sorrow re-lief
bite the lip
just forget the bleeding

then she closed her eyes 
she found relief in a knife 
the blood flows as she cries wo-ah!

then she closed her eyes
she found relief in a knife
the blood flows as she cries 

curled up, shes on the floor
relief left her, she had hoped for something more from it
{hoped for something more from it}
he leans down to comfort her
she is weeping and he wraps his arms around 
and around and around and

the deeper you cut, the deeper i hurt
the deeper you cut, it only gets worse
the deeper you cut, the deeper i hurt
the deeper you cut, it only gets worse
it gets worse

she's slowly opening
she's slowly opening
new eyes

then she opened her eyes 
she found relief in his life
and put down her knives wo-ah!

then shen opened her life
she found relief in his eyes
and put down her 
she put down her *knife*---Lyrics submitted by alexsis.
