Tonight, tonight's gonna be the last night I'll try
I'll try to get by
Maybe tonight if it goes just right
I started with a bottle
Bottoms up
I'm out of luck
Hope was it's best friend
Left them at the top
Cold hands in coat pockets
Clinching my daughter's locket
What would she think of her daddy now?

All you need is love
All you need is love

A little love, a little love is all it takes
A little love, a little love it's never too late
A little love, a little love and faith

Shove the papers into the case
I'm heading home cause the hands just struck 8
And on and on it goes
Tired of this repetition
Over and over
And not getting closer
To where I want to go

And they say
All we need is luck
But no all you need is love

A little love, a little love is all it takes
A little love, a little love it's never too late
A little love, a little love is all it takes
A little love, a little love it's never too late
A little love, a little love and faith
A little love, a little love is all it takes
A little love, a little love it's never too late
A little love, a little love is all it takes
A little love, a little love it's never too late
A little love, a little love and faith
A little love, a little love
A little love, a little love and faith---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
