Do you remember of that Saturday?
When all the things we felt were gone away

So I've tried to erase all the
Memories you left
Living these times faster
Than I can

And I want you to know that

You're my never falling star and
You're my world and everything
I had

So here I stand in front of you today
I hoped so many days to find you on my way

I tought I'd never lost you
Maybe was just a dream
Everyone knows life's a
Trouble thing

And I want you to know that

You're my never falling star and
You're my world my everything and
You're my never falling star and
You're my dreams and everything
I want

And I wish that you were there
Waiting for me again
And calling me your "sweet tattle" as you used

But you won't ever be there
and never wait for me
This is my life so please
Don't worry

I just want you to know that 

You're my never falling star and
You're my world my everything and
You're my never falling star and
You're my dreams and everything---Lyrics submitted by Martyy.
