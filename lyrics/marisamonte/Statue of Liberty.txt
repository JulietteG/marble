Baianas down on Broadway
Selling DVDs
Os ps no cho do mundo
When I walk and the musics in me
Where are you?
I am here

Jogging in So Paulo
Truth and longing
On my headphones
Quem ser
New York City is on my mobile
Great desire, kitchen fire

Where are you
Statue of Liberty?---Lyrics submitted by Dion.
