Sometimes you're weak and weary
Feels like your heart is breaking
Nobody close enough to ease your mind
Seems like the night is falling
The darkness has you crawling
You wonder if you'll ever reach the light

But you've got to know
That the Father's always there by
your side

CHORUS
We will overcome
Heartache and sorrow
We will overcome
All the pain in this world
We will rise above
The cares of tomorrow
We will overcome

We all get disillusioned
With all of life's confusion
Sometimes we simply have to walk
by faith
The road may not be easy
But there is hope and healing
Remember help is just a prayer away

So don't be afraid
He will give us all the strength that we need

REPEAT CHORUS

When we struggle 
Through the hard times
There's a peace that comes from 
the Lord
Just remember He is faithful
So believe and trust in Him more

And don't be afraid
He will give us all the strength that
we need

REPEAT CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Roxxi.
