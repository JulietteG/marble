Its winter in my consciousness, dew has turned to frost
Some will win, some will lose, some have won and lost 
You can feel the time between us now pulling us apart
If I could get in touch somehow, we could make another start

And in Ohio theres one place I would go
Back to the arms of a girl I used to know
Well be ridin back in style gonna be there in a while
Back in the heart of a girl in Ohio

Warmth and the sunshine of the day, slowly turns to night
Whispering winds come what may, birds in homeward flight
Theres just one way that you can go when the sunset is set free
Softly through shadows to the place I want to be

And in Ohio theres one place I would go
Back to the heart of a girl I used to know
Well be ridin back in style, gonna be there in a while
Back in the arms of a girl in Ohio 

Bridge:
I know you know me better than to say I lost my pride
When the things that you can see in me, things that I cant hide
Windy ride into the night its all it usually takes
See me clear yesterday most of my mistakes

And in Ohio theres one place I would go
Back to the arms of a girl I used to know
Well be ridin back in style, gonna be there in a while
Back in the heart of a girl in Ohio

Ohio is one place I would go
Back to the heart of a girl I used to know
Well be ridin back in style gonna be there in a while
Back in the heart of a girl in Ohio---Lyrics submitted by karla weiss.
