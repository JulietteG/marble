In a place you only dream of
Where your soul is always free
Silver stages, golden curtains
Filled my head, plain as can be

As a rainbow grew round the sun
All my stars above who died
Came from somewhere beyond the scene you see
These lovely people played just for me

Now if I let you see this place
Where stories all ring true
Will you let me past your face
To see what's really you
It's not for me I ask this question
As though I were a king
For you have to love, believe and feel
Before the burst of tambourines take you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone soul and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you


Those who don't believe me
Find your souls and set them free
Those who do, believe and know
That time will be your key
Time and time again I've thanked them
For a peace of mind
They helped me find myself
Amongst the music and the rhyme
That enchants you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone soul and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Yeah, they play just for you---Lyrics submitted by Stephen.
