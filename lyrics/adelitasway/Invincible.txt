Bow down
I'm invincible tonight
I'm alive take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride

Believe me
You never met a motherf**ker like me
Bet you never seen the things i've seen
Bottled up inside this time

(Bridge)
I'm rising up
I've had enough

(Chorus)
I feel invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

I'll break you a hundred different ways that i'll make you
Remember my face
Not that I would let you leave
It's hard to stop what you cant see

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

I'm feelin Invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

I'll waste you
When you cant escape me
And I will break you down
(Invincible)

(Chorus)

Invincible.....
Invincible.....
