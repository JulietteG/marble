You said things would never change
But sometimes they get rearranged
I know that you're wrong
You've known all along

You said I could keep you safe
Then upped and left without a trace
I know that you're wrong
You've known all along

I'll never take it back
I'll never take it back
I didn't mean to make you cry
I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry

I'll never take it back
I'll never take it back
I didn't mean to make you cry
I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry

Things you say, they sound so fake
And make me drink until I ache
I know that you're wrong
You've known all along

You're not pleased 'till you draw blood
I don't hit back, but I think I should
I know that you're wrong
You've known all along

I'll never take it back
I'll never take it back
I didn't mean to make you cry
I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry

I'll never take it back
I'll never take it back
I didn't mean to make you cry
I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry

I'll never take it back
I'll never take it back
I didn't mean to make you cry
I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry

I'll never take it back
I'll never take it back
I didn't mean to make you cry
I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry
No, I'm not sorry---Lyrics submitted by Tom A.
