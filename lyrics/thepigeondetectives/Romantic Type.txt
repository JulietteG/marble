I can see you standing there like you know what to do
You all think you know me but you havent got a clue
Well I can see you looking but youre looking at the floor
No I dont think I really care cause youve paid at the door

And its not that Im not the romantic type
Its just that I like what I choose to like
And if youd only take the time to look my way
If you would only take the time to see well I might let you stay

Well I know that you want something and you want it from me
Everyone says were the same but I just can not see
And I know what youre asking for cause Ive just read the tie
Would paying once or maybe twice be really such a crime?

And its not that Im not the romantic type
Its just that I like what I choose to like
And if youd only take the time to look my way
If you would only take the time to see well I might let you stay


Its not that Im not the romantic type
Its just that I like what I choose to like
And its not that Im not the romantic type
Its just that I like what I choose to like---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
