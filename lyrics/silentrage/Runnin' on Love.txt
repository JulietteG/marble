l'm not sittin' around lm ready to roll
Her driven` love makes me lose control
l`m pumped up, and n0thin`can slow me down

Put her to the floor she fuels my fire
She gets closer, and I get higher
All rev`d up racin with the speed of sound

Chorus
Im runnin', runnin' on love
If you're empty l'll fill you up
Im runnin on love
Im gonna start you up
Im runnin', runnin on love
If you're lonely then Im the one
Runnin',  runnin on love

l'm not holdin' back, lm holdin' my own
She's my little queen and l'm her throne
She don't put on the brakes when l want love

I'll slide it in gear, and give her what she needs
Her rpm's high she's on full speed
ll they get in our way we'll drive 'em down---Lyrics submitted by tac.
