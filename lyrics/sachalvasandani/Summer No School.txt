Dressed in blue sunlight passes through you
Forgot my name I could never blame you
Somehow I found you in the crowd
Time moves slow now

Only love would make me this afraid of you
Look my way I cant even play cool
Somehow you must have figured out the time is right now

Should I try to fight it?
I'm moving closer to you
The sun is burning,
The back of your neck still warm

(scat)

Dont act too foolish or too proud
The time is right now

Should I try to fight it?
I'm moving closer to you
The sun is burning
The back of your neck still warm

Silence is getting me low
Its like you already seem to know

Watching you smile is a way out
Your magic is all that I need
Right now

Got to try but even as I say hi,
Your silent eyes louder than a white lie
Goodbye Ill leave you to your crowd
Time moves slow now

Slow now
Slow now
Slow...---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
