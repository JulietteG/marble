Verse:
Its raining in December on the freeway going home
People feeling tired and alone
But when I hear them playing the carols on the radio
When I hear their voices loud and strong
I know its not too late to sing along.

Chorus:
Ringing the bells of Christmas
Living to tell the world about his love
Open your heart and let it fill you up

Ringing the bells of Christmas
Sending the spirit out into the wind
Its just gonna keep on ringing out til everyone one joins in

Verse:
It seems we do more taking from than giving to this earth
Sometimes we forget how much its worth
Its time we reconsider what we put last and we put first
Remember who we are and why were here
Lets send up a thank you message loud and clear

Chorus:
Ringing the bells of Christmas
Living to tell the world about his love
Open your heart and let it fill you up

Ringing the bells of Christmas
Were sending the spirit out into the wind
Its just gonna keep on ringing out til everyone one joins in

Bridge:
Its gonna take the faith of all our hearts
Just like the men who crossed the desert in the dark
They just kept on following that star

Chorus:
Ringing the bells of Christmas
Living to tell the world about his love
Open your heart and let it fill you up

Were ringing the bells of Christmas
And snding the spirit out into the wind
Its just gonna keep on ringing out, ringing out

Ringing the bells of Christmas
Were living to tell the world about his love
Open your heart and let it fill you up

Were ringing the bells of Christmas
And sending the spirit out into the wind
Its just gonna keep on ringing out, ringing outOhh---Lyrics submitted by Bruce Carter.
