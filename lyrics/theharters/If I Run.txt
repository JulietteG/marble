My heart has arrived
Love lives in your eyes
And I need to know
What you see in mine
Ive been shattered and healed
Searching for something thats real
Where do you stand
How do you feel

If I run will you run after me
If I walk will you wait patiencely
If I fall will you have sympathy
If I run if I run will you run after me

Yeahhhhhhhh

I dream of a place of white satin and lace
Black on a tie and cake on my face
Wickered rocking chairs
Salt and peppered hair
And that day comes round
Willl you still be there

If I run will you run after me
If I walk will you wait patiencely
If I fall will you have sympathy
If I run if I run will you run after me

Yeahhhhhhhh

Baby
If I run 
Ohhh
If I 
If I
If I run will you run after me
If I walk will you wait patiencely
If I fall will you have sympathy
If I run if I run

If I run will you run after me
If I walk will you wait patiencely
If I fall will you have sympathy
If I run if I run will you run after me

Oh Yeahhhhhh
