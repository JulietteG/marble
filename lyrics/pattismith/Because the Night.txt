Take me now, baby,
here as I am
pull me close, try and
understand
desire is hunger is the fire I
breathe
love is a banquet
on which we feed
come on now try
and understand
the way I feel when
I'm in your hands
take my hand come undercover
they can't hurt you now
can't hurt you now,
can't hurt you now

because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to life
because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to us

have I doubt when I'm alone
love is a ring, the telephone
love is an ange; disguised as
                   lust
here in out bed until the
morning comes
come on now trey and understand
the way I feel under your
command
take mt hand as
the sun descends
they can't touch you now
can't touch you now, can't touch 
you now

because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to life
because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to us

with love we sleep
with doubt the vicious circle
turn and burns
without you i cannot live 
forgive the yearning
I believe it's time,
too real to feel
so touch me now,
touch me now,
touch me now

because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to life
because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to us
because tonight there are

two lovers
if we believe in the night
we trust
because tonight there are
two lovers

because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to life
because the night
belongs to lovers
because the night
belongs to us---Lyrics submitted by Marija Ursic.
