Oh look at how she listens
She says nothing of what she thinks
She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out on to Grey Street

She thinks, Hey,
How did I come to this?
I dream myself a thousand times around the world,
But I cant get out of this place

Theres an emptiness inside her
And shed do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

How she wishes it was different
She prays to God most every night
And though she swears it doesnt listen
Theres still a hope in her it might

She says, I pray
But they fall on deaf ears,
Am I supposed to take it on myself?
To get out of this place

Theres loneliness inside her
And shed do anything to fill it in
And though its red blood bleeding from her now
It feels like cold blue ice in her heart
When all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

Theres a stranger speaks outside her door
Says take what you can from your dreams
Make them as real as anything
Itd take the work out of the courage

But she says, Please
Theres a crazy man thats creeping outside my door,
I live on the corner of Grey Street and the end of the world

Theres an emptiness inside her
And shed do anything to fill it in
And though its red blood bleeding from her now
Its more like cold blue ice in her heart
She feels like kicking out all the windows
And setting fire to this life
She could change everything about her using colors bold and bright
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart
It breaks her heart
To grey ---Lyrics submitted by Tasha.
