Fall back again
Fall back again
Fall back again
Fall back again

Oh life it seems a struggle between what we see what we do
I'm not going to change my ways just to please you 
or appease you
Oh look at this crowd
Five billion proud
Willing to punch it out
Right wrong, weak strong ashes to ashes
All fall down

Oh look around about this round about this merry go round and round
If at all God's gaze upon us falls 
It's with a mischevous grin
Look at him

Forget about the reasons
And the treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that our emotions can be kept at bay
Forget about being guilty we are innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

Oh look at me and my fancy car and my bank account
Oh how I wish I could take it all 
Down to my grave
God knows I'd save and save
Aw take a look again, take a look again
Things you have collected
Well in the end it all piles up so tall
To one big nothing
One big nothing at all

Forget about the reasons
And the treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that our emotions can be swept away
Kept at bay
Forget about being guilty we are innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

You seek up an emotion and your cup is overflowing
You seek up an emotion sometimes your well is dry
You're looking for a monster for him to fight your wars for you
But when he find his way to you, the devil's not going
ha ha...ha ha

Say...oh say
Late at night with TV's hungry child, his belly swells
When for the price of a coke or a smoke
I could keep alive those hungry eyes
Man take a look again, take a look again, take a look again
Everyday things change
But basically they stay the same

Forget about the reasons
And the treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that our emotions can be kept at bay
Forget about being guilty we are innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

Fall back again
Fall back again
Fall back again
Fall back again---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
