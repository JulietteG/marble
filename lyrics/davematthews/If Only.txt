Oh yeah 
Some days it's so easy 
Sometimes I forget her 
Much I want you back again 
Back again 

Well maybe it's a game 
You win some and you lose some 
But when you've found a good one 
Don't you let her get away 
Don't let her go 

Oh yeah 
If only I could have you 
Just the way I want you 
Oh, to have you back again 
Back again baby 

Oh, I'm just a fool baby 
Playing Mr. Cool baby 
Rolling round like I got nothing much to lose 
But I know you and you know me 
And I know you can see 
So help me find my way back to you 
Back to you 

Walking past your window 
You used to smile and throw 
Your sweet kisses back to me 
Back to me 

Oh yeah 
Remember when I asked you 
If you'd be my one true 
it seems like yesterday 
Just like yesterday 

Oh yeah, and I'm just a fool baby 
Playing Mr. Cool baby 
Rolling round like I got nothing much to lose 
But I know you and you know me 
And I know you can see 
So help me get my way back to you 
Back to you 

I want you so take me back please 
Take me back my baby 

If only I could have you 
Just the way I want you 
Yeah 

I'm just a fool baby 
Playing Mr. Cool baby 
Rolling round like I got nothing much to lose babe 
But I know you and you know me 
And I know you can see 
So help me get my way back to you 

I want you so take me back please 
Take me back my baby 

If only I could have you 
Just the way I want to 
Just the way I was 
Yeah ---
