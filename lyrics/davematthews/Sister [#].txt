Passing time with you in mind
It's another quiet night
Feel the ground against my back
Counting stars against the black

Thinking about another day
Wishing I was far away
Where ever I dreamed I was
You were there with me

Sister, I hear you laugh
My heart fills full up 
Keep me please
Sister, and when you cry
I feel your tears running down my face
Sister, sister
Keep me

I hope you always know it's true
That I would never make it through
Cause you can make the sun go dark, just by walking away
Playing like we used to play
Like it would never go away
I feel you beating in my chest
I'd be damned without

Sister, I hear you laugh
My heart fills full up 
Keep me please
Sister, and when you cry
I feel your tears running down my face
Sister, sister
Keep me

I hope you always know it's true
Cause I could never make it through
You can make the heavens fall, just by walking away

Sister, I hear you laugh
My heart fills full up
Keep me please
Sister, and when you cry
I feel your tears running down my face
Sister, sister
Keep me---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Brown.
