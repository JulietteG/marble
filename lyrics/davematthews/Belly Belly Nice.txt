Think about what you want 
Think about what you got 
And all the things that'll heal or hurt you 
But when that big bomb is full of peaches 
It don't matter what the preacher preaches 
The days are warm and the well is full of virtue 

Jack and jill went up the hill 
To fetch a pail of water 
Jack fell down and broke his crown 
Because he was messing with the preachers daughter 

Open up your wings 
Make a dead man sing 
Such a good good thing 
Just can't be wrong no no no 

You can't get too much love 
Don't you feel it in your belly go get you some 
You can't get too much love 
The time is right for loving so come on come on 

Can you feel it in your belly come on 

Mamma's in the kitchen 
Daddy's in the field 
And baby girl is going to town 
Because she likes the way it make her feel 
Swimming in the river 
Rolling in the mud 
When the juice is dripping off your chin 
One peach is not enough 

You can't get too much love 
So if you feel it in your belly come on come on 
You can't get too much love 
The time is right for loving come and get you some 
You cant get too much love 
Oh give it up, give it up, give it up 

Oh the light that shines upon 
The gift that everyone has for the taking 
And happiness so pure as this 
Is surely worth the making 

Jack and jill went up the hill 
To fetch a pail of water 
Jack fell down and broke his crown 
Because he was messing with the preachers daughter 

Love love love love love love love 
Love love love love love love love 

You can't get too much love 
So if you feel it in your belly come and get you some 
You can't get too much love 
The time is right for loving say come on come on 
You cant get too much love 
Gonna eat you're belly jelly till the kingdom comes 
You cant get too much love 
So give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up ---
