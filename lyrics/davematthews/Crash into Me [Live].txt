You've got your ball
you've got your chain
Tied to me tight tie me up again
Who's got their claws
in you my friend
Deep in your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock
and sweet you roll
Lost for you I'm so lost for you

you come crash into me
And i come into you
I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare-boned and crazy for you
Oh and you come crash
into me, baby
And I come into you
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you
to forgive me
in my haste
When I'm holding you so girl...
close to me

Oh and you come crash
in to me baby
And I come into you
Hike up your skirt a little more
and show the world to me, baby
hike up your skirt a little more
and show the world to me
In a boy's dream...In a boy's dream

Oh I watch you there
through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you
wear it so well
Tied up and twisted
the way I'd like to be
For you, for me, come crash
into me, oh yah
Come crash into me baby,

Crash into me
Crash into me
Crash into me

You know Well, I'm the king of the castle, youre the dirty rascal
Crash into me, ah sing it crash into me baby
Lying here swimming in your sea and in your ocean

And I can feel the wave come and crash into me
Yes I can feel the wave come and crash into me
Ah yes I will feel your wave come and crash into me

I will be your Dixie chicken if youll be my Tennessee lamb
We will walk together down in Dixie land

Crash into me
Crash into me, yah yah
Crash into me, oo ya ya yay
Crash into me

Ah will you come crash into me girl---Lyrics submitted by Leo.
