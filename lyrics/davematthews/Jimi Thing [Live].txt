Lately I've been feeling low
A remedy is what I'm seeking
I take a taste of what's mellow
Come away to something better
What I want is what I've not got
But what I need is all around me
I reach and search and never stop
And I'll say...

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called... Jimi
If you could keep me floating just for a while
I'll get back to you

Sometimes a Jimi Thing slides my way and keeps me swingin'
I'd like to show you what's inside
And I sure don't care if you do or don't like it
Brother chaos rule all about
Sometimes I take a walk there
Yes, God knows, sometimes I take a bus there
Shouldn't care I shouldn't care bereaved as I'm feeling

The day is gone I'm on my back
Staring up at the ceiling
I take a drink sit back relax
Smoke my mind make me feel
High for a time
What I want is what I've not got
And what I need is all around me
I reach and search and never stop
And I'll say...

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called... mommy
If you could keep me floating just for a while
I'll get back to you

Sometimes I think a Jimi Thing just keep me swingin'
I'd like to show you what's inside
And I sure don't care if you do or don't like it
Brother chaos rule all about
Sometimes I take a walk there
Yes, God knows, sometimes I take a bus there
Shouldn't care I shouldn't care bereaved as I'm feeling

(instrumental solo)

Lately I've been feeling low
A remedy is what I'm looking for cooking for
So I take a taste of what's below
Come away...

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called Jimi...
If you could keep me floating just for a while
Well I'll come right back to you

Sometimes I think a Jimi Thing just keep me swingin'
I'd like to show you what's inside
And I sure don't care if you do or don't like it
Brother chaos rule all about
Sometimes I take a walk there
Yes, God knows, sometimes I take a bus there
Shouldn't care I shouldn't care bereaved as I'm feeling---Lyrics submitted by David.
