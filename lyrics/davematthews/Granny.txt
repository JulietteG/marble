Hello, how are you doing today?
I hope I find you feeling healthy
I'm so glad our paths crossed this time today
On our way into the night

Oh, we find love, it's hiding there, in the shadows, in the darkness
Baby, it's you and I, could bring it to the light
Love, when I approach the tears they fall like rain, you tell me
Baby, your heart into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can
But I blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next pretty girl that comes my way

So here we are all of us stand around
We're leaning heavy on each other
Always wondering what is it lies behind
The worried eyes of the woman that I love

I believe it's love, it's hiding there, inside you and inside me
Baby, the two of us can bring it to the light
Love, when I approach the tears they fall like rain, you tell me
Baby, your heart into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can
But I blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next good thing that comes my way

I say it's love, it's inside here, it comes on out, share it with some
Baby, you and I could bring it to the light
Love, when I approach these tears they fall like rain, you tell me

Baby, your heart into a thousand pieces...

Love...

Baby...---Lyrics submitted by Angelo.
