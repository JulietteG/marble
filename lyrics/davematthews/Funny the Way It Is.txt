Lying in the park on a beautiful day,
Sunshine in the grass, and the children play
Sirens passing fire engine red
Someone's house is burning down on a day like this

Evening comes and we're hanging out
On the front step when a car goes by with the windows rolled down
And that war song is playing, why can't we be friends?
Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs

Funny the way it is, if you think about it
Somebody's going hungry 
Someone else is eating out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong,
Somebody's heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song

The way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss
Like a pretty bird on a breeze
Or water to a fish
A bomb blast brings a building crashing to the floor
Hear the laughter while the children play war

Funny the way it is, if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school
Another's dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong,
On a soldier's last breath 
His baby's being born

Standing on a bridge
Watch the water passing underneath
It must've been much harder
When there was no bridge just water
Now the world is small
Compared to how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars

I watch the sky with airplanes so far out of my reach
Is there someone up there looking down on me?
Boy chase a bird, so close but every time
He'll never catch her
But he can't stop trying

Oh funny the way it is, if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school
Another's dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier's last breath his baby's being born
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody's broken heart becomes your favorite song
Funny the way it is, if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school
Another's dropping out

Standing on a bridge
Watch the water passing underneath
It must've been much harder
When there was no bridge just water
Now the world is small
Compared to how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
