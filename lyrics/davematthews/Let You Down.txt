I let you down
Let me pick you up
I let you down
Let me climb up you to the top 
So I can see the view from up there
Tangled in your hair
I let you down
I have no lid up on my head but if I did
You could look inside and see whats on my mind
You could look inside and see whats on my mind
I let you down
Oh, forgive me 
And give me love 
Let me walk with you 
Maybe I could say
Maybe talk with you
Open up
Let me through
Dont walk away
Dont walk away
I have no lid up on my head but if I did 
You could look inside and see whats on my mind
You could look inside and see whats on my mind
I let you down
How could I be such a fool like me?
I let you down 
Tail between my legs
Im a puppy for your love
Im a puppy for your love
I have no lid up on my head but if I did 
You could look inside and see whats on my mind
Oh, its you
I let you down
Im a puppy for your love
Im a puppy for your love
Forgive me
Forgive me
Oh, oh, oh
Forgive me
I let you down---Lyrics submitted by Magdalena.
