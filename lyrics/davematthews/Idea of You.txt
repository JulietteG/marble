I'm sitting on my front step
Waiting for you to walk by with your friends
You look up at me the lights form
Smile sweet that made me skin
Jump out all that the way you do
It's like no feeling I could express
Oh sitting up here oh this little kid
You look like an angel

I fall so hard inside the idea of you
That's why with you can't say what I mean
Wanna stay but I think I'm getting outta here
I fall so hard inside the idea of you

I stumble falling
Front of you and all your cool friends
You pick me up you brush me off I grin
But you know I wanna disappear
One day when you fall for me girl
You know I know it's gonna come
I'm not gonna brush you off no way
And I'm not gonna pull your hair

I fall so hard inside the idea of you
That's why with you can't say what I mean
Wanna stay but I think I'm getting outta here
I fall so hard inside the idea of you

Oh yeah
It's something
It's a game I play
Inside myself
But you goin'
But you watching me
Knowing til myself oh I playing
Like you're sitting there
And you hold my
Til I fall asleep
And I wake up
And I find out
You're gone gone gone yeah

I fall so hard inside the idea of you
That's why with you can't say what I mean
Wanna stay but I think I'm getting outta here
I fall so hard inside the idea of you

I stumble falling
Front of you and all your cool friends
You pick me up you brush me off I grin
But all I wanna do is disappear
One day when you fall for me babe
I know it's gonna come and then
I'm not gonna brush you off no way
And I'm not gonna kick you in your shin---Lyrics submitted by Wendi.
