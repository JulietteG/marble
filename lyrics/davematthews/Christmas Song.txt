She was his girl, he was her boyfriend
She'd be his wife, that'd make him her husband
A Surprise on the way, any day any day
One healthy little giggling, dribbling baby boy
The wise men came, three made their way
to shower him with love while he lay in the hay.
Shower him with love, love, love
love, love, love
love,love, is all around.

Not very much of His childhood was known.
Kept His mother Mary worried always out on his own
He met another Mary for a reasonable fee
Less than reputable was known to be. 
His heart was full of love, love, love
love, love, love
love, love was all around.

When Jesus Christ was nailed to His tree,
He said Oh Daddy-o I can see how it all soon will be
Came to shed a little light on this dark little scene
Instead I fear I've spilled the blood of My children all around
The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children all around.

So I'm told, so the story goes 
The people there were less than golden-hearted.
Gamblers and robbers, drinkers and jokers,
But all soul-searchers just like you and me,
Like you and me.
Rumors insisted that He soon would be,
For His deviations, taken into custody,
By the authorities less informed than He,
Drinkers and jokers, all soul-searchers.
Searching for love, love, love,
love, love, love,
love, love is all around.

Preparations were made for his celebration day.
He said eat this bread and think of it as Me,
Drink this wine and dream it will be, 
the blood of our children all around,
the blood of our children all around,
the blood of our children all around.

Father up above why in all this anger do you
fill us up with love, love, love, 
love, love, love,
love, love is all around.

Father up above why in all this hatred do you
fill us up with love, love, love, 
love, love, love,
love, love is all around.---Lyrics submitted by Ma.
