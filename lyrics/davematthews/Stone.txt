I've this creeeping suspicion that things here are not as they seem
oh reassure me why do i feel as if i'm in too deep?  Oh I've been praying for someway to show them I'm not what they see. Oh I have done wrong, but what I did I thought needed to be done. I swear....

Oh unholy day, if I leave now I might get away.  God knows it weighs on me as heavy as stone and as blue as I go.  I was just wondering if you'd come along, hold up my head when my head won't hold on, I'll do the same if the same's what you want, but if not I'll go....I will go a long way, ahhh from that fools mistake, and I will forever pay.  Run and I'll run then I'll be ok.ay, I was just wondering if you'd come along hold up my head won't hold on.  I'll do the same if the same's what you want, but if not I'll go, I will go a long way..to bury the past for I don't want to pay, god how I wish this, to turn back the clock do it all over again.
I was just wondering if you'd come along, hold up my head when my head won't hold on, and I'll do the same if the same's what you want...but if not I'll go....I will go along....
I need so to stay in your arms to see you smile, hold you.... close, oh and it weighs on me as heavy as stone and a bone chilling cold.  I was just wondering if you'd come along, tell me you will....Let it all fall out let it all fall down on you.---Lyrics submitted by nancy.
