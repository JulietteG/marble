And in plays to write the wire in
I'll come back again
Torching time talking rhymes in
I'll come back again

HEY!

Would you like to play
With the thought of a friend
In a distant passing stage
While you lie around
With your hands up and out
So in time you will fall down

While you're around here play
Wild on the warm and far away
While you're around here play
The days keep scribbling themselves in tidy lines

Would you like to play
With a fool holding hands
With a one-eyed jack of spades
While on the deck they sing
All of the captain's cards are kings
Still he and the queen are lost at sea
I hope it isn't you and me

And I'll be back 'round again
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend
And we'll find that place
That we had danced in so long ago

And in plays to write the wire in
I'll come back again
Torching time talking rhymes in
I'll come back again
With this resigned
The letter I sign---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
