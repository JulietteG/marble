Once upon a time
When the world was just a pancake
Fears would arise that if you went too far you'd fall.
But with the passage of time,
It all became a rubber ball
We're as sure of that as we all once were when the world was flat.

So I wonder this,
As life billows smoke inside my head
Is it a game
Where nothing is sure? Oh
Why would you play by the rules
Who did?  You did. You.
Who did?  You did. You.

When is was it killed? 
The very last Dodo bird.
And was she aware she was the very last one?

So I wonder this,
As life billows smoke inside my head
Is it a game
Where nothing is sure? Oh
Why would you play by the rules
Who did? You did. You.
Who did? You did. You 
You say, "Who did?", well you did. You.

Oh all the things that you are saying now
Were true enough but still,
What is all the worrying about. 
We can work it out.
We can work it...

So I wonder this,
As life billows smoke inside my head
Is it a game
Where nothing is sure? Oh
Why would you play by the rules
Who did? You did. You.
Who did? You did. You 
You say, "Who did?", well you did. You.---Lyrics submitted by Nanci.
