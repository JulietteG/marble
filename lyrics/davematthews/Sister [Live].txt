Passing time with you in mind
It's another quiet night
Feel the ground against my back
Counting stars against the black
Thinking bout another day
Wishing I was far away
Wherever I dreamed I was
You were there with me

Sister, I hear you laugh
My heart fills full up
Keep me please
Sister, when you cry
I feel your tears running down my face
Sister, Sister keep me

I hope you always know its true
I would never make it through
You could make the sun go down
Just by walking away
Playing like we used to play
Like it would never go away
Feel you beating in my chest
I'll be dead without

Sister, I hear you laugh
My heart fills full up
Keep me please
Sister, when you cry
I feel your tears running down my face
Sister, Sister keep me.

Hope you always know it's true
I would never make it through
You could make the heaven's fall
Just by walking away
Just by walking away

Sister, when you laugh
My heart fills full up
Keep me please
Sister, when you cry
I feel your tears run down my face
Sister, Sister keep me---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
