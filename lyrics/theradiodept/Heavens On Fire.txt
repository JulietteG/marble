"When I look at you, heaven's on fire
I wish I didn't know you better, but it's pointless
One look at you, and heaven's on fire

When I look at you, I reach for a piano wire
Fighting to keep it together, but it's pointless
One look at you and heaven's on fire,
Heaven's on fire

It seems like everyone is on your side
We're outnumbered by those who take no pride
In constantly moving against the tide
Charlatans just out of reach and out of time

I'm a little like you,
Ugly on the inside
But while I dive into the gritty
You just stand by
When I look at you
Heaven's on fire
Heaven's on fire

It seems like everyone is on your side
We're outnumbered by those who take no pride
In constantly moving against the tide
Charlatans just out of reach and out of time"---Lyrics submitted by Yongjik.
