We touch you soul now
You can run but we get through some how
You should had known that these people'll break your walls down
Here come the feet of the found

We take you deep now
You can trust that we can work it out
You should believe that we obviously can't be stopped now
Here come the feet of the found

You live in a fire that makes you cold
Sell out the sounds that makes you known
Feelin' that they're invincible 
The fires that make you cold

Standin in a lamb that never sees
Handin in line for crowns and greed
Elevator fairs that makes you bleed
Yeah, there is no peace

I know you're lost
And need to be found
Just take my hand and we'll shake the ground
Sometimes we all run, but what if this time we don't run

We touch you soul now
You can run but we get through some how
You should had known that these people'll break your walls down
Here come the feet of the found

We'll bring you home now
You were lost and couldn't feel the power
There ain't no problem, cause brother we got your covered now
Here come the feet of the found

Live in a fire that makes you cold
Sellin a lie that makes you bold
I don't wanna cut the humus, no
But the lies'll make you the cold

Livin a life than rather feel
Stealin from homes and takin pills
I can't love, help reveal
Thieves have come to kill

I know you're lost
And need to be found
Just take my hand and we'll shake the ground
Sometimes we all run, but what if this time we don't run

I know you're lost
And need to be found
Just take my hand and we'll shake the ground
Sometimes we all run, but what if this time we don't run

I can touch your soul

We touch you soul now
You can run but we get through some how
You should had known that these people'll break your walls down
Here come the feet of the found

We'll touch you soul now
You can run but we get through some how
You should had known that these people'll break your walls down
Here come the feet of the found---Lyrics submitted by LINDSAY.
