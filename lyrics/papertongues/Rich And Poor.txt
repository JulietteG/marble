This goes out the rich and poor
I stand as a broken man
Before we shake I shoulda let you know
My hand it's a dirty hand
The place I live ain't called easy street
Our houses are weak and cheap
So this goes out to my struggling peeps
I have a dream we get out this week

New york, LA say a prayer for me
Orange county, Queensbridge say a prayer for me
ATL Southeast say a prayer for me
Manhattan, Hollywood say a prayer for me
? say a prayer for me
Queens City, Lawndale say a prayer for me
Jamesville NC say a prayer for me
Lawndale, Jamesville say a prayer for me

I want to give my peace away to the man that drives the Escalade
Cause he knows that money dont buy a home
It's takes a wife and kids where love is grown
I think Im really tired of these washed up plans 
To be the king of thug and all the wall street fam
It takes alot of guts to hold onto your green
When there are dead banks plus political swing
I think its bout time we get some people in the house
Who wanna run game on the naysayers mouth
If you got the money then you understand me partly
And if you plain broke well then welcome to the party

This goes out the rich and poor
I stand as a broken man
Before we shake I shoulda let you know
My hand it's a dirty hand
The place I live aint called easy street
Our houses are weak and cheap
So this goes out to my struggling peeps
I have a dream we get out this week

New York, LA say a prayer for me
ATL southeast say a prayer for me
Manhattan, Hollywood, say a prayer for me
London, Hong kong say a prayer for me
Singapore, Germany say a prayer for me
Mexico, Bejing say a prayer for me
Columbia, Sydney say a prayer for me
Brazil, Russia say a prayer for me

I want to give 500 cups of karma to the homeless on the block
Next week lets make it half a mil, but they say my daydreams aren't for real
Can you tell a man a better way to make dreams
I know we got a world full of overrated schemes
I watched alot of people get bent, didn't break
Stuck up in the system with locks on their gate
I know alot of people who can sing this song
Cause I wrote this for all those who dont belong
I say we form a choir and take it to the streets
And let the world know we gettin out this week

Dream dream
Dream boy dream
Dream dream 
Dream girl dream

If I get down I'll sing
If I get scared I'll yell
Make no mistake about this, I'm coming out of here

This goes out the rich and poor
I stand as a broken man
Before we shake I shoulda let you know
My hand it's a dirty hand
The place I live aint called easy street
Our houses are weak and cheap
So this goes out to my struggling peeps
I have a dream we get out this week

New york, LA say a prayer for me
Orange county, Queensbridge say a prayer for me
ATL Southeast say a prayer for me
Manhattan, Hollywood say a prayer for me
? say a prayer for me
Queens City, Lawndale say a prayer for me
Jamesville NC say a prayer for me
Lawndale, Jamesville say a prayer for me---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
