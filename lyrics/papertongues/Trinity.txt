You got a way of living, Your Ways, Hey I Want That,
I try to live my life for the people who need a Come Back!!!!!!
There's too many problems to think that you could fix me,
My name is called The World & I'm dying of unbelief see
I'm the Kind of person who's strong & wants to react... Read More
So feel me when I fight for the cause of bringing Hope Back
Don't ask me where I'm going, Cause I could never prove that
But I do have something to say
Loop)
I am reaching from the Depths of my Soul,
Hear me Pleading, I'm a Child im the poor
I am Needed to Draw on your virtue
Believing....
Chorus)
Trinity, don't say good by, hey you know that
Time After, Time after we will surive,
that's Why I'm Still Alive
Oh,woo, I,
 Love & Action takes the Widow with her Lose, and True Commitment take the Orphans
Paying their Cost, Were just broken vessels pouring out our wine, Our days a numbered, but yet still
we walk this line.
Loop)
I am reaching from the depths of my soul,
Hear me Pleading, I'm a Child im the poor
I am Needed to Draw on your virtue
believing....
Chorus)
Trinity, Don't say good bye, Hey You Know That
Time After, Time After We Will survive,
Thats Why I'm Still Alive
(Bridge)
The Words Can't Break your Bones, so I release them in a Song,
unbelief get out my Head, You can't win cause I'm not Dead.
Prison step aside, cause It's time for us to Rise
All my people Under Fire, You can Bet this time that I will Survive.
(Chorus) Trinity...---Lyrics submitted by Juliana.
