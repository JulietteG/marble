When you step in the room 
They won't be holding me down
All these demons in my head 
Come on let's kill them with sound
You see I'm prayin that you take me
And you never look back
That's why I'm crying to a wall
Hoping that you come now

Hey...I don't wanna wake up from this
I cannot afford to forget
The feeling of your arms, they hold me
The power of your skin, it's lovely
You provoke a man to bow down
And I get on my knees and cry out
"Everything I have is yours now"

Pre-Chorus:
So the time is now
Just don't let me down
Oh the time is now
Please don't let me down

Chorus:
Get higher, and higher, and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall
Climb higher, and higher, and higher
When my back's against the wall 
You're the hand that breaks my fall

Take me to a place for romance
You can choose the space and for this
I can hardly breathe it's so deep
My hands begin to shake with frailty 
You will not escape my embrace 
'Cause I'll be holding on with violence
Everything I have is yours now

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

When you step in the room
They won't be holding me down
All these demons in my head
Come on let's kill them with sound
You see
We finally get a message that we're gonna breakout 
I say we wrestle all the angels 'til they give us a crown
You know
We're gonna live forever if we hold on to love
So don't you leave me when you know that I'm needing your touch
You see
I'm begging that you take me and you never look back
That's why I'm crying to a wall hoping that you come now

Chorus

(Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah oh oh....)
I wait for you(repeat 6x)

You're my fire
You're my fire
You're my fire---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
