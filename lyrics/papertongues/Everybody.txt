Brother get off the tracks
You shouldn't chose to go down like that
You got that evil in your mind
But take a breath and breathe this time

Sister go take a chill
Before your mind leads you to kill
I know that accidents are real
But drink some peace and learn to heal

Chorus:
People always act unreal
People always act unreal
People always act like they can't heal
But if you hold their hand just before they break
You can crush their guilt

Chorus repeats

Sonny get off the floor 
Cause you don't live there anymore
You got your hat it's from your dad
But you got it better than what he had

Lisa I know you're hurt
But get your face up out the dirt
What if the baby is what you need
To come inside and wash away your grief

Father get off the couch
Your family starves and goes about
What if your son can hardly cope
You could embrace and give him hope

Mother get out that home
Your kids are living outside alone
How bout you wrap them in your cloth
And let them know that love's not lost

Chrous repeats 2x

Boy you know me, I know you
We're just like everybody
Yes we do bend, we do break
We fall apart sometimes and
We're not perfect 
We're not right
We're made from every color
Can you relate?
Like they say
We're gonna need each other

Well you know me, I know you
We're just like everybody
Yes we do bend, we do break
We fall apart sometimes and
We're not perfect 
We're not right
We're made from every color
Can you relate?
Like they say
We're gonna need each other

Well you know me, I know you
We're just like everybody
Yes we do bend, we do break
We fall apart sometimes and
We're not perfect 
We're not right
We're made from every color
Can you relate?
Like they say
We're gonna need each other
