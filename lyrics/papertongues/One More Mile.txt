Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
(x2)

Don't turn back now
Just one more mile
(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na) 
(x2)

I'm like traffic lights and city streets
Calling you, look to me, I go
Don't turn back now
Just one more mile
People hurt, I see them bleed
Their faces show the pain beneath, I go
Don't look down now
I'm your way out
Your skin is orange, my skin is green
But that don't mean a thing to me, I go
Don't point here friend
Just be kind man
Take a step and then you fall
You get back up and still you fall, I go
Don't hold back now
We'll win somehow

(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)
Don't turn back now
Just one more mile
(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)
Don't turn back now
Just one more mile

I catch too much heat when I fight defeat
Theres nothing left inside of me, I go
Don't turn back now
Just one more mile
What if my home was built rome?
Would my kingdom fall or stand alone?, I go
Lets get free now
Tear that wall down

(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)
Don't turn back now
Just one more mile
(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)
Don't turn back now
Just one more mile

Don't get lost inside of your mind
Its only dark until the sun rises
I think we were made for doing something
Don't excite the path, you never left it
If you turn you're never gonna be someone
Life is short, don't look back, I never saw you
This is how the world is gonna make it
One by one we're all gonna make it

Oh, lets hit the road
Lets see the world through brand new eyes
So much to see
Theres more than you, theres more than me
Come, its just above
Its not that far, you can't somehow
What if you're late? For more than this
Your price is paid
Just one more mile


Don't get lost inside of your mind
Its only dark until the sun rises
I think we were made for doing something
Don't excite the path, you never left it
If you turn you're never gonna be someone
Life is short, don't look back, I never saw you
This is how the world is gonna make it
One by one we're all gonna make it

Its a brand new day
I'm still alive
What can I say?
The road was mighty hard
But its okay
I did my pride 
Just one more mile---Lyrics submitted by Jose.
