You got your scene pinned underneath your thought
and that's the way you need it. (yeah)
You got the dirt that hurts on everyone
and all the people see it. (yeah)

(Every single heart would be for you alone, if you would let it)
Startling eyes let by subtle lies.
(No one knows the way you are when you're alone, 'cause you won't let them)
Cut them off before they get too close to you

(Every single heart would be for you alone, if you would let it)
Startling eyes let by subtle lies.
(No one knows the way you are when you're alone, 'cause you won't let them)
Cut them off before they get too close to you.

Don't let them near (don't let them near)
Don't let them near (don't let them near)
You gotta keep yourself composed so

Don't let them near (don't let them near)
Don't let them near (don't let them near)
You gotta cut them off before they get too close to you.---Lyrics submitted by pielogist.
