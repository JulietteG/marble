Ooh I'm ready
Ooh I'm ready
Ooh

At the end of the day
It's alright
Gonna pull it together
Change my ways, take a piece of the future
Waited so long
For the end of the day
Ooh ooh

I've been thinking of a time
That we didn't have each other
Trying to understand
Like we never want another
Let's talk
I don't wanna lie

I've been dreaming of a future
Maybe we could be together
I'm never gonna lose you
Baby, we can live forever
Let's talk

We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love
We got this aerial love

At the end of the day
We'll take flight
See you all later
Gonna love you or leave you
Got to believe it's the true kind of love
At the end of the day
Ooh---
