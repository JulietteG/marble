T-t-t-t take it back ta the the day of the M.J. Thriller
Ba-ba-ba- back in forth like Aaliyah
On the dance floor I'm a killer
Yea ya boy smooth like Ice Vanilla

Did you get the way I mo-mo-move
Let me know what you-what you wanna do do do
Gonna head and tell ya whole crew-crew-crew
And then we can decide who's better than who

Usually I ain't the one ta brag
I do my 2-step and it takes care all of that
Normally I ain't the one for talking trash
But the music won't let me hold it back

[Chorus]
But guess what you ain't got nothing on me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me
Uh-uh you ain't got nothing on me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me
Open up yo eyes and you'll see
See the way I be moving my feet
That's the way its always gone be
You ain't never had nothing in me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me, on me [x6]
Yeah you ain't got nothing on me [x5]
Nah you ain't got nothing on me

You can't touch this like hammer
I can back it up so it don't matter
My style you can get enough of
Cause I do it my way usher!

Did you get the way I mo-mo-move
Let me know what you-what you wanna do do do
Gonna head and tell ya whole crew-crew-crew
And then we can decide who's better than who

Usually I ain't the one ta brag
I do my 2-step and it takes care all of that
Normally I ain't the one for talking trash
But the music won't let me hold it back

[Chorus]
But guess what you ain't got nothing on me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me
Uh-uh you ain't got nothing on me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me
Open up yo eyes and you'll see
See the way I be moving my feet
That's the way its always gone be
You ain't never had nothing in me

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard
But you'll never be on my level that's my word
That's my word
If you know about me
You better ask somebody
Or you'll find out the hard way
Left left turn around pick it up...slide
Down back up kick okay to the right
What's wrong can't keep up
Then you should've said nothing all night
But you still got time (got time)
Cause tonight ain't done (ain't done)
By the time its over, I bet you be saying I'm the one

[Chorus]
But guess what you ain't got nothing on me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me
Uh-uh you ain't got nothing on me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me
Open up yo eyes and you'll see
See the way I be moving my feet
That's the way its always gone be
You ain't never had nothing in me
Nah you ain't got nothing on me, on me [x6]
Yeah you ain't got nothing on me [x5]
Nah you ain't got nothing on me---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Arzu.
