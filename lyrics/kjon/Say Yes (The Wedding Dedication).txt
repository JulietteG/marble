What you doin Baby.Come here for a minute, I got something to show you
Why you crying Baby, Naw girl Im serious, and I know youve been waitin a long time.
(Just Say Yes, Just Say Yes) But now I think Im ready, (Say Yes) 

Weve been knowin each other for a minute, counting every second Baby (my Baby)
Girl just be patient we aint finish 
Time with you is treasured everyday (everyday) 
We been through some ups and downs (up and downs)
Weve been struggling, girl even now (even now)
Still we make it work, (we make it work) for better or worse (better or worse)
Baby thats the reason we deserve one another

I know youve been waitin for me to pop the question
And Baby Im hopin you say yes
And if you would be my wife itll be the second greatest blessing
Cause the first one is raising our kids
You are my everything; God must have seen my path
Because he sent you, the only thing left to do
Is hold on tight, get ready for the ride
Girl I wanna be in love with you the rest of my life

I know you been waitin Baby (waitin Baby) and oooh Im goin crazy (goin crazy)
I really want to be the one; I want to be the one you count on
So Baby lets celebrate (celebrate yeah) every year on a special day (its your day)
So what are we waitin for (what are we waitin for), so much in store (so much in store)
Ive never been so sure

I know youve been waitin for me to pop the question
And Baby Im hopin you say yes
And if you would be my wife itll be the second greatest blessing
Cause the first one is raising our kids
You are my everything; God must have seen my path
Because he sent you, the only thing left to do
Is hold on tight, get ready for the ride
Girl I wanna be in love with you the rest of my life

Oh Baby.Oh, if you would be my wife (be my wife)
I will be your lover too, the rest of my life yeah
If you will spend your life with me (life with me)
I will give my love unconditionally
Cause I love you Baby aint ashamed to say that
Asking you now, dont you keep me waitin
Say Yes Baby, Say Yes Baby
Down on my knees, asking you finally

I know youve been waitin for me to pop the question
And Baby Im hopin you say yes
And if you would be my wife itll be the second greatest blessing
Cause the first one is raising our kids
You are my everything; God must have seen my path
Because he sent you, the only thing left to do
Is hold on tight, get ready for the ride
Girl I wanna be in love with you the rest of my life
