You take away 
All that I lived for so long 
But if you would, just wait 
Maybe it won't be that much longer

(Chorus)
It's just your feelings 
You're gonna shut up and let me speak 
I'll let you know what you are 
If all you're needing Is a chance to be like me 
It lets you find what you are

I think I'm going to need a change 
Let's take a time out 
You changed your face 
Into a person I don't know 
But if you would just stay 
Maybe it won't take that much longer

(Chorus) 
It's just your feelings 
You're gonna shut up and let me speak 
I'll let you know what you are 
If all you're needing 
Is a chance to be like me 
It lets you find what you are
What you are

Its just your feelings 
You're gonna shut up and let me speak 
I'll let you know what you are 
It's just your feelings 
You're gonna shut up and let me speak 
I'll let you know what you are 
If all you're needing 
Is a chance to be like me 
It lets you find what you are
What you are...---Lyrics submitted by Samm Pettitt.
