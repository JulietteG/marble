Think of a way
Play me a fool
See you somewhere in the future, baby
I told you I was
Stronger than you
Too strong to love, just throw me out...

I'm walking up to the room
Maybe for the last time
Maybe there I'll see your eyes

Everlasting
Ever trying
Because you're another girl I don't know too well
Give up on everything
Give up and dry your eyes
Making your move
Setting a trap
Set me on fire

I'm walking up to the room
Maybe for the last time
Maybe there I'll see your eyes
Walking up to the room
Maybe for the last time
Babe it ain't no big surprise

I'm walking up to the room
Maybe for the last time
Maybe there I'll see inside
Walking up to the room
Maybe for the last time
Babe it ain't no big surprise...---
