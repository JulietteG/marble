Coming up to better yourself
I was always with you
Only looking for another respite
Gave away what suits you
I was lost but you were within
Came up when I needed you
Don't be worried that you're losing it
The more you got they'll give you

Summer was a day
Things were looking up
It never felt so good and
You weren't looking for it
Summer was a day
So much further now
You're gonna wait til fall to go home

Love goes weak when you won't escape
Lies and broken faces
What a difference another day makes
You ever ask the questions

Summer was a day
Things were looking up
It never felt so good and
You weren't looking for it
Summer was a day
So much further now
I couldn't be the one to warm your heart

Oh-oh-oh...
I couldn't be the one
Oh-oh-oh...
Couldn't be the one
Oh-oh-oh...
I couldn't be the one...---
