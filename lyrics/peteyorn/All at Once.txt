Every now and then I get like this
And it isn't hard to see
But the old man in the kitchen
I think he's part of me
Don't say nothing bout the old house
Cause I burned it to the ground
And when the darkness comes, I lie awake
Playing lost and found

All at once
There's no more hiding
And all he wants
Is to show us how he feels

They're all liars in the back room
Watch them all go down
They can tell what you want to hear
But they will never stick around
So don't say nothing bout the old house
Cause I burned it to the ground
And when the darkness come I'll lie and wait
Still playing lost and found

All at once
I break my silence
All at once
There's no more hiding
And all he wants is to show us how he feels

When he comes around
Do not tell him nothing
Do not make a sound
Cause if he know we're there
He might tear his heart out
And beat us to death with it
I was too young to understand---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
