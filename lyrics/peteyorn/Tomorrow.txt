I can take you anywhere
I just want to get to know you
I can take you anywhere
I just want to get to know you
Hand on your heart
Wind the clock
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow is another day...

There's so much of this world I never see
In front of me
Far too much of this world we've never been
Forgive me

I can take you anywhere
I just wanna get to know you
I can take you anywhere
I just wanna get to love you
Hand on your heart
Tomorrow is another day
Hand on your hope
Tomorrow we will, tomorrow we will get away...

I just wanna get to know you
I just wanna hear you say...
I just wanna get to love you
I just wanna get away

Hand on your heart
Tomorrow is another day
Hand on your hope
Tomorrow we will, tomorrow we...
Hand on your heart
Tomorrow is another day
Hand on your hope
Tomorrow we will, tomorrow we will get away...

Tomorrow is another day---
