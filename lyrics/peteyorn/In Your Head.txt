In your head, in your head, in your head
It's your head, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
In your head, it's like a desperate song
Telling you everything that ya fear can ever go wrong
And I don't wanna try
You convince yourself
No I don't wanna try
I give up too much of myself
Give up too much of yourself

In your head, in your head...
I watch you, from the left side of the bed
So beautiful in the morning

In your head, in your head
In your head, in your head, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
In your heart at twilight
It's just just a desolate stone
Can't see anything forward
It's like you've already lost
And I don't wanna try
You convince yourself
No I don't wanna try
You give up too much of yourself
You give up too much of yourself...
In your head, in your head...
I watch you, from the left side of the bed
So beautiful in the morning...---
