Terrorize the ones you love the most
Take a while to get back from your ghost
It's a miracle you ever left that home
Got something for nothing
Yeah you want to be alone

I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting
I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting

Reconciled to live here on your own
You hear everyone talkin' 'bout the cold
It's a miracle you ever went back home
Don't take it for granted
Yeah you want to be alone

I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting
I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting
I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting

Terrified to get out on your own
You were into being here and now you're not
Oh it's a miracle you never left that home

I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting
I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting
I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waving
I know you're waiting for me
Seen you at the bus stop waiting, at the bus stop waiting---
