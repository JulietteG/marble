Tell me why you're always running off the track
You never move forward when you're looking back
You fall in and out of love with yourself
Makes you wanna crawl back into your shell

And this fire
This fire's burned out
I can't blame myself
If you're walking out

Killing yourself in slow motion
Waving from the bottom of the ocean
I'll swim back to land just let me in
Tell me can we ever begin again?

And this fire
This fire's burned out
I can't blame myself
If you're walking out

Staring at the cold white walls
Waiting on a slow dissolve
Don't know how to carry on
Knowing that moment has gone

Maybe for once in your life
Maybe for once in your life...

Tell me why you're always running off the track
You never move forward when you're looking back

And this fire
And this fire's burned out
I can't blame myself
If you're walking out

Staring at the cold white walls
Waiting on a slow dissolve
Don't know how to carry on
Knowing that moment is gone
And this fire's burned out
I can't blame myself
If you're walking out
This fire
This fire's burned out
End this fire... ---
