Oh I can't stand what I'm seeing
And I can't get away from this feeling
And I've been screamin' at the top of my lungs
Screamin' at the setting sun

Oh and I can't stand what you're sharing
And I don't really care what you're wearing
I've been screaming at the top of my lungs
Screamin' at a setting sun
I've been screamin' at the top of my lungs
Screaming at a setting sun

If it's a holiday
It goes on for days
It gets hard to say
What you believe in
And you'll be screaming at the setting sun alright

Oh I can't stand what I'm seeing
And I can't get away from this feeling
And I've been screaming at the top of my lungs
Screamin' at a setting sun
Oh I've been screamin' at the top of my lungs
Screamin' at a setting sun

It's a holiday
It goes on for days
It gets hard to say what you believe in
It's a holiday
Goes on for days
It gets hard to say that you were leaving
You'll be screaming at the top of your lungs

Screaming at the top of your lungs
Screaming at the setting sun
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Screaming at a setting sun
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Screaming at a setting sun---
