When sometimes I go out, by myself
And I look across the water.
And I think of all the things, 
What you're doing, 
And in my head I paint a picture.
Since I've come home,
Well my body's been a mess, 
And I miss your tender hair, 
And the way you like to dress.
Oh won't you come on over, 
Stop making a fool out of me, 
Why dont you come on over, Valerie, 
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house out up for sale? 
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didnt catch a tan, 
I hope you find the right man, 
Who'll fix it for you?
Are you shopping anywhere? 
Change the colour of your hair, 
And are you busy?
Did you have to pay that fine?
That you were dodging all the time? 
Are you still dizzy?

Well since I've come home,
Well my body's been a mess,
And I miss your tender hair, 
And the way you like to dress.
Oh wont you come on over, 
Stop making a fool Out Of Me, 
Oh why don't you come on over, Valerie.
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

When sometimes I go out, by myself,
Ad I look across the water.
And I think of all the things,
What you're doing, 
And in my head I paint a picture.

Since I've come home,
Well my body's been a mess,
And I miss your tender hair, 
And the way you like to dress. 
Oh won't you come on over, 
Stop making a fool out of me, 
Why dont you come on over, Valerie, 
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Why Don't You Come On Over, Valerie.---Lyrics submitted by Carolina.
