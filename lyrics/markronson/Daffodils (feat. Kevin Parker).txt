All you think is down and gone
All of that out of the blue, baby
Make that thing go higher
Stop the beacon dragon bail
Step out on the patio
Follow away your daddio rhythm

Also when I shadow that
Call until they're coming in morning
Hit that driver if now
Life in as the breathe out easy
Drop another daffodil
Make her push up through until morning
Drop another daffodil
Say you love the man until morning

Maybe this ain't not a sin
But it's got to keep in storing
Sweep again wide eyes pressing on deny this on and
Drop another daffodil
Make her push up through until morning
Drop another daffodil
Say you love the man until morning

Put another record on
Leave the shotgun on rock it
Got your body fall out
Get up all your gone cracking
For one day I saw the list
A little bit of sex means nothing

Drop another daffodil
Make her push up through until morning
Drop another daffodil
Say you love the man until morning ---
