How does the brain,
Connect to the body?
How does it wake from a dream?

Go book another show,
I don't want to know what's happening.

I'm not here with you,
I see your lips are moving too,
And they can talk and talk,
I think we might be having a blast,
Presently I'm gone,
Somewhere on a long celestial sleepwalk.

How do you make,
A life out of nothing?
And make nothing out of your life?

Blink.
I don't want to wink.
I just want to take siestas all day.

I say stop the war,
I'm glad I still wanna have my car,
So I can drink and drive,
I can't believe I'm still alive,
Talking on the phone,
Asking if we had a good time last night.

How does the brain,
Connect to the body?
How does it wake from a dream?

And we will hurt nobody for the love of money,
We can find our way without so much pain.

Take me there,
Take me honey,
Let me love you again.---Lyrics submitted by JustACommenter.
