Cheer up
Tune it out
Take your mask off
Have a shot
Are you a sick kid or a trick
It's gonna mess you up

Gone missing
For a thrill
Kind of miss how it feels
Are you an angel or a flea
Get back
It's blinding

Kick it off
Shake the ground
Blow our brains up
Make it loud
You'll be so free
But not enough for me

Stop with that soft scene
That hip infection
Stop with that soft scene

Cheer up
Tune it out
Gone missing
Kind of miss how it feels
Are you an angel or a flea
Get back
Get back

Stop with that soft scene
That hip infection
Stop with that soft scene
We don't need you any more---
