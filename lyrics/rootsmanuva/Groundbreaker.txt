I am the Roots Manuva
I hit the ground
I broke the ground
I lost my rhyme
I pee all the time
I ate the burger
And the hot dog too
THEN I!

MADE A GROUNDBREAKER
Gave em' papercuts
Made em' eat my mustard
And my ugly squash
THEN I!

MADE A GROUNDBREAKER
Gave em' papercuts
Made em' eat my mustard
And my ugly squash
THEN I!

ATE A BIG BURRITO

AND ALL OF THEIR SQUASH

I broke the gound

Caused a groundbreakerererer---Lyrics submitted by hi people.
