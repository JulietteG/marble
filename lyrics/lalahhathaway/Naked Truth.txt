[verse1]under my skin I feel it reach in my soul I can't resist my safe illusion of control its my only fade in you already know the dance we're dancin you danced before a matter of time before I let go we come together each time a surprise I know it was written when I look in your eye [chours] it's just the naked truth truely alive when i'm with you it's the naked truth you change all I thought a knew and you are live through you the walls give in the times to spend and as we climb to high to you heyyy yeah in the naked truth yeah[verse2] in energy the currentcy closer space between you and me without a touch of cinder burnin within burdens to spread before it begins with every breath I ponder what you to sayyy whatever is broken to get in my head im grown gettin down  and I love the feelingkilling me uh its takin me down [chorus]  n na na na na na na na na na na na na---Lyrics submitted by tena.
