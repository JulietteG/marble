Smile, I like your smile
Your eyes they smile
I like your smile
(You know I like your smile)
oh babe

Nothing makes me happy like you do
Fresh air that flows right you
You sooth
This tired old soul
It's a blessing that I sing
It's gold 
It's in your smile
When sitting here in front of me
You have a certain personality
And if I wait a wile
I know I'm gonna love with your smile

I like your smile
Your eyes they smile
I like your smile
Yes, I do

It makes me want to pull out a book
And read your poems about your looks
Send roses to your address
I must confess there's nothing but your eyes
Right here and now I make a plan
To look into your heart and hands
Just to get you in view
All because I need your smile


Nothing makes me happy like you do
Fresh air that flows right through
You sooth
This tired old soul
It's a blessing that I sing
It's gold

It's in your smile
When sitting here in front of me, yeah
You have a certain personality
Just to get you in view
I know I'm gonna love with your smile

I like your smile
Your eyes they smile
I like your smile, oh baby
Your eyes 
I like your eyes 
Your eyes they smile

I like your eyes
Your smile, baby

I like your smile 
Your eyes they smile, oh yeah

I like your smile
Yes, I do

Nothin' makes me happy like you do---Lyrics submitted by Lina.
