I didn't crumble cause you went away
I kept on living for myself
I stumbled but I just wouldn't fall
Then through desperation, i hid my frustration
Deep inside
But I've lied

Although i smile, I'm not over you
Hard as I try, I just can't face the fact that we're through
I'll smile, but I'm not over you

(said i do, wish I knew...What to do)

Thought that I would remain unchanged
But how was my heart to know
I'm different and your love is to blame
I know I just won't be the same
Deep inside
Guess I've lied

Baby
I'll smile, but I'm not over you
Hard as I try, I just can't face the fact that we're through
I'll smile, but I'm not over you

(can't get over you)

Noooo
Can't get over you
Noooo

Thought that I would remain unchanged
Budget how was my heart to know (how was my heart to know)
I'm different and your love is to blame
I know I just won't be the same
Deep inside
Yes, I've lied

Baby
I'll smile, but I'm not over you
Hard as I try, I just can't face the fact that we're through
I'll smile, but I'm not over you

I can't let go, no no no no
Hard as I try
I just can't seem to get over you no no no
I've tried and tried and tried
No matter what I do---Lyrics submitted by love eternal.
