Never dreamed that it would be like this
Never knew that I could ever miss
Ive been thinkin bout the way it was
How we used to share each others love

I can feel you callin out to me
I can sense the love you really need
Dont know how we got to be this way
But I do know somethings got to change.

I wanna be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me.
Im gonna be by your side day and night
Thru the rest of my life
So open your heart for me
Im coming back for you.

Im coming back just to give you my love
Theres a part of me that lives in you
Im coming back just to give you my love
Loving yous the best thing I can do.

Was a time when lovin used to be
All the subtleness of you and me
Now with every passing day I find
It was a fools mistake to run and hide

I can feel you in the air I breathe
Youre the center of each thought I think
Now theres only one thing left to do
And thats to find my way back to you.

I wanna be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me.
Im gonna be by your side day and night
Thru the rest of my life
So open your heart for me
Im coming back for you.

Im coming back just to give you my love
Theres a part of me that lives in you
Im coming back just to give you my love
Loving yous the best thing I can do.

Im coming back just to give you my love
Theres a part of me that lives in you
Im coming back just to give you my love
Loving yous the best thing I can do.---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
