Im outta time and all I got is 4 minutes (8x)
Come on yeah
Break down come on

Madonna
Come on boy
Ive been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll

Justin Timberlake
Well dont waste time
Give me a sign
Tell me how you wanna roll

Madonna
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
Theres enough room for both

Justin Timberlake
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where its at
Are you ready to go
(Are you ready to go)

Both
If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and imma give you what you want

Both
Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got 4 minutes, 4 minutes

Both
Keep it up, keep it up, dont be a pri, hey

You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Thats right, keep it up, keep it up, dont be a pri, hey

Sometimes I think what I need is a you intervention, yeah

Justin Timberlake
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that its good, by the way that you move, ooh, hey

The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah

Justin Timberlake
But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how bout you?

Both
If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
