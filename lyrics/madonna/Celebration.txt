Come join the party, yeah
Coz everybody just wont do
Lets get this started, yeah
Coz everybody wants to party with you

I think you wanna come over
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk or you sober
Think about it, doesnt matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it
I dont know what youre waiting for

Boy you got a reputation
Nut youre gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your marks

Step to the beat boy thats what its for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance tonight

Come join the party, yeah
Coz everybody just wont do
Lets get this started, yeah
Coz everybody wants to party with you

Feel my temperature rising
Theres too much heat Im gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher, get closer to the fire
I dont know what youre waiting for

Havent I seen you somewhere before
You look familiar
You wanna dance, yeah
I guess I just dont recognize you with your clothes on
What are you waiting for

Come join the party, yeah
Coz everybody just wont do
Lets get this started, yeah
Coz everybody wants to party with you---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
