As quiet as it is tonight 
Youd almost think you were saved 
Your eyes are full of surprises 
They cannot predict my fate 
Waiting underneath the stars 
Theres something you should know 
The angels they surround my heart 
Telling me to let you go 

I barely couldnt 
I barely couldnt recognize but Ive been hidin to it 
Who am I to criticize 
Somehow Ill get through it and you wont even realize 
Falling through your own disguise 

Its like over and over 
Youre pushing me right down to the floor 
I should just walk away 
Over and over I keep on coming back for more 
I play into your fantasy 
Now that its over 
You can't lie to me right through your smile 
I see behind your eyes 
Now Im sober 
No more intoxicating my mind 

Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
I do, I do 

You almost proved yourself this time 
That all the saints be praised 
You hide your sadness behind your smile 
And you keep your lost heartbreaks 
The steps that are just on the ledge 
Is much higher than it seems 
That Ive been on that ledge before 
You cant hide yourself from me 

I barely couldnt 
I barely couldnt recognize, I still play bad to it 
Who am I to criticize 
Somehow Ill get through it and you wont even realize 
Falling through your own disguise 

Its like over and over 
Youre pushin me right down to the floor 
I should just walk away 
Over and over I keep on coming back for more 
I play into your fantasy 
Now that its over 
You can't lie to me right through your smile 
I see behind your eyes 
Now Im sober 
No more intoxicating my mind 

Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
I do, I do 

Its like over and over 
Youre pushin me right down to the floor 
I should just walk away 
Over and over I keep on coming back for more 
I play into your fantasy 
Now that its over 
You can't lie to me right through your smile 
I see behind your eyes 
Now Im sober 
No more intoxicating my mind 

Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
Even the devil wouldnt recognize you, I do 
I do, I do 

Even the devil wouldnt recognize you---Lyrics submitted by Felicity.
