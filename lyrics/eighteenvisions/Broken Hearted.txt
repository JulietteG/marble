I need a beginning again
I want to feel how I used to feel
When everything was in the palm of my hand
And you were here with me

You know I just don't get it
You know I really don't get it at all
That you would leave so sudden well did you know
You would leave me all alone

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

Somedays I wonder where I would be
Cause I don't think it was wasted time
I always thought you'd be waiting for me
And now I'm facing the world alone

You know I just don't get it
You know I really don't get it at all
That you would leave so sudden well did you know
You would leave me all alone

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I wonder what you are doing today
I wonder if you could ever change
I wonder if you still think of me the way that I was
The way that it used to be

I need a beginning again
I need a beginning again
I need a beginning again

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I think we're falling apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

You left me here to be broken hearted
You left me here to be broken hearted---Lyrics submitted by Heloiza.
