(feat. John Paul White and Jason Isbell)

I ain't easy to love
Start to make me black and blue
But I feel a lot less broken
Every day I spend with you

Oh, you bring out the woman
That I never never who I was
Oh, please forgive me darling
When I ain't easy to love

I ain't easy to love
I get a little crazy sometime
Oh yes, you do
But you know it's time to pull me
Gently back across the line

Right beside me through the bad times
When anybody else would run
I thank the Lord for you each morning
'Cause I ain't easy to love

And you love me
Unconditionally
You forgive me of all my faults
That's the beauty of it all

You ain't easy to love
Oh, I ain't easy
That's what I'm gonna do
Crying

Oh, I spend my whole life running
Now I'm walking with you
For the worst, or for the pain
Through the gender and my church
Hand in hand, we'll walk forever
You ain't easy to love

Oh, please forgive me darling
I ain't easy to love---
