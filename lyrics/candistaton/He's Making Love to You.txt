When he takes you in his arms
And gently start to squeeze
Kisses you in your ear
And makes you wanna scream
Touches you where you're soft
And makes you climb the wall

He's making love to you
But he's thinking of me
ooo yes he is

When he rubs your curly hands
And comforts you where you like
Soothes you where you're sore
And kisses away the pain
Holds you when you shake
And you hear him call my name

He's making love to you
But he's thinking of me
ooo yes he is

When he squeezes your hand in his, oh baby
Feels you where you tender
And softly kisses your lips
And makes your soul surrender
When he soothes away your pain
Then he softly calls my name

He's making love to you
But he's thinking of me
ooo yes he is

But he's thinking of me
ooo yes he is
When he's holding you
He's thinking of me---Lyrics submitted by Michael Mayors.
