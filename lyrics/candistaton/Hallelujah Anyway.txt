Uhhhhhhhhuuuwhhh!

You have some problems,
You need got to solve hem.
You get down on your knees and pray
When is he coming through,
When will he answer you.
Well it may mot be right away.
But in the mean time,
Just keep your mind,
In a positive attitude.
And while you waiting,
Start praising,
He is gonna see you through,
Here is what you got to do.

(Praise him till your blessings come down
Praise him till your situation turns around
You gotta lift up your voice and say: hallelujah anyway! Hallelujah anyway.
