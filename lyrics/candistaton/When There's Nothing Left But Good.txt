When everything you ever worked for, Lord, it's gone in a second
When life throws you a curve, you can't bend, Oh yeah
When everyone has turned against you, all of your friends,
Your so-called friends forsake you
When there's nothing left but God, that's all you need

When all hell, hell breaks a loose
And it looks like there's no way to win
When everyone that you relying on, is now relying on you, Oh yeah
When destruction....Lord....is destroying
And the devil, the devil sends you through
When there's nothing left but God, child that's all you need, Oh yeah

He's the life that you live, He's the breath that he gives
He's the joy, that he brings
I want tell ya, he's your everything, hey, hey, hey
He's the peace that he gives
And that ain't all he's the healer, that he is
When there's nothing left but God, ...child
that's all you need....

you can't get too low
you can't be too down
He get down there with you, he'll pick up the pieces for you
my Lord you can start all over again
you got love and you got peace
that's all you need is Jesus --

He's the life that you live, He's the breath that he gives
He's the joy, that he brings
I want tell ya, he's your everything, hey, hey, hey
He's the peace that he gives
And that ain't all he's the healer, that he is
When there's nothing left but God, I want to tell you right now,
that's all you need...

When there's nothing left but God, that's all you need---Lyrics submitted by Margaret P.
