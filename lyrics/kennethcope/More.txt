More steady, more sure,
more trusted, more pure.
Some say it doesn't matter.

More trained, and more aware,
more aim to get me there.

I climbed this far.
You raised the bar.
You want my heart.

        CHORUS
More furious desire
to stand against the wind

More blazing fire
when targets closing in.


So there's more and more 
of me to give.

More words to learn and know,
more etched upon my soul.
Some say it doesn't matter.

More tried, more true.
Less me, and much more you.

I stretched this tall.
You sound the call.
You want my all

CHORUS 

You keep reaching out, calling out to me
for more strength, and shoulders to face the war with sin.

More wise and bolder,
to save the souls of men.
More faithful soldiers,
to the end.

You want more and more of me to give.
More and more of me to give.

More, more.

More and more of me to give.

More love, more light.
more purpose
more serve with all my might.

I need more hope, more faith,
more patience each day I pray for more.

More and more of me to givew.
More fire, more seal,
more spirit to no one's spill.
More courage, more joy.
More, more, and more of me to give.

More grateful, more true,
more humble to trust and do.

You call I hear.

I'll walk to path that's set in stone
my heart is fixed on getting home,
and no thing on Earth could ever matter more.

More and more of me to give.
More.---Lyrics submitted by sf.
