Making his home with the lonely,
spending his days with the poor,
bringing hope their hearts,
giving man a new start with his cure.

But not all would recieve of his offereing.
Some even planned his decease.
And yet he couldn't forsake
those whose lives he might save,
so he refused to leave.

Never a better hero.
Never a truer name.
Hoping to save us
by taking our pain in his hands.
Never a greater compassion.
Never a wasted day.
Not one regret,
true to the end, 
there was never a better way.

Now, he knew his life would be shortened,
but never murmured a word of complaint.
He had in mind a much greater design
and it helped him through the pain.

He gave man power to take him,
knowing his death would bring life.
And it was no surprise
there was love in his eyes
when he died.

Never a better hero.
Never a truer name.
Hoping to save us by taking our pain in his hands.
Never a greater compassion.
Never a wasted day.
Not one regret,
true to the end,
there was never a better way.

But death was not the end
for he would live again.

Never a better hero.
Never a truer name.
      Giving us all that he had.
Hoping to save us by taking our pain in his hands.
Never a greater compassion,
Never a wasted day.
     He showed the way.
Not one regret,
true to the end,
there was never a better way.

All that he did,
follow and live.
There'll be never a better way .---Lyrics submitted by Elaina.
