A purple sky to close the day,
I wade the surf where dolphins play.
The taste of salt, the dance of waves,
and my souls wells up with hallelujahs.

A lightning flash, my pounding heart,
a breaching whale, a shooting star 
give testimony that you are,
and my souls wells up with hallelujahs.


    Oh praise him all, his mighty works.
    There is no language where you can't be heard.
    Your song goes out to all the earth,
    Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujau.


Oh cratered moon and sparrow's wings,
oh thunder's boom and Saturn's rings, 
unveil our Savior as you sing,
and my souls wells up with hallelujahs.


    Oh praise him all, his mighty works.
    There is no language where you can't be heard.
    Your song goes out to all the earth,
    Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujau.


The pulse of life within my wrist,
a fallen snow, a rising mist,
there is no higher praise than this,
and my souls wells up,
oh my soul wells up,
yes my soul wells up with hallelujahs.


    Oh praise him all, his mighty works.
    There is no language where you can't be heard.
    Your song goes out to all the earth,
    Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujau.
   Oh Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujau.---Lyrics submitted by Elaina.
