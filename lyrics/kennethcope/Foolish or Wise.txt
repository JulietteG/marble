Ten virgins fair, waiting there
Closed doors left five behind
All had been called, but some unprepared
Foolish or wise

Two sisters serving the master's needs
One chose to heed her heart
She sat at his feet, and heard every word
The better part

Foolish or wise
Real or disguised
Every soul free to choose
Flesh or divine
Foolish or wise

The guilty came judging, accusing her
Their sins turned their hearts to stone
Go sin no more
His love implored
The stones fell un-thrown

Foolish or wise
Real or disguised
Every soul free to choose
Flesh or divine
Foolish or wise

Foolish or wise
Shadows or light
Every soul free to choose
Anguish or life
Foolish or wise---Lyrics submitted by Lizzy Wood.
