along the way you'll find a second wind
the song you play will let the day begin
so take advantage of the time you have
and learn to laugh
and what you sing

things are being stolen from the hourglass
things have been unwoven in the aftermath
foolishly you've chosen not to open up the other half

and if the wind should bring you back to me
call up and tell me what you'd rather be
and if the phone books have been banned
you'll have to send it telepathically

things are being stolen from the hourglass
things have been unwoven in the aftermath
foolishly you've chosen not to open up the other half

and when your ghost is haunting me 
(and i won't be afraid)
i will make the most of what you see
(and i won't be afraid)
won't let them overlook how much they took from me

don't look back
baby don't look back
it's catching up to you

and when your ghost is haunting me
i'll make the most of what you see
won't let them overlook
how much they took from me---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
