Morning comes  laughing through the crack above your window
And you know
Right about now
Everybody's shaking, there's some things that need-breaking
They can't wait until you wake up

[CHORUS:
Legs kicking, arms flapping, trying to fly
She's one inch from the floor with her head in the sky
She's got 
Legs kicking, arms flapping, trying to fly
She's one inch from the floor with her head in the sky

She said:
Hey Gravity, you are my enemy
Hey Gravity, you aren't a part of me (Or: You want a part of me?)
Hey Gravity, you are my enemy
I don't, I don't need you]

All the birds are singing in the trees and in the sky
Shoot them down
Heaven and you
The stupid little pigeons with those stupid little legs, they must all die
Right about now

[CHORUS]---Lyrics submitted by Maggie S.
