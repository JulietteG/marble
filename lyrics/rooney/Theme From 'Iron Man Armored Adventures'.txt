He is, a man, on a mission
In armor of high tech ammunition
Trapped on the edge of an endless game
His teenage life will never be the same
In the dangerous world he does all he can
He's IRON MAN!
Iron Man

The heart, of his powers, within him
No force will make him give in
When he's backed into the corner of uncertainty
He takes the heat to the next degree
He's more than a hero, believe what you see
He's IRON MAN!
Iron Man
(Guitar Solo)
He's IRON MAN!
Iron Man
IRON MAN!---Lyrics submitted by thiago.
