It's like freedom, making some people jealous.
It's like a rope between you n' your fellows.
It's like a web, you're stuck. How could it be so that
some people don't always know how they feel?

When you can talk to somebody who you can trust.
When you can lie to that somebody when you must.
It's like health, respect, because you still got one.
It is the way that I feel, I'm not the only one.---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
