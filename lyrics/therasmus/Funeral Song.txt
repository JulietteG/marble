I dumped you again
I don't understand
It's happend before
Can't take it no more

These foolish games 
Always end up in confusion
I'll take you back
Just to leave you once again

I died in my dreams 
What's that supposed to  mean?
Got lost in the fire

I died in my dreams
Reaching out for your hand
My fatal desire

I failed you again
'Cause I let you stay
I used to pretend
That I felt OK

Just one big lie
Such a perfect illusion
Just to hurt you once again

I died in my dreams
What's that supposed to mean?
Got lost in the fire

I died in my dreams
Reaching out for your hand
My fatal desire---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
