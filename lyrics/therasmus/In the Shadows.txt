No sleep, no sleep until Im done with finding the answer
Wont stop, wont stop before I find the cure for the this cancer
And sometimes I feel like going down and so disconnected
But somehow I know that I am haunted to be wanted

Chorus
Ive been watching, Ive been waiting in the shadows for my time
Ive been searching, Ive been living for tomorrows all my life

In the shadows
In the shadows

They say that I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I, Id rather kill myself than turn into their slave
And sometimes I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Cause somehow I just dont wanna stay and wait for a wonder

Chorus

Lately Ive been walking, walking in circles, watching, waiting for something
Feel me, touch me, heal me, come take me higher

Chorus

Ive been watching, Ive been waiting
Ive been searching, Ive been living for tomorrows

In the shadows
In the shadows

Ive been watching---Lyrics submitted by Leandro.
