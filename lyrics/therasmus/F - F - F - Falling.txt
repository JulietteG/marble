I don't go to school every monday
I've got my reason to sleep
Don't you tell me how I should be
I made up my mind 'bout the music
I made up my mind 'bout the style
I know that I'm stable and able to settle down
But I keep

F-f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-falling

This life is so full of temptation
And I want to keep it that way
I know myself I can handle the game
Made up my mind 'bout the future
Made up my mind 'bout the past
I know that I'm stable and able to hold on

F-f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-falling

(falling)
I need a flame I need a spark
(falling)
Don't be afraid to open my heart
(falling)
I need a game I need a shock
(falling)
Don't be afraid my heart is unlocked

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh woh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh woh yeah yeah yeah

f-f-f-Falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-falling

(falling)
I need a flame I need a spark
(falling)
Don't be afraid to open my heart
(falling)
I need a game I need a shock
(falling)
Don't be afraid my heart is unlocked
(falling)
Made up my mind 'bout the music
(falling)
Made up my mind 'bout the style
(falling)
I know that I'm stable and able
(falling)
To settle down
F-f-falling
