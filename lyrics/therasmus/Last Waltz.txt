Make me blind
Cover my eyes 
You can do what you want
I'm paralyzed by the perfect mood
When we're dancing with blindfolds on

You make it easy to love you and hate you
I can't explain it, I feel insecure
Say it simple: "You die just to live again."
You say we're waiting for the last waltz

Another you and me 
Another revolutionary heavenly romance 
Waiting for the last waltz

And so it seems 
We don't find the solution
Confusion leads the dance 
We're waiting on the last waltz

Praise the wine
So divine
And it stings like a rose

Allow the night to flow inside 
Open the window and let the wind blow
Highlight of the night is the unhappy ending

You keep refusing to answer my calls
Drop the bending and stop the pretending
You say get ready for the last waltz

Another you and me 
Another revolutionary heavenly romance 
Waiting for the last waltz

And so it seems 
We don't find the solution
Confusion leads the dance 
We're waiting on the last waltz

Ohh you and me 
Another revolutionary heavenly romance 
Waiting for the last waltz

And so it seems 
We don't find the solution
Confusion leads the dance 
We're waiting on the last waltz---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
