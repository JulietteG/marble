Wake up, the world is yours
Get lost, find a new course
I'm gone, it's easier to close the door
I thought I loved it but my heart can't take no more

Stand up, blindfold your eyes
You'll see, you'll be suprised
For too long I've been the same
Time to explore
I thought I loved it but my heart can't take no more

I'm on the road that leads me nowhere
Shattered but I don't care
I know the truth awaits me out there
Don't try to reach I've gone somewhere
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Too late, my time is up
And I know, you'll never stop
Always
Until the end
You'll be my friend

I must admit it but my heart can't take no
I can't deny it and I cannot fake no...
I'm sick and tired and I just can't wait no more, no more

I'm on the road that leads me nowhere
Shattered but I don't care
I know the storm awaits me out there
Don't try to reach I've gone somewhere
(Yeah x16)

I know it's gonna change
(Yeah)
I know it's gonna change
(Yeah)

Oooh
I'm on the road that leads me nowhere
Shattered but I don't care
I know the storm awaits me out there
Don't try to reach I've gone somewhere
Oooh---Lyrics submitted by Aida.
