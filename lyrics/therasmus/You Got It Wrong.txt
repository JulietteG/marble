When you found me on the street
Did you think you rescued me
Bet you thought without you I would die
Like a snake you swallowed me
I took it till I couldnt breathe
Just to bring your fantasies to life
You count on the faithful
To get your way
And to follow your light 

You got it wrong now
Cause I dont give a 
Im not your believer
You got it wrong so
I guess youre out of luck
Your dream just lost a dreamer 

You fool me with your mystery
Preaching peace and charity
But I see through your vanity and lies
You think you got the best of me
But I will rewrite history
Ill take back my life to your surprise
If I could make it as painful
As you did for me
Id be just wasting my time 

You got it wrong now
Cause I dont give a 
Im not your believer
You got it wrong so
I guess youre out of luck
Your dream just lost a dreamer

There's a little part of me
That would like to see you cry
Even if its just one tear
I know it would never dry 

You got it wrong now
Cause I dont give a 
Im not your believer
You got it wrong so
I guess youre out of luck
Your dream just lost a dreamer---Lyrics submitted by Buddha.
