Tomorrow's taking me away from you
Like a jealous lover
Kiss me one last time
Before I go down this broken road I follow
You will leave me torn and sting me like
A thorn from a dying rose
The saddest scent of you will cling to me
I know

I will run to you
When my journey is over
Wait for me
Keep our love alive
I will dream of you
'till I reach the sun
Then I'll turn around and run to you

If I stay with you and linger here
Another moment
I will fade into the scenery
You wouldn't even see me
I've got nothing left to offer you
It's not that I don't care
All I ask is that you think of me
I swear

I will run to you
When my journey is over
Wait for me
Keep our love alive
I will dream of you
'till I reach the sun
Then I'll turn around and run to you

I hate to see you cry
The way you look away
Makes me wanna die

Run to you
Wait for me
Keep our love alive
I will dream of you
'till I reach the sun
Then I'll turn around and run to you---Lyrics submitted by Buddha.
