That grows inside of me silently
And you could be my blood
And be a part of me secretly

I've lost a war
I've lost a fight
I've killed a man
Wasted a life

Open my eyes, let me see you
And blow this blinding darkness away
Open my eyes, let me find you
Give me a sign

Hate is like a ghost
That lives inside of me, I plead
For you to be my guide
To be a feeder of my need

I've lost a war
I've lost a fight
I've killed a man
Wasted a life

Open my eyes, let me see you
And blow this blinding darkness away
Open my eyes, let me find you
Give me a sign

Take the world and fold me in
Free the soul behind the sin
The endless dark will be the death of my senses

Take my love and hold it in
Kill the beast under my skin
The endless dark will be the death of my senses

(Open my eyes...)
Open my eyes, let me see you
And blow this blinding darkness away
Open my eyes...
Open my eyes, let me see you
And blow this blinding darkness away
Open my eyes
Give me a sign---Lyrics submitted by Isaiah.
