Since you've been gone 
I've been alone
Feeling untied and free
No more cry on the phone
No more slavery

And of the misery
I'm breaking free
Since you've been gone 
things have come so clear to me 
Just want to shout 
cause I'm able to breathe
Ohhh...
Since you've been gone
I've been free

Since we crashed and fell apart
We've been history
Since we trashed this dying love
No more agony

(Since you've been gone
things have come so clear to me)
(Just want to shout 
Cause I'm able to breathe)

And of the misery
I'm breaking free
Since you've been gone 
things have come so clear to me 
Just want to shout 
cause I'm able to breathe
Ohhh...
Since you've been gone
I've been free

Since you've been gone
I've been
I've been free

Ohhh.... 
Things have come clear to me

Since you've been gone---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
