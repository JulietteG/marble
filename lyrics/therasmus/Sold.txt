There you come again, I see you're having your everlasting smile on your
face, like now n' then.
I cannot hide, I cannot fight, I cannot go, you know, you know, you
know,
hey, do you know
that you do not have to entertain anybody, that you do not have to
entertain my cat,
if you don't want that, yeah.
It seems that you don't know that you're twisted by your nature n'
that's the reason
I hate ya.

I'm gone, I can't stay another day.
Roll my mind, hold my hands up in the air.

So here it comes now - a couple of hard words, yah, yah, I know this
hurts but I'm so, so happy.
'cos you, oh yes, yes, you do really deserve this. Shed a tear when you
want me to stop.
So many times you have made people cry. So many lies, why I'm asking.
I'm the one who will say, hey get out of my way, because you're twisted.
Oh yes you are.---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
