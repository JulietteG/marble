Ever, every day
Ever, every way
Rich Man (whispered)

There's bin a lot of talk
There's bin a lot of fighting
I Had the street to learn
There's been a lot of fake
Umm... been a lot of lying
I know I had my turn

Every day in every way
Not ashamed to say that
I'm a rich man
Rich Man (whispered)

I don't try to take the future
only small things can be planned
I'd better find the right way
on a proper day and take a 
chance on happiness

Every day in every way
Not ashamed to say that
I'm a rich man

Every Day in every way
I'm really not ashamed to say
I'm a rich man

Every day in every way
I'm not ashamed to say 
That I'm a rich man

We simply got to live together
and let the child in us wake up
and return
If you believe in love
There's one thing left
One thing left for sure
You gotta let it show
Don't let go
And give it all you can

Ever, every day
Ever, every way
Oer Rich Man

Ever, every day
Ever, every way
Oer Rich Man

Rich Man Oh

Rich man---Lyrics submitted by Rod Holland.
