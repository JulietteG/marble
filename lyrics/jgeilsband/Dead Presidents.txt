A little bit of Lincoln can't park the car
 Washington he can't go too far
 Jefferson is good, to play at the track
 You think you're gonna bring them big fish back

Them dead presidents
 Them dead presidents
 Now I ain't broke but I'm badly  bent
 Everybody loves them dead presidents

Hamilton on a ten baby gonna get you straight
 But Jackson on a twenty is really great
 And if you're talkin' about a poor man's friend
 Grant will get you out of whatever you're in

Them dead presidents
 Them dead presidents
 I ain't broke,  I'm badly bent
 Everybody lovin them dead presidents

A hundred dollar Franklin man, is really sweet
 A five hundred McKinley is the one for me
 If I get a Cleveland, I'm really set
 A thousand dollar Cleveland is hard to get

Them dead presidents
 Them dead presidents
Now I ain't broke,  but  badly bent
 Everybody lovin them dead presidents
Them dead presidents
Them dead presidents
Them dead presidents
Them dead presidents
I ain't broke but  badly bent
Everybody lovin them dead presidents---Lyrics submitted by glenn six.
