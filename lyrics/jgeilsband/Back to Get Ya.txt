Think I found something thats gonna wreck my mind
Keep it close to me baby get all the time
Looked so good when I first met ya
Hold it babe Ill be back to get ya, oohh yeah

Aint gonna waste anytime with you
Hot and ready, gonna come on through
Aint gonna hang around your door
Gonna pound it down, gonna get some more

Rip them wires right off your phone
Got to make sure were all alone
Roll me over til I turn blue
Rockin and rollin til way past two.

Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then Id be back to get ya
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then Id be back to get ya

Get my ?
Scramble my eggs honey, come on
Its comin honey there it is

Throw your lovin in my face
You know Ill take you any ol place
Take it easy got all the time
Gotta buzz on me baby and Im feelin fine
Dont get shy or play polite, Ha
Just shut your mouth and turn off the light
Been alone and I been blue
Cmon baby want to rock with you

Makin a mess all over the floor
Keep it going til I get sore
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then Id be back to get ya and here I am honey
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then Id be back to get ya---Lyrics submitted by Mikel Pollard.
