You've been caught in a storm
you've been battered and torn
your survival will mean your revival
and when I saw your flag
it was only just a rag
and the boat that you were sailing on was leaving

It's a cold bitter tide
that has stolen your pride
you're the daughter of violent water
and when I took your hand
you're a thousand miles from land
and the world that you'd been living in was sinking

Oh come, you've been down so long
this current pulls so strong
this life that you've been leading
oh please, take this love from me
(it's) stronger than the sea
this love that you've been needing
have I reached your heart in time to stop the bleeding?

Time has led you away
from the bright side of day
if you follow, your life will be hollow
say goodbye to the sea
share this love inside of me
and the warmth that it will bring will last forever

Oh come, you've been down so long
this current pulls so strong
this life that you've been leading
oh please, take this love from me
(it's) stronger than the sea
this love that you've been needing
have I reached your heart in time to stop the bleeding
have I reached your heart in time to stop the bleeding?---Lyrics submitted by Gavin Dillard.
