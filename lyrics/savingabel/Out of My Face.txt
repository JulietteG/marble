I'm the man you want of me
and I'm not the same I used to be
I think for myself for now
I don't need you in my ear

I'd love to hit you in the face
well I've loved though you've gone away
well I don't wanna to see you again
I hope you can understand me

Get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head
and give me back my piece of mind
I dont understand why you think you can do the things you can

So get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head
and give me back my piece of mind
my piece of mind

your so mad cause your losing control
you don't know which is save to go

everything is so fake
I don't know what else to say
Just say somehow someday
someway you'll fade
believe me

Get of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head
and give me back my piece of mind
I don't understand why you think you can do the things you can

so get out of my face
get of my sight
get out of my head
and give me back my piece of mind
and bring me back my piece of mind

Get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head 
and give me back my piece of mind
I don't understand why you think you can do the things you can
