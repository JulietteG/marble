You know all my deepest secrets,
I think you know, you know to keep them,
But I wonder if you know, that I hate sleeping alone.

So come and tell me what my kiss tastes like
Don't wanna miss it so turn off the lights.
But I wonder if you know, I hate sleeping alone.

I have to fake it, I'd leave if I could
I'm not in love but the sex is good!
You can't mistake it, cause it's understood.
I'm not in love but the sex is good!

You got to know, know my weakness
You always touch in all the right places
We don't get along that well
Not much for talk but you're hot as hell!

I have to fake it, I'd leave if I could
I'm not in love but the sex is good!
You can't mistake it, cause it's understood.
I'm not in love but the sex is good.

It's not like I don't wanna stick around
It's just tonight I'm gonna lay you down

So now ya know what my kiss tastes like
So in the morning I'll say goodbye
But I wonder if you know, I hate sleeping alone.

I have to fake it, I'd leave if I could
I'm not in love but the sex is good!
You can't mistake it, cause it's understood.
I'm not in love but the sex is good.

I have to fake it, I'd leave if I could
I'm not in love but the sex is good!
You can't mistake it, cause it's understood.
I'm not in love but the sex is good.---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
