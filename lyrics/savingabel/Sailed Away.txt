Does it hurt to hear me say
That I never really meant to stay
I left you right where I want you
Now there's nothin' left
And not a reason
There's nothin' left to believe in
When just one remains
I've sailed away

Such a foolish game
That we have been playin'
Now you got me right where you want me
I left you in the right
But you wouldn't let me take the fall
Now you've got me right where you want me

Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all just the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
I've sailed away

I found out on my own
Everything that I've been missin'
Now I've got you right where I want you
Now that we're apart
I see just who you are
You're always gonna be
The one to keep hatin'
Now I've got you right where I want you

Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all just the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
I've sailed away

I'm not one to hide my face behind the pain
It's not like me to beg you to stay
I'll just sail away

Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
You know I've sailed away

And when just one remains
You know I've sailed away

Does it hurt to hear me say
That I never really meant to stay---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
