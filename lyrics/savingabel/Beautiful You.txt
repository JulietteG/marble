I'm in free fall,
Straight up out of control
Full of words of wisdom
Seein double vision,
From a dead on head on
Crash course in collision
A sucker for a kind word
From every voice i've heard
This is my laso for you

There you go again bein beautiful you
Setting fire to all you hold on to
Theres a place in my head portraying 
One side of you
I'm letting go again 
Won't be another friend
To a beautiful, beautiful you

I'm a concept in the human race
A mere burnt image
Another shade of grays
Provoked by pride
Barely holdin on to life
A prejudice lover always in forever
Cause this is my answer for you

There you go again bein beautiful you
Setting fire to all you hold on to
Theres a place in my head portraying 
One side of you
I'm letting go again 
Won't be another friend
To a beautiful, beautiful you

I keep hearing what you said
It keeps playing over and over again

There you go again bein beautiful you
Setting fire to all you hold on to
Theres a place in my head portraying 
One side of you
I'm letting go again 
Won't be another friend
To a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
