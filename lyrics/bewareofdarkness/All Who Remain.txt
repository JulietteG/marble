Tell the one about these criminals
Taken and given life like marble candy
Everything collapses around me, overwhelms and astounds me, a terrible truth
When you leave this lfie, the world will be a darker place for all who remain
When you leave this life, the world will be a darker place for all who remain
And the light you gave and the rest will all go away

I see you everytime that I close my eyes, I hum every lullaby that she used to sing
You never know the last time you see someone,
so give them the love you love cause they'll disapear.
When you leave this life, the world will be a darker place for all who remain
When you leave this life, the world will be a darker place for all who remain
And the light you gave and the rest will all go away

If I can't have you in this life, then I don't want this life at all
Cause there's nothing else in this broken world that I'll ever, ever love as much
I call and I call but you never picked up
And I cried and I cried but you never woke up!
And you died, you died without asking me first.
You left me all alone!
Ahhhhhhh, yeaaaaaaah!

When you leave this life, the world will be a darker place for all who remain(X4)
Wait around, wait around for me!
Wait around, wait around for me!---Lyrics submitted by Michael Larmore.
