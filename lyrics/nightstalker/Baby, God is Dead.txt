Baby, God is dead
He had an overdose
He went straight to hell
Hes never been before
Evil is back again
The planet is getting hot
No one is safe my friend
Cause now youll see him roam

Baby, God is dead
He went straight to hell

I just lost my head
I'm out of control
All my body burns
Im ready to explode
You cant see me now
Im not here at all
You can feel my spell
Now, you can hear my call

Baby, God is dead
He went straight to hell

-Bass/Guitar Solo

Baby, God is dead 
He left us all alone
We can do it right
We can do it wrong
He wont come back again
You'll never find him home
He stopped to believe
Doesnt believe he's god

Baby, God is dead
He went straight to hell---Lyrics submitted by Chrys TosAnesti Xavi.
