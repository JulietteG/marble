Somebody's knockin', should I let him in?
Lord, it's the devil, would you look at him.
I've heard about him, but I never dreamed,
he'd have blue eyes and blue jeans.

Well, somebody's talking, he's whispering to me.
"Your place or my place, well which will it be?"
I'm getting weaker and he's coming on strong,
but I don't wanna go wrong.

He must've tapped my telephone line
He must've known I'm spendin my time alone.
He says we'll have one heavenly night.
My fever's burnin so he oughta feel right a home.

Somebody's knockin, should I let him in?
Lord, it's the devil, would you look at him.
I've heard about him, but I never dreamed,
he'd have blue eyes and blue jeans.

MMM He must've tapped my telephone line.
He must've known I'm spendin my time alone.
He said we'd have one heavenly night.
My fever's burnin so he oughta feel right at home.

Somebody's knockin, Somebody's knockin, 
MMM Somebody's knockin.
Well Somebody's knockin.---Lyrics submitted by Missy.
