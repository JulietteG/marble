Breathe deep 
In light of what is all around you
But don't speak 
Words are becoming your worst enemy

And seize the day
But do you have something you can sink your teeth into
That in a stale place are you able to cry or make a silly face

And at the end of the day 
You just aren't the same
Now please don't give in

And are you set in your ways
Is there room for change 
Please don't give in

And at the end of the day
You just aren't the same
But please don't give in

And are you set in your ways
Is there room for change
But please don't give in

And please don't give in
And please don't give in---Lyrics submitted by sherri.
