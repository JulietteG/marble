Dance, to the movement of the stars
Sing till the walls around this ring
Pray that it never fades away
Until we sleep

Feast, go ahead now, take your fill
Drink, till the room begins to sway
Play, and your cares will blow away
Until we sleep
Into a deep and dreamless sleep our spirits fall
And what we sow we cannot reap nor keep at all

Work, though the work will break your back
Rest,hope to feel your spirits rise
But the years, have cut you down to size
Now go to sleep
Into a deep and dreamless sleep our spirits fall
And what we sow we cannot reap nor keep at all---Lyrics submitted by tom murphy.
