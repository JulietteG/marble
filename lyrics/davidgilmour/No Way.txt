There's no way
I'm gonna let go
There's no way
Because it's my show
I'm hangin' on
For a little while
I won't go down easy
That's not my style

I'm all tied up
Tied up in a knot
And I can't decide
Just what it is I've got
Did I get out of touch
Did I lose my way
I've not forgot
No, not a single day

Now you might believe
I'm not a happy man
Putting myself apart
From the common clan
What a boat we're sailing
We had a week or two
But I know it sounds
Like me and you

So there's no way
I'm gonna let go
There's no way
Because it's my show
I'm hangin' on
For a little while
I won't go down easy
That's not my style---Lyrics submitted by Giorgi Tsomaia.
