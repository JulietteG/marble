This is the moment Ive been waiting for all my life
To open my heart and show you Ive nothing to hide
You see the best in me and I owe it all to you

Take a look at me now
Living out my dreams now
Sure as I am standing here tonight
Make this last forever
You and me together
Living all our dreams out loud tonight

All from a spark to a flicker that burst into flame
Now the amber of hope and this moment are one in the same
Some call it destiny shining this light on me

Take a look at me now
Living out my dreams now
Sure as I am standing here tonight
Make this last forever
You and me together
Living all our dreams out loud tonight

You dont have to close your eyes to dream
All I see is right in front of me

Take a look at me now
Living out my dreams now
Sure as I am standing here tonight
Make this Iast forever
You and me together

Living all our dreams out loud tonight---
