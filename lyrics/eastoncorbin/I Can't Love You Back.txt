I can love you in the morning
I can love you all day
I can love you even more when I get home
I can love you until the ends of the earth
Where needing yous the only thing on
My broken one track mind

(Chorus)
Girl, I love you crazy
Become so easy
After all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just cant love you back

I could write a thousand letters
Call hundred times a day
Or try to drown my sorrow at the bar
I could go down to the church
Get on my knees and pray
But it still wont change the way things really are
Wont bring you back again

(Chorus)

I could love you for all im worth
To the ends of the earth
But I just cant love you back---Lyrics submitted by Leah.
