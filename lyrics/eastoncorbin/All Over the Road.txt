No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet things got me buzzing
From whispering in my ear

Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot nest
Mr. You'll understand
I'm doing my best

And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit a left and a little bit a right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me
I'm all outta control
All over the road

Don't want to get no ticket
Don't want to cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say "girl take it easy"
She laughs, says "it'll be fine"
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines

Yeah, I know I'm all over the road
And I can't help but go
A little bit a left and a little bit a right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me
I'm all outta control
All over the road

Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home
As fast as I can go

And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit a left and a little bit a right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the road ---
