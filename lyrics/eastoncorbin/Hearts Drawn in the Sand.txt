She was workin a summer job
Sellin t-shirts towels and sunblock
A midwest girl who couldn't live without the beach

I was a local boy who worked next door
Never seen a smile like hers before
She put her feet up on the dash of my old Jeep
It was henna tattoos tank tops and ray bans
And hearts drawn in the sand

Cause summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn to hot to fast
Ya don't talk about it 'cuz you both understand
Ya get drunk on those board walk days
That pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sand

Sit out on the St. Johns pier
She drank wine and I drank beer
And when we saw a boat light blink we'd make a wish
Then we'd take a walk where the waves hit your feet
She'd lean right in close to me
And I could taste the sun and salt on her lips
And that day would wash away when the tide came in
Like hearts drawn in the sand

Oh summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn to hot to fast
You don't talk about it 'cuz you both understand
You get drunk on those boardwalk days
And that pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a sea side tan
And hearts drawn in the sand

Ya you get drunk on those board walk days
And that pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a sea side tan
And hearts drawn in the sand---
