Riding down south in my old Jeep
Jenny is painting her toe nails pink
And I'm fishing in the cooler for something to drink
Cold Coca Cola
My rocking radio is riding the dash
I've got a blue boogie board sticking out of the back
And I think that sign we just blew past
Said Pensacola
Yeah I know what to do when it's ninety-two
And only getting hotter

Just add water
Jump right in and catch a wave
Just add water
A little something to wash the worries away
With the sun and the shine and the tan and the lines
A good time, man we got 'er
Made in the shade
Just add water

Got a beach towel laid out down on the beach
A couple cold Coronas and four bare feet
And off in the distance you can just see 'em big boats dance
There's some Buffet coming out of the coconut hut
I guess some of them boys are catching a buzz
And some Joe with a pick-up truck stuck in the sand
And Jenny's got on that little teeny two-piece bikini I bought her
Just add water

Just add water
Jump right in and catch a wave
Just add water
A little something to wash the worries away
With the sun and the shine and the tan and the lines
A good time, man we got 'er
Made in the shade
Just add water
We got the sun and the shine and the tan and the lines
A good time, man we got 'er
Made in the shade
Just add water
Yeah, just add water
Yeah, just add water---
