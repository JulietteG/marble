You got a cousin whos tellin you somethin that dont have nothin 
With the love were in, baby
I hear shes sayin that game were playin should be complicated
If you wont, Ill say it, I think shes crazy cause

CHORUS:
Love dont have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-out, drag-outs cryin in the rain
Its alright to keep it light now mama, dont you think
Were having such a good time together, its only just begun
My hearts never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun

Im walking around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
Theres no self-help book on your shelf, you know too well
Theyre selling you somethin for nothin cause

CHORUS:
Love dont have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-out, drag-outs cryin in the rain
Its alright to keep it light now mama, dont you think
Were having such a good time together, its only just begun
My hearts never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun

Instrumental

CHORUS:
Love dont have to be a bunch of drama
