Guys need girls to make 'em feel tough
And girls know how to make guys fall in love
It ain't crazy, it's a fact of life
It's all right here in black and white
Baby this story sounds just like us

I'll be the guy that buys you a drink
You'll be the girl that drives me wild with a wink
And a kiss and that last call, look this is late
Let's take this outside right now
I'll be the guy begging for one last dance
You'll be the girl that says you missed your chance
Let's take it to the parking lot
And drop the tailgate down
And turn it into a Saturday night
Small town world, a cooler of beer
A little truck bed twirl in the moonlight
Guys and girls

Girls give guys that all night rush
And guys give girls that butterfly crush
Like a whiskey shot to the heart
Just two stones make it a spark
Baby don't this sound just like us?

I'll be the guy that buys you a drink
You'll be the girl that drives me wild with a wink
And a kiss and that last call, look this is late
Let's take this outside right now
I'll be the guy begging for one last dance
You'll be the girl that says you missed your chance
Let's take it to the parking lot
And drop the tailgate down
And turn it into a Saturday night
Small town world, a cooler of beer
A little truck bed twirl in the moonlight
Guys and girls

Guy goes out and buys girl a ring
He knows he can't but he swears he'll give her everything
Girl gives a laugh and says I couldn't want more
Guy thanks God for the girl

I'll be the guy that buys you a drink
You'll be the girl that drives me wild with a wink
And a kiss and that last call, look this is late
Let's take this outside right now
I'll be the guy begging for one last dance
You'll be the girl that says you missed your chance
Let's take it to the parking lot
And drop the tailgate down
Turn it into a Saturday night
Small town world, a cooler of beer
A little truck bed twirl in the moonlight
Guys and girls---
