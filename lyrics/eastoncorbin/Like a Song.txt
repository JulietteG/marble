I was hoping it wouldn't rain, no not today
There's so many things that I gotta do
There's eight hundred miles to go on this old highway
Each turn I take brings me back to you
I can't forget

You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
No I can't shut it off, I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head

You said I'll always love you, like you love me
You kissed me and whispered goodbye
Your eyes filled with tears as I turned to leave
That picture still burning in my mind
I can't forget

You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
And oh I can't shut it off, I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head

I don't know where tomorrow is gonna take me
Maybe run away again or maybe run back to you

You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
No I can't shut it off, I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
Stuck in my head---
