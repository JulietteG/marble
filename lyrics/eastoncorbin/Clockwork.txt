Might as well have my alarm set on my phone girl 
It's like you got a camera, don't know how you know, Im home alone girl 
Come around 10:47 every Friday night 
Might as well leave the light on, cause you're always right on time 

You call, I say hello 
You knock, I'm lettin' you in 
You say, you've missed  
My lips, we kiss 
Here we go again 
Your dress, my shirt 
We love, I live and never learn 
I crash, I burn 
You leave, I hurt 
Like clockwork 

It's like Im walkin' down the street and fall in that same trap girl 
I see a freight train comin' I just stand there on the tracks girl 
Somebody'd be gettin' rich if they were placin' bets 
On me thinkin' no, no, no, always sayin' yes 

You call, I say hello 
You knock, I'm lettin' you in 
You say, you've missed  
My lips, we kiss 
Here we go again 
Your dress, my shirt 
We love, I live and never learn 
I crash, I burn 
You leave, I hurt 
Like clockwork  

It's too easy, you know my street 
And you know where I leave my key 
Baby you know me, I can count on you, to count on me 
It's like a movie Ive seen a thousand times I hate the end 
But I still hit rewind 

You call, I say hello 
You knock, I'm lettin' you in 
You say, you've missed  
My lips, we kiss 
Here we go again 
Your dress, my shirt 
We love, I live and never learn 
I crash, I burn 
You leave, I hurt 
Like clockwork  

Like clockwork 
Like clockwork---
