Yeah, a bar's just a bar
'Til the band starts playing
And the girls come out
They goes to pop a top
And the floor goes to rocking
And the crowd gets loud
George Strait, Alan Jackson
Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, "Three Chords & the Truth"
Fist fights, dim lights, wifis, alibis, bubbles and booze

And it's wild women and whiskey
Yeah the party situation
Not a better combination you'll find
Wild women and whiskey
Oh order up a double
Dance and drink your troubles goodbye

No sparkle and spangle
Honky tonk angels, they're a sight to see
Yeah ain't nothing quite like 'em
Get your hands on the right one
And you'll know what I mean
Straight up or on the rocks
To get your courage up
May take a shot or two
And the party's on, right or wrong
Country song, sing-along, cutting loose

And it's wild women and whiskey
Yeah the party situation
Not a better combination you'll find
Yeah it's wild women and whiskey
Oh order up a double
Dance and drink your troubles goodbye
Oh wild women and whiskey
Yeah the party situation
Not a better combination you'll find
Wild women and whiskey
Oh order up a double
Dance and drink your troubles goodbye

Yeah order up a double
Dance and drink your troubles goodbye---
