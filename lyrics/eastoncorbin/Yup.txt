You ought to shoot that last one down now
Pass on that one more round now
Closing in onto 8:30
Better get home, gotta hit it hard early
Yup
You got a pretty girl looking at you there
Giving you that what you gonna do stare
Saying, 'look, gonna call it a night now'
But you're all wrapped up in the right now

Yup
Gonna buy her a drink, no time to think
Yup
You try to say that you can't stay
Her smile is saying 'why can't you?'
Gonna wind up staying there, ain't you?
Yup

There you go about to drop another 50
Another shot of that fireball whiskey
Tomorrow this night's gonna owe me
No reason to go home lonely

Yup
Gonna buy her a drink, no time to think
Yup
You try to say that you can't stay
Her smile is saying 'why can't you?'
Gonna wind up staying there, ain't you?
Yup

Round and round, you got her now dancing with you
In a a minute she's gonna lean in and kiss you
Yup

Yup
Gonna buy her a drink, no time to think
Yup
You try to say that you can't stay
Her smile is saying 'why can't you?'
Gonna wind up staying there, ain't you?
Yup

Man, you ain't going nowhere, are you?
Yup---
