Imagine a dirt road full of pot holes 
With a creek bank and some cane poles 
Catching channel cat 
Im a little more country that 

Picture a small town with an old hound 
Laying out front of the court house 
While the old men chew the fat 
Im a little more country than that 

I just want to make sure you know just who youre getting under this old hat 
Cause girl Im not the kind to two time or play games behind your back 
Im a little more country than that 

Think of a hank song from days gone 
With a steel ride thats so strong 
It sends chills up your back 
Im a little more country than that 

If you want a brick home in a school zone 
With the doors locked and alarms on 
Girl, youre way off track 
Im a little more country than that 

I just want to make sure you know just who youre getting under this old hat 
Cause girl Im not the kind of two time or play games behind your back 
Im a little more country 

Yeah, Im sure that youve heard those three words from Others 
But they fell flat 
But this ring aint some thing that I mean to give you 
And then take back 
Im a little more country than that 
Im a little more country than that 
Im a little more country than that---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
