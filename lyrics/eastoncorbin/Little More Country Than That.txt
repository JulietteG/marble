imagine a dirt road 
full of pot holes 
with a creek bank 
and some cane poles 
catching channel cat 
I'm a little more country than that 

picture a small town 
with an old hound 
laying out front of the courthouse 
while the old men chew the fat 
I'm a little more country than that 

i just want to make sure you 
know just who your 
getting under this old hat 
cause girl I'm not the kind to 
two-time or play games 
behind your back 
I'm a little more country than that 

think of a Hank song 
from days gone 
with a steal ride that's so strong 
it sends chills up your back 
I'm a little more country than that 

if you want to break home 
in a school zone 
with the doors locked 
and the alarms on 
girl you're way off track 
I'm a little more country than that 

i just want to make sure you 
know just who your getting under this old hat 
cuz girl I'm not the kind to two-time 
or play games behind your back 
i'm a little more country than that 

yeah' 
I'm sure that you've heard 
those three words from others 
but they fell flat 
but this ring ain't something 
that i mean to give you and
then take back 
I'm a little more country than that 

I'm a little more country than that 
I'm a little more country than that---Lyrics submitted by Gail.
