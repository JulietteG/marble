Wipe away your tears
Put away your pain tonight
Runaway until you finally see the light

Sing a song with me
Hush the quiet scream inside
See the world through different eyes
Hear no more the sound of lies...

[Chorus]:
Can't you run?
(A pretty one that's shaken up inside)
Can't you hear?
(I hear them call her name) Missunderstood
(She's unpredictable and...)

Hear the cold wind blow outside
Try to feel the warmth inside
Etched, the faces and the words into your mind

As she gently weeps
Surface the secrets that she keeps
Like a thief into the night
A love so wrong but right...

Can't you run?
(A pretty one that's shaken up inside)
Can't you hear?
(I hear them call her name) Missunderstood
(She's unpredictable and pure...)

[Chorus]

How can she.. begin to try?
Misunderstood so many times.. so many times
Rise above, rise again
Thought you went away but I misunderstood

Can't you run?
(A pretty one that's shaken up inside)
Can't you hear?
(I hear them call her name) Missunderstood
Don't you go away
Don't you fade away

[Chorus]---
