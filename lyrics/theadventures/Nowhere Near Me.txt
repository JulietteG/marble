LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LAAAA

It starts in the playgrounds
And in the schools
Apply the pressure
Apply the rules

I see it clear
I see the fraud
That your approval 
Is my reward

But you're nowhere near me
You've missed the mark
You're nowhere near me
In the dark you're chasing shadows

You make a maneuver
A compromise
The man with the mouthwash
Sees the lies

I see it clear
I see the fraud
That your approval 
Is my reward

But you're nowhere near me
You've missed the mark
You're nowhere near me
In the dark you're chasing shadows


LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LAAAA
LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LAAAA

But you're nowhere near me
You've missed the mark
You're nowhere near me
You've missed the mark

But,You're nowhere near me
You're nowhere near me---Lyrics submitted by Terry.
