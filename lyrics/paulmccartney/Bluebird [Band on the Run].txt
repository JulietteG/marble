Late at night when the wind is still
I'll come flying through your door
And you'll know what love is for,
I'm a bluebird...

Touch your lips with a magic kiss,
And you'll be a bluebird too,
And you'll know what love can do,
I'm a bluebird...
Bluebird...

Fly away through the midnight air,
As we head across the sea,
And at last we will be free,
You're a bluebird...
Bluebird...
All alone on a desert island
We're living in the trees,
And we're flying in the breeze
We're the bluebird...
Singing Bluebird...---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
