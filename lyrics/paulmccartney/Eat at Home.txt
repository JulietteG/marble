Come only Lady
Lady lets eat at home
Come Only Lady
Lady lets eat at home
Eat at home
Eat at home

Come only Lady
Lady lets eat in bed
Come only Lady
Lady lets eat in bed
Eat in bed
Eat in bed

Bring the love that you feel for me
Into line with the love I see
And in the morning you bring to me
Love

Come only Lady
Lady well dont do that
Come Only Lady
Lady well dont do that
Do that
Do that

Come only Lady
Lady lets eat at home
Come Only Lady
Lady lets eat at home
Eat at home
Eat at home

Bring the love that you feel for me
Into line with the love I see
And in the morning you bring to me
Love

Come only Lady
Lady well dont do that
Come Only Lady
Lady well dont do that
Do that
Do that

Do That
Do That 
Oh No!---Lyrics submitted by Chris Wilbur.
