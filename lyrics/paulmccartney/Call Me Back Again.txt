Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night I would call
Your number brought me joy.

I called your house,
every night since then
But I aint never, no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call be back again...

Call me back again.

I've heard your name
every night since then
But I aint never, no no never...
Heard you calling me back again
Call me back again

Well when I when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night, every night
I would call because your number brought me joy

Oh-I've called your name
every night since then,
But I aint never, no no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call be back again.

Call me back again.---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
