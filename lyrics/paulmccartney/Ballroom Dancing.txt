Well I used to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a China cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballrom dancing
Big B.D.

Well I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballrom dancing
Big B.D.

Well went so fast and we all grew up
Now the days that passed in the China cup
Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballrom dancing
Big B.D., oh---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
