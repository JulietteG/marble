You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away.
I want to help you with your problem.
Stick around, I say

It's coming up! It's coming up!
It's coming up like a flower!
It's coming up!

You want a friend you can rely on,
One who will never fade away.
I know you're searching for an answer.
Stick around, I say

It's coming up! It's coming up!
It's coming up on the hour!
It's coming up!

You want a better kind of future,
One that everyone could share.
You're not alone, we all could use it.
Stick around - we're nearly there!

It's coming up! It's coming up!
It's coming up like a flower!
It's coming up!---Lyrics submitted by Barry.
