Once upon a time I was feelin mighty fine
And I said it in a happy song
I said it cause it told just how I felt
And my friends started singing along
If you ask me if Im still feelin fine right now
I can answer with an all time YES
I can tell you how I feel
Theres never any need to guess

CHORUS:
Well Im still feelin fine after all this time
Im feelin might fine today
Every day Im climbing just a little bit higher
Walkin up the Kings Highway
I still want to go
Where the milk and honey flow
And Im not gonna change my mind
Happy on my journey
And Im still feelin might fine

Wake up in the morning.
Thinkin bout the journey
Goin to the promised land
Thinkin bout the songs we used to sing
And I sing them all over again
God has never changed and my song remains
And Heavens still on my mind
I know where Im going
And Im still feelin mighty fine

Repeat Chorus three times

TAG
I still want to go
Where the milk and honey flow

Happy on my journey
And Im still feelin might fine
Still feelin fine.
Reprise
Repeat Chorus twice
Repeat Tag.---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
