I was working in town one afternoon, attending some business affairs.
I heard a commotion a couple streets over and wondered whats happenin there?
A young man was running from in that direction and stopped just to catch his breath,
I asked him to please tell me what was the hurry. He smiled up at me and he said-

I was trying to catch the crippled man, did he run past this way?
He was rushing home to tell everyone what Jesus did today.
And the mute man was telling myself and the deaf girl hes leaving to answer Gods call,
Its hard to believe, but if you dont trust me, 
Ask the blind man he saw it all. Ask the blind man he saw it all.

My friend if the troubles and burdens you carry are heavy and dragging you down,
Youve tried everything you can possibly think of theres no relief to be found,
That very same Jesus that altered the future of the blind man, the deaf and the lame,
Is still reaching out in your hour of trouble; One touch and youre never the same.

Youll be trying to catch the crippled man, did he run past this way?
He was rushing home to tell everyone what Jesus did today.
And the mute man was telling myself and the deaf girl hes leaving to answer Gods call.
Its hard to believe, but if you dont trust me,
Ask the blind man he saw it all.   Ask the blind man he saw it all---Lyrics submitted by JD.
