Weve all done things that were not proud of
Made mistakes along the way
Walked the path of least resistance
Travel roads that led to shame

But theres no need to be held captive
Beneath the weight that blame can bring
Just pour your heart out to the Savior
He alone can break the chains

There is freedom and forgiveness
There is peace and sweet relief
Grace and mercy now are waiting
When you bow at Jesus feet

So bring your cares and every burden
Lay them down and walk away
Say Goodbye to all that haunts you
Leave your guilt to yesterday

Hope will dawn with each tomorrow
The grip of fear will lose its hold
Defined no longer by your failures
Youll find strength in letting go

There is freedom and forgiveness
There is peace and sweet relief
Grace and mercy now are waiting
When you bow at Jesus feet

Grace and mercy now are waiting
When you bow at Jesus feet
When you bow at Jesus feet---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
