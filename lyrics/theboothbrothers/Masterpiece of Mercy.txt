He knew what I was when He made me
He saw the sinner Id become
Yet He knew He had grace that could save me
His latest work of art had just begun

He started with an old dirty canvas
My sin had left me tattered, bent, and marred
Then this artist turned His light upon my sadness
And began to wash away the blackest part

When all the stains were gone He started painting
With colors that Id never seen before
Then with joy He was ready to display me
To show the world what the Cross was for

Chorus:
A masterpiece of mercy; a miracle of grace
When the master sees one hurting
And wipes the pain away
The canvas of the artist
Becomes a holy place
For a masterpiece of mercy; a miracle of grace

Now Im getting ready for Heaven
Every day just makes me want to go
But the artist hasnt stopped; Hes still painting
And when Hes finished, He will take me Home

Chorus:
A masterpiece of mercy; a miracle of grace
When the master sees one hurting
And wipes the pain away
The canvas of the artist
Becomes a holy place
For a masterpiece of mercy; a miracle of grace

The canvas of the artist
Becomes a holy place
For a masterpiece of mercy; a miracle of grace---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
