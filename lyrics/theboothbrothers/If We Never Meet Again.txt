Soon well come to the end of lifes journey
And perhaps well never meet any more
Till we gather in Heavens bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

CHORUS:
If we never meet again this side of Heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
Theres another meeting place somewhere in Heaven
By the side of the river of life.
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separations come no more
If we never meet again this side of Heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Oh, they say that we shall meet by the river
Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
And they say that well be happy in Heaven
In the wonderful sweet by and by

Repeat Chorus

TAG:
I will meet you
I will meet you on that beautiful shore.---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
