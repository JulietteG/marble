You gotta answer to yourself
You can't depend on anyone else
You gotta know where you stand
And what's in your hands
Yeah you gotta answer to yourself

You gotta write down what you know
You gotta make sure that it's known
Because they're coming along to see what you've done
And they're gonna claim it for their own

You got a rabbit in your hat
You got a few tricks up your sleeve
Don't get stuck in a rut
Or stuck in the same
You got exactly what you need

You got a talent don't you know?
You're more talented than you know
And you give it a shot
And give it the time
And be surprised how far it goes

But I think I'm gonna die
Before I see my time
But I think I'm gonna die
Trying anyway

You gotta answer to yourself
2 days a week outside yourself
You take an hour a day, an hour a day
And you don't respond to anyone else

You got a few things on your shelf
You got to look through for yourself
You gotta choose what to read
Choose what to believe
And you don't take it from anyone else

But I think I'm gonna die
Before I see my time
But I think I'm gonna die
Trying anyway---Lyrics submitted by Linda Fruit.
