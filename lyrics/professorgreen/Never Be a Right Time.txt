(Verse 1)
This is stressing me
Its really beginning to get to me
You've always been the best to me
And I've never given you any less of me
You've never been in a negative energy
Im stressing, you tell me never to let it get to me
Theres never been another next to me, that means what you meant to me
I said meant, but thats mean, i meant mean to me not meant to me!
but i dont know if its meant to be
I wanna tell you but nothings coming out when I speak
I cant find the words to say, its like the words evade me

I'm struggling to find a way to word it, and I'm supposed to be a wordsmith
It's just hard to find the words to say, hard to find the words to say..

(Chorus)
There'll never be a right time,
The time will never be right.
There'll never be a right time
For me to tell you
It's over

(Verse 2)
I was selling white, you were telling me i could do better
I told you if I was you I'd leave but you never,
Forever had faith in me even when i never did
I said I'd never let her slip like her ex-fella did
Been tryin to disguise it and dress it up,
I wanna tell her but i cant bear to see her welling up
I've got to find the strength to let her know, I've got to find the strength to let her go
But if I let her go I'll never know if things will get better with her,
See this could be a hiccup and not the end of the road
I'd be better to never get involved, she deserves better

than a fella with a fear of being alone

Struggling to find a way to word it, and I'm supposed to be a wordsmith
It's just hard to find the words to say, it's hard to find the words to say..

(Chorus)
There'll never be a right time,
The time will never be right.
There'll never be a right time
For me to tell you
Its over

(Bridge)
I cant help the way I feel, I don't want us to end
But I cant help the way I feel, I really can't pretend
I cant help the way I feel, but I dont want us to end
'Cause it will never be enough for us to just be friends

(Verse 3)
Nah, it'll never be enough
'Cause I think we both know what it means for us
I see the look on your face and I hate it
But I finally pluck up enough courage to say it
That's when she spins me around and tells me I aint leaving
To tell her I take it back to tell her that I don't mean it
To look her dead in the eye and tell her I dont feel it
But I dont feel it..

(Chorus)
There'll never be a right time,
The time will never be right.
There'll never be a right time
For me to tell you
Its over---Lyrics submitted by mariam bergaoui.
