I remember how Id cuss, the taste of that old hillside dust
And the hot July sun that burned my back
As I walked between the rows, I dreamed of places that Id go
Far away from the fields of home.

A young man longs to get away, and I told Dad I would someday
And I remember how I laughed at his reply
He said son someday youll long, to kiss this ground youre standing on
When theres miles between you and the fields of home

Chorus
I left before I turned 18, I set out to do big things
Oh, I didnt write or call, I thought I knew it all
And for a while I lived it up, but when I got down on my luck
I started longing for the fields of home

Now 20 years have slipped away, but I went back the other day
And found the weeds had taken Daddys farm
I looked for Genes old grocery store, the road dont run by there no more
And I didnt recognize the fields of home

Chorus
I left before I turned 18, I set out to do big things
Oh, I didnt write or call, I thought I knew it all
I cant believe how things have changed, And they wont ever be the same
Lord, I wish Id never left the fields of home

Tonight, I long to walk, the fields of home. ---
