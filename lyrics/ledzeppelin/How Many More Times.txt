How Many More Times, treat me the way you wanna do? [X2]
When I give you all my love, please, please be true.

I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all. [X2]
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl.

[spoken]
I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinkin' it all over, just what I had missed.
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then...
Whoops, oh Lordy, well I did it again.
Now I got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven.
But I'm in constant heaven.
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give.

Oh, Rosie, oh, girl. [X2]
Steal away now, steal away [X2]
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play.

Well they call me the hunter, that's my name.
They call me the hunter, that's how I got my fame.
Ain't no need to hide, Ain't no need to run.
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my..........gun!

How Many More Times, barrelhouse all night long. [X2]
I've got to get to you, baby, baby, please come home.---Lyrics submitted by Marko.
