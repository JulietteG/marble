Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while, 
I Think I see my friends coming, Riding a many mile. 
Friends, you get some silver? 
Did you get a little gold? 
What did you bring me, my dear friends? Keep me from the Gallows Pole. 
What did you bring me to keep me from the Gallows Pole? 

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold, 
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the Gallows Pole. 
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while, 
I think I see my brother coming, riding many a mile. 
Brother, you get me some silver? 
Did you get a little gold? 
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the Gallows Pole? 

Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah.
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything 
To keep you from the Gallows Pole. 
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the Gallows Pole. 

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile, 
I think I see my sister coming, riding many mile, mile, mile. 
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand, 
Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man, 
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this mad, man. 

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile, 
Tell me that I'm free to ride, 
Ride for many mile, mile, mile. 

Oh yes, you got a fine sister, She warmed my blood from cold, 
She warmed my blood to boiling hot to keep you from the Gallows Pole, 
Your brother brought me silver, Your sister warmed my soul, 
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging from the Gallows Pole 

But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging from the Gallows Pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole!

Ah-ha-ha
Swingin'
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
See-saw marjory daw
See-saw knock at my door---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey.
