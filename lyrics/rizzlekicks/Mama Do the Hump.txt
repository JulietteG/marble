Mama won't you please let me x6

Yo coming in with a sound fresher than cut grass (fun starts)
second that we enter if you must ask (rush past)
like you've forgotten your mind
or the drivers all up your face like can i see your bus pass!?
huh naaa
we just wanna lickle rhyme bruv
call me what you want but you should not call it a night love 
and i might just join the mile high club
only problem being that i couldnt give a flying f**k!

yeah lemme touch back down
slap her on the bum until it
comes back round
half a rooms like OI whats this all about, with the other hand jizzing,
i love that sound

a yeah yeah, I love that sound,
a yeah yeah I love that sound.
so flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
yeah your mama can hump

(chorus)
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump

Yo its been a long week
how i've got this much energy is beyond me
i just want all of these girls to be on me
and maybe even one of them could be beyonce
we aint gonna pack that rap noise in
all of that cheesy stuff, clap clap sing
and we're gonna burn some calories
right here, right now
aint over till a fat boy slims mama

(chorus)
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama

won't you please let me do the hump hump

yeah knock a rum back down

bust a little jiggy as the
drum track pounds
half the room are just making their own crowd with 
the other half jiving
i love that sound, a yeah yeah
i love that sound, a yeah yeah
i love that sound
so flick you fag butts at once in a mad one like
yeah yeah your mama can hump

(chorus)
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump

when we step in to the room everybody makes a pathway
cause you know RK make the dance change
and we rule that crowd
and we dont change pace at the half way
we we, we keep it moving
we we, we hold it down
cant stop
break sweat
no loosing
yes
nobody gonna take my crown,
hold back
na na na na never gonna happen
go back
na na na na never gonna happen
especially when its all packed out,
crowd shouting out
yeah, i love that sound

a yeah yeah i love that sound
a yeah yeah i love that sound
so flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
yeah your mama can hump

(chorus)
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
mama do the hump mama do the hump hump, mama
won't you please let me do the hump hump
