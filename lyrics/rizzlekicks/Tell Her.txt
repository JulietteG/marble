Do you remember back in school,
When the boys and girls that could not make their moves,
So they get their friends to do the do?
Well that's how I feel for you.
Cause I can't approach you, no not today,
So I sit back in the corner, get my friends to say.
Tell her I love her cause I'm feeling shy.
Tell her I love her cause I'm not that guy.
You've taken my fancy, you're catching my eye,
You've taken my fancy tonight.

Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her

It seems I haven't got the tools, yeah,
To build my courage, baby ask you if you're cool.
I've sink into to the wall,
And I'm waiting for a chance, baby us to cross our paths.
Cause I can't approach you, no not today,
So I sit back in the corner, get my friends to say.
Tell her I love her cause I'm feeling shy.
Tell her I love her cause I'm not that guy.
You've taken my fancy, you're catching my eye,
You've taken my fancy tonight.

Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her
Tell her I love her---
