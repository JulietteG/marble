[CHORUS]
You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
We got some clowns and jokers too (ROUND UP)
We know you're glad you found us too (ROUND UP)
Thank you for inviting us round
here to perform tonight.
We got
Clowns and tamers you're bound to blame us I hope that that's alright
(NOW ROUND UP)

You know we're not normal guys
since a bunch of freaks and animals arrived
and maybe if you act nice
we'll leave you alone so don't cry
We may seem quite crazy but, don't run for safety
'cause everyone inside the circus agrees
don't rock out without a purpose

Everybody loves antics,
the mad shit that happens at random
well this is the anthem for that then
we're bound to be the main attraction.
The place is rammed but your mate just slapped him
(it kicks off)
Lion tamers in action
pulling at the mane to catch him, he makes a tantrum
but then maintains a fraction
we make this happen for you 'cause we know that

[CHORUS]
You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
We got some clowns and jokers too (ROUND UP)
We know you're glad you found us too (ROUND UP)
Thank you for inviting us round
here to perform tonight.
We got
Clowns and tamers you're bound to blame us I hope that that's alright
(NOW ROUND UP)

And I'm sitting at the bar
few mates, few bars chilling at the start.
We're just having a laugh
so far nothing's happened but we're far from calm.
And I
got a mouthy friend breathing fire
claiming what he really desires
is to go outside and pick a fight
but the Lion tamer will not leave his side

I think it's funny how the clowns intervene
but they keep (fights going)
bound to take risks on a night (knife throwing)
seen that clown before yes (I know him)
don't like him let me get a pie thrown in
And I know on a night like this
when the hype grows
it might go like treading a tight rope
with your eyes closed
Might notice five blokes when the light glows
Five- O hope you enjoy tonight's show

[CHORUS]
You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
We got some clowns and jokers too (ROUND UP)
We know you're glad you found us too (ROUND UP)
Thank you for inviting us round
here to perform tonight.
We got
Clowns and tamers you're bound to blame us I hope that that's alright
(NOW ROUND UP)

You love the vibes we bring for you (ROUND UP)
We got some clowns and jokers too (ROUND UP)
We know you're glad you found us too (ROUND UP)
