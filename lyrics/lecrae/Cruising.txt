Okay, okay, okay
I woke up, kinda late
All good, thank God
Hit the shower, hit the closet, hit the mirror, stay fly
Uh, really I'm rockin' some sweats
Oh well, I'm still feeling blessed
Get fully dressed. Walk in the kitchen she already made me a plate - kinda impressed
And that sun shinin', it's good weather I'm feelin' good; got the Good Book, I'ma read up, put my feet up and then hit the hood
Got to go cause the Jeep got the top off. Got my real shades on, not my knock-offs
On the streets like fifteen minutes and the lights stay green, boy the team might win it. Slow down, speed got limits. But I'm cruising, knee-deep in it
At the car wash cleaned the Jeep found a ten dollar bill inbetween the seats
I gave it to the man on the corner
Had a sign up saying he was hungry
Yeah the world kinda crazy but and the folks kinda foolish but I keep cruising

But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising
But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising

Cruising, feeling good yo
I don't remember living in the hood bro
Death rate high and the funds low, when I used to get by on crumbs bro
Went to the park to get to school
Saw the boys shooting hoop
And my shot kinda rusty but the fade clean
And me and Steph Curry on the same team
Win it like back to back
Nobody really want me after that
Feeling like a young Doctor Jay they can't stop the Jay they can't block my pace
It's true that they can't stop the rain of my shot today
And my girl still fine as ever so when she hit my phone I had to stop the game
Later on, time to eat
Favourite restaurant, open seat
Sunset the scenery
Told my lady, "lean on me"
After than jump in the whip and we in a wind
Tomorrow may not be another win
But until then I'ma keep on moving
Crew in, gotta keep cruising

But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising
But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising

Windows rolled down but the night's going up
If you got the fire you can ride with us
Feelin real good can't get enough
You know how we do it
Yeah baby we cruising
Windows rolled down but the night's going up
If you got the fire you can ride with us
Feelin real good can't get enough
You know how we do it
Yeah baby we cruising

But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising
But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising
But I (But I) keep keep cruising, cruising... cruising
