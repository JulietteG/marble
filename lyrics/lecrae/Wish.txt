Yeah 
I wish I never held back 
Wish nobody had to sell crack 
Then I may have seen my dad a little more 
Maybe I can dream a little more 
But I still wishing on stars in the sky 
Wish a lot of people (was a lie?) 
And I probably passed on a whole lot of truth 
But I know about a whole lot of lies 
Man I wish I had me a time machine 
I would tell Martin it was all a dream 
And I wish like Ray Jay back in 06 
Guess it worked cause I got my chick 
And I wish like [?] did 
If I could change the clock 
Man Id change a lot 
And I probably wouldnt be so selfish 
I woulda gave a lot 
Man Im ashamed of that 
I wish I coulda told [?] thank you 
Before it got way too late 
I wish I woulda worked on my jump shot 
But time just fades away 
I probably wish too much 
I know I play less than I should 
I know I did too much 
I take it all back if I could 

Wish I had another chance 
Maybe Ill do better
Maybe Ill do better
Maybe Ill do better
Every time I think about all of my mistakes 
I just wanna turn it around 
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh 
Oh oh oh ooh oh 
If I never went there, I would never know 
Oh oh oh ooh oh 
Oh oh oh ooh oh 
Maybe I can turn it around 

I wish I didnt do it but I did it 
Man it happened last night 
Man I wish I would try to act like you aint never lost your sight 
And I dont even do it for the money 
Except when I do it for the money 
Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny 
I wish I had ten more wishes 
I swear I got ten more visions 
And life is a game that I cant stop playing 
Baby gimme like ten more minutes 
Im almost finished 
I wish I had a little more time 
I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe I'mma lose my mind 
Before I get to those 
Yeah I miss the goals 
But my shot was off 
Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost 
But I probably missed my calling 
Wish I was a little bit taller 
Wish I was a baller 
Then again every time I get a little money 
I be looking at the next man like he smaller 
I cant call it 
And I wish I didnt go and get high on the one first date 
I was all zoned out, paranoid like did you hear that noise" 
And I know she probably thinking Im cray (crae) 
No pun intended 
I wish I repented 
A little bit quicker 
Then again I didnt pull the trigger 
I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure 

Wish I had another chance 
Maybe Ill do better
Maybe Ill do better
Maybe Ill do better
Every time I think about all of my mistakes 
I just wanna turn it around 
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh 
Oh oh oh ooh oh 
If I never went there, I would never know 
Oh oh oh ooh oh 
Oh oh oh ooh oh 
Maybe I can turn it around---
