(Chorus) 
Now I'mma tell the world, tell em 
I'mma tell it everywhere I go 
Tell the world, tell em 
Yea I'mma billboard 
Tell the world, tell em 
Cast Him like a radio 
Tell the world you are to know 
I'm brand new 

(Verse 1) 
Uh, I know one thing's true 
I don't even really deserve to know you 
But I... I'm a witness that you did this 
And I'm brand new so I... I'm ready to go 
And I'mma tell the world what they need to know 
A slave to myself but you let me go 
I tried gettin high but it left me low 
You did, what they could never do 
You cleaned up my soul and gave me life, I'm so brand new 
And that's all that matters 
I aint love you first, but you first loved me 
In my heart I cursed ya, but you set me free 
I gave you no reason to give me new seasons, to give me new life, new 
Breathin 
But you hung there bleedin 
And you died for my lies, and my cheatin, my lust, and my greedin 
What is a man, huh? that you're mindful of em? 
And what do I have to deserve this love? 

(Chorus) 
Tryna make the moments last 
Holdin on to the past 
But like a hero in a dream 
Christ came and He rescused me! 
Now I'mma tell the world, tell the world, tell em 
I'mma tell it everywhere I go 
Tell the world, tell em 
Yea I'mma billboard 
Tell the world, tell em 
Cast Him like a radio 
Tell the world you are to know 
I'm brand new

(Verse 2) 
I can't offer you nothin, but your care and kindness keep comin 
And your love is so unconditional, I get butterflies in my stomach 
I got the old me in the rearview, gotta new me, gotta clear view 
I was so dead, I couldn't hear you 
Too deep in sin to come near you 
But you drew me in, and cleaned me up 
And take me home and beamed me up 
Before you do, just let me tell the truth 
And let these folks know that I done seeing your love 
And it's everlastin, infinite 
It goes on and on, you can't measure it 
Can't quench your love, they can't separate us from the love of God 
It's no estimate 
My face look the same, my frame done rearranged 
But I changed, I promise I aint the same 
Your love is so deep, you suffered and took pain 
And died on the cross to gimme a new name 
Aint nothin like I seen before 
I gotta beam to glow 
Was low, down, and dirty but you cleaned me Lord 
You looked after me, you keep rockin me 
Imma tell the world and aint nobody stoppin me 

(Chorus) 
Tryna make the moments last 
Holdin on to the past 
But like a hero in a dream 
Christ came and He rescused me! 
Now I'mma tell the world, tell the world, tell em 
I'mma tell it everywhere I go 
Tell the world, tell em 
Yea I'mma billboard 
Tell the world, tell em 
Cast Him like a radio 
Tell the world you are to know 
I'm brand new 

(Verse 3; 2 Corinthians 5:17) 
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, 
He is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 
Yea, I'm brand new 

(Chorus) 
Now I'mma tell the world, tell the world, tell em 
I'mma tell it everywhere I go 
Tell the world, tell em 
Yea I'mma billboard 
Tell the world, tell em 
Cast Him like a radio 
Tell the world you are to know 
I'm brand new---Lyrics submitted by Jose Jimenez.
