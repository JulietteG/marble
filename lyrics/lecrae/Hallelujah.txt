Gone in the club on the vod-ka-ka
 Trying to get lil' momma in the car-ar-ar
 I heard a gun pop like "pa-pa-pa"
 Someone hit us with a choppa like "ra-ta-ta"
 An average night for a couple of no goods, up in college but yet we still act like we're so hood
 Never makin' it to Church, man we're drinkin' til it hurts, if we could do it tomorrow yeah we sure would
 When you're sittin' in your room and you're feelin' like a fool 'cause you got a couple STD's
 See you're partner's on the news 'cause he thought that he was cool, now they're 'bout to put him 6 feet deep
 When I'm really at my lowest and I'm feelin' kinda hopeless everybody gotta hate on me
 Shame on me, 'cause the blame's on me but Hallelujah the Lord showed His grace on me
 He saved me! Was on my way to hell with a full tank
 I don't care what them boys think, 'cause what I'm on is a sure thang
 Stackin' they money up like it's Lego's, Tienes hambre para all of the Peso's
 The'll never be satisfied, man I tried, it's a lie, the only hope you got is turning to Jess

I'm not here to impress, I'm here to impact
 I won't settle for less, got my cross on my back
 I was out my mind, my head was screwed up
 But Jesus saved me! HALLELUJAH!

Turn up my level, still a Rebel, screaming HALLELUJAH
 Me and my partners on your block, we holla HALLELUJAH
 Was out my mind, my head was screwed up
 But Jesus saved me! HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 My soul was empty, my life was foolish
 But Jesus saved me! HALLELUJAH!!

Follow me, follow me, I'm a phenomenon, not because of what I do or the music I'm on

 Follow with shooters and gettin' caught up in too much, I found the Lord, was the truest, and now I follow the Son
 Enemy of the King like Sauron, He shoulda smashed ya boy, I was a moron
 Runnin' from the Truth, fulla 40 proof, half-naked looks that I only wanted more of
 Knew in my heart I was opposed to You, knew I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do
 Made in Your image, but I was more like a menace, and by Your grace I repented, and now I'm close to You
 I tell the world but when I tell 'em they don't listen
 "How you rappin'? but you Christian?" They don't get it so they dissin'
 But they shot Pac and they popped Biggie, I pray my killer gets saved when he done with me
 First put me on a plane, headed to the rap game, let me tell the whole world how the Lord did it
 Go and put me in line with all the worst sinners, only difference is I'm tall and a lil' thinner
 But if you ask who's forgiven, see my hand hit the ceiling, I been changed like weather after a cold winter

They can say what they wanna, I ain't scared of these people
 Lord is my shepherd, I fear no evil
 My soul was empty, my life was foolish
 But Jesus saved me! HALLELUJAH

Turn up my level, still a Rebel, screaming HALLELUJAH
 Me and my partners on your block, we holla HALLELUJAH
 Was out my mind, my head was screwed up
 But Jesus saved me! HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 Hey what you say? HALLELUJAH
 My soul was empty, my life was foolish
 But Jesus saved me! HALLELUJAH!!---Lyrics submitted by grot.
