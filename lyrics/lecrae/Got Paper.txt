Ayo man, ay let's do this right, you know what I'm talking about, yeah, yeah, hey

These brothers passin me and they all rollin fly coups
They throw some D's on it but they still aint got truth
They blow they cheese on it then they die and what's the use
I'm so secure in Jesus all I want in life is fruit
I, I, I don't need no fast money NOPE dont need a fast car
Yeah the faith is a race,  it  a'int a nascar
And you and God got beef
But you keep chasin money like them hundreds got feet
Buddy wanna be rich but even 50 done said
That he still feel broke even tho he got bread
Make em throw away they life got em runnin from feds
Love of money's like crack both of em will leave you dead
When you die and face God, nothing left to be said
Instead of chasing the truth you take a lie to the head
Homie all I can do is tell you what Jesus said
Repent and turn from your sin cause the kingdom of God's at hand
That's real

You got money, you got paper
Mon, mon, money, pay, pay, paper
Money, money, you got paper (so what who cares)
You got money, you got paper
Money, money, pay, pay, paper
Money, money, you got paper (I got Jesus baby)
You got money, you got paper, you got money
Paper, pay, pay, paper, you got paper 
(So what who cares)
You got money, you got paper, you got money
You got paper, you got money, pay, pay, paper (I got Jesus baby)

Ay, people they want cheese american mozzerella
The enemies rat trap might snap any second
I'm like that dude in matthew who after finding a treasure
Gave all he had to get it thats a real go getta
The 13 letters, the torah, Gospel and prophets
You've never see a soul who profits chasing the bucket
Now look at 1 Timothy 6 it's so clear
You chase the money and wind up in a snare
Now a vow of poverty no it's not there
But you pursue God the rest he takes care
You don't step on his back in order to get rich
If you do then you're in sin and ordered to REPENT
You come to Christ for God You come to Daddy for worship
He aint take that Cross to fund your vanity purchase
Even though we all agree death is certain
It seems we believe there's banks beyond earth (THATS CRAZY)

You got money, you got paper
Mon, mon, money, pay, pay, paper
Money, money, you got paper (so what who cares)
You got money, you got paper
Money, money, pay, pay, paper
Money, money, you got paper (I got Jesus baby)
You got money, you got paper, you got money
Paper, pay, pay, paper, you got paper 
(So what who cares)
You got money, you got paper, you got money
You got paper, you got money, pay, pay, paper (I got Jesus baby)

Money dough cash paper
If it was a woman I promise I used to date her
Now that we broke up she be callin ya boy a hater
Cause all I do is use her for glorifying my Maker
My treasure's up in heaven Christ is my satisfaction
If I was broke I'd be richer than folk who never had Him
God is the Gospel not a new bentley
Was empty and he gave me life and that's plenty
Get me...homie I could spend six centuries
Simply saying I'm satisfied in the sensei 
And it's sickening, that knowing God aint enough
We gotta tell em they can get rich quickly
Now this is heresy false it's not true
2nd Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 2 
Read that and please believe that
Forget a c-note man they pockets was e-flat
And they still had joy

You got money, you got paper
Mon, mon, money, pay, pay, paper
Money, money, you got paper (so what who cares)
You got money, you got paper
Money, money, pay, pay, paper
Money, money, you got paper (I got Jesus baby)
You got money, you got paper, you got money
Paper, pay, pay, paper, you got paper 
(So what who cares)
You got money, you got paper, you got money
You got paper, you got money, pay, pay, paper (I got Jesus baby)---Lyrics submitted by tarisai.
