I Know (x6) 
Boy I lost and I'm foolish, running off at the two lips 
Prolly wooing all the cruelest persecute us to fool us 
Catch me hanging with shooters rumored to strew your medula 
My momma told me they would screw us but I already knew it 
Who gon give 'em peace of mind ? They can piece of mine 
Know they thinkin' I'm blind but I just pay them no mind 
Yeah I know they be lyin', they misquoting my lines 
They like what you think you doin' putting hope in your rhymes 
You would think I'm shooting folk or putting coke in my rhymes 
I just give them bass for free and push the dopest of lines 
Boy you trippin' (I Know) 'Crae you slippin' (I know) 
I done heard this all before just sit back enjoy the show 
Yeah I know they gon' hate us, type they blogs up deface us 
They be fishin' for attention but don't know how to bait us 
Keep that hate on hiatus, big ups to my Creator 
No big bang just a banger, so tell that DJ to bang it! (yeah) 

I Know (x8) 
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though (x2) 
I know what they sayin' I ain't trippin' on it mane 
I just came to do my thing, something different for a change 

Listen, I K N O they tryin' to find out my M.O. 
I tell them God sent me they probably ain't get the memo (I know) 
I can't say that 'cause 'Jesus Walks: they don't play that (I know) 
Shouldn't be here 'cause people rollin' they trees here (I know) 
You can't help em, no trippers and killers welcome (I know) 
You can't hear it, no ignorance in my lyrics 
Boy they swear I went loco, 116 still my logo 
Catch us rollin' in that Volvo, gon snap you a photo 
Maybe Andy or Pro though, might see Trip in De Soto 
Maybe KB, maybe T-Dot, yeah I know you don't know though 
Yeah I know they don't like me, cause I be on my Spike Lee 
Even when I do the right thing, they still wanna fight me 
IRS want they taxes, police stop us in traffic 
Plus my girl be on my back, she say my life is so hectic 
Crae they watchin (I know), Ay they takin (I know) 
I done seen this before, this just part of the show, let's go 
I Know (x8) 
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though (I know) (x2) 
I know what they sayin' I ain't trippin' on it mane 
I just came to do my thing, something different for a change
