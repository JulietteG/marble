Calling all the messengers 
Calling all the messengers
Can you hear it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey

We've been given a call 
Been forgiven, risen, we livin' to give him our all 
Rise up from your past it's holding you down 
This moment is all that matters the future is now 
How will the people know if we don't tell 'em if we fail 'em 
They stumblin' in the dark but the light is what we carry 
Yea, don't have to wonder your purpose or what you here for 
Reflect his image and show the world what he cares for 

And I know it's alright 
And you know it's your life 
And we know that time's running out 
Can't wait around cause 
The time is now 

Calling all the messengers 
Calling all the messengers 
Calling all the messengers
Can you hear it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey

I've been a lot of places where the scene ain't pretty 
I've seen plenty of hatred death and destruction where ignorance kills many 
The blind leading the blind we turning a blind eye 
That alone is a crime we got the power of life 
I know that we make mistakes don't let 'em keep you away 
Mercy love and His grace is the reason we move ahead 
Speak out though we never been qualified to do it 
I ain't earned it, I was loved into it I'm brand new - yea 

And I know it's alright 
And you know it's your life 
And we know that time's running out 
Can't wait around cause 
The time is now  

Calling all the messengers 
Calling all the messengers 
Calling all the messengers
Can you hear it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey---
