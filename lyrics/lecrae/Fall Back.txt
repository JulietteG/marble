[Chorus:]
I know you might a seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me... you might wanna (fall back)

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Lies in the songs, lies on television
No telling what lies on the television
Learn sarcasm, sexism, racism
Learn to worship money, cars
Learn to hate Christians
All the Christians in the movies so typical
Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritic and mystical
They say since everybody's doing it it's normal
But Jesus says be transformed and don't let em conform you
You ain't thin enough you need a new diet
You need a psychic everybody does it you should try it
Spring break hit the beach what you're supposed to do?
Be careful what you let the media impose on you
You learn how to find peace from a TV show
You learn how to ride clean from the videos 
In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up
Call now and we can have your whole life fixed up (fall back)

[Chorus:]
I know you might a seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me... you might wanna (fall back)

The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the Word of God to lead me
And I ain't eatin everything they feed me
Tryin to deceive me... so I gotta (fall back)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
These days if you watch the, box you should block your
Mind in these times, and them lies that could lock you
They telling girls in our world to be hot stuff
And telling dudes link with crews on the block tough
Plus I'm feeling like they mock us
They think that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug, and live pleasing in His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
It's on that cash that they fix they mind
Man they always sayin "cheese" like it's picture time (be easy)
Tell em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame
And removed from them tired games
Then say my life it ain't mine man
We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change (fall back)

[Chorus:]
I know you might a seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me... you might wanna (fall back)

The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the Word of God to lead me
And I ain't eatin everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me... so I gotta (fall back)

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Be a rebel, let the Word of God lead you
Cuz Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
He will lead ya leach ya leave ya
So be careful as you navigate thru media
Take heed for gravity get the best of you
And you find the concrete bench pressin you
Use the Word of God to help you filter all that
Before you fall into the trap you better fall back

[Trip Lee:]
You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin how to walk that and saying "you ain't lurin me"
The media is meeting us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)
I know guys trying to hype you
But cling to the Lord's Word, flee from them vipers
We spitting aiming at your heart like snipers
We'd like fa you to desire God like Piper (fall back)

[Chorus:]
I know you might a seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me... you might wanna (fall back)

The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the Word of God to Lead me (fall back)
And I ain't eatin everything they feed me
Tryin to deceive me... so I gotta (fall back)---Lyrics submitted by Aiden Ellis.
