(feat. Kari Jobe)

Im just a broken instrument in the hands of the Greatest
So if the notes are off its cause I aint nothin to play with
And you can fault me, but aint we all off key
Majorin' in the minors like there aint no errors behind us
Somehow we still mix these melodies with my felonies
I aint buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me
Broken pieces actin' like we aint cracked
But we all messed up and caint no one escape that
We some broken people
Came from broken homes
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul
Alcoholics, the addicts
English, African, Arabs
Aint no riches to fix it
You still broke when you have it
If you aint breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit
It aint no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit
Aint a soul on the planet
Thats better than another
And we all need grace in the face of each other

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams
I thought I found
And you put me back together
I need your grace for my flaws
God Im broken in this mess Ive made
I need you to restore me

From Heaven we all small
Can't nobody buy tickets
You better have will call
That reaper he will call
They hurt just like me
Work just like me
Lust of the flesh that brought em life
They flirt just like me
Regardless of our money we all broke together
And if we don't swallow our bride we gon choke together
Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands
Fell off the wall of purity
Doing that Humpty dance
Forget the king's horses
Forget the king's men
The King is coming to put us back together again
I've been fighting since my daddy left
Fighting for approval
Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile
We [?] being less
Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest
We are outsiders, outliers, out-criers loud and meek
Inherit the earth,

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams
I thought I found
And you put me back together
I need your grace for my flaws
God Im broken in this mess Ive made
I need you to restore me

Your presence in me
Is all the strength that I need
Your presence in me
Is all the strength that I need
And I'll always be home
And I'll always be home

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams
I thought I found
And you put me back together
I need your grace for my flaws
God Im broken in this mess Ive made
I need you to restore me

You never left me
You never ran off
You never gave up

You never left me
You never ran off
You never gave up

You never left me
You never ran off
You never gave up---
