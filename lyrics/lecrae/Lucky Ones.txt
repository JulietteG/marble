Hook (Rudy Currence):
When its all said and done
You and I are the lucky ones
We fought many
And well fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here

Verse 1 (Lecrae):
Under the sun, I found we were left to drown
Evil abounds, weight is pullin us down
No sight or sound, impaired to His care
Chasing after the wind, running after the air
Deserving of desertion, servants of destruction
And everyday we taste of a grace that were unconcerned with
My sin I should be burned with, I'm guilty, filthy, and stained
But He became a curse, drank my cup and took my pain
And for that he reigns, through faith I'm changed
And I don't have a reason why he loosened up my chains
I don't believe in luck; I believe in Grace
But they say were lucky cause we seen your face
And we heard Him call us, and He heard our answer
And He gives us second chances when we throw our hands up
So weary and broken, hopin His arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into focus
(I guess we the luck ones, huh?)

Hook:

Verse 2 (Lecrae):
Youre greater than my shame, guilt, my doubt, and my past
Fortunate to trust in you cause I've doubted your plans
Ive questioned your ways, every question I raised
Is foolishness compared to mountains, the wind, and the waves
Youre so mindful of us, we rise from the dust
You love these cheating, beating hearts and these eyes full of lust
Gave us power to fight it, though we cower in quiet
We have the faith to start a riot; how can we deny it?
Fire inside us that you kindle when it starts to dwindle
And simply put Im sinful so your love is essential
I don't believe in luck, no, I believe in Grace
But they say we lucky cause we seen your face
Lord, we heard you call us, You heard our answer
And you give us second chances when we throw our hands up
Im weary and broken, but your arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into your focus

Bridge (Rudy Currence):
See, Im not sayin Im always right
And I aint sayin that Im perfect
And I know I dont deserve it
But Im glad I got this life
Im glad that I got it
And it makes me a lucky one
