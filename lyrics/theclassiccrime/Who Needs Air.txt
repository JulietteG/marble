I long to taste adventure like the nature of the sea 
always moving...always hiding 
all the creatures from beneath
save me silence, songs of sadness 
my heart waits for its chance
to dance upon the ashes and burnt up little plants
and i.. stand alone before the night
my nakedness is so clear, in the glowing moonlight.

life is old.. but so short
we are young... we want more

im drowning but i dont care... 
cause when you got what i got what i got 
who needs air.. 
i dont need air.

my addiction to danger like the rush of the sea 
like a wave on the rocks 
let them crash down on me
i dont need to prove the world to you only to myself 
so step back look away as i dive into the swell.

im drowning but i dont care 
cause when you got what i got what i got 
who needs air.

so take me down to the river like a little child 
and take my in and tell me its ok to be wild 
i never knew the world until i saw it through your eyes 
 never knew myself until i ripped up my disguise.

im drowning but i dont care.. 
cause when i got what i got what i got 
who needs air.

im drowning but i dont care 
cause when i got what i got 
i dont need air.

i dont need air.---Lyrics submitted by Makoto.
