My real estate
My life is dull
And dried up like the sound
A voice makes when the heart grows cold
And its going that way

I think Ill move out of state
Somewhere far from Seattle city lights
They burn my eyes
California sounds nice but Californias a lie
Maybe Im out of luck
Or maybe Im just blind
All this time

Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought wed be there long ago

My life is like a rolling river
So muddy and absurd
And although I might be mistaken
I know that Ill be heard
And I find the second I try to pull away
Im thrown back in line
All this time

So
Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul

Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought wed be there long ago

Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought wed be there long ago

And we are all looking for the same thing
The same thing

Seattle is calling me back home
Back home

So
Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought wed be there long ago

Rain on my hopes
Rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous
The pursuit of this dream
We thought wed be there long ago---Lyrics submitted by Mailia.
