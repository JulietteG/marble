-Verse 1-
It's like I never had time to look away. 
My body's stuck between death and decay. 
I'm plastic and set up on display. 
And their eyes are wide, and they are looking my way

Each ligament exposed, each muscle connected. 
And every organ that I proudly neglected. 
I've been arranged for all the common collected. 
Stomaching the sight of human flesh resurrected. 

-Pre-Chorus-
It seems we're fearfully made and designed. 
But it's a shame we can be so blind. 

-Chorus-
We're all the same, 
made of hair and bones and water and blood cells. 
We're all to blame, 
for spending way too much time on ourselves. 

-Verse 2-
I have been blessed and now I'm blind. 
A veil's been pulled over my eyes. 
Now every bad season that kept me believing seems so contrived. 

There's more glory to be seen 
and savored through suffering 
than ever was through self-serving escape. 

-Pre-Chorus-

-Chorus-

Ashes to ashes 
And dust to dust
