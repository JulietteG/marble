I had months to write a song
That captured who you are
But I fear I have done you wrong
Because I've failed you so far

The chord that struck, an angel fell
Skies went dark and it all comes down
The choices made, the lies forgotten
Oh, well

This is the way that I know
This is the way that I know
I would give everything for some hope

Are you different?
Could I be different too?
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you like I do

'Cause theres a song outside my window
And it plays to your tune
And theres a life inside this pencil
And it lives for what is true

'Cause I'm lost for words, the cost for her
Was way too much too bear
You're not perfect
But I don't care

This is the way that I know
This is the way that I know
I would give everything for some hope

Are you different?
Could I be different too?
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you like I do

Are you different?
Could I be different too?
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you like I do

Say the word, say the word

Are you different?
Could I be different too?
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you like I do

Are you different?
Could I be different too?
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you like I do

Are you different?
Could I be different too?
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you like I do---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
