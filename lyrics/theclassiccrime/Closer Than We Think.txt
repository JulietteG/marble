What's it gonna take for me? 
I'm on my hands and knees, 
while all the poets fill the pages of loose leaf 
I feel cheap, and I feel empty 
We will bathe in the sea of disbelief, but we will not go quickly. 
No we will not die so easily 

And I knew that this would happen, it always does 
And I couldn't stop my reaction, so I let it come 
I let it come 

I still hold the belief that we are free, 
that we don't need the rules to see 
that despite what we've done, we're not alone 
We're closer than we think to home 

It didn't take me long to believe that I could do anything, 
we turn the songs up loud so we can sing 
I am true and I am living 
We will walk through the valley of the shadow of the boring and burn it all 
No we will not go quietly 

And I knew that this would happen, it always does 
And I couldn't stop my reaction, so I let it come 
I let it come 

I still hold the belief that we are free, 
that we don't need the rules to see 
that despite what we've done, we're not alone 
We're closer than we think to home 

To home, to home 

Across the water you call me, but I'm not listening as I sink down 
Water fills my lungs as I begin to drown 
I knew that this would [happen] 

I still hold the belief that we are free, 
that we don't need the rules to see 
that despite what we've done, we're not alone 
We're closer than we think to home---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
