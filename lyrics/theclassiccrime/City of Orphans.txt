Jenny left from Idaho
And made her home in Capitol Hill
In a 300 square foot studio
Above a coffee shop near the Broadway Grill

And every night she walks the block
To trade in her time for cheap thrills
And everyone she meets is cool,
But just out of reach and it kills
She used to spend her nights
By firelight and singing to the stars
Now shes ours

Kevin left from Denver where
The air is clear and people are nice
And he traded it for sea level,
For misty rain, what a bitter compromise

For now he felt like he belonged
To those who understood him
But he sold his soul to fit right in
And he watched his friends desert him
He used to spend his nights
By candlelight and drinking wine to vinyl
Now hes ours

Its a city of orphans
Who had nowhere to go
So they cashed in their dreams
Headed northwest to the sea
And they called it their home

But most dont belong here
Were all running away
And well drain you dry of all semblance of life
We dont give we just take, take, take

But this city has no Bible
Theres no meaning you can use
Were all desperately searching for truth
Were a city of orphans
Who had nowhere to go
So we cashed in our dreams,
Filled our glasses with Beam
And our bodies with smoke
And we spend every weeknight
Trading pints at the Streamline
And we talk about truth
And we talk about love
But we wake up to lies, lies, lies

Its a city of orphans
Where did our fathers go?
We stumble around in the bad part of town
At the end of our hope
But there are no answers
On the tables of oak
If God could just hear us
We think that Hes near,
But He left long ago
Were a city of orphans
What do we do to ourselves?

We take all the good and the heaven around us and turn it to hell
