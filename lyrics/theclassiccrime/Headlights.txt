A summers drive away from dying: A broken heart, nothing to lose
I know it hurts so bad just trying to please the ones you hate to love
And I wrote this note about someone I used to know
So I'd remember how life can be so short
when you're left alone to wonder how it is someone opens and shuts the door

And I know you're cold, but come home
It's a shame how short we all have come

You set your mind on cruise control
Knuckles grip the wheel in fear to let it go
Love is empty, love is cruel
Love, it blindly breaks the rules
How could you have been a fool?
It's something all of us go through
You choke back tears and swallow lies,
but those wiper blades won't fix your eyes
Count on having clouded vision for at least a little while

And I know you're cold, but come home
It's a shame how short we all have come
And I know you're cold, but come home

Please don't face the headlights of the oncoming cars along
We won't forget the past
We won't forget the past (And I know you're cold)
Say all the answers and I will let you go
I won't look back
and I won't look back
Say all the answers
and I will let you go
I will let you go,
and I will let you go

Say all the answers and I will let you go
I won't look back
and I won't look back [x3]

Please don't face the headlights of the oncoming cars along
And I will let you go...---Lyrics submitted by Cesia.
