I know it cuts you inside every time that you try 
to take the pathway in life that leaves you so un-obliged. 
Every promise is lies, every smile makes you cry, it leaves you so un-alive. So un-alive. 
I wish I could take the fall, maybe that could solve the problems we're all having. 
It's been a while since you felt like you've been home, your life's just flesh and bone.
But your heart is worth more than you know, and one thing that hurts more than your life is to wake up one more time alone: it's to wake up more time alive.

(chorus:) 
So take us in, we'll stop you dead; we'll show you something you won't ever forget.
This life's a road, no place is home, my heart's a hole that needs to constantly be filled with love.

This time it's all that I've got, words hit the page like gunshots.
My stomach's left in a knot, and my pride is left here to rot.
It's been a while since I felt this restless,
by definition it's depression it's depression but I'm alright.
It kills to wake upone more time alone; It kills to wake up one more time alive.

(chorus)

I know the feeling of being alone, so let's drink to the fact that we're not.
I know the feeling of being alone, so let's drink to the fact that we're not.
