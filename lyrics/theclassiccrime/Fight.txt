Would you go to war for me?
Baby would you cry?
For the weak can die,
For the peace of men
Oh how did we know?
You and I've both known,
So lets let this roll of excuses burn and say

One day it all comes down to this,
You can sink or swim
You can have all of this
One day it all comes down,
One day we all come down
(chorus)
I'll take my heart back, and set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die and take who's coming with me
I'll take my heart back, and set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die and take who's coming with me
(chorus)

Step back for all the world to see,
Your life means all the world to me
I'll take all pain and suffering
But I'm such a sucker sometimes
Sometimes we don't know
That's why i got those bullet holes
Honey you feel so close
Don't let go until i say

One day we'll drink to this and say
"Remember when we died, we went out in flames"
One day we'll drink to this and say
"Remember when we died, we went out"

(chorus 2)
I'll take my heart back, and set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die and take who's coming with me
I'll take my heart back, and set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die, there will be blood in the streets
(chorus 2)

(chorus 3)
I'll take my heart back, and set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die and take who's coming with me
I'll take my heart back, and set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die and take who's coming
And take who's coming with me
(Chorus 3)---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
