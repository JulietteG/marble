What great risk to truly live
We could die alone
Our self proclaimed meaning of bliss is getting what we're owed.
It's always getting what we're owed.
I am like a machine, all that I really need is medicine and then I'll fall fast asleep
In my dreamlike state I'll pretend I'm unscathed but when I wake up my resilience fades
When I wake up my resilience fades
How long? How long?
How long? Long?

I know there's more to life than slavery, I'm tired of dying
I know there more to life than drinking this soul sick medicine

Oh no, no I'll never listen or do what I'm told
At twenty-four you'd think I'd hold my speech.
Instead I'll mix you a cocktail, some truth and some slander
and never practice what I preach.
And never practice what I preach
How long? How long?
How long? Long?

I know there's more to life than slavery, I'm tired of dying
I know there more to life than drinking this soul sick medicine
(x2)

I know there's more to life, I know there's more to life
I know there's more, I know there's more to life than drinking this soul sick medicine.---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
