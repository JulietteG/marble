She's got a solar powered life
She does without with direct sunlight
but every morning in the spring
she gets up in the morning 
and this is what she sings

Chorus:
My oh my what a beautiful day outside
hey hey what a beautiful day
my oh my what a beautiful day outside 
hey hey what a beautiful day
Yeah

My baby gets depressed at night
all hope is gone with the twilight
but every morning after dawn
she sings to me and this is her love song

Chorus

I give you everything you need
I give vacations by the sea if that's what you need girl
I give you everything you want
Sitting sipping smoothies with your sunglasses on

Chorus 2X---Lyrics submitted by Craig Chapman.
