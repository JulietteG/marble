I've been sitting in the suicide lane on
Highway 99
Looking for a sign in the headlights

I've been to war with my mind
But things will be different this time
I won't be putting up a fight

Give me your poison pills cuz Im
Digging my star crossed grave tonight

Don't wanna leave it alone
Don't wanna leave it
(2x)

I've been sitting by the train tracks
Here in the back door of my mind
Waiting for the planets to align

I've got every good reason
To make this open season
Keep my head up above the metal
Piece tonight

Give me your poison pills cuz Im
Digging my star crossed grave tonight

Don't wanna leave it alone
Don't wanna leave it
(2x)

Gravedigging
(3x)
We're digging our own grave

Give me your poison pills cuz Im
Digging my star crossed grave tonight

Don't wanna leave it alone
Don't wanna leave it
(2x)

Gravedigging
(3x)
We're digging our own grave---Lyrics submitted by drew.
