Please
All I wanted was a change
Lisa
I never wanted you to go that far away

Then ya had to go and leave me sittin'
All alone, oh baby how I miss ya so
And I'm so damn tired of thinkin'
She wiped the tears away a lifetime away
And laid a goodbye on me
And at night I can still hear you sayin'

Hang on to me (Baby oh)
Hang on to me
It ain't easy

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
So we can go on forever
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me

Lisa
Every time I turn around I see your face
Please
Give me a sign that says you're o.k.

Will ya let me know that you'll need me at
The door and take me everywhere ya go up in
The sky when I buy my ticket
I have a hard time sleepin'
Your ringin' your bell
Reminds me of all the time of playin'
At night I can still hear you sayin'

Hang on to me (Baby oh)
Hang on to me
It ain't easy

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
So we could go on together
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me

Hang on to me (Baby oh)
Hang on to me
It ain't easy

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
So we can go on forever
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
So we can go on forever

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
I never wanted to say goodbye
I always wondered why

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
It's another sleepless night
Are you really, are you alright

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
You're so far away
Oh I miss your face

Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me---Lyrics submitted by Shelli Wilson.
