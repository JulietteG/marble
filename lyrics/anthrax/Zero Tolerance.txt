The truth of humanity is far from insane
Its focused, its cruel, its heartbreak and pain

As if I needed more reasons to hate
A savage decision thats not hard to make

Family and friends, dare to threaten whats mine
I kill motherfuckers for crossing the line

Tighten the noose round my life and I choose
Murder and mayhem cause Im worse than you

Youre lying and I dont believe
Your message just so much bullshit
Youre lying and I have no faith
A scab on humanity to be scraped off
Youre vile and no less obscene
Debasing what they find holy
Make yourselves right with your God
I am I am I am I am
(On your knees for)
I am fire I am death and

Judge you as I see fit
Struck down from your bully pulpit
Sticking your head on a pike
I am I am I am I am
(On your knees for)
I am fire I am death and

No one can take what is mine
Youre selling delusion as virtue
Happily suffering the fools
Murder and mayhem cause Im worse than you
I am I am I am I am

I am fire I am death and I am fire I am death and

Humans kill each other and so often for every reason there is including none
Extreme school, inhuman rule, brutality nowhere to run
I am fire I am death and I am fire I am death and

And on the day you meet your god what will he say?

Zero tolerance for extremism - in the name of religion
Zero tolerance for racial hate - no police state
Zero tolerance for politicians - on the left and the right
Zero tolerance for killing children - what would your god say to that motherfuckers?---
