Waking on a bed of nails
Dying wind through shredded sails
Can you hear me when I shout
And nobody knows what Im talking about

What can I do?
Im trying to figure it out
Right here right now
Teaching me how

Kill all the ends its your cold black revenge
Mark my words
Defend avenge
Break till it bends its a means to an end
Defend avenge
Youre all gonna get what you fuckin deserve

Defend avenge

Your indifference abounds
Everywhere fence-sitting clowns
Harvesting the seeds of doubt
And nobody knows what Im talking about

What can I do?
Im trying to figure it out
Right here right now
Teaching me how

Kill all the ends its your cold black revenge
Mark my words
Defend avenge
Break till it bends its a means to an end
Defend avenge
Youre all gonna get what you fuckin deserve

Defend avenge---
