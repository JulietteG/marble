Why, I will destroy everything
Why, I'll tear your world apart

An honest hand, a shaking fist
Behind your back
Recidivist
And punishment
Your drug addicts
Brought low with shame and
Cut off at the wrist

Why, I will destroy everything
Why, I'll tear your world apart

All of, all of them thieves
All of, all of them thieves
Lied to cheated beat and deceived
Scarred mistreated a wicked conceit
An evil born of larceny
All of, all of them thieves

Despicable, your motive screams
Vile contempt
An insane dream
A lowlife play
And now you're stuck
A bankrupt pig with no one left to suck

Why, I will destroy everything
Why, I'll tear your world apart

All of, all of them thieves
All of, all of them thieves
Lied to cheated beat and deceived
Scarred mistreated a wicked conceit
An evil born of larceny
All of, all of them thieves

I will destroy everything
I'll tear your world apart

All of, all of them thieves
All of, all of them thieves
Lied to cheated beat and deceived
Scarred mistreated a wicked conceit
An evil born of larceny
All of, all of them thieves

All of, all of them thieves
All of, all of them thieves
This dead hand you gave to me
All of, all of them thieves
This dead hand you gave to me
All of, all of them thieves---
