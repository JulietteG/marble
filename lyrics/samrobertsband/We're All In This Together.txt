It is such a drag,
you're dressed in rags,
everybody waving these faded flags,
tongue tied a fire inside,
caught like a deer in the headlights.
Mine, mine, it isn't a lot
so why try to take more than I got,
more, more, we only want more,
it's not what we came, for it's not what we paid for.

We're all in this together, so keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop
We're all in this tougher, so keep moving don't stop, keep moving just go, go, go.

Every night I free fall into a dream,
mirrored halls in the chrome machine,
it's a phenomenon that goes on and on,
saying it right but you're doing it wrong.
Slow down you're going too fast now,
a delicate dance take your foot off the gas now,
don't try making it last now,
sooner later you're a thing of the past.

We're all in this together, so keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop
We're all in this together, so keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop.
We may never be the same again, we may never be the same again,
keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop,
we may never be the same again, we may never be the same again
keep moving don't stop, keep moving just go, go, go.

We are we are the angry apes,
we don't want to look at no empty plates.
We are we are the fire brigade,
all we want to do is set the record straight.
We are we are the first degree,
we're the thief, we're the judge, we're the jury.
We are we are the angry apes
shake the fruit from the vine till there's nothing to take now.

It's a phenomenon that goes on and on,
saying it right but you're doing it wrong,
tongue tied a fire inside,
caught like a deer in the headlights.
Slow down you're going too fast now,
a delicate dance take your foot off the gas now,
don't try making it last now,
sooner later you're a thing of the past.

We're all in this together, so keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop,
we're all in this tougher, so keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop,
we may never be the same again, we will never be the same again,
keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop,
we may never be the same again, we may never be the same again,
keep moving don't stop, keep moving don't stop,
keep moving don't stop, keep moving just go, go, go. ---
