You do you best
You take the fall
You reminisce
About almost nearly
Having it all

You see the stars
You try and catch one
Oooh
You try so hard
Chasing, nothing

Because
Were all no one
til someone thinks that were someone
til then were no one
And you got me looking at you

I said, were all no one
`til someone thinks that were someone
til then were no one
And you got me looking at you
Looking at you

Were all the same
We all have hopes
Ohh it gets insane
When youre slipping down that downward slope
I come with peace
I offer love
So if youre hearing me
Then hurry baby
Give it up

Because
Were all no one
til someone thinks that were someone
til then were no one
And you got me looking at you

I said, were all no one
`til someone thinks that were someone
til then were no one
And you got me looking at you
Looking at you

I said, were all no one
`til someone thinks that were someone

Oh
Cmon
Ooooh
Cmon

Do ya best, Do ya best, Do ya best, Do ya (x4)

Were all no one
til someone thinks that were someone
til then were no one
And you got me looking at you

I said, were all no one
`til someone thinks that were someone
til then were no one
And you got me looking at you
Looking at you---Lyrics submitted by aldo cotes.
