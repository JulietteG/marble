Eddie Money: No Control

Late at night and I still cant sleep
My bodys tired, but my thoughts are running deep
I guess I know just what youre going through
Because I kind of feel the same way too
Looking back, there was nothing we could do

Its not easy what youre going through
You call me up, and Im still wondering what to do
We both admit that its gone too far
Were just trying to find out who we are
Lonely nights is something that I dont want to see

Now your free and living fast
Its not easy looking at the past
It gets harder every day when youre running away

Running away

Looking back we shared a lot 
Is it worth it all to let go of what we got
All at once you cant ignore the fact
Some where some how we got off the track
Give it up, its changing you and changing me

If we have the chance to turn the clock back
Who knows how or when
Would it happen all again

Now your free and living fast
Its so tough to make a good thing last
It gets harder everyday when your running away

Its not easy living on your own
You miss your friends you want to go back home
It gets harder everyday when youre running away

Running away---Lyrics submitted by Scott Simpson.
