verse 1:

i took the bus down Bathurst St. and saw where,
all the lonely people meet down there.
i sat on a pile of cigarettes and blew,
icicles with one short breath t'wards you.

chorus:

there's black ice
no sign

verse 2:
oooooohhh oooooohhh
and temper me temper this, ive tried,
in fit in e'vry thing in a small time.
the winter brings a heavyness this way,
so hand over the things i shouldnt say.

chorus:

there's black ice
no sign
there's black ice
no sign---Lyrics submitted by jenny.
