Here on these hours,
the sun hangs over
the parallel, a spell.
We feel the myth, the distance like a metal case.

My family, the limbs of which, spread
the body of this land.
I'll pour my blood on this place,
to keep you safe, keep you safe.

We'll send it home, balikbayan. 
We'll send it home, balikbayan.

The heavy freight, it carried
the weight, of a better life.
You separate, your kids get old,
the air gets cold, we feel alone.

Our country, this in between,
the hours hang; we're still not paid.
We'll fold our clothes, and write our notes -
send them home, send them home.

We'll send it home, balikbayan.
We'll send it home, balikbayan. ---Lyrics submitted by Mich Estaol.
