Something tells me you've been missing out 
On all the places in town we always used to go
So I'm stuck here, to figure now 
At the chance we had
Made you pack your bags.

3000 miles from the place you once called home.
So much different, you're getting distant, and now,
I'm the only one who's all alone. 
The fact about fiction is that it's always in your head
So let it all go, what you don't know, is that, 
I'd pick you, yeah, I'd pick you instead. 

So drink down the bottle and just go to bed,
This whole situation is going right over your head. 
So you're out of your body? 
Why don't you come to mine.
'Cause right now, what it takes to fall,
Is what it takes to climb.

3000 Miles from the place you once called home.
So much different, you're getting distant, and now,
I'm the only one who's all alone.
The fact about fiction is that it's always in your head, 
So let it all go, what you don't know, is that
I'd pick you, yeah, I'd pick you instead.

So break away from the simple things in life,
'Cause when the moon comes out, there is no doubt that it is always by your side
I never thought you could be so happy
With a ticket in your hand and a plane ride back to home.
I guess for now I'll have to settle for the fact that what we could've been,
Is what I'll never know.

You're 3000 miles from the place you once called home,
So much different, you're getting distant, and now,
I'm the only one who's all alone. 

I'm writing postcards to let you know how much I care,
Saying the only thing that gets me by is when I close my eyes, 
And pretend you're there.---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
