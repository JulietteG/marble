It's time like these where i lose myself,
in the stories my old man would tell,
about life, true love and war. 
The kind of war where you beat yourself.

'Cause now I've got this stomach pain,
the kind of pain that gets worse when the rain hits hard.
Like my fist
I try to explain to the wall this mess I'm in. 

See I'm tired now and my mind won't quit,
since i got the news that you were sick,
I though of life, time and death, 
If i could only use my breath. 

I breathe my life into your lungs,
with love and strength i have faith i will lift you up. 
It's a lesson learned,

As we move on, i still need you around
I'd be lost without you
I'm not sure i can face this world on my own.

No i don't wanna go on alone.
No i don't wanna go on alone.
I don't wanna go

Now I'm terrified that this fear exists,
and scared T'll come to terms with it 
But that's life, you are what you leave,
the simple lessons my dad taught me.

I know we all grow old and die,
and make a place in another life 
I'm glad that there's still time

To let you know i still need you around,
I'd be lost without you.
I'm not sure i can face this world on my own. 
No i don't wanna go on alone.
No i don't wanna go on alone.
I don't wanna go 

So live it up, live it up
'Cause you never know, never know
Time is always running, it will always guide you home.
(x3) 

I don't wanna go on alone (its times like these where i lose myself) 
(x3)

I don't wanna go on alone---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
