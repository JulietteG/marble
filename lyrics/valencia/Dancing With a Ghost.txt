Have you skipped through broken records of your past and future selfs?
Desperate to find exactly how it was you felt?
'Cause when you fell, you fell hard. 
From dancing with a ghost.

When you don't understand the walls that break your hopes of going home,
The truth hurts a lot more when it's from someone that you love.
It'll make you fall, and fall hard.
When you're dancing with a ghost. 

It's in the middle of your head, the middle of your head!
Don't say you don't, don't know what it's like. 
Try sinking your teeth in, face the commitment. 
You'll feel better when you face, face, all of your fears.
Don't take it out on the music, feel your feet movin'!
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow,
When you're dancing with a ghost.

Some days I float too far away from every point I try to make. 
I stumble over words, get lost in empty boring space.
If i don't make sense, then i don't connect. 
The feeling just escapes. 

So just take me as i am, and push me, put me in my place.
'Cause if I just pretend, I'll feel like everything's okay.
And when I fall, I fall hard.
From dancing with a ghost. 
And when i fall fall, I'll fall hard
From dancing with a ghost. 

It's in the middle of my head, the middle of my head!
Don't say you don't, don't, know what it's like,
Try sinking your teeth in, face the commitment!
You'll feel better when you face, face all of your fears
Don't take it out on the music, feel your feet movin'!
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow,
Sometimes you feel complete, and sometimes you feel hollow,
Don't be afraid to change
'Cause you know its all in the middle of your head!
Stop livin' in the past!

Don't say you don't, don't know what it's like
Try sinkin' your teeth in, face the commitment!
You'll feel better when you face, face, all of your fears
Don't take it out on the music, feel your feet movin! (x2)

When you're dancin' with a ghost.---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
