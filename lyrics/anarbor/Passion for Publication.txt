It's the calming before the storm
Alcohol sits nicely in your stomach warm
When you wake up hungover 
You wish you were sober.

I've danced with the devil
And dreamed with the demons
Fell asleep with debt 
Then fell short of breath.
When you wake up hungover
You wish you were sober.

Just be pretty but nave,
Anything you hear is what you believe
Let the rhyme get stuck in your head
Wish you had undressed me in your head.

It's the low before the high
It's been so long you thought you would die
When you wake up hungover
You wish you were sober.

And I'll be counting the days that the sun goes past
With the clouds beneath my feet.

Just be pretty but nave
Anything you hear is what you believe
Let the rhyme get stuck in your head
Wish you had undressed me in your bed.

'Cause we've been falling apart
Built to crumble from the start
I'm a cold metal machine
And I'll do things you've never seen.

Just be pretty but nave
Anything you hear is what you believe
Let the rhyme get stuck in your head
Wish you had undressed me in your...

Just be pretty but nave
Anything you hear is what you believe
Let the rhyme get stuck in your head
Wish you had undressed me in your bed.

'Cause we've been falling apart
Built to crumble from the start
I'm a cold metal machine
And I'll do things you've never seen.

And what they don't tell you in church is
Saints are sinners too.---Lyrics submitted by Kana.
