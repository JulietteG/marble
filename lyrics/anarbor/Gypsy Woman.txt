I think she took my soul, but i didn't know,
That gypsy woman's got me under control. 
She fed me lies as she cast her spells,
That gpsy woman's really rinigin' my bells.

And to hell, i will go, knockin' right on Satan's door.
Heavens no, this ain't it,
Honey i won't beg, I'll just take it quick.

She took me too my knees and now shes got me prayin'

Save, me, she's a liar!
And i cant, seem to untie
The rope, shes got wrapped around her finger,
I think I lost the last bit of my self control!

I can feel the whole that she left, 
That gypsy woman robbed my of my best.
She said she couldn't say,
Gypsy woman wore black on her wedding day.

And to hell, I will go, knockin' right on Satans door,
Heavens no, this ain't it, honey I wont beg I'll just take it quick.

She took me to my knees and now she's got me prayin'

Save, me, she's a liar, and I can't seem to untie the rope,
She's got wrapped around her finger,
I think I lost the last bit of my self control!

'Cause I dont need what you've been giving me
So gypsy woman stay the hell away from me.
'Cause I dont need what you've been giving me
So gypsy woman stay the hell away from me.
'Cause I dont need what you've been giving me
So gypsy woman stay the fuck away from me!

(Save me, yeah) Save me, shes a liar.
And I cant seem to untie the rope,
Shes got wrapped around her finger
I think I lost the last bit of my self control!

Yeah shes a liar.
And I cant untie the rope,
Shes got wrapped around her finger
I think I lost the last bit of my self control!

My self control!---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
