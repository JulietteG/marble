I woke up this morning, caught sleepin' in
And noticed the sun was creeping in.
I picture some people I've never seen
One family's love can spark my dreams.

The coldest year we've had-
Oh-so far from Mom and Dad.
Colored pills and alcohol-
We'll make it better after all.

And I'll... I'll get through this,
No one can stop me now.
Time is useless when your head's caught up in the clouds.

Time flies by when you love someone,
And the hands stand still when it's overdone.
But getting caught up inside of my past,
Friends come and go, but only family will last.

The coldest year we've had-
Oh-so far from Mom and Dad.
Colored leaves fall from the trees;
I just try to make you proud of me.

And I'll... I'll get through this,
No one can stop me now.
Time is useless when your head's caught up in the clouds.

(Oh...)
I'll get through this...
I'll get through this,
No one can stop me now.
Time is useless when your head's caught up in the clouds.
Oh, and I'll get through this,
No one can stop me now.
Time is useless, yeah, when your head's caught up in the clouds---
