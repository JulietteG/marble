Oh you're Mr. Big Shot
And you think that you've got a lot
Do you mean to tell me, I'm not worthy?

Oh you're Mr. Big Shot
Ever think that your going to get caught
I've been wondering lately, You're not ready

Oh you think that you're hot as hell
Oh you think that they can't tell
But deep down you're just a baby

Someday you'll come knocking on my door
And I'll leave you lonely, I don't want you anymore
My bones are stronger than before
So don't come around my way
I'll kick your ass right out the door

And oh and you're Mr. Big Shot
Yeah you really think you hit the spot
But someone told me, You're all stories

Oh you're Mr. Big Shot
And life's not about what you got
So don't you tell me, I'm not happy 

Oh you think that you're hot as hell
Oh you think that they can't tell
But deep down you're just a baby

Someday you'll come knocking on my door
And I'll leave you lonely
I don't want you anymore
My bones are stronger than before
So don't come around my way
I'll kick your ass right out the door 

Is that all you got, Mr. Big Shot?

Is that all you got, Mr. Big Shot?

Oh you think you're hot as hell
Oh you think that they can't tell
But deep down you're just a baby

Someday you'll come knocking on my door
And I'll leave you lonely
I don't want you anymore
My bones are stronger than before
So don't come around my way
I'll kick your ass right out the door

I'll kick your ass right out the door---Lyrics submitted by Adaja.
