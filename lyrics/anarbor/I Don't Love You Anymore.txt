"I can feel I'm breaking through,
Rushing toward the core view.
Destroying your anatomy
You bring out the worst in me
oh oh oh

Can't you tell that I'm afraid, 
I don't want to live this way
Destroying your anatomy
You bring out the worst in me
oh oh oh

If this is love then fuck it, I  don't want it anymore
If this is love then fuck it, I was better off before
If this is love then fuck it, Lose the battle win the war.
I don't love you anymore.

Ripping your own chest apart
Won't stop till you're beating heart
Bit off more than you could chew
I learned everything from you, oh. 
oh oh oh oh.

I don't think you realize
you used to buy your alibis
bit off more than you could chew
I learned everything from you
oh oh oh

If this is love then fuck it, I  don't want it anymore
If this is love then fuck it, I was better off before
If this is love then fuck it, lose the battle win the war.
I don't love you anymore.

You hate my friends
It never ends
I lift you up
You put me down
into my grave
you've got the dirt
you smiled and waved

If this is love then fuck it, I  don't want it anymore
If this is love then fuck it, I was better off before
If this is love then fuck it, lose the battle win the war.
I don't love you anymore.

If this is love then fuck it, I  don't want it anymore
If this is love then fuck it, I was better off before
If this is love then fuck it, lose the battle win the war.
I don't love you anymore.

(If this is love then fuck it, I don't want it anymore)
I don't love you anymore
(If this is love then fuck it, I was better off before)
I don't love you anymore
(If this love then fuck it)
Lose the battle win the war
I don't love you anymore!"---Lyrics submitted by Azyyie.
