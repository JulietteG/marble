I am weak to your temptation oh
With imagination comes obligation
I love you to death but to you I am
Well I love you to death but to you I'm already dead
I'm already dead
I'm already dead

I'm a mess between my heart and head

I feel like I'm just floating away yeah
Oh God I wish that I could stay
I'ts hard I admit but baby don't quit yeah
We can make it yeah
We can make it

I'm am weak to your affection babe
All I need is your attention
I love you to death but to you I am
Well I love you to death but to you I'm already dead
I'm already dead
I'm already dead

I'm a mess between my heart and head

I feel like I'm just floating away
Oh God I wish that I could stay
I'ts hard I admit but baby don't quit yeah
We can make it yeah
We can make it

Don't trouble your pretty little head
Theres only room for love
Theres only room for love instead (x4)

I feel like I'm just floating away
Oh God I wish that I could stay
I'ts hard I admit but baby don't quit
We can make it yeah
We can make it---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
