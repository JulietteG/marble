Just like the day that I met you
You didn't say a word
But I still knew
Did you really think I wouldn't see?
You were lying straight through your teeth

Such a waste of a wonderful day
Wrecked and ruined by your slanderious ways
By the games you play, oh by the games you play

It will be the death of me
Before I let you get the best of me girl
It will be the death of me
Before I let you get the best of me

You're the monster underneath
Lost of all faith
Feeding off my dreams
Where I thought I was safe

Just like the day that I met you
You didn't say a word
But I still knew
You were lying straight through your teeth
Oh you were lying straight through your teeth

Did you think you would prove the whole world wrong?
Everythings never enough
Baby you're so, well you're just too much
Everythings never enough


It will be the death of me
Before I let you get the best of me girl
It will be the death of me
Before I let you get the best of me

You're the monster underneath
Lost of all faith
Feeding off my dreams
Where I thought I was safe

So shut your mouth
And bite your tongue
Because your a liar never foolin anyone
You're the smoke in the air making everyone choke

You're the monster underneath
Lost of all faith
Feeding off my dreams
Where I thought I was safe

So shut your mouth
And bite your tongue
Because you're a liar never foolin anyone---Lyrics submitted by victoria.
