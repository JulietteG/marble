Hmmmmmmmmmm.
Hmmmmmmmmmm.
Hmmmmmmmmmm.
Hmmmmmmmmmm.

There shines a light in the heart of man
That defies the dead of the night
A beam that glows within every soul
Like wings of hope taking flight

A sunny day, when a baby's born
The little things that we say
A special sparkle in someone's eye
Simple gifts, every day

Somewhere there's a paradise
Where everyone finds release
It's here on earth and between your eyes
A place we all find our peace

Come - open your heart
Reach for the stars
Believe your own power
Now, here in this place
Here on this earth
This is the hour
 It's just a place we call paradise
Each of us has his own
It has no name, no, it has no price
It's just a place we call home
A dream that reaches beyond the stars
The endless blue of the skies
Forever wondering who we are?
Forever questioning why?

Come - open your heart
Reach for the stars
Believe your own power
Now, here in this place
Here on this earth
This is the hour

There shines a light in the heart of man
That defies the dead of the night
A beam that glows within every soul
Like wings of hope taking flight
Like wings of hope taking flight---Lyrics submitted by carlos.
