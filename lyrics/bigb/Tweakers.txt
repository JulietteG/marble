Hey Tweakers  stay the fuck away

   (chorus)
Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there
Dont ask me why they messin with my high
Taking up my time, fucking with my mind

(verse 1)
Heres a lil story that I like to tell about all them tweakers how
We know so well, up for five days, running their main eye glaze 
Now a days seems everybody knows one 
Some dumb, fun, some sucked up like a skeleton tweaked out, freaked 
Out, paranoid schizo. All ways on the go in the sack cause they were normal 
Not that long ago. YEAH things change, they polluted their  brains with recreational use of full blown things. Snorting, & smoking, & shooting it up 
However they can get it, they dont give a fuck 

(chorus) 
 Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there
Dont ask me why they messin with my high
Taking up my time, fucking with my mind
But Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Hey tweakers leave that shit alone

(Verse 2)
Its 3a.m  they hanging at Wal*Mart looking for something to take apart 
There obessed with saudering guns & turmal tools but when your tweaked 
Out I guess there aint no rules looking like a super chicken straight scrappin, buzz killers, shit stealers one time beef grinders, counter re-winders to who all need sleep now, the human body wasnt meant to stay up for two weeks (alright) YEAH
Talk to a cricket they got it all together whatever you can do, they can do  but better Cause you energy is weary I know your listening but can you hear me?


(Chorus)
Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there
Dont ask me why they messin with my high
Taking up my time, fucking with my mind
But Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Hey tweakers leave that shit alone


(Bridge)
Hey Mr. tweaker you think your slick you broke into my house stole my shit, your about to die because of  a drug. Imma put it in your coolo and Im really slug 

     There they go again 
    And their at it again
    And their at it again
   & their at it again  
There they go again 
    And their at it again
    And their at it again
   & their at it again  

(Verse 3)
Now Joe was a tweaker that I once new he had a friend named Mike that was a tweaker too, I guess you could say they were a tweaker crew. 
Joe had a wife who was sweet & innocent but became a tweaker too and
Viola a tweaker residence, Joe had a bother he invited to stay he wasnt a tweaker but ended up that way, now Joe had a small business but whoever 
Works for him would soon witness how fucked up speed makes you become. They all tried to quit but the damage was done you ask if I got sympathy Yeah Right 
I got NONE





(chorus)
Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there
Dont ask me why they messin with my high
Taking up my time, fucking with my mind
But Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Everywhere I go there tweakers there 
Hey tweakers leave that shit alone
