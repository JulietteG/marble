And in this song, we employ the use of numbers
And what Ill do is have a volunteer give me a number
And Ill take that number
And make a verse for a song out it

Now, if someone will give me
A number between 20 and 22
Ill show you, what I mean, 21
Thats very good, first time, 21

Well, 21 take away 9
12 little children standing in a line
From that take 2 that leaves you 10
Take away 8 and you got 2 again

Yeah, you got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now you got 2 again
You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 
again


Now see how easy that was
For the second verse
I need someone to give me a number
Between 12 and 14, I'll make a verse, 13

13, ah, 13, well, 13 multiplied by 1
You still got 13 but wasnt that fun
Now, take that same 13 multiply by 2
26 hours the train's overdue

Yeah, you got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now you got 2 again
You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again


10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
Happy people divided by 1
Leave nothing, nothing, none

You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again
You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again

You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again---Lyrics submitted by Bill Johnson.
