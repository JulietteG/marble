Youre pink youre young youre middle-class
they say it doesnt matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
youre shooting up the ladder

Your mind is racing like a pro, now
Oh my god it doesnt mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god it was a million years ago

Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
sometimes you stay in bed
sometimes you go la di da di da di da da
til your eyes roll back into your head

Your mind is racing like a pro, now
Oh my god it doesnt mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god it was a million years ago

Youre dumbstruck baby
Youre dumbstruck baby now you know
Youre dumbstruck baby
Youre dumbstruck baby now you know

Your mind is racing like a pro, now
Oh my god it doesnt mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god it was a million years ago

Youre dumbstruck baby
Youre dumbstruck baby now you know
Youre dumbstruck baby
Youre dumbstruck baby now you know
Youre dumbstruck baby---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
