your walking taller than you should
the air is thinning around your
beautiful head.

your saying things with-your mouth to me
that i dont recognize
your wearing yourself lately
refining yourself
designing yourself
heaven look at me forever

gotta diagram of your associations
a strategy
your weighing your options
what would you trade me for?

your measuring me lately
and i can tell
and i can tell im losing weight
your measuring me lately
your dressing me

tonight
tell me ive changed
your just raising your standards

tonight
give me away
i am the same
i am the same

have you found him?
have you told him everything?
does he say he feels bad
about all of this?

you show
tenderness for me
tenderness for me
to him

tonight
tell me ive changed
your just raising your standards

tonight
give me away
i am the same
i am the same---Lyrics submitted by Gemini.
