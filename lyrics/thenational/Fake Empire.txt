Stay out super late tonight picking apples, making pies
put a little something in our lemonade and take it with us
were half-awake in a fake empire
were half-awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city with our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice
bluebirds on our shoulders
were half-awake in a fake empire
were half-awake in a fake empire

Turn the light out say goodnight
no thinking for a little while
lets not try to figure out everything it wants
Its hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
were half-awake in a fake empire
were half-awake in a fake empire---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
