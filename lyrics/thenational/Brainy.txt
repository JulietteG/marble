Ive been draggin around from the end of you coat for two weeks, ah ah.
Everywhere you go is swirlin, everything you say has water under it, ah ah.
You know I keep your fingerprints in a pink folder in the middle of my table
youre the tall kingdom I surround
think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
come home in the car you love, brainy brainy brainy

Ive been draggin around from the end of you coat for two weeks, ah ah.
You keep changing youre fancy fancy mind every time I decide to let go
I was up all night again, boning up and reading the American dictionary
youll never believe me what I found
think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
come home in the car you love, brainy brainy brainy
You might need me more than you think you will
come home in the car you love, brainy brainy brainy---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
