Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle
Where they hang the lights
Where it's random, and it's common versus common
La di la
[repeat]

I've got five hundred in twenties
And I've got a ton of great ideas
I'm really worked up
I'm on a good mixture, I don't want to waste it
I'm on a good mixture, I do not want to waste it
I wanna go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up

Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle
Where they hang the lights
Where it's random, and it's common versus common
La di la
[repeat]

I have weird memories of you
Wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you
Pissing in a sink, I think
I have weird memories of you

I wanna go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up
I wanna go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up

Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle
Where they hang the lights
Where it's random, and it's common versus common
La di la
[repeat]

I have weird memories of you
Wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you
Pissing in a sink, I think

I have weird memories of you

Parking your car, you said, I'm overwhelmed
You were thinking out loud, you said, I'm overwhelmed
You were parking your car, you said, I'm overwhelmed
You were thinking out loud, you said, I'm overwhelmed
You said, I think I'm like Tennessee Williams
I wait for the click
I wait, but it doesn't kick in
I think I'm like Tennesse Williams
I wait for the click
I wait, but it doesn't kick in

I have weird memories of you
Wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you
Pissing in a sink, I think
I have weird memories of you
la da da da...

I have weird memories of you---Lyrics submitted by Eder.
