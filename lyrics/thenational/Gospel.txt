I got two armfuls of magazines for you
Ill bring em over
so hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden and Ill
Ill bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over I can waist your time Im bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
and well play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
well stand by the pool
well through out our golden arms

Darlin can you tie my string
killers are callin on me
my angel face is fallin
feathers are fallin on my feet
Darlin can you tie my string
killers are callin on me

Stay near your, stay near your television
Set it up outside
and hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden and Ill
Ill bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over I can waist your time Im bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
and well play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
well stand by the pool
well through out our golden arms

Darlin can you tie my string
killers are callin on me
my angel face is fallin
feathers are fallin on my feet
my angel face is fallin
feathers are fallin on my feet
Darlin can you tie my string
killers are callin on me
Darlin can you tie my string
killers are callin on me---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
