Underline everything, Im a professional in my beloved white shirt
Underline everything, Im a professional in my beloved white shirt
I'm going down among the saints

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens! Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens! Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!

Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves and I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves and I wanna rush in with the fools

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens! Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens! Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!

3:30 in the last night for you to save this
Youre zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out
3:30 in the last night for you to save this
Youre zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out

This isnt working, you, my middlebrow fuck-up---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
