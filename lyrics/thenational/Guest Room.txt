Theyre gonna send us to prison for jerks
for having vague ideas of the way to turn each other on again
Theyre gonna send us to prison for jerks

Theyll find us here here here in the guest room
where we throw money at each other and cry, oh my

We miss being ruffians, going wild and bright
in the corners of front yards
getting in and out of cars
we miss being deviants

Theyll find us here here here in the guest room
where we throw money at each other and cry, oh my

We cant stay here
were starting to stay the same
We cant stay here
we cant stay this way

Just tie your woman to your wrist
give her room to tie the other

Theyll find us here here here in the guest room
where we throw money at each other and cry, oh my---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
