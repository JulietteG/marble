(feat. Justin Vernon of Bon Iver)

I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I cant get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden
And you got out and said Im sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

Im under the gun again
I know I was the 45% of then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I cant get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Theres some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
In a week well be together
Try to call you when Im landed
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you said Im sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
Ill try to call you from the party
Its full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

Im under the gun again
I know I was the 45% of then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I cant get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I keep feeling smaller and smaller ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
