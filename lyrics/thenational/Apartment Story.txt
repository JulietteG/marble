Be still for a second while I try and try to pin your flowers on la la la la
Can you carry my drink I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
Im getting tied, Im forgetting why

Oh were so disarming darling, everything we did believe
is diving diving diving diving off the balcony
Tired and wired we ruin too easy
sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave

Hold ourselves together with our arms around the stereo for hours, la la la la
While it sings to itself or whatever it does
when it sings to itself of its long lost loves
Im getting tied, Im forgetting why

Tired and wired we ruin too easy
sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
but Ill be with you behind the couch when they come
on a different day just like this one

Well stay inside til somebody finds us
do whatever the TV tells us
stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days
Well stay inside til somebody finds us
do whatever the TV tells us
stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

so worry not
all things are well
well be alright
we have our looks and perfume

stay inside til somebody finds us
do whatever the TV tells us
stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

so worry not
all things are well
well be alright
we have our looks and perfume on---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
