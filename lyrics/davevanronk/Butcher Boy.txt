She went upstairs to make her bed.
Not a word to her mother said.
Her mother she went upstairs too,
Saying daughter, daughter whats troubling you?
Oh mother, mother, I may not tell,
Its the butcher boy I love so well.
Hes courted me my life away,
And now at home he will not stay.
There is a tavern in yonder town,
Where he goes and sits him down.
He sits those pretty girls on his knee,
And he tells them tales he wont tell me.
Her father he come home from work,
He ask for his daughter, she seems so hurt.
He went upstairs to give him hope,
And he found her hanging by a rope.
He took his knife and cut her down,
And on her bosom these words he found.
Oh what a foolish girl have I,
For such a cruel young man to die.
Go dig my grave both wide and deep,
Marble slab at my head and feet.
And on my grave carve a snow white dove.
To let the world know I died for love. ---
