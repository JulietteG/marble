Well it's early in the morn'n, the morn'n
Well, when I rise, a well a
Well it's early in the morn'n, the morn'n
Well a, when I rise, a well

A well it's early in the morn'n, the morn'n
Well when I rise, baby
I got an aching, little mama
In my right side, a well

in my right side, baby
in my right side, sugar
I got an aching, miss mama
In my right side, a well

I ain't ever been to Georgia, Georgia
But I've been told, a well a
I ain't a never been to Georgia, Georgia
But I've been told, a well

I ain't ever been to Georgia, Georgia
But I've been told, a well a
Well a Georgie women, mama
Got a sweet jelly roll, a well

Well who sum ever told, did he told her
Told a dirty lie, a well a
Well a who sum ever told, did he told her
Told a dirty lie, a well

Well who sum ever told, did he told her
Told a dirty lie, a well a
He said the eagle on the dollar, baby
Gonna rise and fly, a well

He gonna rise and fly in the morn'n
He gonna rise and fly in the even'n
He said the eagle on the dollar, baby
Gonna rise and fly, a well

It takes a rocks and a gravel, to make a
To make a solid road, a well a
It takes a rocks and a gravel, to make a
Make a solid road, a well

It takes a rocks and a gravel, to make a
To make a solid road, a well a
It takes a good look'n woman, baby
To make a good look'n whore, a well

Well it's early in the morn'n, the morn'n
Well a, when I rise, a well a
Well it's early in the morn'n, the morn'n
Well a when I rise, a well

Well it's early in the morn'n, the morning
Well when I rise, a well
I got an aching near me, baby
In my right side, a well

In my right side, a sugar
In my right side, a baby
I got an aching near me, mama
In my right side, a well

Well who sum ever told, did he told her
He told a dirty lie, a well a
Well who sum ever told, did he told her
He told a dirty lie, a well

Well who sum ever told, did he told her
He told a dirty lie, a well a
He said the eagle on the dollar, baby
He gonna rise and fly, a well

[fading begins]

He gonna rise and fly in the morning
He gonna rise and fly in the evening
He said the eagle on the dollar, baby
Gonna rise and fly, a well...
