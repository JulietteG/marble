When you get back we can run away
rent an apartment with studio space
invited by the world to meet face to face
finally catch the things that we've chased

and just like every other kid we wanted you to understand

well the thought caught and landed on a breeze
picked up our bags and sailed over seas
up above the world all we could see
a couple of buildings but mostly just trees

it's scary to bury your fears

well rehearsed in all of our roles
no time to think of what we were told
out into the world stay we can't stay
says you're either acting or watching the play

we have to stay and we have to go
and all the little people they want to understand---Lyrics submitted by Jijin P.
