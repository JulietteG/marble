I gotta a big boss man
Just won't treat me right 
Works me hard all day long
I can't sleep at night

He standing on the turn road
with his pistol in his hand
He done whooped a woman
gonna kill that man
He's a big boss man
Just won't treat me right 
Works me hard all day long
I can't sleep at night

I told my wife last night
Just pack up your things and go
I ain't gonna work for that
 mean boss man no more
'Cause he's a big boss man
no one hear me call
well you ain't so big
you just tall that's all

He's standin' on his corner
with his hat on his head
Get mad and you can't 
Understand what he said
'Cause he's a mean boss man
Just won't treat me right 
Work me hard all day 
I can't sleep at night

Next boss i get
Gonna be right to me
When I go to him
He gonna let me be
'Cause he's a mean boss man
Just won't treat me right 
Work me hard all day long people
I can't sleep at night

Next boss man I work for 
he gotta treat me right
I been working here all day
and let me sleep at night
Cause he's a big boss man
don't you hear me call?
you ain't so big
you just tall thats all---Lyrics submitted by ariel rabinovic.
