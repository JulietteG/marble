I hope you're breathing you last breath
Marshal Dear
And you will die, you will die soon
I give you a quarter of an hour
Oh Marshall Dear
Can't see I'm winning

Can you hear me now
Silence yourself
Silence yourself
Silence yourself
Silence yourself

There are suicides in every dreams
Oh Marshal dear
Even more when the army's on its knees
Crowds grow crazy and fire
Oh marshal dear
Can't you see we're losing

Can you hear me now
Silence yourself
Silence yourself---Lyrics submitted by Guillermo.
