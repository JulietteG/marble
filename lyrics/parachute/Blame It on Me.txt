You can blame it on the small things
You can blame it on your heartbeat, the wrong day
You can blame it on your regrets
And all your little secrets you keep them

You can show me all your old scars
You got from all the old wars
You fought so you could tell me
I'm not the one who needs the saving

You can say what you want but it's only getting better
It's alright, oh baby it's alright
You can try to deny but it's only getting better
It's alright, oh baby it's alright now

You think it feels right but you don't know
You've got everything you wanted but you're not sure
You can say what you please if it's all that you need
To believe it's getting better, you can blame it on me

There's a million ways to hold on
Everything that goes wrong, the sad songs
Oh, but all these different reasons
Are just a million different ways to say the same old thing
Now tell me, I'm not the one who needs the saving

You can say what you want but it's only getting better
It's alright, oh baby it's alright
You can try to deny but it's only getting better
It's alright, oh baby it's alright now

You think it feels right but you don't know
You've got everything you wanted but you're not sure
You can say what you please if it's all that you need
To believe it's getting better, you can blame it on me
You can blame it on me, you can blame it on me
Oh, you can blame it on the small things

Say what you want but it's only getting better
It's alright, oh baby it's alright
You can try to deny but it's only getting better
It's alright, oh baby it's alright now

You think it feels right but you don't know
You've got everything you wanted but you're not sure
You can say what you please if it's all that you need
To believe it's getting better, you can blame it on me
You can blame it on me, you can blame it on me, come on---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Aversa.
