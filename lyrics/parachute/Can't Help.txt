Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

Well I tried to fake it, baby I tried to break it
But that's some kind of spell you got over me
You're a heavenly vision, gonna make it my mission
Do whatever it takes to get you with me

Everywhere I go, yeah, no one else I know
That shines as bright as you in my telescope
I tried to let it fade but I can't get away
I really hope you're listening 'cause I never thought I would say-ay-ay

I can't help myself from falling in love
From falling in love with you, yeah-yea
I can't help myself from taking the drug
From taking the drug, it's you, yeah-yea

It happens every time, can't get you off my mind
And anybody else, better wait in line
I can't help myself from falling in love
From falling in love with you yeah-yea

Every time you come calling, didn't think I'd be falling
Never thought It'd be you I would always need
Love was something to run from, I was always the last one
That everyone thought would be in this dream

Everywhere I go, yeah, no one else I know
That shines as bright as you in my telescope
I tried to let it fade but I can't get away
I really hope you're listening 'cause I never thought I would say-ay-ay

I can't help myself from falling in love
From falling in love with you, yeah-yea
I can't help myself from taking the drug
From taking the drug, it's you, yeah-yea

It happens every time, can't get you off my mind
And anybody else, better wait in line
I can't help myself from falling in love
From falling in love with you yeah-yea

They told me son, you'll be addicted
You stole a kiss, and now I see it
You're in my veins, and I can feel it
Taking over me...

I can't help myself from falling in love
From falling in love with you, yeah-yea
I can't help myself from taking the drug
From taking the drug, it's you, yeah-yea

It happens every time, can't get you off my mind
And anybody else, better wait in line
I can't help myself from falling in love
From falling in love with you yeah-yea ---
