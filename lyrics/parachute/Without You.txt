Lead me on
Holy Spirit
Fill my heart
Come flood my soul
Lead me on into your presence
Touch me Lord
Jesus I need you
I can't live without you
I can't walk this road alone
In my heart I need you
Holy one come take my hand

I can't live without you
I can't walk this road alone
In my heart I need you
Holy one come take my hand
Please come take my hand

Holy one come take my hand
Holy one come take my hand---
