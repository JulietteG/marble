Im telling you I went dry
I couldnt do it anymore
Told myself that I was fine
It was something that Id just ignore
That Id feel a weight lift up
The moment that I followed through
But I guess I fooled myself
Cause I never really wanted to

Oh I knew
That even if I kept you in the dark
It would never do
Because it only takes a spark

Im standing in the pouring rain
I feel it like a hurricane
A photograph is all it takes
But I know I shouldnt let it
And the memory is rising fast
Its seeping in through every crack
Oh funny how it all comes back
When youre trying to forget it

Here comes the hurricane
Here comes the hurricane

Oh when I cut you off
It was something that I had to do
You can try to push it down
But its always going to follow you

And yeah if you close your eyes
It doesnt mean you fell asleep
Oh and I could keep you out
But youre never really gonna leave

Oh I knew
Even if I kept you in the dark
It would never do
Because it only takes a spark

Im standing in the pouring rain
I feel it like a hurricane
A photograph is all it takes
But I know I shouldnt let it
And the memory is rising fast
Its seeping in through every crack
Oh funny how it all comes back
When youre trying to forget it

Here comes the hurricane
Here comes the hurricane
Everybody knows I didnt want it to end
Everybody knows I didnt want it to end
Im standing in the pouring rain
I feel it like a hurricane
A photograph is all it takes
But I know I shouldnt let it
And the memory is rising fast
Its seeping in through every crack
Oh funny how it all comes back
When youre trying to forget it

Here comes the hurricane
Here comes the hurricane ---Lyrics submitted by jennet nguyen.
