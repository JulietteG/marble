I turn my head, I can't shake the look you gave
And I'm good as dead
'Cause oh, those eyes are all it takes
And all I want is you

So I pull away, all I do is sit and wait
And I might as well
Write the words right on my face
That all I want is you, oh, is you

Because I've kept my heart under control
But lately all this time has taken its toll
Said I tried to but I can't hold back
What's deep in my soul
Oh, so darling, please forgive me
I want you and you'll just have to know

And all my fears
Creep and crawl across my skin
And these four walls
Are after me and moving in

And all, all that I want to do
Oh, oh, is give up, give in
Let this one stay where it is
But I don't suppose I will

Because I've kept my heart under control
(All locked up and under control)
But lately all this time has taken its toll
(All this time has taken its toll)

Said I tried to but I can't hold back
What's deep in my soul
(Deep down in my soul)
Oh, so darling, please forgive me
I want you and you'll just have to know

One of these days I'm gonna find myself a way
I'll find the courage and I'll find the grace
Oh, and I'm gonna know just what to say
Oh, and you'll walk on up when you want this love
Oh, when you've had enough and you've given it up

Because I've kept my heart under control
(All locked up and under control)
But lately all this time has taken its toll
(All this time has taken its toll)

I said I tried to but I can't hold back
What's deep in my soul
(Deep down in my soul)
Oh, so darling, please forgive me
I want you and you'll just have to know

I've kept my heart under control
(All locked up and under control)
Lately all this time has taken its toll
(All this time has taken its toll)

Said I tried to but I can't hold back
What's deep in my soul
(Deep down in my soul)
Oh, so darling, please forgive me
Oh, I want you and you'll just have to know

I've kept my heart under control
(All locked up and under control)
Lately all this time has taken its toll
(All this time has taken its toll)

Said I tried to but I can't hold back
What's deep in my soul
(Deep down in my soul)
Baby, baby, baby, please, baby girl

I've kept my heart under control
(All locked up and under control)
Lately all this time has taken its toll---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Aversa.
