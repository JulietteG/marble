I want your love, I want your heart
They try so hard, to keep us apart
They say I will treat you bad
But Imma be the best thing you ever had
Im gasoline and youre the spark
You set me off here in the dark
In your kiss, your fingertips
We get too close
Well be burning out of control

[CHORUS]
Young hearts go crazy
Just do what you came to do
Let your lovin never come down
It belongs to me and you (me and you, me and you)
Young hearts go crazy
With the sound of something new
Young hearts go crazy
Me and you (x4)

You give me a little high
All I need to get me by
Say the word, I cut the tie
If we can run
If we can run, I know we can fly

[CHORUS]
Young hearts go crazy
Just do what you came to do
Let your lovin never come down
It belongs to me and you (me and you, me and you)
Young hearts go crazy
With the sound of something new
Young hearts go crazy
Me and you (x4)

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh (x2)
You give me a little high (Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
All I need to get me by (Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Say the word, I cut the tie (Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
If we can run
If we can run, I know we can fly (fly x2)

[CHORUS]
Young hearts go crazy
Just do what you came to do
Let your lovin never come down
It belongs to me and you (me and you, me and you)
Young hearts go crazy
With the sound of something new
Young hearts go crazy
Me and you (x4)

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh (x2)---
