It was you and me
And one hot summer
Beaten up with sweat
All over each other
Soakin wet
Didn't have a lot of time
So didn't waste much 
Found all the right places 
You wanted me to touch
Bet all those memories
Make so hard to forget about me

Chorus:
I bet you wish you had me back
Another chance to get it just like that
The best you ever had
And do you close your eyes with her 
And pretend I'm doing you again
Like only I can
I bet you wish you had me back
I bet you wish you had me back

It was you and me 
It seemed to last forever 
the way you taste
And I still remember 
The sounds you made
One day in June 
I stayed all night
And made love to you 
Like the forth of July
And all those memories 
Make it so hard to forget about me

chorus:

Every night, Every time 
You see me when you close your eyes
I bet you wish you had me back
Another chance to get it just like that
Like only I can
I bet you wish you had me back 
I bet you wish you had me back 
I bet you wish you had me back---Lyrics submitted by Lindsey.
