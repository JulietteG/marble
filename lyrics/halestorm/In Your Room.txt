Let me in your room
I've seen the rest of you
But I know there's something more in your room
I'm right outside your door
Show me things you've never shown before

A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
All you have to do is let me in your room

You can be yourself
You don't have to hide from me, I won't tell
I know everyone you've ever trusted has let you down
And you don't want to come out
And show me, show me

A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
All you have to do is let me in your room

You know every part of me
I let you in, I let you see
All the dark and every color of my room
Let me do that for you
And tell me all about your past
Why you painted those walls black
Baby it's all right, you're safe in here with me
Open up so I can see

A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
An unopened letter from your dad
A poster of your favorite band
It don't matter I'll take every part of you
All you have to do is let me in your room

Let me in your room---Lyrics submitted by Bob From Space.
