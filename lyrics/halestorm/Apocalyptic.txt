I wear my nine inch heels when we go to bed
I paint the color of my lips blood red
I get so out of mind like never before
So you press play and I hit the comfort switch

Pushing up, physical
Always slamming doors
You're a bitch, throwing fits
Always waging wars
Me and you, sad but true
And now I'm seeing more
But there's still one thing we're good for

I'll give you one last night
So make it twist
Give you one last shot, go on and hit it
Give you one last time to make me miss it
Baby love me apocalyptic

Give me a red imprint right across my ass
I'll even scratch us up and down your back
Throw me against the wall, buy me over net
Like answer the world, break-up sex

'Cause no one does it better
No one knows me better
'Cause no one lasts forever
No one lasts forever
It's now or never---
