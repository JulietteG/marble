I'm on the train that's pulling the sick and twisted
making the most of the ride before we get arrested
we're all wasted and we're not going home tonight. 
Covered in black we lack the social graces, 
just like an animal we crawled out of our cages, 
they cant tame us, so if you're one of us get on the bus. 

If you're freak like me, wave your flag 
if you're a freak like me get off your ass, 
it's our time now to let it all hang out, so shout 
if you're a freak like me you were born to burn 
this is no disease you don't need a cure 
it's our time now to come out. 
If you are a freak like me x2. 

We were on the ground but we will not surrender 
we're going to give them something to remember, yes 
so write your name in gasoline and set that shit on fire 

If you're freak like me, wave your flag 
If you're a freak like me get off your ass, 
it's our time now to let it all hang out, so shout 
if you're a freak like me, don't apologize 
they can hold you down you were born to rise 
it's our time now to come out. 
If you are a freak like me x2 
Are you a freak like me? x2 

If you're freak like me, wave your flag 
If you're a freak like me get off your ass, 
it's our time now to let it all hang out, so shout 
If you're a freak like me don't apologize 
they can hold you down you were born to rise 
it's our time now to come out. 
If your a freak like me x5---Lyrics submitted by Keylee Adams.
