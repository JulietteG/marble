I have to admit I've made poor decisions
of relationships in the past
But I've learned through my delusions 
In result I found you at last
Well I never knew til you showed me 
What real love was all about 
And with this true love that I found in you, 
I'll never let you down
How could I live without you beside me?
I oculd not live without your love to guide me
Your love has set free wings inside of me
I'm soaring on the wind with wings of love
I think about you all the time 
You're always on my mind 
I know no matter where I am or what I do
I know you'll always be by my side
Well I never knew til you showed me
what real love was all about 
And with this true love that I found in you
I'll never let you down
How could I live without you beside me
I could not live without your love to guide me
Your love has set free the wings inside of me 
I'm soaring on the wind
Cuz I've walked a million miles
I've met a million people
but no on on this earth can compare to you
I know no matter where I go 
Or what I do
The only thing I need to know is I'm in love with you
How could I live
Your love has set free the wings inside of me 
and I'm soaring on the wind
With the wings of love---Lyrics submitted by jesika harrison.
