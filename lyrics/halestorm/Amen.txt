A fires gotta burn
The world is gonna turn
A rain has gotta fall
Fate is gonna call
But I just keep on breathing
Long as my heart is beating

Someone's gotta hate
It's never gonna change
Gets harder everyday
This is one hell of a place
Keep your heart from freezing
To keep yourself believing

But I won't run
I'm not afraid
I'll look em in the eye
Gonna hear me say
It's...

My life
My love
My sex
My drug
My lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?
My grace
My church
My pain
My tears
My hurt
My god, I'll say it again
Can I get it?
Can I get an Amen?

Life has gotta kill
Faith is gonna blind
Hope is gonna fade
The truth is gonna lie
Sometimes there's no reason
To justify the meaning

But I won't run
I'm not ashamed
It's gonna take more than this for me to break

My life, my love, my sex, my drug
My lust...---
