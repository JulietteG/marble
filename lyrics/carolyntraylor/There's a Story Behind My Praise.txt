There's a story, behind my praise
that's why my hands I continue to raise
I'm going to praise him, for the rest of my days
oh, there's a story "yea" behind my praise

Repeat

If you see me crying, oh that is a story
how he's been God for me, and all of his glory
yea yea yea
if you see me shouting, oh don't be amazed
I just realized, where and when I was save
if you see me running, oh don't you think it change
my whole life he rearranged,
there is a story, behind, my praise
my praise my praise
there is a story behind my praise
it's a real long story
I can't tell it all
but when I think of how he brought me out
there is a story, behind, my praise
there is a story of how he allowed me to my mind
there is a story, behind, my praise

I love you God, I love him
How you allowed me to keep my mind
out of all I been through

there is a story behind my praise
there is a story behind my praise

hey God I love you
I love him hey God
I love you, because you first love me
If I had ten thousands I would praise you with everyone

There is a story behind my praise---Lyrics submitted by Victoria Waitingpatientlyformyblessing Williams.
