Come to me baby
Ahh sexy lady

I'd get a thrill if you'd say you will
Come here baby

Let's play house, babe (Come here pretty baby)
Be my spouse, babe (Eww! Sexy lady)

I'd get a thrill if you'd say you will

Let's play house, baby

Do it with me baby!

Gimme the music (Let's play house, baby)
Gimme the music (Let's play house, girl)

Somebody-done-somebody-wrong song, gimme the music
Gimme that baby-come-back-home song, gimme the music

Let's play house, baby

Gimme the bop, be-bop slop, but gimme the music

Let's play house girl

Gimme that old-fashion dancehall, gimme the music

I'd get a thrill, If you'd say you will

(Gimme a lullaby)
(Gimme a lullaby, give me a by and by oh by and by oh by)

I'll get a thrill if you say you will

(Gimme a lullaby)
(Gimme a lullaby, give me a by and by oh by and by oh by)

Let's play house, baby
Let's play house, girl

I'd get a thrill if you say you will (Give me a lullaby)
Lord

( ? ... cookien?) by the music (repeated)
Raindrops in your will, say

(?)
And Oh yeah -- I'm with the band
For I am the music
Sheet music to be precise

And oh yeah I don't care to precise
I play by ear, I've always wanted to be in a band
(Give me the music)

Encore! You want more?

(Gimme that somebody-done-somebody-wrong song
Gimme the music)

Gimme that get me off, turn me on song, gimme the music

I'll give you the bop, be bop slop, cause I am the music

Gimme that turn me up, bring it on song, gimme the music

Uh - can't you read me? -- uh sheet music baby
Also, ... if you know what I'm talkin' about baby---
