Oh oh, I'm man, get off my foot, ha ha
Said, I 'mo take my shoes off and kick up my heels
(Ha ha)
Just watch me ya'll, umm huh
Said, I 'mo take my shoes off and kick up my heels

Now here I go, okay, hah

I got some ground work to do
(Let's go strollin')
And I need a little support
(On the dance floor)
Heel and toe [unverified]
(Let's go strollin')
And just like the grinner I need just a little more foot, hah

Tryin' to put a size twelve foot
In a size eight shoe
(You know that won't do)
It's like putting on a five dollar hat
On a nickel head
(It's about that hat rack)

Now promenade and do-si-do
Take your partner across the floor
Foot stompin' time
Heel and toe, sidesteppin'

Ho

I 'mo take my shoes off
(Got to take my shoes)
And kick up my heels
Hey, watch me ya'll hear I go

Hey
I 'mo take my shoes off
And kick up my heels
Not with your smelly feet
See ya, bye

Party time
Step on it
Come on
Give up a dime

(Lord)
Cool
(Come on)
Hey

It's party time
Step on it
Come on
Give up a dime

Party time
Come on ya'll

He's got more socks than the ogre there in the corner
I believe it is, it's a toe jam
Are you any kin to Dr. Scholl's?
You've got some funny looking toes
You've got some funny looking toes
(Where'd you get that toe from?)

Are your toenails over-grown?
'Cause ya see I got ptomaine
And I'm gonna turn it loose on the dance floor
And I'm gonna spread my groove all over you
