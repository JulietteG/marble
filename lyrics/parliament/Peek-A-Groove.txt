Bring me that groove and that thing that you shake
(Oh! shake it to me baby)
Thing that you shake, thing that you shake

Bring me that groove and that thing that you shake
(To me, bring it to me baby)
Thing that you shake, thing that you shake
(The way that you shake that thing)

Bring me that groove and that thing that you shake
Thing that you shake, thing that you shake

Can we, can we take you all the way
Can we peek a groove?

Can we, can we take you all the way

We don't need the night, to do what we feel is right
Vanish from your eyesight in broad daylight, yeah!

We don't almost move you

Can we, can we take you all the way?
Can we turn you out?

Can we, can we take you all the way?

We don't need the night, to do what we feel is right
Vanish from your eyesight in broad daylight

We can peek a groove
We don't almost move you

Bring me that groove and that thing that you shake, thing that you shake

I recall with good feelin' my childhood days
A little old man with the groove
Every year at this time he would come to my mind
He was searchin' for the grooveless, less the groove
He said "Bring me that groove and that thing that you shake!"

We don't almost move you

Can we, can we take you all the way
Can we blow your mind?

Ooohhh could we, should we take you all the way?

Oh and in time
Heyyy

Can we, can we move you night and day?
Can we peek a groove (doo doo doo)

Can we, can we take you all the way out? (doo doo doo)

You'll be out of sight

We don't need the night to do what we feel is right
Vanish from your eyesight in broad daylight

We can peak a groove all night

We don't almost move you
We are here to groove you
We don't almost move you

Can we? (Can we?)
May we? (May we?)

We don't almost move you

Can we (Can we get the funk on me)
Can we take you all the way (Bring me that thing you shake)
Can we peek a groove (Got what it takes to MOVE YA!)
Can we, Can we (Baby, bring me that thing ya shake) take you all
The way (Come get this funk out me)
Can we peek a groove (Got what it takes to MOVE YA! WHOO!)

Can we, can we take you all the way (Owww! Move it baby!)
Can we peek a groove? (I got a thang for you! Uhh!)

Can we, can we take you all the way (Move me baby)
(Can you move me baby?)

I said thank me

Whether my music will move your behind

Cause I'm a mover baby
