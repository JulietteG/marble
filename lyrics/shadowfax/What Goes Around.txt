Drop of pepper in the water,
And the way you reach the shore,
Light the candle in the darkness,
Someone somewhere finds the door...

Turn your eyes away from people,
And the tune will rise from you,
Its a lesson hard to learn now,
What you are is what you do.

And the world keeps turning in the circle,
World keeps turning in the circle,
What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around,
Around and around,
Around and around...

Turn the rain into a river,
You will drown if are near,
Cast the word against the wind and
You're the only one to hear...

Deal the cards and spades and lose ends,
Everyone will know you're there,
This song is sang in many tongues and,
The story told in many lands.

And the world keeps turning in the circle,
World keeps turning in the circle,
What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around,
Around and around,
Around and around...

What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around,
What goes around, comes around...---Lyrics submitted by Natalija.
