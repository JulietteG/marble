Hold on dont give up 
Dont you worry you dont have to cry
God sees, He sees what youre going through, oh yes does
God is willing and Hes able 
This didnt catch Him by surprise
So if you would trust Him, just step, step aside, oh yeah

And be still, dont question it
For these obstacles they were allowed
Yes, he wants to take you
Take you higher, higher if you hold on....
God is willing; and he's able
This didnt catch Him by surprise 
So if you would trust Him and step, step, step aside

Ohh! He is faithful. 
My God is faithful to do what He said He would do
And if He said it I believe it
Theres nothing He cant do

If youll stand on His Word 
Cast your cares on Him
For He knows and He loves you
He did it for me, I thank Him

 Step, step aside
Get out of his way
My God will fix it for you
Lean on Him, cast your cares on Him
Lean not to your own understanding
My God will work it out

Step, step aside
My God will, He will do it, yeah
Hold on, He is so faithful, 
Hell never leave you, He wont forsake you
Youre not in this thing alone 

Step, step, step aside
Lean on Jesus
He cares, He cares for you
Lord Ill get out of your way
I know youre able

If your step, step, step aside

Hallelujah
Hell do it, yes he will

Get out of His way---Lyrics submitted by April.
