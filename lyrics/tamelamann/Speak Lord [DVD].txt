Here I am again, on unsure ground
Made a move once before, on my own, it was wrong(I found out)
Lord ya know, how hard it was
but ya picked me up, and I learned be still and wait on ya word

Lord please bestow on me,
A word from thee
Lord speak to me
Lord please bestow on me a word from thee
Lord won't you please speak

There's an anxious heart, on the finish line 
Tryna fight a battle, ya know is not yours(it's not yours)
In those times, I reminded that I'm
On the winning side, if you speak 
Surely victory is mine

Lord please bestow on me(send it on down Lord)
A word from thee(from you Jesus)
Lord speak to me 
Lord please bestow on me
A word from thee 
Lord won't you please speak

If ya speak a word, a word of peace
I know, I know things will change
Lord speak to me Jesus 
Lord please (Lord won't you please) 
Speak Lord (Lord won't you please)

Speak to me Lord, speak right now 
Speak to my heart Lord
I need you right now, have your way in my life (Oh speak Lord)
Nature some kind of glory right now Jesus 
Ohhh yeaaa
Lord I wanna hear it, Lord I wanna hear a word from you Lord
Speak Lord
Speak Lord
Oh speak Lord---Lyrics submitted by venieka hogans.
