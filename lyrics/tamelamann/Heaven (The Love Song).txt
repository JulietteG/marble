Every time I look at you I feel something brand new.
Its real I can feel it all over me.
Can the trees often shade you.
Send fire through me when you call my name.
Has me looking forward to the next time we will go out and hang.

Chorus:
Something magical happens every time I'm lying in your arms.
The feeling that it gives me can weather any storm.

Lying next to you relaxes me.
Makes me feel so complete.
No other place I'd rather be than here, here with you.
Just your skin touching mine and to me you're one of a kind.
I believe my search was over when you came my...........

Chorus:
Something magical happens every time I'm lying in your arms.
The feeling that it gives me can weather any storm.

It feels like........ HEAVEN
When you with me, it feels like.............HEAVEN
When you smiling, it feels like...............HEAVENS RIGHT HERE ON EARTH FOR ME
(Repeat)

Chorus:
Something magical happens every time I'm lying in your arms.
The feeling that it gives me can weather any storm.---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
