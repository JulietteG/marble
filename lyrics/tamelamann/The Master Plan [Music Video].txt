You may be wondering
What's gonna happen
How you gonna fix it?
With nowhere to turn

With the weight
So much weight on your shoulders
And it seems nobody cares

Oh, hold on
God's got the answer, yes he does
To those questions you don't understand

You don't have to worry
God's got, yeah, he has the master plan
Yes he does, oh

The father knows, what's best for you, yes he does
God always knows how to provide for you
He always, always see you through, yes he has
Hold on to what he's promised you

Hold on, God's got the answer
Oh, oh, to those questions, to those questions
My God, you don't understand, hold on
Hold on my brother, hold on my sister

Yes my God, he's got, he's got the master plan
Yes he does
Whatever it is, God's got it
You've been searching, he has it right there

My God has everything you need
I dare you to try him
I dare you to reach out for him
He's knocking, he's knocking

He wants to come in, he's on the outside
He has the answer, the master plan
My God has, he has it, he has the master plan
Yes, yes he does, hallelujah, he has the master plan---Lyrics submitted by Sumia Nancy Kin.
