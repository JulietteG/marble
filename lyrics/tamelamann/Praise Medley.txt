I love you lord, and i lift my voice to worship you.
Oh, my soul rejoice. Take joy, my king in what you hear.
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.

My soul loves Jesus. 3x
Bless, i will bless his name.

There is a name i love to hear. i love to sing his praise. 
it sounds like music in my ear. The sweetest name i know.

Oh how i love Jesus. 3x
He is the sweetest, he is the sweetest name.............i know.---Lyrics submitted by Nesha.
