[Jay-Z]:
After the show it's the afterparty, then
After the party it's the hotel lobby, then
After the Belve then it's probably Cris
And after the original it's probably this
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, Fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest-side (uh what)
Game recognize the game, hos do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I don't suppose you knew, so thugs
Pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us, or
Bullets'll chase you like, Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts', racin' twin Porches
Boxsters with glocks That will pop you to make you ghost
Whoever come close, you've been warned
But thos niggas don't get the picture til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on

[Jay-Z & R. Kelly]:
And we'll be drinkin' til six in the mornin'...

[R. Kelly]:
In the back of the club with mama
Poppin' bottles of Cris with mama
Put the bar on the tab for mama
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs with mama
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' til the early lizz-ight
Nigga high like a mu'fuckin' kizz-ite
Take three honeys just to make me feel rizz-ight
My, my, my, my
Is what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say my, my, my, my
Everytime they see them big thangs on the rizz-ide
While ya'll got a club date, I'm fuckin' with arenas
Got your man sayin', tell me have you seen her?
Yeah, she with me on the low, gettin' high off of 'dro
Got her knees on the floor, Fiesta

Fiesta,Fiesta,FiestaFiesta,Fiesta,Fiesta,Fiesta,Fiesta,(oh wee)

Switchin lanes in my 6 in the burbs
I met a broad name Tasha from the burbs
Took the hood then I moved into the burbs
Now no mo' sherrifs or police in the burbs
Now we about to tear this club up
Don't worry about expenses cause I got that, sho' nuff
Ready to foo! like I'm fresh outta jizz-ail
I need some boo from all the honeys on the DL
I said my, my, my, my
That's what them thugs yellin when the strippers on the flizz-oor
They say my, my, my, my
Got Keisha yellin frm that up and down strizz-oke
While ya'll got a club date, I'm fuckin with arenas
Got your man sayin tell me have you seen her?
Yeah, she with me on the low, gettin high off a 'dro
Got her knees on the floor, Fiesta

[Gotti]:
I put this big body up, come through in a Rover
Not only Kelly and Gottie, it's Boo and Hova
Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist in the light
I'm with Roclain right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody want to get to me
How you make it to the gate and forget the key
I'm the one God chose, so you blessed with me
Gotti flow'll get you higher than that Esstasy (ya heard)

[Boo]:
Hey yo, I come through stunnin, plus I'm gettin blunted
In the new 600, with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light you shoulders
Got a lotta hot cars, but the drops is colder
You see VIP, me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov
Drinkin' Cris like it's H2O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees fore it's time to go (come on)

[R.Kelly]:
If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin on them thangs then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you's a motherfuckin thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that Ecstasy you got to feel this shit
If you sippin on some Cris you gots to feel this shit
And if you're throwin up your shit you gots to feel this shit, Fiesta---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
