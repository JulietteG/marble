My mind is telling me no
But my body
My body's telling me yes, baby
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess
To you

I don't see nothing wrong (Ooh)
With a little bump 'n grind (With a little bump 'n grind)
I don't see nothing wrong (Hey baby)
I don't see nothing wrong (I don't see nothing wrong)
With a little bump 'n grind (With a little bump 'n grind)
I don't see nothing wrong

You see I know just what you want
And I know just what you need girl so
So baby bring your body to me
Bring your body here
I'm not fooling around with you
Baby my love is true
With you
With you is where I wanna be
I wanna be
Girl you need someone
Someone I can be, yeah
To satisfy
Your every need

With a little bump 'n grind (With a little bump 'n grind)
I don't see nothing wrong (Baby, baby, I don't see)
I don't see nothing wrong (I don't see)
With a little bump 'n grind (Nothing wrong with a little)
I don't see nothing wrong (Bump 'n grind, baby)

You say he's not treating you right
Lady spent the night (I'll love you like you need to be loved)
Girl won't you try some of me
No need to look no more
Because I won't be at my doors
You never (You never want another lover)
Baby, you never find another me
You see I need someone
Someone I can be yeah
To make love to you baby
Constantly

I don't see nothing wrong (Hey, nothing wrong)
With a little bump 'n grind (With a little bump 'n)
I don't see nothing wrong (Grind, ooh)
I don't see nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With a little bump 'n grind (With a little bump 'n grind)
I don't see nothing wrong (Baby, baby, allright)
I don't see nothing wrong (I don't see nothing wrong)
With a little bump 'n grind (No girl)
I don't see nothing wrong (I don't see, I don't see, nothing wrong, baby)
I don't see nothing wrong (Nothing wrong, nothing wrong, nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong (Hey baby, hey baby, baby)
With a little bump 'n grind (Baby, baby, baby)
I don't see nothing wrong (Come on, come on)---
