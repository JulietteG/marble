[chorus: R. Kelly] 
(i'm A, I'm A, I'm A, I'm A) Flirt 
Soon As I See Her Walk Up In The Club (i'm A Flirt) 
Winkin Eyes At Me, When I Roll Up On Them Dubs (i'm A Flirt) 
Sometimes When I'm With My Chick On The Low (i'm A Flirt) 
And When She's Wit Her Man Lookin At Me, Damn Right (i'm A Flirt) 
So Homie Don't Bring Your Girl To Meet Me Cuz (i'm A Flirt) 
And Baby Don't Bring Your Girlfriend To Eat Cuz (i'm A Flirt) 
Please Believe It, Unless Your Game Is Tight And U Trust Her 
Then Don't Bring Her Around Me Cuz (i'm A Flirt) 

[verse 1: R. Kelly] 
Now Swear To Tell The Truth 
And The Whole Truth 
When It Comes To Hoes I Be Pimpin Like I Supposed To 
Rollin Like I Supposed To 
Shinin Like I Supposed To 
In The Club, Fuckin Wit Honeys Like I Supposed To 
I Don't Understand It When A Nigga Bring His Girlfriend To Club 
Freakin All On The Floor Wit His Girlfriend In The Club 
And Wonderin Why All These Playas Tryin To Holla At Her 
Just Soon As She Go To The Bathroom, Nigga I'm Gon Holla At Her 
A Dog On The Prowl When I'm Walkin Through The Mall 
If I Could Man I Probably Would Flirt Wit All Of Y'all 
Yeah, Yeah Homie U Say She Yo Girlfriend 
But When I Step Up To Her I'ma Be Like, "cousin" 
Believe Me Man, This Is How Them Playas Do It In The Chi 
And Plus We Got Them Playerette Flirters In The Chi 
Now The Moral Of The Story Is Cuff Yo Bitch 
Cuz Hey I'm Black, Handsome, I Sing Plus I'm Rich And (i'm A Flirt) 

(i'm A, I'm A, I'm A, I'm A)

[t.i. Speaking:] 
Hey Homie, If U Ain't Gettin No Money 
U Better Keep Her Away From Me Ya Dig. 

[verse 2: T.i.] 
Well If U Love Ya Girl 
And Wanna Keep Ya Girl 
Don't Be Walkin Up And Askin Me To Meet Ya Girl 
Because I'm Well Enough A Flirt When I Speak To Girl 
She Winked Her Eyes On The Slide 
I Seent U Girl 
Better Treat Your Girl Right 
Cuz Another Man Will 
Better Eat Ya Girl Like Another Man Will 
Cuz U Leave Your Wife 
And I See Ya Wife

How Long U Think That's Finna Be Ya Wife 
Well I'm Livin The Life 
You Just Gettin It Right 
Your Old Lady Look At Me 
Cuz U Ain't Hittin It Right 
She Probably Used To Like U 
Cuz U The Bitter Type 
That's Until I Came Along 
And Put Some Dick In Her Life 
Wanna See How That Ass Lookin Thick In Da Light 
I Noticed She Was Checkin Me 
And Diggin The Ice 
And If I Get That Tonight 
Better Hit That Twice 
I Can Even Make Her Mine 
If I Hit That Price 
You Know Smack That Thang 
Sit That Right 
Up On That Dresser 
Yeah That's Right 
Pullin On Her Hair 
Like We Gettin In A Fight 
Yeah I Know It's Kinda Tight 
But It'll Suit 'er Just Right 
So If Yo Girl Sexy 
And She Test Me 
Don't Be Upset G 
Cuz U Might Catch Me 
Tryin To Catch A Glance Up Her Skirt 
The Mclaren In Reverse 
Then If I See Her And I Like Her Then I'm A Flirt 

[verse 3: T-pain] 
(when I, When I, When I, When I) Pull Up To Club 
All The Shawties Be Like (damn Twenty-eight,eights) 
Then I Be Like Girl U Know Just Who I Am (don't Hate, Hate) 
Say I Done Fell In Love Wit A Stripper Yall 
All I Do Is Flirt With Her, And I Get Them Draws 
And I Don't Need No Help, I Got It Down Pact 
Teddy Paine Was Born To Flirt Now U Can't Down That 
Now I'm Flirt With Her Whether I'm In Or Out Of Town 
That's Why They Call Me Teddy Bend Her Ass Down

And I'm Hopin U Feel The Same 
I'm A Wink My Eye And Let U Know I Got The Game
