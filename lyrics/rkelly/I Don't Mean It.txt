Now I was supposed to be a man about it,
Should've never left your side no way no how,
Put too many years in this relationship,
And it's not that serious for us to split,
Now I admit sometimes I make mistakes,
Still I appreciate the love we make,
Stop at the door and put your bags back down,
Now baby please cant we work this out?

(Chorus)
Now I may say you can walk,
But I don't mean it.
And I might name call,
I don't mean it.
I may pull some some silly stunts but thats just a front,
I don't mean it. 
(Now wait a minute, hear me out.)
Now I may holler at you,
I don't mean it.
And I may tell you we're through,
I don't mean it.
And give you looks that could kill but it's not for real,
I don't mean it.

Now I was supposed to be more understanding,
Instead of trying to be so damned demanding,
Baby I'm willing to drop my ego,
And do the things I should have done and more,
See I know that I can be a better man,
Girl all you gotta do is take my hand,
Promise this time I'm going all the way,
And show you all the reasons why you're staying.

(Chorus)
Now I may say you can walk,
I don't mean it.
And I might name call,
Girl I don't mean it.
I may pull some some silly stunts but thats just a front,
I don't mean it. 
(Listen baby.)
Now I may holler at you,
But I don't mean it.
And I may tell you we're through,
Girl you should know I don't mean it.
And give you looks that could kill but it's not for real,
I don't mean it.
(Come here girl)

You see I never meant to break you down and make you cry,
(Make You Cry)
Oh please baby please, turn back around don't you say goodbye,
(Say Goodbye) 
Sometimes I know I can take it just a little bit too far,
But yo my heart is good,
(Heart is Good)
So baby you don't have to worry,
You're gonna see a change girl you know I love you even though

(Chorus)
I may say you can walk,
I don't mean it.
And I might name call,
But I don't mean it.
I may pull some some silly stunts but thats just a front,
I don't mean it. I don't mean it.
Now I may holler at you,
When I'm hollering at you.
And I may tell you we're through,
I never mean it when I say we're through.
And give you looks that could kill but it's not for real,
I don't mean it.
Now I may say you can walk,
I be sayin that you can walk babay.
And I might name call,
But I promise I don't mean it.
I may pull some some silly stunts but thats just a front,
I don't mean it. 
(Thinkin I'm cool, But I'm a fool.)
Now I may holler at you,
Hollerin' bout privacy
And I may tell you we're through,
But I know you are my bride to be.
And give you looks that could kill but it's not for real,
I don't mean it.---Lyrics submitted by DJ.
