[duet with K. Michelle]  


[R. Kelly:]
Said I'm feeling pretty good right now baby
Good about our loving darlin
Listen

Like the world goes around everyday baby
That is how you spin me
Might as well call me a telegram baby
Cause darlin that's just how you send me

[K. Michelle:]
I might as well take me a pen and sign a waiver
To be yours for the rest of my life
You rescued me from heartache just like a savior
Now being in your arms is my paradise

[R. Kelly:]
Ain't no love like your love ain't no kiss like your kiss
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this

[K. Michelle:]
You a genie to me babe the way you grant my wish
And tonight we're gonna let the world hear it

[Both:]
This is how our love is
You and me forever baby sing it darlin
This is how our love is
Can't nobody come between it nah babe

[R. Kelly:]
Listen honey
Ain't no doubt what we got baby is one of a kind
We're in the hall of fame as the greatest love of all time
So mamny said that this love wouldn't last too long
But we got the victory darling and proved them all wrong

[K. Michelle:]
Just like the sun comes in and chased away the rain
See I love you boy cause you take away my pain
And it don't matter where you are just call me baby
Cause I'd run a million miles just to get to you baby

[R. Kelly:]
Listen honey now
Ain't no love like your love ain't no kiss like your kiss
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this

[K. Michelle:]
You a genie to me babe the way you grant my wish
And tonight we're gonna let the world hear it

[Both:]
This is how our love is
You and me forever baby sing it to me darlin
This is how our love is
Can't nobody come between us babe

[R. Kelly:]
Now let me tell you how I feel
See our love is like an antidote and we deliver
Whole wide world with it darling preach to me

[K. Michelle:]
This love is like the people's hope something outta heaven baby
Cause it's gotta colon

[R. Kelly:]
Oh girl when we're touching ooo when we're feeling
It's crazy like walking on the ceiling

[Both:]
This is how our love is
You and me sing it to me girl
Oh this is how our love is
Can't nobody come between us babe
This is how our love is
Rain sleet or snow I want the whole wide world to know
This is how our love is
Forever and a day it will always be this way
This is how our love is
Take it or leave it you and me together take it or leave it
This is how our love is
Take it or leave it take it or leave it---Lyrics submitted by Ariana.
