[Chorus: R.Kelly]
I'm A, I'm A, I'm A, I'm A Flirt
Soon As I See Her Walk Up In The Club (I'm A Flirt)
Winkin Her Eyes At Me, When I Roll Up On Them Dubs (I'm A Flirt)
Sometimes When I'm With My Chick On The Low (I'm A Flirt)
And When She's Wit Her Man Lookin At Me, Damn Right (I'm A Flirt)
So Homie Don't Bring Your Girl To Meet Me Cuz (I'm A Flirt)
And Baby Don't Bring Your Girlfriend To Eat Cuz (I'm A Flirt)
Please Believe It, Unless Your Game Is Tight And U Trust Her
Then Don't Bring Her Around Me Cuz (I'm A Flirt)

[Verse 1: Kells]
Now Swear To Tell The Truth
And The Whole Truth
When It Comes To Hoes I Be Pimpin Like I Supposed To
Rollin Like I Supposed To
Shinin Like I Supposed To
In The Club, Fuckin  Wit Honeys Like I Supposed To
I Don't Understand It When A Nigga Bring His Girlfriend To the Club
Freakin All On The Floor Wit His Girlfriend In The Club
And Wonder Why All These Playas Tryin To Holla At Her
Just Soon As She Go To The Bathroom, Nigga I'm Goin Holla At Her
A Dog On The Prawl When I'm Walkin Through The Mall
If I Could Man I Probably Would Flirt Wit All Yall
Yeah, Yeah Homie U Say She Ya Girlfriend
But When I Step Up To Her I'm Be Like Cousin
Believe Me Man, This Is How Them Playas Do It In The Chi
And Plus We Got Them Player-ette Flirters In The Chi
Now The Moral Of The Story Is Cuff Yo Bitch
Cuz Hey I'm Black, Handsome, I Sing Plus I'm Rich And (I'm A Flirt)

[TIP Speaking:]
Hey Homie, If U Ain't Gettin No Money
U Better Keep Her Away From Me Ya Dig.

[Verse 2: TIP]
Well If U Love Ya Girl
And Wanna Keep Ya GIrl
Don't Be Walkin Up And Askin Me To  Meet Ya Girl
Cuz I'm Well Enough A Flirt When I Speak To Girl
She Winked Her Eyes On The Slide

Better Eat Ya Girl LIke Another Man Will
Cuz U Leave Your Wife
And I See Ya Wife

Cuz U You The Better Type
That's Until I Came Along
And Put Some Dick In Her Life

I Noticed She Was Checkin Me
And Diggin The Ice
And If I Get That Tonight
Better Hit That Twice
I Can Even Make Her Mine
If I HIt That Right
You Know Smack That Thang

Upon That Dresser

Pullin On Her Hair

But It'll settle Just Right
So If Yo Girl Sexy
And She Test Me

Cuz U Might Catch Me
Tryin To Catch A Glance Up Her Skirt

We Playing In My glan in reverse
Then If I See Her And I Like Her Then I'm A Flirt

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
When I, When I, When I,When I Pull Up To Club
All The Shawties Be Like (Damn 28's)
Then I Be Like Girl U Know Just Who I Am (Don't Hate)
See I Done Fell In Love Wit A Stripper Yall
All I Do Is Flirt With Her, And I Get Them Draws
And I Don't Need No Help, I Got It Down Pact
Teddy Paine Was Born To Flirt Now U Can't Down That
Now I'm Flirt With Her Whether I'm In Or Out Of Town
That's Why They Call Me Teddy Bend Her Ass Down
