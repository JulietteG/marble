My minds telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby - I dont wanna hurt nobody
But there is something, that I must confess - to you

[Chorus]
(I dont see nothing wrong) ooh
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I dont see nothing wrong) ba-baby - hey, I
(I dont see nothing wrong) I dont see nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I dont see nothing wrong) hey, oohooh

(Lookie here)
See I know, just what you want
And I know, just what you need girl
So (so baby, bring your body to me) hey, hey, heybring your body here
I'm not fooling around with you
Baby my love is true
With you - is where - I wanna be (with you, is where I wanna be)

Girl you need someone, someone like me yeah
To satisfy, your every need

[Chorus]
(I dont see nothing wrong) I dont see - I dont see nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I dont see nothing wrong) baby - baby, I dont see
(I dont see nothing wrong) I dont see
(With a little bump, and grind) nothing wrong, with a little
(I dont see nothing wrong) bump, and grind - baby, hey

You say, he's not treating you right
Lady, spend the night
Ill - baby (Ill love you, like you need to be loved) girl wont you try, some of me
No need to look no more
Because Ive opened up my doors
Youll never - baby (you'll never, want another love)
Youll never find another me

You see you need someone, someone like me - yeah
To make love to you baby, constantly

[Chorus]
(I dont see nothing wrong) I dont see - hey, nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump and
(I dont see nothing wrong) grind - ooh, ooh
(I dont see nothing wrong) I dont see - nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I dont see nothing wrong) baby, baby - alright

[Chorus]

(With a little bump, and grind) no mam
(I dont see nothing wrong) I dont see, I dont see - nothing wrong, baby
