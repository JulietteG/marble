1 we'll go to my room for fun
2 then i'll say give me your tounge 
3 cause tonight i'm gonna fulfill your fantasies (yeah)
4 lie down on the floor 
5 can not wait to cum inside 
6 anything that's broken i'll fix
7 spread your legs apart
8 feel me i'm so hard 
9 see i want you from behind, skip the bump in grind 
10 baby climb on top of me
11 Up and down we'll go to sea 
12 and that's when i go, down on my knees, giving you some of my 12 play 
give em a lil 12(just), just a lil 12, a sample of my 12 play ( oh yeah)
