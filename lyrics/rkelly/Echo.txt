Girl i wanna hear you echo (echo),

I called your boss
and he knows you aint coming in today,
(sex in the morning sex all day)
so baby girl pack you bag and head to my place
(sex in the morning sex all day)
and when you get there don't stop don't hesitate
(sex in the morning sex all day)
i left the keys so let yourself in baby
(sex in the morning sex all day) 


now drop your bag pour yourself a drink 
i left your next clue by the sink 
it should be a box with your name 
open it up see whats inside whatever it is put it on 
and head to the bedroom and ill be waiting for you right there baby
 ill be waiting there to F*** like crazy i hope your ready to 
go all day long i hope your ready girl to scream and moan
 like  yodley yodley ohhoooo wanna hear you 
echo (echo) echo (echo) 
yodley yodley ohhoooo wanna hear you 
echo (echo) echo (echo)
 the way you riding it i can tell you like my surprise

(sex in the evening sex all night) 
now I'm working it up n down like a roller coaster ride
(sex in the even sex all night)
i got your eyes rolling back finger nails in your spine
(sex in the evening sex all night)
we never had a sex session like this one in your life
(sex in the evening sex all night)


now when we finally get to round 10 
we not gonna stop we'll start again 
and when you need a break ill let you up,
 I'll let you breathe wash your face, get something 
to eat then come back to the bedroom and I'll be 
waiting for you right there baby I'll be waiting there
 to F*** like crazy i hope your ready to go all day long
 i hope your ready girl to scream and moan like

sounding like your screaming from a mountain peak and

open up when they see its me and you ooh
