I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters with the who's baddest
But the one's who stop ya fallen' from your ladder

When you feel like you're feelin' now
An-doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love ya like the way I love ya
An-I suffer but I ain't goin'na cut ya cuz

THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO BETTER MAN
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HEOR TO CALL HOME

THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO BETTER MAN
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO TO CALL HOME

Every time I close my eyes, I think
I think 'bout you inside
Ain't no mother given' up on askin' why
Why you lie and you cheat,
And you try to make a fool out of she

I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters with the who's baddest
But the one's who stop ya fallen from your ladder, cuz

THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO
THIS AINT NO PLACE FOR NO BETTER MAN
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO TO CALL HOME

THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO BETTER MAN
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO TO CALL HOME

THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO BETTER MAN
THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR NO HERO TO CALL HOME---Lyrics submitted by RynOkane.
