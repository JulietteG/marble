Take all my money
Take all my time
Take all the stars that hang above me
Be mine!

Take all my tears
Covet my eyes
Take what you need
To make you love me 
Be mine!

If I could be that stranger
And knock you off your feet
Make amends for the lies I've told
And put an end to our deceit

If I could feel 
No danger
I'd be all out war
Trade excuses for promises
That I can't keep anymore

Take all my money
Take all my time
Take all the stars that hang above me
Be mine!

Take all my tears
Covet my eyes
Take what you need
To make you love me
Be mine!

And didn't i try
Hard enough to fool you
Didn't i try 
Hard enough to fail
Didn't i try
Hard enough to read between the lines
As this moment set sail...

Take all my money
Take all my time
Take all the stars that hang above me
Be mine!

Take all my tears
Covet my eyes
Take what you need
To say you love me
Be mine!---Lyrics submitted by oscar valadez.
