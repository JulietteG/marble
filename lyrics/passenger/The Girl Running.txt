And I've seen a girl running
With no shoes on her feet
Jumping shade to shadow
In this stiffening heat

And I hear the trains coming
And the drunk man singing on the street
And the fan on the ceiling wheeling me onto sleep

I dream of silent movies
Black and white memories I suppose
With the same old stories
Dressed in different clothes

So where's the girl running?
With no shoes on her feet
For there's no shade, nor shadow
In this stiffening heat---Lyrics submitted by Pauline Lahaye.
