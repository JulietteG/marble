Well the walls are turning yellow like a smokers tooth,
Cold as a call girls smile in a phone booth,
Baby pigeon starving on the side of the roof,
Nothings changed,

Sometimes words dont say enough,
Sometimes silence says too much,
Too close for comfort but too far too touch,
Nothings changed,

Sun still shiny in the play ground,
Water still running like a grey hound,
My heads still drumming when I lay down,
Nothing strange,
We still rattle round the same town,
Like two little stones in a coke can,
Like two lost kids at a fairground,
Nothings changed,

Car alarms ringing in the dead of the night,
Drunk man singing in the morning light,
Too brave to fall but to scared to fight,
Nothings changed,

Sun still shining in the play ground,
Water still running like a greyhound,
My heads still drumming when I lay down,
Nothing strange,
Were just dancers waiting in the wings,
Aint no answers blowing in the wind,
Aint no saint no sin,
And nothings changed. ---
