Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
Im not gonna roll it no Im not gonna smoke it
Til were staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinkling in the silvery night

Two sips of whiskey in the flask but Im not gonna drink them
I swear Ill make it last
Til were drinking out of the same glass again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
Ill wait for you

Got a polaroid picture in my wallet
Im not going to tear it no Im not gonna spoil it
Its an unspoken heartbreak
A heartbroken handshake Ill take with me where I go

And three words on the tip of my tongue
Not to be spoken nor sung
Or whispered to anyone
Til I scream them at the top of my lungs again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
Ill wait for you
Ill wait for you
And Ill wait for you

Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
Im not gonna roll it no Im not gonna smoke it
Til were staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinkling in the silvery night---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
