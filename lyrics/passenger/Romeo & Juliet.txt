Lovestruck Romeo, sing the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low, your love song guided me
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Say something like, You and me, babe, how about it?

Juliet says, Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack
He's underneath the window, singing, Hey, la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, you exploded into my heart
I forget, I forget the movie song
When are you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes but the dream was just the same
And I dream your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me, as if I was just another one of your deals?

Well, you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say, Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know
I used to have a scene with him

But Juliet, we made love, you used to cry
You said, I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, and all the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

I can't do the talk, like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything, but be in love with you

And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, do the stars with you any time now

But Juliet, we made love, you used to cry
You said, I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, and all the movie song
When are you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?---
