About one year later your daddy was born and your grandma held my hand so tight
Oh I cant tell the joy as she brought forth new life, by the glow of the kerosene light, by the glow of the kerosene light.

Hes the deflated balloon wrapped around your gait
Cut priced to clear a past to sell by date
Hell be fool running through the church screaming out its not too late
When he does, I know that youll wait

Hes the drunk man with bad breath coming on too strong
Hes the beauty queen that strings your heart along
And hell answer every question in your new-age magazine wrong
But I know youll love him strong

So Im leaving before theres nothing to believe in
Im just craving for a love I never knew
Please dont go mistreating me
Im not saying youve been misleading me
Just not needing me the way that I need you

Hes the elephant in the room that never speaks
But you dream about him every two weeks
I wouldnt know his name, but you call it in your sleep
Oh I know you love him deep
So run back to him like you should
I guess I always knew that you would
For hes captured your heart in a way I never could
So go on and love him good

So Im leaving before theres nothing to believe in
Im just craving for a love Ive never knew
Im the stray cat you keep feeding
Youre the book I cant stop reading
But the tides are receding that its true

So please dont go mistreating me
Im not saying youve been misleading me,
Just not needing me the way that I need you
Just not needing me the way that I need you---
