I got no money in my hand, or my coat, or my pocket
Wont get to space cuz I havent got a rocket
But I have air in my lungs, eyes in my sockets
And a heart that beats, like a tap that leaks
In the night when you havent got a plumber who can stop it
Jack in a box without a key to lock it
Well this boat may sink, but Im not going to rock it, cuz the sea doesnt know my name
Yeah, the boat may sink, but Im not going to rock it, cuz the sea doesnt know my name

Well if you cant get what you love, you learn to love the things youve got
If you cant be what you want, you learn to be the things youre not
If you cant get what you need, you learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Oh, the things that stop you dreaming

Well Ive got no ones word and nobodys promise
Not a lot to show but this book full of sonnets
And my liver may be fucked, but my heart is honest
And my word is true like the sky is blue
In the summertime when everybody gets on it
Warm my skin just to get sunburn from it
And our eyes shine bright, like a sky full of comets that shoot like silver trains
Yeah, our eyes shine bright, like a sky full of comets that shoot like silver trains

Well if you cant get what you love, you learn to love the things youve got
If you cant be what you want, you learn to be the things youre not
If you cant get what you need, you learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Ohhh woah, the things that stop you dreaming

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohhh
Oh, ohhh, ohhh, ohh
Ohhh, ohhh, oh, no

Well if you cant get what you love, you learn to love the things youve got
If you cant be what you want, you learn to be the things youre not
If you cant get what you need, you learn to need the things that stop you dreaming

Ohhh wohh, the things that stop you dreaming
Oh the things that stop you dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
