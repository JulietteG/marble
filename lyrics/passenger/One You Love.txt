We're all looking 
That's what she said
For someone to share our thoughts
For someone to share our beds
But if you find someone 
That doesn't try to change you
And if you find someone 
That doesn't have to blame you
And if you find someone 
You don't need to explain to
You've found the one you love

We're all searching
That's all I know
For someone to keep us warm
When the rain soaks through our clothes
But if you find a hand to hold
When the night comes
To be there when you're old 
And you're frightened
If you find someone 
That loves you with a love song
You're found the one you love

So hold it near
'Cause love it comes so quickly
And then it goes
And be careful my dear
'Cause the very thing that makes you 
Will be the thing that breaks you
You know

Oh, and if you find someone
That doesn't undermine you
If you find someone
That doesn't drag behind you
If you find someone 
That loves you just like I do

You've found the one you love.---Lyrics submitted by Sharette Kern.
