You're just a stone's throw from me
But throwing stones could never be
The perfect way to start
'Cause sticks and stones make broken bones
Empty words make broken homes
But it's love that broke her heart

And if I knew what you were thinking
I would stop this boat from sinking
But darling you are like the sand
And you're slipping through my hands 
I just don't know what you're thinking

You're just a photo in a drawer
But photographs are not much more
Then ghosts we can't forget
Just a red rag to a bull
You're just a false hope for a fool
But it's as close as I can get

And if I knew what you were thinking
I would stop this boat from sinking
But darling you are like the sun
Setting when my evening comes
I just don't know what you're thinking

And I will stop the sky from falling
If I knew, if I knew
And I would love you every morning
If I knew, if I knew
Oh, oh
If I knew what you were thinking
I would stop this boat from sinking

But darling you're like the stars 
I know that I can't reach that far
I just don't know what you're thinking---Lyrics submitted by Sharette Kern.
