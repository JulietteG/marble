i dont wanna talk about the weather
i dont wanna go out on the town
i dont wanna watch TV together
i just wanna kiss you on the mouth

we dont have to spend a lot of money
we dont need to get up off this couch
i just want to turn the lights down hunny
and kiss you on the mouth

i wanna get drunk on your lips like wine
get lost in you a 1000 times
baby while your here with me tonight

i dont wanna think about tomorrow
i dont need to think about that now
i dont want ask where this is going
i just wanna kiss you on the mouth

i wanna pull your body close to mine
i dont know why were wasting time
cuz baby its just you and me tonight

i dont wanna talk about the weather
i dont wanna go out on the town
i dont wanna watch TV together
i just wanna kiss you on the mouth

i think i could stay like this forever
baby this is what lifes all about
let me show you how to make it better
let me kiss you on the mouth

i just wanna kiss you on the mouth---Lyrics submitted by Shari.
