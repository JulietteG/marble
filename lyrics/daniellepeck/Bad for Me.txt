I like chocolate 
But my hips sure don't 
I like drinking red wine 
but tomorrow my head sure won't
These are just some things that I love
That are bad for me


I like shoppin'
But my purse sure don't
I like wearing high heals
But tomorrow my feet sure won't
These are just somethings that I love
That are bad for me


But of all the things I shouldn't do
Number one is lovin' you
There's a fate old charm
In your faithless arms
Why is everything that feels so dang good
Bad for me

I like fast cars
But the law sure don't
I like partyin' late
But tomorrow my boss sure won't
These are just some things that I love
That are bad for me


But of all the things I shouldn't do
Number one is lovin' you
There's a fate old charm 
In your faithless arms
Why is everything that feels so dang good
Bad for me


Oh I like danger 
But common sense sure don't
Tonight I like your sweet lies
But tomorrow my heart sure won't
These are just some things I love
That are bad for me


But of all the things I shouldn't do 
Number one is lovin' you
There's a fate old charm
In your faithless arms
Why is everything that feels so dang good
Bad for me


Oh your one of those things
That I love
But your bad for me

So bad for me---Lyrics submitted by Roni.
