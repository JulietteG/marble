Well I know, you couldn't love me
cause you're promised to a wealthy man
take a look, what are you seeing?
is that a noose or a wedding band

Should i go to see a healer
nervous twitchin' in my hands
nervous twitchin' in my head

God help me rid this feelin'
cause i'm fallin' to pieces
and i can't get out of bed

Beggars and hangers-on
try to take you from me
someone with a bible in his pocket
clouding everything you see

Beggars and hangers-on
they chip it away
bury your soul in the river
cause the end is here to stay

God help me rid this feelin'
cause i'm fallin' to pieces
and i can't get out of bed

I was wrong i don't need you
it seems reckless and unfair
better days
are far behind
guess that's another cross i'll have to bear

I know that there's a time and a reason
to take the ghost and lock it up inside
and maybe i am down
but i'm not beaten
like anything
we were born to die

Beggars and hangers-on
try to take you from me
someone with a bible in his pocket
clouding everything you see

Beggars and hangers-on
they chip it away
bury your soul in the river
cause the end is here to stay

Beggars and hangers on
beggars and hangers on
no no no no
no no no no
no no no no---Lyrics submitted by Tamar OniaSvili.
