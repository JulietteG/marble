(feat. Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators)

Mama, don't you cry
Don't you worry
I cannot stay here any longer
The time has come to find a distant calling
That only seems to get much stronger

And, I know it's hard
To see the one you come to lean on make his way
Far beyond the world but I can't stay

I won't stop running
I'm only getting closer
To getting off the ground this time
The sky is calling, the wind is at my shoulders
Won't let this chance pass me by
Mama, I'm bent to fly

Remember yesterday
Before the storm
Before the innocence was lost
I promised I would stay forever more
But, every boy, in time moves on

Your wounds will heal someday
This I know, but I am restless and so torn
Mama, I can't stay here any more

I won't stop running
I'm only getting closer
To getting off the ground this time
The sky is calling, the wind is at my shoulders
Won't let this chance pass me by
Mama, I'm bent to fly

I can feel it coming
A perfect storm is rising
Gotta say my last goodbye...

(Mama, I'm bent to fly...)

Mama, don't you cry
Don't you worry
I cannot stay here any longer

I won't stop running
I'm only getting closer
To getting off the ground this time
The sky is calling, the wind is at my shoulders
Won't let this chance pass me by
Mama, I'm bent to fly, ohhhh

Mama, I'm bent to fly

Yeeeaah...

I can feel it coming
A perfect storm is rising
I gotta say my last goodbye...---
