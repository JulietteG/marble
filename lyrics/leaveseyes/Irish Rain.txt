Let the rain kiss you
Wash away my pain
A minute to keep silence
Time to think and time to weep

Irish rain 
It's the only thing
I share with you tonight
Irish rain lullaby

Let the dark embrace you
Like a feather bed
A moment to seek silence
Time to pray for inner peace

Let the moon enlighten you
Like a midnight star
Is there heaven great enough 
To spread my holy love for you?---Lyrics submitted by Annoymous.
