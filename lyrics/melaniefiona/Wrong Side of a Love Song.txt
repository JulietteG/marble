Where were you when I needed a friend
Thought I could be strong
Never knew I'd be so low
A heart breaker, most of my life
Suddenly all changed
The moment you left me
And walked out my life
I tried to break through
But instead I was playing myself
What you gotta know about me
Is I'm dying in this lonely hell

And I don't wanna be without you
Cause I can hardly breathe without you
This is what it feels to be the one
Who's standin' left behind
How did I become the wrong side of the love song?

Baby, I'm a mess
Out of every piece and part of me
You were always the best
But instead I was leaving you here alone
But I didn't mean it
No, I didn't mean it
Now I'm begging baby come home

And you got me singing why
Why you wanna make me cry
I'll be thinking 'bout you
Got me dreaming 'bout you
Every single day and night

And I don't wanna be without you
'Cause I can hardly breathe without you
This is what it feels to be the one
Who's standin' left behind
How did I become the wrong side of the love song?

How baby
Wanna know why
You can feel me, why
Said that you'll be there for me
Said you'll care for me
So now you gonna say goodbye

And I don't wanna be without you
Cause I can hardly breathe without you
This is what it feels to be the one
Who's standin' left behind
How did I become the wrong side of the love song?

I really need you now baby
Oh baby, oh baby---Lyrics submitted by sunshyyne.
