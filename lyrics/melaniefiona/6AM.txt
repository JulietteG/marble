[T-Pain]
Girl why you mad (why you mad)
I know (know) exactly what time it is

You aint gotta tell me (you aint gotta tell me)
So whats up with the yelling (whats up with the yelling)
Shorty I was up in the club (club) really turned up (up)
Chillin just minding my biz
I wasnt doing nothing wrong (wasnt doing nothing wrong)
Girl you know that I was coming home

[Melanie]
Im just saying
It feels like forever you been gone
Where did you go (where did you go)
And how do I know (I know)
It aint a lie (aint a lie)
Cause it seems like it never takes this long
For you to come back
Boy tell me where your phone is
You a grown man

[Chorus]
Its six in the morning
Conversation got boring
And I been waiting up for him
Six in the morning
Why did my lover not answer
I was somewhere with a dancer
Its six in the morning
Oochy wally wally you been at a party
Getting all kinds of naughty
Its six in the morning
Too many lies, not enough time
Four and five, six in the morning
Its 6am, Its 6am, Its 6am, Its 6am

[T-Pain]
Its way too early (too early), calm down (down)
You aint gotta jump in my face
Im bout to go to sleep (Im bout to go to sleep)
Holla at me round three (holla at me round three)
(Girl, Girl) Girl I been drinking
And I cant even make up a lie right now
With you in my ear (with you in my ear)
Shorty I was just playing (Im listening)
What are you saying?

[Melanie]
Boy who the hell you really think youre talking to
If only you knew (if only you knew)
What I had planned for you (for you) you woulda been here
Coulda had had my loving
Instead you out there clubbing (that aint cool)
And you aint even pick up the phone
Im tired of being all alone

[Chorus]
Its six in the morning
Conversation got boring
And I been waiting up for him
Six in the morning
Why did my lover not answer
I was somewhere with a dancer
Its six in the morning
Oochy wally wally you been at a party
Getting all kinds of naughty
Its six in the morning
Too many lies, not even time
Four and five, six in the morning
Its 6am, Its 6am, Its 6am, Its 6am

What your ass doing up anyway, anyway
Fuck that I was sitting here worried about you
I been on my grind all week (like me)
I was just trying to grab me a drink
You coulda picked up the phone
And let your girl know
Cause love shoulda brought ya home

[Chorus]
Its six in the morning
Conversation got boring
And I been waiting up for him
Six in the morning
Why did my lover not answer
I was somewhere with a dancer
Its six in the morning
Oochy wally wally you been at a party
Getting all kinds of naughty
Its six in the morning
Too many lies, not even time
Four and five, six in the morning
Its 6am, Its 6am, Its 6am, Its 6am---Lyrics submitted by shi luvz yuh.
