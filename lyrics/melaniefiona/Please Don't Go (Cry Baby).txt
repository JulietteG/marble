I want to love you
Until the morning comes
Secretly I want to tap you on your shoulder
and ask you to come closer to me
( I wanna love you I I wanna love you)
Baby your so fine
the way you make me feel is always on my mind
(I think I need your love)
Baby darling I'm afraid to love I'm falling
Please Don't Go

Chorus
Stay right here where the lovin is strong
Baby please don't go
Stay right here where your needed the most baby
Don't Make me cry baby
Imma cry baby for you

I get fever when I see ya you've turned me to a believer in love
(hmm hmm hmm hmm)
You've got me wrapped around ya finger
when I seem to be in need of your touch
(hmm hmm hmm hmm)
Baby you don't know
the way it feels to me when your out the door
( I miss you so)
Baby Darling its true its love I've fallin
Please Don't Go

Chorus

Bridge(x2)
All the ladies take your crying to the floor
if you got a man and don't want him to go

Don't make me cry baby cuz
Imma cry baby for you

Chorus

All the ladies take your crying to the floor
All the ladies take your crying to the floor
Cry baby
Cry baby
Don't make me cry baby cuz
Imma cry baby for you---Lyrics submitted by charlayne.
