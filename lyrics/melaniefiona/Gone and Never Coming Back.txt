Verse 1
sad that memories never die
just fill your head with why
then you're caught livin a lie again
its sad that all he ever said 
was that he loved me to death 
but that hes gone again and I was wrong again

Bridge
cuz you think its easier 
easy like that
just when I wasn't finished 
you were gone like that
cant you hear me crying
cuz I need you back 
cuz im slowly dying 
cuz I need you bad
cuz youre gone
and never comin back
gone and not comin back
hes never comin back

Verse 2
should've known the long kiss goodbye
would bring sadness in my life 
wearing this disguise again
I wish that you would've said
or lied to me instead
like a bullet to my head
like a fool I pretend
that its on again on again

cuz you think its easier 
easy like that
just when I wasn't finished 
you were gone like that
cant you hear me crying
cuz I need you back 
cuz im slowly dying 
cuz I need you bad
cuz youre gone
and never comin back
gone and not comin back
hes never comin back

Verse 3
whoever said look on the brighter side
has never been on mine
whoever said that he'll get his
never felt like this
aint no use in crying 
when youre done like that
cuz baby baby you took something 
that I cant buy back
and now you're gone 
and never comin back
comin back
oh hes not comin back---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
