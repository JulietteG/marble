(feat. B.o.B)

I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ

[Melanie Fiona]
'Cause this one's got scratches
Went to get drinks, and I'm asking him how did you get this way?
Whose lipstick is on your face?

It's been 15 minutes then 2 hours
You think you can make it up with some damn flowers?
Thinkin' bout the things you do when I'm waiting over here and you ain't got no skoo

'Cause you don't care right here
And you don't care who's there
And you don't care
Oh here's the song I hear

[Chorus]
You can do better, then do better
If you don't like how he's playing then change the record
You can do better, then do better
'Cause I don't know what kind of games you're playing
But it's time to change the record, record, record

I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ

'Cause this one's got played out
Skips everything you wanna hear about
Far from perfect, a little played out
Tired of the lies you wanna run about yeah yeah

'Cause you don't care right here
And you don't care who's there
And you don't care
Oh here's the song I hear

[Chorus]
You can do better, then do better
If you don't like how he's playing then change the record
You can do better, then do better
'Cause I don't know what kind of games you're playing
But it's time to change the record, record, record

[B.o.B]
Yeah yeah, Well this is what dependence is
I was with the model type, body like a gymnast
Hot sex each night, It was just ridiculous
We was a match made in heaven but we had to split because we couldn't fix the differences
And the differences, she was manipulative, and I wanted to do just whatever I did
But apparently you had a better idea and you left, I guess that's how it is
Hollywood divorce after Hollywood romance
Now when we together, we don't even hold hands, we don't even two step and we don't even slow dance
We was a duet, we was on bed
But now I'm solo, It's no show and no fans
That's how I go, you strike out like Molan
But strike out like Baseball, you go down the goal man
And now you frozen, and don't know there's no chance
She put them hooves on your head like a Colts fan
Now they comment on your life like a sportsman
I need a mediator, you need a mediator, you need a mirror and maybe you'll see

[Melanie Fiona]
The faster you let it go
The faster you will hear me happy on the radio
Stronger I let it flow
The deeper I fall into this hole.

'Cause you don't care right here
And you don't care who's there
Now I don't care
'Cause here's the song I hear

[Chorus]
You can do better, then do better
If you don't like how he's playing then change the record
You can do better, then do better
'Cause I don't know what kind of games you're playing
But it's time to change the record, record, record

I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ-eh-eh-eh

Eh-eh-eh
Eh-eh-eh
