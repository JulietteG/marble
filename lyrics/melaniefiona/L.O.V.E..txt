Uh uh ah ah
Yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
Uh uh ah ah

Oh, love
So many suffer
We all ask why as they fight for their lives
Can we try, though it may seem impossible, change it
Or we just cant sit by
Love just cant let them die

How long 'til we get it right?
How long will it take?
Oh, we should come together
And we should start today

I know that we can do it
There ain't nothin' we can't rise above
All we need is L.O.V.E love
Love is the right solution,
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love,
All we need is love

Yeah, yeah, alright
If you are with me say your right tonight
Yeah, yeah, alright
It's L-O-V-E, love

So many voices,
So many mothers cry
Can we take the time to listen?
Oh, can we try in this time of trouble?
We know (oh) love is the only cure
It's what we're waiting for

How long 'til we get it right?
How long will it take?
Oh, we should come together
And we should start today

I know that we can do it
There ain't nothin' we can't rise above
All we need is L.O.V.E love
Love is the right solution,
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love,
All we need is love

Yeah, yeah, alright
If your with me say alright tonight
Yeah, yeah, alright
It's L.O.V.E, love

Yeah Yeah Alright
It's L.O.V.E, Love
Release your love inside
Release your love inside
It's L.O.V.E, Love

We can shed a light in the darkness
We can make it right where it's wrong
It's time to conquer hate
Before it's too late
Show them what we needed for so long

I know that we can do it
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
Oh, all we need is L.O.V.E love
Love is the right solution,
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love,
All we need is love

Yeah, yeah, alright
If you are with me say alright tonight
Yeah, yeah, alright
Yeah, yeah, alright it all comes back to love
Yeah, yeah, alright release your love inside
Release your the love inside
Release your the love inside
It's L.O.V.E love

Yeah yeah alright
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah alright
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah alright---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
