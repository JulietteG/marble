verse1:
i know theres love waiting on the top of the hill
 when i get there i hope its not too late to reveal 
this broken heart of mine it seems it ran out of time 
loving you loving me its not the way its suppose to be 
but youll regret it, you wanna bet it sit in this golden goose free

chorus:
my love where did we go wrong
i wonder whos in your arms especially because you did me wrong. 
you know sad songs are the best songs
 you dont have to wonder how its gonna end.

verse2:
gave back my key
because you seem to have so many.
did you know this, the wrong one was given to me
with the in L.M, is that who you are seeing
loven her, leavin me, its not the way it suppose to be 
but youll regret it, youll be upset when the next man is lovin me

chorus:

verse3:
no one to cry on, ive begining at the end of this song
so i remain strong keep an interest .................
what did i do lord, to deserve to be alone............................---Lyrics submitted by alex.
