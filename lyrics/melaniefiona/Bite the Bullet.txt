The first time you shot me down I was grazed
Second round was never found, it ricocheted
Nowhere to run, I was stunned in a daze
A victim of a love I can't escape

I remember when you said you loved me
Three little words that burned into my soul
Maybe you didn't mean those things you told me
Maybe you didn't really mean those words at all

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
Or stop playing with loaded guns
Stop playing with loaded guns

What do you want from me?
Baby what do you want from me?
You think you have the ability to love two women equally
Well I don't have the energy to fight for your exclusivity
Oh no no no no

Cause I remember when you said you loved me
That's why it's so damn hard to let you go
How did you mean them things you told me?
Did you ever really love me at all?

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
Or stop playing with loaded guns
Stop playing with loaded guns

All this back and forth, what is it for?
The silent games, the tug of war
Wish I could break down your walls
Be the one you call, catch you when you fall
Brick by brick, I thought that we could build again
But now I know this is the end

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
I'm done playing with loaded guns
Done playing with loaded guns---
