I know what you want from me
My light, my love, my everything
Keep your hands to yourself
Place them by your sides
Put your needs on the shelf
And ride in on the Atlantic tides
Busy bodies build up themselves
Climbing ladders to the top
They fall and blow their knees to dust
Seek after the ones that they trust
Crawling to the friends that they once hand
And begging for a second chance---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
