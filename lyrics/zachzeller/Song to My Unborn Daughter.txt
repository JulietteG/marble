As the seasons change they look your way
And by your side
It's a shallow walk on the longest road
So keep your hands in mine
Be ready for eventful games
To come your way
In the end they make no sense
These games are not the ones
You want to play
Leave me for love
I've got your neck in my hands
Now your leaving your last breath---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
