My bones are aching now
Time has caught up to me
Saw her months ago
In the firey space
Didn't speak a word
Recognize the face
So I decide
Your mine
Take him by the hand
Put him in his place
Show him the world
Leave a paper trace
In the rain
You cried
"Why oh why?"
Your mine---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
