I've graced these hands and have tasted these lips before
One day my true love, the next a treacherous storm
I have lost again
I won't let her back in
True love's so sweet as well is the taste for blood
The veins run real thin, to thin to ever love again
I am coming down
From the worst trip of love
She wants back my time, my thoughts, my mind
I will give back her worthless sense of pride
I have gained one love
It has a hold on me---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
