The lemons don't fall far from the tree
While the keys tap gently in between
As the clouds creep closer to our knees
Swinging for the guidance we seek
Singing blue jays crawl up your spine
And share the deepest secrets in your mind
Finding the sharpest corners inside
Discovering what you'd thought they'd never find---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
