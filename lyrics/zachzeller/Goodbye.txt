We find caves and build our homes from dust
Bones from grave yards, tempting metals rust
Closet drinkers, failing teacher's room
Rainy classroom, picture puzzle room
Sign off to the cove, tell your friends goodbye
Shifting feet walk, moving side by side
Falling downwards, grasping tears of love
Streaming upward, spawning fish fly high---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
