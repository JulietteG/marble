She's driving down the five
With the  sunshades over her eyes
Covering what's deep inside
The answers that keep her alive
I'm left alone
With a dog and no telephone
She's running to-and-fro
With nowhere to go
She's stranded on the road
There's no one in sight
She's a dimming light
I don't know what to do now
The flashes won't turn on
It's so terribly wrong
Her painting fell from the wall
It's all bloodied on the floor
Thin layers begin to peel
It's the sort of scene you have to feel
She's hanging from the rope
There's no one in sight
She's a faded light---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
