Ahhh... Yeah yeah 
Youve got to show me love 

Heartbreaks and promises, Ive had more than my share 
Im tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere 
What I need is somebody who really cares 
I really need a lover, a lover who wants to be there 
Its been so long since I touched a wanting hand 
I cant put my love on the line, that I hope youll understand 

So baby if you want me 
Youve got to show me love 
Words are so easy to say, oh ah 
Youve got to show me love 

Im tired of getting caught up in those one night affairs 
What I really need is somebody who will always be there 
Dont you promise me the world, all that Ive already heard 
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words 

So if youre looking for devotion, talk to me 
Come with your heart in your hands 
Because my love is guaranteed 

So baby if you want me 
Youve got to show me love 
Words are so easy to say, oh ah  
Youve got to show me love 

Show me, show me baby 
Show me, show me baby 
Show me, show me baby 
Show me, show me baby 

Heartbreaks and promises, Ive had more than my share 
Im tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere 
What I really need is somebody who will always be there 
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words 

If youre looking for devotion, talk to me 
Come with your heart in your hands 
Because me love is guaranteed 

So baby if you want me 
Youve got to show me love 
Words are so easy to say, oh ah yeah 
Youve got to show me love 

Theres nothing that you can tell me 
Youve got to show me love 
Theres only one key to my heart 
Youve got to show me love 

Show me, show me baby 
Youve got to give it to me, give it to me, give it to me yeah 
I dont want no fakes, dont want no phoney 
I need you love 
Show me, show me, show me baby 
Give it to me, give it to me 
I am not a toy, Im not a play thang 
Youve got to understand 

If youre looking for devotion, talk to me 
Come with your heart in your hands 
Because me love is guaranteeeeeed... 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Mallory.
