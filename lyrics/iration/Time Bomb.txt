You've seen her at a party, she's doing her rounds 
She likes to get it started, she likes to get loud 
She's poppin' that champagne, she's taking shots down 
She's living for the moment, 

She's a time bomb, trying to take you out, 
The ticking of her heart is the only sound 
She's a time bomb, about to detonate 
You try to cut her wires but you're way too late 

Whiskey stain on her dress now, she's wearing it proud 
And there's nothing you can tell her, cuz she's starting to shout 
Now she's spraying that champagne, all over the crowd 
She's living for the moment 

She's a time bomb, trying to take you out, 
The ticking of her heart is the only sound 
She's a time bomb, about to detonate 
You try to cut her wires but you're way too late ---
