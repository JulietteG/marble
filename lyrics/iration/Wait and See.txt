I know we've always been a long 
Shot, I'm down to roll those dice, 

I'll travel down that long hard 
Road girl, 
Just to make you know 
That I tried 
We might not make it 
In the end but, 
We'll sure enjoy 
That ride 
At least we'll have 
This song to remember, 
The way we 
Felt that night 

I'm all in til 
You make it with me 
I'll read it 
Written on that old marquee 
Take 
A chance just wait and you'll 
See 
Oooh wait and see 

I know 
We've always been a long shot 
I'm 
Down to run all night 
Travel 
Through the rain and cold 
Girl 
Just to make you feel 
Alright 
We might not make it in 
The end but 
We'll sure enjoy 
That ride 
At least you'll have 
This song to remember 
To remember 
Me by 

I'm all in til 
You make it with me 
I'll read it 
Written on that old marquee 
Take 
A chance just wait and you'll 
See 
Oooh wait and see---
