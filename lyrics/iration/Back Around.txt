What you said
I can't seem to get it out of my head
Lost in the thoughts of the past when I go to bed
I thought that I'd move on
You'd just become a brand new song
Miscounted the one that was there to be counted on

This wounded heart of mine can't walk the line
Maybe I'll be better off the 2nd time

Waiting for you to come back around girl
So you can save my world
And when the lights go on in the night I'm not lonely
Back around girl
Change my world
And when the lights go off in the night I'm not lonely

I could've been a better man
I could've tried to understand
But I don't know anything
I lost before I began

This wounded heart of mine can't walk the line
Maybe I'll be better off 2nd time

Waiting for you to come back around girl
So you can save my world
And when the lights go on in the night I'm not lonely
Back around girl
Change my world
And when the lights go off in the night I'm not lonely---
