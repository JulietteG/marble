This is that full out souped up automatic just cant quit let the bass hit right on time
Running hard til the end put you in a panic automatic

I know that life is just a test and Im trying my best to give it nothing less and
I know I do it all for you when I see you staring back with a love thats true
Sometimes I dont know how to feel
I try to soak it in
Its all so surreal and
Im just a man with a guitar
Words in my mind
A song in my heart

I wanna give it back to you
I know that you can feel it too

This is that full out souped up automatic just cant quit let the bass hit right on time
Running hard til the end put you in a panic automatic smile knowing youll be mine
Full out souped up automatic cant quit let the bass hit right on time
Running hard til the end put you in a panic automatic

Were gone travelling so far
Take us in your car
Bump it in the yard
We grow and bring it back to you
Never losing touch with what weve been through
Sometimes we get pulled away
Know that well be back
Sorry for the delay
We are all about the luv
You give us the life that we all dreamed of

And we wanna give it back to you
I know that you can feel it too

Chorus

The time has come
The lights are on high
I wanna know I never thought life was passing us by
And the only certainty is that its you and me tonight
And were gonna give it all til the curtain call
Were gonna make it alright---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
