You, I think it was half past 3  
You spilled your Jim and Coke on me  
Left the party half past 4  
Had to sneak into your dorm  
Left before the sun had shown  
Trippin all over your clothes  
As I shut the door to 213  
I heard your voice from the bed say...  

Get back to me, Get back to me  
I'm waiting for you to  
Get back to me, Get Back to me  
I'm waiting for you  

I always living on the fly  
Used to think about you and I  
Hoping someday that we could be  
I'm thinking that some day we should be  
You  
I'm tired of wasting time  
You probably found another guy  
And now I'm messaging your iPhone  
Because you're in another time zone---
