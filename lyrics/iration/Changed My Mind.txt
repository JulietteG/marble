I've known you for a while girl
And yeah we've had some good times
But when I saw you last night girl
Well I just couldn't define
The way you looked in that dress girl
I saw you mouthing my name
And I just got to confess girl
I felt that something had changed

[Chorus:]
I know I said I'm not crossing that line
And I know I said I was doing just fine
But after what you did to me last night,
Ooh girl you changed my mind

I've known you for a while girl,
And yeah you've always been down
But when I saw you last night girl
I knew I had found...
The one to break down my walls
Until they crumbled to dust
You're the one that can change me
You're the one I can trust---
