Youre living out there, surrounded by blue 
Lush green eyes, sand on your shoes 
Youre home and I dream of you 
Remember those times? 
You could make a fantasy appear in real life 
Every time I leave you now I have to think twice 
And dream of you 
And its true, theres nowhere quite like you 
Its about time that you knew 
Youre home and I 

Dream of you I dream 
Dream of you I dream 
Dream of you I dream 
Youre home and I 

When Im lost out there, youre easy to find 
I close my eyes, youre in my mind 
Youre home and I dream of you 
December sunshine, the only memories are ones that make me feel fine 
Just know well be together when I see you in my dream of you 

And its true, theres nowhere quite like you 
Its about time that you knew 
Youre home and I 

Dream of you I dream 
Dream of you I dream 
Dream of you I dream 
Youre home and I---Lyrics submitted by Min.
