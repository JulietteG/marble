Time has come for us to part
I think I'm living as it was
Into the future we must cross, must cross
I'd like to go with you ..
I'd like to go with you...

You say I'm harder than a wall
A marble shaft and that's a fall
I've loved you dearer than them all-l-l-l
so let me stay with you..
so let me stay with you..

As we walked into the day
Skies of blue have turned to gray
I might've not been clear to say
I've never looked away
I've never looked away

And though I'm feeling you inside
My life is rolling with the tide
I'd like to see it be an open ride
Going along with you
Going along with you

And we came out into view
There i found myself with you
When breathing it felt like something new
Going along with you
Going along with you

Time has come for us to part
I think I'm living as it was
Into the future we must part
I'd like to go with you..
I'd like to go with you..
I'd like to go with you..
Id' like to go with you..---Lyrics submitted by spikespiegel.
