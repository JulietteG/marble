Come round amen corner
And there she standin in the door
Staring in the eyes of my poor sole
Been around I wore those shadows
That Sooner or later drag ya down
Hang around your heart and your mind
I... been down this road before
I... don't go there anymore

Ahhh honey I look in your eyes
It carries me far away
Take me right back to the day
In my mind
I've been down where nothing matters
And your knocking everybody down
Stumbling every place in town
With an open door
I... like to open up the door.
I... can't go there anymore

Ahhh you're a devil
You can push those buttons
Til there's no more water
In the well
Fires burnin in hell
Flowin in my veins
I've been around I know you brother
I know how this story goes
You and me pushin it
To blow then I feel fat
I... like to even up the score
I... don't go there anymore

Come round amen corner
And there she standin in the door
Starin in the eyes of my poor sole
Been around I wore those shadows
That Sooner or later drags ya down
Hang around your heart and your mind
I... like to open up the door
I... been down that road before
I... don't go there anymore---Lyrics submitted by blake beall.
