Flying kites
With boy wonder
Hold tight
To me all summer

Reading my magazines
Dancing in my blue jeans

Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do for everybody to see
Polaroid through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me

I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light

Fireworks
And night streamers
Baby blue
With the day dreamers

Under water
Close to me
Hold my breath
In my blue jeans

Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do for everybody to see
Polaroid through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
