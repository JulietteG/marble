Break a bone
Got me on my knees
You break my heart
Just to watch it bleed

Im sick with love
Sick like a disease
Dont call me up
Just so I can please you

I cant stand the way youre smiling
I cant stand the way Im lying

I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that its for me
Its not up to you, you know its up to me but
Curiosity will never let me go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh,
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Look at me
Left here in the corner
Stupid girl
I really tried to warn her

Walked the streets all night
Until you came around
Knew that you would come
Before you ever even made a sound

I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that its for me
Its not up to you, you know its up to me but
Curiosity will never let me go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh Curiosity

So dont break me tonight
This is crazy love
And you know Im gunna follow you home
Through the rain
Cause I need your love
And you know Im gunna follow you home.

Cause I need your love and you know Im going to follow you

I know, I know, I know you got the key
You know, you know, you know that its for me

Well I think that we should try it out to see yeah
Curiosity

So dont break me tonight
This is crazy love
And you know Im gunna follow you home
Through the rain
Cause I need your love
Yes I need your love

So dont break (dont break) me tonight (me tonight)
This is crazy love
And you know Im gunna follow you home
Through the rain
Cause I need your love
Yes I need your love

Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,
Uh oh Curiosity will never let me go---
