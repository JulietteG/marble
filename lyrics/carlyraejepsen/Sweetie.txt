We were both headed different ways
 Both in a rush, trying to get away
 I ran into you-ou-ou
 Like a crash of thunder
 Out in the rain waiting for the bus
 We started talking 'bout different stuff
 And it's true-ue-ue
 There's an eight world wonder
 And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
 I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
 I can make it happen
 We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
 Anytime of day boy
 I'll be your distraction
 We can make it happen
 I could be your sweetie, sweetie
 You're not as lonely as you think you are
 I'm trying to tell you
 Anything you want boy
 I can make it happen
 We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie, sweetie

A dinner date and a glass of wine
 We stayed up late and lost track of time
 When I'm with you-ou-ou
 I feel a different hunger
 You held my hand and you didn't let go
 I'm gonna kiss you now
 I thought you should know
 And it's true-ue-ue
 There's an eighth world wonder
 And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
 I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
 I can make it happen
 We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
 Anytime of day boy
 I'll be your distraction
 We can make it happen
 I could be your sweetie, sweetie
 You're not as lonely as you think you are
 I'm trying to tell you
 Anything you want boy
 I can make it happen
 We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie

Anything you want boy
 Anything you need
 Anything you want boy
 Anything you need

Anything you want boy
 I can make it happen
 We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
 Anytime of day boy
 I'll be your distraction
 We can make it happen
 I could be your sweetie, sweetie
 You're not as lonely as you think you are
 I'm trying to tell you
 Anything you want boy
 I can make it happen
 We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
 Anytime of day boy
 I'll be your distraction
 We can make it happen
 I could be your sweetie, sweetie
 You're not as lonely as you think you are
 I'm trying to tell you
 That all I wanna do, is just be true to you
 And give you satisfaction
 Sweetie, sweetie
