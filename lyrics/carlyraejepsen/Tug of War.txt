You seem to good
To good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger then i'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering who you're screwing

Tug of War
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again

You seem to good
To good to be true
I'm loving you longer
Longer then i'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering who you're screwing---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
