Maybe hes right 
Maybe there is something the matter with me 
I just, I dont see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad 

Look at this stuff 
Isnt it neat? 
Wouldnt you think my collections complete? 
Wouldnt you think Im the girl 
The girl who has everything 

Look at this trove, treasures untold 
How many wonders can one ever hold? 
Looking around here you think 
Sure, shes got everything 

Ive got gadgets and gismos a plenty 
Ive got whos town whats its galore 
I walked in a world of sin, Ive got 20 
But who cares? No big deal 
I want more 

I wanna be where the people are 
I wanna see, I wanna see them dancing 
Walking around on those 
What you do call it? Oh, feet 

Flippin your fingers you dont get too far 
Legs are required for jumping dances 
Strolling along down a whats that word again? 
Street 

Up where they walk, up where they run 
Up where they stay all day in the sun 
Wondering free, wish I could be 
Part of that world 

What would I give? If I could live out of these corners 
What would I pay to spend a day doing all these things? 
Venture on land, they understand that they dont recommend their daughters 
Bright young women, sea could swim in 
Ready to stand 

Im ready to know what the people know 
Asking my questions, Ill get some answers 
Whats a fire and what is it? 
If it would burn 

Whens it my turn? 
More than alive 
Love to explore and show up above 

Out of the scene 
Wish I could be 
Part of that world---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
