I threw a wish in the well
Dont ask me Ill never tell
I looked at you as it fell
And now youre in my way

I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasnt looking for this
But now youre in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night
Wind was blowing
Where you think youre going baby?

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But heres my number
So call me maybe
Its hard to look right at you baby
But heres my number
So call me maybe

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But heres my number
So call me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But heres my number
So call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still youre in my way

I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and its real
I didnt know I would feel it
But its in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night
Wind was blowing
Where you think youre going baby?

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But heres my number
So call me maybe
Its hard to look right at you baby
But heres my number
So call me maybe

Hey i just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so so bad, bad, bad, bad.

Its hard to look right at you baby
But heres my number
So call me maybe

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But heres my number
So call me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But heres my number
So call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me, maybe---Lyrics submitted by Justine L.
