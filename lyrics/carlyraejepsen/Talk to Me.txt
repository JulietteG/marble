Every morning
As I go walking by
I feel you looking
Thats why I take my time
Oh oh yeah

I can see what cha wanna do to me
You can feel it somethings gonna break
Well Im in if youre in
Lets make a big mistake

Talk to me, why wont you talk to me
Cant you see Im burning up
When you look like that
And Im looking right back
Why dont you talk to me
Walk with me baby

When hes singing his song
Well all the young girls sigh
And well be wearing those things
That make a grown man cry
Oh oh yeah yeah

I can see what cha wanna do to me
You can feel it somethings gonna break
Well, Im in if youre in
Lets make a big mistake

Talk to me, why wont you talk to me
Cant you see Im burning up
When you look like that
And Im looking right back
Why dont you talk to me
Walk with me baby

Come on take me away
Ive been yours from the start
Summer nights, Summer days
Ill be your summer heart

Come on take me away
Ive been yours from the start

When its love like that
And you look like that

Talk to me, why wont cha talk to me
Cant you see Im burning up
When you look like that
And Im looking right back
Why dont you talk to me, walk with me baby

Come on take me away
Ive been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
Ill be your summer heart

Come on take me away
Ive been yours from the start

Talk to me, why wont you talk to me
Cant you see Im burning up
When you look like that
And Im looking right back
Why dont you talk to me talk to me
Why wont cha talk to me---
