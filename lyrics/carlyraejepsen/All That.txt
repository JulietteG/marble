I wanna play this for you all the time
I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best of you and more
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

I'll be the magic you ever see
You can always rely on me
To help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
I will be that
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
I will be that
I will be your friend

I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost to see
I'll keep my light on, baby, you can always come to me
I wanna be the place you call your home
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
I will be that
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
I will be that
I will be your friend

When you need me
I will never let you come apart
When you need me
I will be your candle in the dark
When you need someone
Oh, let me be the one
The only one
And the only one
And the only one

Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
I will be that
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
I will be that
I will be your friend

(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
(And I will be your friend)
I will be that
I will be your friend
(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
(And I will be your friend)
I will be that
I will be your friend

(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
(Show me if you care)
I will be that
I will be your friend
(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
(Show me if you care)
I will be that
I will be your friend
(Show me that you care)

I will be that
I will be your friend
Oh, show me that you care
I will be that
I will be your friend
Just show me that you care---
