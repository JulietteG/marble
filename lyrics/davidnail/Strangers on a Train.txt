Sometimes you see someone
When youve already got someone
Still you wonder what if they had come
Along, a long time ago
You know that theyre feeling it too
But there aint nothin you gonna do
Except for imagine who you might have been with them
Theyre not tryin to make it last
Just enjoying each second as they pass

Cause as these little brick houses are flying by
Neath the flickering of the railcar lights
I let myself get lost in your eyes a while
Not another passenger in here can see
How in my mind youre holdin me
While outside the cold makes snow out of the rain
But in here were just strangers on a train

Start to smile, I turn my head
Its kinda like a spiders web
I just cant seem to sake you off
So I look your way again
Youre staring off trying to pretend
Like you havent noticed me at all
But dont feel guilty it dont mean much
The truth is the two of us aint never gonna touch

Cause as these little brick houses are flying by
Neath the flickering of the railcar lights
I let myself get lost in your eyes a while
Not another passenger in here can see
How in my mind youre holdin me
While outside the cold makes snow out of the rain
But in here were just strangers on a train

Brakes grind, I gotta go
Reach down pick up my coat
Afraid that you might stop me in the aisle
Watch my breath rising in the air
I cant do nothing but just stand there
As you press your hand against the windowpane
And I wave to my stranger on a train
My stranger on a train---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
