I aint never seen the snowfall on the Delta
Like the one thats gonna cover all of New York tonight
But it sure do remind me of those miles and miles of cotton
Long ago but not forgotten, yeah, thats a southern mans field of white

Yeah, I turned my back and walked away
But lately I aint seen a sunny day
Been thinking bout rolling on back home
Back where I belong

So wont you put me on that riverboat Queen
Let the side wheels spin
Cause I aint seen that muddy water town in I cant remember when
All these years they played a trick on me
No, I aint the man I used to be
Tonight I feel like Mississippi

People round here, Lord they move in such a pace
Im just another face, lost in the crowd
Theres a sweet sound being sung down in Dixie
Now and again it gets me when I get to feeling down

Yeah, I turned my back and walked away
But lately I aint seen a sunny day
Been thinking bout rolling on back home
Back where I belong

So wont you put me on that riverboat Queen
Let the side wheels spin
Cause I aint seen that muddy water town in I cant remember when
All these years they played a trick on me
No, I aint the man I used to be
Tonight I feel like Mississippi

All these years they played a trick on me
No, I aint the man I used to be 
Tonight I feel like Mississippi
Tonight I feel like Mississippi---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
