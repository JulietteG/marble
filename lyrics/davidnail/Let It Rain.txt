Its hard to find the perfect time to say something 
you know, is gunna change everything
Living with the shame, 
it aint nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
that she threw out the window, 
Drowning next to me 
No, seven years of good cant hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

So let it rain, let it pour, if she dont love me anymore, 
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, 
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, 
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

Last thing I remember was the unfamiliar taste of someone on my lips,
Its too late to turn around, 
When the shades start coming down, 
The guilt you feels the last thing on your mind

So let it rain, let it pour, if she dont love me anymore, 
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, 
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
So let it rain, let it pour, if she dont love me anymore, 
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, 
every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me, 
let it come down on me, let it rain,
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
