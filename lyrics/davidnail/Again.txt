She said, "California," as a tear fell down her cheek 
"Small town Missouri just ain't the life for me." 
Waved goodbye to mom and dad, and all her friends 
In that '97 Mustang, that we both lost it in 

I can't recall the day I'd finally had enough 
Chasing my father's dream and never of growing up 
I turned in that uniform before I ever played a game 
With a junior college scholarship in a white trash town upstate 

You never know which way the road is gonna go when it bends 
And all I know is what I'd give today to feel that way again, yeah

I made the most of no degree here selling cars 
On the Westside of St. Louis where most the rich folks are 
From time to time I hear about some star you met 
And just how close you've come but haven't made it yet 

It gets me thinking 'bout the way it was and all we could've been 
Wondering if you ever wish you could feel that way again, oh, and feel that way again 

You never know which way the road is gonna go when it bends 
And all I know is what I'd give today to feel that way again 

I cannot lie sometimes when I come back to town 
I head out to the river and roll the windows down 
Listen to that Mississippi running through the night 
Let it wash away the years and bring you back here by my side 

Let it wash away the years and bring you back here by my side 
Again, feel that way again

I wanna feel that way, I wanna feel that way again
I wanna feel that way, I wanna feel that way again---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
