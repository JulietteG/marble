Well, the turn signal's clicking
And the seconds are slipping away
Just a little bit more of this turnpike
And so much to say

The airport traffic, it slows us to a still
I turn the radio down
And leave one hand on the wheel

Well I don't know what to tell you
What do you wanna hear
You see, guys like me, we just disappear

You deserve someone who will never leave
But, girl, the last few days are the best we'll ever be

Isn't every goodbye a chance to become
A bittersweet memory for someone
Don't you ever look back with regret
Share with me a moment for all time
In a corner of your mind

If you've never seen New England in the fall
Should you find yourself up there, give me a call
But before I make my way into the crowd
Could I share one last kiss while we're still in the clouds

Isn't every goodbye a chance to become
A bittersweet memory for someone
Don't you ever look back with regret
Share with me a moment for all time
In a corner of your mind

Isn't every goodbye a chance to become
A bittersweet memory for someone
Don't you ever look back with regret
Share with me a moment for all time
In a corner of your mind

In a corner of your mind---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
