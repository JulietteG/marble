She's a little complicated
She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that'll keep you waitin', waitin' around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplyin her lipstick
The muddy river bank shes the first in and last out
She's got somethin I can't figure out
That everybody's talkin about

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she never the same
The sun one minute then she pourin down rain.
And she'll do whatever she wants
And she moves at the jump of a drop
And I'll do whatever she wants I don't want her to stop
I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she never the same
The sun one minute then she pourin down rain.
And she'll do whatever she wants
And she moves at the jump of a drop
And I'll do whatever she wants I don't want her to stop
I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

She's got me hangin' on the ledge
On the edge of a kiss
All I ever wanna do is this

She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

She's a little bit complicated
That's alright
Doesn't matter I'll keep on waiting
For whatever she's got
For whatever she's got ---
