I know what you think, here we go again
The same waste of potential that Ive always been
Ive been given chances and Ive burned some bridges up
Had a million excuses why Id self-destruct

But this time around
Im a little more ready now
Im a little bit older, a little more figured out
This time around

I see what I want and Ive had a taste
Im aware of the sacrifice its gonna take
I aint afraid of failure cause I aint supposed to win
It took a while to find it, but Im back again

But this time around
Im a little more ready now
Im a little bit older, a little more figured out
This time around

Yeah, this time around
Im a little more ready now
Im a little bit older, a little more figured out

Yeah, this time around
Im a little more ready now
Im a little bit older, a little more figured out
This time around

Yeah, this time around
This time around---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
