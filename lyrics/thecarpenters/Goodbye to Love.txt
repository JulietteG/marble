I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it

So I've made my mind up I must live my live alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love

There are no tomorrow for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to love for something I could live for

All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future s a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as if falls
There may come a time when I will see that 
I've been wrong
But for now this is my song

And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
