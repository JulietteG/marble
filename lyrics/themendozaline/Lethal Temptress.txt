oh I bled on the bed 
from a wound in my head 
on the night before I sent this
welling with dread 
from the things that were said 
in the boardroom that left me defenseless

and though you weren't there 
I could still feel you stare 
and your voice it rang cold and contemptuous
so forgive me this morning 
if I should fall worn
in the arms of the lethal temptress

at a nightclub engagement 
we sang on the stage
in a voice that broken and tuneless
still it's better to work 
than to beg like a jerk 
for the kind of things we all find useless

and hell hath no fury 
and dear I'm not worried
I will see to my eternal penance
just one more glass of gin 
before I fall back in 
to the arms of the lethal temptress

so you frighten the ghost town 
and ground them all down 
til one day you'd reach a consensus 
and I know from your verse 
you put America first 
and all others you simply beat senseless 

and worship like this 
is to honor the fist 
and to conjure what's cruel and licentious 
and I don't know what's fair 
and I really don't care 
in the arms of the lethal temptress

and I won't place a bet 
but I knew when we met 
that one day we'd come to regret this 
and that what once was love 
can turn quickly enough 
into something so hard and contemptuous 

and hell hath no fury 
and death is no jury 
our love's ended before I commence this
but for one final sin
you won't see me again
in the arms of the lethal temptress

but for one final sin
you won't see me again
in the arms of the lethal temptress---Lyrics submitted by Tristan T.
