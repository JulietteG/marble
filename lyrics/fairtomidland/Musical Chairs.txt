You should be counting your blessings
From the sky
Your eagle eyes found the great blind faith
I could be kicking the bucket
But you should know
I never had very good aim

The right of way
Is a wild goose chase

It makes you wonder
If shooting for stars is like darts in the dark
It makes you wonder
If the beaten path is the promised land

If I worship the ground that he walks on
And it winds up that he has two left feet
Will he be walkin' on water?
Cause you should know
We never like to get our feet wet

The right of way
Is a wild goose chase

It makes you wonder
If shooting for stars is like darts in the dark
It makes you wonder
If the beaten path is the promised

I got dizzy
I got lost

It makes you wonder
If shooting for stars is like darts in the dark
It makes you wonder
If the beaten path is the promised land

It makes you wonder
(It makes you wonder)
It makes you wonder
(It makes you wonder)
It makes you wonder

And I'm just a stick in the mud---Lyrics submitted by Jeff.
