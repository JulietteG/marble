Man I feel like money
Man I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
They come around like honey
Cause I'm fly like a bee
Man I got them all 
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada
Man I got the world
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada

Back to back up in the mix like that 
And I know you like it when it's just like that 
All the girlies just love my swag
From my kicks to the way I fix my hat
I'm...... Back
Fresh like some new J's
Brodie got next NBA to pay
I'm too paid
Shaded with some ladies
Reppin my city
West L.A. baby
West L.A. made me this way
Two rules:
Stay fresh, homie
Get paid
Hey
Never broke and never bummy
I'm from where it's forever sunny

Man I feel like money
Man I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
They come around like honey
Cause I'm fly like a bee
Man I got them all 
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada
Man I got the world
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada

When I come around, round, round
They go........
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go........

New cat with an old school feel
Only new artist with an old school deal
Tied the game by Steve Lobell
So we always win
Don't need no help
New girls act like they no me so well
But I shows no love and be like "Oh Well"
When my album drops
Sure as hell gonna sell
Stack cash and laugh like "L-O-L"

Man I feel like money
Man I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
They come around like honey
Cause I'm fly like a bee
Man I got them all 
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada
Man I got the world
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada

When I come around, round, round
They go........
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go........
When I step in your town, town, town
They go........
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go........

Yeah, yeah
Shawty in my ear
Saying all the things that I wanna hear
Buzzin
And as the night ends
I'mma have her and get all her friends
Buzzin
Okay,
Hands in the air (yeah)
From the back to the front everywhere
Buzzin
Throwing out twenties
Throwing out hundreds
Ladies got to love it

Man I feel like money
Man I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
They come around like honey
Cause I'm fly like a bee
Man I got them all 
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada
Man I got the world
Buzzin buzzin buzzin buzzin
Like da-da-da-da-da-dada

When I come around, round, round
They go........
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go........
When I step in your town, town, town
They go........
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go........---Lyrics submitted by Keyarria.
