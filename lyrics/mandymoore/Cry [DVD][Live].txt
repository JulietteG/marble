I'll always remember 
It was late afternoon 
It lasted forever 
And ended too soon 
You were all by yourself 
Staring up at a dark gray sky 
I was changed 

In places no one would find 
All your feelings so deep inside (deep inside) 
It was then that I realized 
That forever was in your eyes 
The moment I saw you cry 

The moment that I saw you cry 

It was late in september 
And I've seen you before (and you were) 
You were always the cold one 
But i was never that sure 
You were all by yourself 
Staring at a dark gray sky 
I was changed 

In places no one would find 
All your feelings so deep inside (deep inside) 
It was then that I realized 
That forever was in your eyes 
The moment I saw you cry 

I wanted to hold you 
i wanted to make it go away 
I wanted to know you 
I wanted to make your everything, all right.... 

I'll always remember... 
It was late afternoon... 
In places no one would find... 

In places no one would find 
All your feelings so deep inside (deep inside) 
It was then that I realized 
That forever was in your eyes 
The moment I saw you cry---Lyrics submitted by Franalyn.
