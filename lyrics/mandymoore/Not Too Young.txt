When you looked at my face
You thought you could get me
You better look twice
It won't be that easy
Think it's because
You're a little older
All you'll get from me
Is my cold shoulder 

You shouldn't judge
Someone by what you see
You may be wrong
Like you were about me... 

I'm not too young
To know
The right things to do
And one of those things
Is not to fall for you
Don't play
Did ya hear me say
I'm not gonna fall for you
So please just go away 

Didn't work out 
The way that you planned
Bragged to your friends
Said you were the man
Now whatcha gonna do
Since your pride is gone
Couldn't get this little girl
Now you're crying all alone 

Too bad you judged me
By first sight
It's too late now
So kiss this chance goodnight 

I'm not too young
To know
The right things to do
And one of those things
Is not to fall for you
Don't play
Did ya hear me say?
I'm not gonna fall for you
So please just go away---Lyrics submitted by daniela.
