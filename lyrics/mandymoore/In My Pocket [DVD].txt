Among the many muted faces
You try to find me in the spaces
You're drawn to my song
You only move to keep from sinking
You close your eyes as if your thinking
Afraid all along
That in my eyes so revealing,
you'll find what you're needing

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
But, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All I got to keep you warm
Baby don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much for your love
How much for your love

Hoping the melody will leave you
You walk to where I might not see you
Reach out to the wind
Looking to catch it for a minute
But just to hold it not be in it
I've been where you've been
Cause somehow I'm so afraid the love will reveal what you're made of

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
But, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All I got to keep you warm
Baby don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much for your love

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
But, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All I got to keep you warm
Baby don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much for your love
Your love
Yeah Yeah!
Your love
Nothing Babe!(x4)

Cause somehow I'm so afraid the love will reveal what you're made of 

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
All I got to keep me warm
But, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All I got to keep me warm
Baby don't leave me here without it
Tell me how much for your love

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
Baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me how much for your love
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All I got to Keep you warm
Baby, don't let me her without it
Tell me how much for your love
(Baby I'd be broke without it)

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Baby, then I'd be broke without it
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All I got to keep me warm
Baby, don't leave me here without it
How much for your love?

Nothing babe(x4)
