Love doesn't come along now does it? 
Present perfect tense
So you made yourself a little world
Where even strangers make more sense
I play the pain upright, straight ahead
And with the beat

You can ease yourself into the light
Or keep that record on repeat

What if I loved you
What if I loved you
What if I loved you
Everblue, Everblue

Following the sleepless hours
Unsubtle dreams will make you cave
You can paint them all your brilliant colors
Just dont fall off into the deep 

Happiness is not a burden
Oh how the pendulum will swing
I have felt the ground
Ive seen the seeds
Out of which grew golden wings

What if I loved you
What if I loved you
What if I loved you
Everblue, Everblue

High above the stars are dancing
To a song one bird is singing
And its you my Everblue

What if I loved you
What if I loved you
You know I love you
My Everblue, Everblue
Everblue
Everblue.---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
