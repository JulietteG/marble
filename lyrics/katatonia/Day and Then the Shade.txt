i will rise
to dreams of freedom
and avow
to return the treason that came under your reign
the day and then the shade
i have slept
inside the season that froze whitin my grasp

all my fears come into view
there must be and end soon
when every waking hour
is part of the lie

I will rise
over glass cathedrals
and let go
whit my eyes resting upon the nearing dark
the day and then the shade
i have slept 
within the reason that kept me so remote

make a brand new vow
in the heat of an evening
the darkness swarms
i was nothing, ever
but red like the sun
dying down over the freeway
in the brand new sky
over the mountain ridge---Lyrics submitted by Leonardo.
