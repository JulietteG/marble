In the still eclipse
Every light is a heartbeat
In the spring
Where I watch
The sudden change

I find this so hard

[Chorus:]
Onward into the battle
Time is growing so dark around me
I, shallow one
I burn us out
Day by idle day

Days at the sea
My words are incomplete
In the blind spot
Where I saw you
On the 4th at night

I find this so hard

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Isaiah.
