To love again, to love again
I will love again, to love again, to love again

Drowning in tears, that won't be me
I will soon be free from these chains of all this pain inside
And though I cry it won't be long
Till I regain the strength to know I can go on

I will learn to love again, I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mend
I will learn to, learn to love again

All of these tears, time will dry them
I will survive them and make it through into another day
All of this pain, time will heal it
There'll be a time sometime I know, I can feel it

I will learn to love again, I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mend
I will learn to, learn to love again

I will learn to love again, I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mend
I will learn to love again, I will love again

I will learn to love again, I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mend
I will learn to, learn to love again---Lyrics submitted by ara.
