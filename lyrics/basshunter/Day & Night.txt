I dont know how i could live without you.
but u changed everything that i knew.
as time went on all the bad feelings were gone
they say when youre in love you know.

everyday everynight
u are in my mind icant deny
i close my eyes to think of you my love
u make me feel alive.

everyday everynight
u are in my mind icant deny
i close my eyes to think of you my love
u make me feel alive.

I dont know how i could live without you.
but u changed everything that i knew.
as time went on all the bad feelings were gone
they say when youre in love you know.

everyday everynight
u are in my mind icant deny
i close my eyes to think of you my love
u make me feel alive.

everyday everynight
u are in my mind icant deny
i close my eyes to think of you my love
u make me feel alive.---Lyrics submitted by saeed.
