You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough, will i ever be by your side

Your hair is dancing in the wind
Your eyes are burning up my skin
And I'm so happy when i see, that you are smiling back at me

You're leaving burn marks on the ground
Thank you god for what i've found
I don't know how, I don't know why
But you're my angel in the night

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now, just like days before you start to cry
You are my light in the dark 
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough, will i ever be by your side

Prepare for launch 3..2..1..

I try my best to satisfy, but all you do is waving me goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but I'm so crazy about you
Even if i don't know where to start
Even if my love is tearing me apart
I just know that you and me
We are always meant to be

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now, just like days before you start to cry
You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough, will i ever be by your side

3..2..1..

You're my angel in the night---Lyrics submitted by aziz.
