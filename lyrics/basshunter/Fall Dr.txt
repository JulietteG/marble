Hey, who are you smiling so pretty to me?
 Hi there, come closer, please, turn your gaze to me.
 I want to know how to breathe, how you next to my body.
 I want to touch your skin but then came a sound that said:
 Hey, wake up, wake up.


 Every day is like an eternity, every second I feel like a year.
 But when I see you in my dream, then, yes, I know it goes.
 Oh, oh, oh, going to hold out until I get home to my bed
 and then start over and be woken in the morning, please let me sleep again!
 Solo so I force myself up, it is the hell it is so hard,
 But even if my time stands still I sing my song goes;

 Hey, who are you smiling so pretty to me?
 Hi there, come closer, please, turn your gaze to me. Towards me.---Lyrics submitted by Zach.
