I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through

I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through

I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

How many of us out there, feel the need to run and look for shelter?
I promised myself

I promised myself
That I'd say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all your wishes come true

I promised my self
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Now I'm in love with you

How many of us out there, feel the pain of losing what was once there?

I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through

I promised myself
I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

I promised myself---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
