1, 3, 4, 5 We are nothing but numbers,
                                                         Calling you, Calling me.
                                         2, 6, 7, 8 Im sorry but i'm running low, Got to go.
                                                   We are nothing but numbers,

                                                 Wherever i am, I dont give a damn.
                                                            Any place, Any time.
                                                       Always you on my mind.
                                        Life would be a delight, With you in my sight.
                                     You to good to ignore, When you stand at my door.


                                               1, 3, 4, 5 We are nothing but numbers,

                                         In the bed, In the car, I know where you are. 

                                             On a boat, far away, I still hear what you say.
                                              In the bed, In the car, I know where you are.
                                           If you sleep on your own, i can tell we're not far.
