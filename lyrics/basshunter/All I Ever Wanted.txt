Oh all I ever wanted was to see you smiling. (echo)
I know that I love you, oh baby why don't you see? (echo)

Oh all I ever wanted, was to see you smiling.
Oh all I ever wanted, was to make you mine.
I know that I love you, oh baby why don't you see, that all I ever wanted was to let it be.

Oh all I ever wanted, was to see you smiling.
Oh all I ever wanted, was to make you mine.
I know that I love you, oh baby why don't you see, that all I ever wanted was to let it be.(echo)

-Come back, baby-

I'm so alone.
Here on my own.
And I am waiting for you to come.
I want to be, a part of you.
Think of all the things we could do.
And everyday, you're in my head.
I want to have you in my bed.
You are the one, you're in my eyes.
All I ever wanted in my life.

Oh all I ever wanted, was to see you smiling.
Oh all I ever wanted, was to make you mine.
I know that I love you, oh baby why don't you see, that all I ever wanted was to let it be.
Oh all I ever wanted, was to see you smiling.
Oh all I ever wanted, was to make you mine.
I know that I love you, oh baby why don't you see, that all I ever wanted was to let it be.(echo)


-Are you ready?!-

Oh all I ever wanted, was to see you smiling.
Oh all I ever wanted, was to make you mine.
I know that I love you, oh baby why don't you see, that all I ever wanted was to let it be.
Oh all I ever wanted...---Lyrics submitted by bruno.
