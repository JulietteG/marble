Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong,
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong,
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be
only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy
Now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it could break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I will think about you everyday

(ready for takeoff)

(are you ready)

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And i miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreamin' that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy 
Now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And i miss you here
Now you're gone
I'll keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hangin' on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy
Now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it could break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I will think about you everyday---Lyrics submitted by Trichiesa.
