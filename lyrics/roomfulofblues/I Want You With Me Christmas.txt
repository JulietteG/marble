I want you with me Christmas
When candles are aglow
I want your love this Christmas
The thrill, the place, the show

If you are with me Christmas
Beneath the mistletoe
My love my love just like the tinsel
Will really deck the glow

We put our hearts together
When love was very young
Yet with each brand new season
A brand new carol is sung

I want you with me Christmas
That's all I really know
I want your love this Christmas
To keep my heart aglow---Lyrics submitted by DiElle.
