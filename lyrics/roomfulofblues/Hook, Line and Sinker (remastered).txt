Sha-la-la, sha-la-la
She calls me her sweet poppa

She's got me hook, line & sinker
Everywhere I turn
When I'm not around her
My heart aches and it burns

Sha-la-la, sha-la-la
She calls me her sweet poppa

She's a little bitty mamma
She's 5 feet from the ground
Oh, when it comes to love
She really puts it down

Sha-la-la, sha-la-la
She calls me her sweet poppa

She fits me to a T
I'm so glad it's me
Not like reading in a story book
She got me and I'm hooked

She's got a sweet disposition
She always wears a smile
If I ever lose her
I'll be just like a child

Sha-la-la, sha-la-la
She calls me her sweet poppa

She fits me to a T
I'm so glad it's me
Not like reading in a story book
She got me and I'm hooked

She's got a sweet disposition
She always wears a smile
If I ever lose her
I'll be just like a child

Sha-la-la, sha-la-la
She calls me her sweet poppa---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
