Some Peace Will Come

I know these are times of trouble
Trouble is always around
I see that old haunted look on your face
And I can tell there's a lot comin' down

Chorus:
But keep it together
Nothin's forever
Except for that place in the sun
Wait a little longer
And when you are stronger 
I know some peace will come
I know some peace will come

These are the times they were talkin' about
When they told you life ain't always fair
But when you are yearning and burning with doubt
Just thank the Lord you've got someone who cares

Your days are filled with a longing
Broken up by a memory or two
I know that good times can't be long in coming
With someone as good intentions as you---Lyrics submitted by Sara Perry.
