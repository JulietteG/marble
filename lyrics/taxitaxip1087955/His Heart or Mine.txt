I am his secret 
No one can see
Who does he speak to when he speaks to me
There's a woman he loves
I am thinking I am fine
Then I wonder how many conversations at the same time

When he's upon me I'm suddenly shy
It grows bigger
I'm more like terrified
Suddenly I cannot tell 
If it's his heart or mine
That is beating so clearly, so alive---Lyrics submitted by Sophia Soray.
