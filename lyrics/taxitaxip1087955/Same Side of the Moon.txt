Stood still and smiled when left to you
"Wanna come with me?" he, he asked
I couldn't do nothing, could just laugh
I couldn't do nothing, nothing
could just laugh

At night I try to feel you somehow 
and I look into constellation and I 
imagine you see the same things and I,
I recall

We don't see the same side of the moon
We don't see the same side of the moon

At night, I try to see you somehow 
and I imagine you beside
look into my mouth 
when I sang words you couldn't understand, I was singing:

Fr jag har grtit floder, och jag flt nstan bort
Ingen utom du kan trsta varfor kom du inte fort? 

Vinden er fr svag och solen er fr varm,
s lnge jag inte vilar i din famn

We don't see the same side of the moon
We don't see the same side of the moon
We don't see the same side of the moon
We don't see the same side of the moon---Lyrics submitted by Sophia Soray.
