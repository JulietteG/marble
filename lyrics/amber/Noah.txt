My name is Noah and the sea is my home.
This small wooden boat will be my throne.
I'm proud of what I've built and the things that I've done.
And all of the people I've learnt to love.

Noah. Noah.

My name is Judas and my hands are tied.
Even my presence is a warning sign
that wherever you go and whatever you do
your past will always follow you.

Noah. Noah.

Get busy living or get busy dying.
I would hate to see you left behind.

Noah. Noah.---Lyrics submitted by Henry Wyeth.
