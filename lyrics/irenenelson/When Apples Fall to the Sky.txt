Wonder day
Heavens spread on Earth today,
Apples started falling to the sky.
Its a time
When your perfect child is born
Politicians settle disputes far and wide.

Souls in flame,
God loves all of us today,
Men lay down their arms to bring bright hopes,
All beloveds feel a passion in their hearts
Aint it euphoria without a dope?

Chorus:
To the sky
Love is more than ever
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky
Sweethearts leave us never
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky
Warfare cease forever
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky, 
To the sky
When apples fall to the sky

Wonder day!
Language barriers away
Your best songs are written just for love
Colored skin,
Does it really mean something?
Hopeless case got one more chance for life

To the sky
Love is more than ever
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky
Sweethearts leave us never
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky
Warfare cease forever
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky, 
To the skyyyy
When apples fall to the sky
To the sky, to the sky---Lyrics submitted by Angela Love.
