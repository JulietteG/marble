Shadows dance in the night
We are reaching the sky
Im like a bird but dont set me free
Our room has no walls
Theres no moon it dissolves!
I dont sleep but I see real dream!
Someones spreading the nets
Someone stabs in the back
But were feeling no fear
and no pain!
We are birds in the sky
We can fly so high
Cuz Love flows in our veins

Chorus
Sunset Sunrise
When Im with you my soul feels like butterflies
Sunrise Sunset
I open loving heart without regret
Sunset Sunrise
When Im with you my soul feels like butterflies
Sunrise Sunset
Baby I wanna be with you all the time I get

When my stars in the sky
We can fly through the night
We walk over the water as well
Closing my eyes anew
Ill be tender with you
I am breathing your fragrant smells

Theres ............ wings
No matter well die or win!
Cuz we rise from the ashes and flame
Im immortal with you
Youre in my heart! Its true
And I know that youre feeling the same

Chorus
Sunset Sunrise
When Im with you my soul feels like butterflies
Sunrise Sunset
I open loving heart without regret

Sunset Sunrise
When Im with you my soul feels like butterflies
Sunrise Sunset
I open loving heart without regret
Sunset Sunrise
When Im with you my soul feels like butterflies
Sunrise Sunset
Baby I wanna be with you all time Ill get---Lyrics submitted by Angela Love.
