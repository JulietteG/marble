Your voice is like a ghost inside my head
You whisper lies to try and hurt me again
All the times you doubted me you'll see
I was always better than you made me out to be

Not gonna let you down let you down easy
You're gonna feel it inside
It's gonna eat you alive
When I walk away walk away believe me
The pain will say I told you so
Uoh

Tearing off the grip you had on me
Time has told me you will never be what I need
The ashes from the hell you put me through
They will be the memories what's left of me and you

Not gonna let you down let you down easy
You're gonna feel it inside
It's gonna eat you alive
When I walk away walk away believe me
The pain will say I told you so

All your promises to all my dreams were never ment to be
You never believed in me
Hiding your regrets
You'll come back
Wanting me to fall in your arms
Who do you think you are?

Not gonna let you down let you down easy
No
When I walk away walk away believe me
The pain will say I told you
I told you so
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Not gonna let you down let you down easy
You're gonna feel it inside
It's gonna eat you alive
When I walk away walk away believe me
The pain will say I told you so
I told you so---Lyrics submitted by heatheredworthy.
