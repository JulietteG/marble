4 oclock in the morning, city lights
Like diamonds lighting up the night
The partys over but were not
Take a taxi down to the water
Moon is out, but its getting hotter
Its been hours now, but I havent had a drop
And this feeling wont stop

Chorus
Youre my champagne, baby you got straight to my head
Just one taste, Im about as high as I can get
Voice shaking, heart skipping
One look and my worlds spinning out
Youre my champagne
Youre my champagne

Long walk home cut through the park
Give away our secrets underneath the stars
Getting lost, but we laugh it off
Dont got cash, but we got time to spend
Dont stop, dont want this night to end
Wanna drink it up, every sip of you

repeat chorus

Oh Ill never get enough of you

repeat chorus---
