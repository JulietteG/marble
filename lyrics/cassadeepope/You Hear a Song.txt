Maybe one day I'll just let it all go
Let every shade of my true colors show
Keep loving me and I'll lose all control
Eventually...

Never wanna be, never wanna be that girl
With a million needs, who keeps running your world
Boy, do you lie, when you say I look good tonight.

I see a mess in the mirror,
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in,
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
But you hear a song, you hear a song

They keep talking,
All the ghost from the past
Heart broken,
Can't get over it fast
Just give it up, stays around,
And it never leaves.

I see a mess in the mirror,
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in,
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
But you hear a song, you hear a song

A one note symphony... Baby come on
And sing it back to me.

I see a mess in the mirror,
But you see the girl of your dreams
I see the dark clouds rolling in,
But you see the sky I can't see
I hear this melody coming out all wrong
It sounds like the chaos I hear in my head
All night long, but you hear a song,
You hear a song [3x]---
