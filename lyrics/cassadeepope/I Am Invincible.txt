For my girls, the fighters, the warriors,

Broken glass inside wont cut through me
Pain behind my eyes I turn into strength
Oh I will fight, I will survive

I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh-ah-oh
Invincible

Cracks run through these walls,But they still stand strong
Oh heart covered in scars, But my fear is gone
Oh I will fight, I will survive

I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh-ah-oh
Invincible

Nothing gonna make me break or shatter
Nobodys gonna tell me that I dont matter, no
I wont let you

Time is running out, keeps getting faster
Gotta find a way, bring out the answers
Til I can say

I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond that will last

Oh-oh-oh oh, oh-ah-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh, oh-ah-oh
Invincible---
