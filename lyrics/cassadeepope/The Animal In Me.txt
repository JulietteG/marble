(feat. Robin Zander)

It feels like thunder
When we're slowly digging in
It kind of makes me wonder
About the lovers that have been

Lying in my bed with her hands tied up
I knew it all along that it wasn't enough

Cause when I got a taste of you
I found something to sink my teeth into

It's an ache that never heals
It's the deepest cut you feel
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me
It's the darker side of lust
It's the other side of us
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me

I want to be your last breath
Before we suffocate
A kiss you can't forget
Like a wedding on a rainy day

The chills keep shooting down the back of my neck
Like a freight train pounding in the pit of my chest

Cause when I got a taste of you
I found something to sink my teeth into

It's an ache that never heals
It's the deepest cut you feel
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me
It's the darker side of lust
It's the other side of us
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me

It's a hurt that never heals
It's the deepest cut you feel
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me

It's an ache that never heals
It's the deepest cut you feel
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me
It's the darker side of lust
It's the other side of us
It's the thing in you that feeds
The animal in me---
