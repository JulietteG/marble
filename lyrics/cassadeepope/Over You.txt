Weather man said its gonna snow
By now I should be used to the cold
Mid-February shouldnt be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say Ill be OK
But Im not going to ever get over you

Living alone here in this place
I think of you, and Im not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didnt mean to give them to me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say Ill be OK
But Im not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

Cause you went away,
How dare you?
I miss you
They say Ill be OK
But Im not going to ever get over you ---
