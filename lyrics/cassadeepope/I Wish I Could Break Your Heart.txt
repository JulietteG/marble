I wish I could break your heart 
I wish I could bring you down 
Just for a second, teach you a lesson about being alone in the dark 
I wish I could make you cry 
So hard you can barely breath 
And maybe you just might know what it feels like 
oh to be me 

Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby 
But itd be nice to know that I could 
Be strong enough to pull you under, throw you back a little under thunder 
Even though I never would 
I wish I could break, I wish I could break your heart 

I wish I could crush your dreams 
I wish I could turn back time 
Boy Id lead you on light the fuse, drop the bomb 
Just so Id be the first to leave 

Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby 
But itd be nice to know that I could 
Be strong enough to pull you under, throw you back a little under thunder 
Even though I never would 
I wish I could break, I wish I could break your heart

I wish I could break your heart 
I wish I could make you cry 
I wish I could turn back time 

Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby 
But itd be nice to know that I could 
Be strong enough to pull you under, throw you back a little under thunder 
Even though I never would 
I wish I could break, I wish I could break your heart

I wish I could break your heart 
I wish I could break your heart ---
