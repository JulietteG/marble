If I had just one tear runnin' down your cheek
Maybe I could cope, maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent, yeah

Could you cry a little
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feelin' a little more pain
I gave now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

If your love could be caged, Honey I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath the pile of lies you handed me
And you would hunt those lies, they'd be all you'd ever find
That'd be all you'd have to know for me to be fine, yea, yea yea

And you'd cry a little
And die just a little
And baby, I would feel just a little less pain
I gave, now I'm wantin'
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

Give it up, baby
I hear your goodbye
Nothings gonna save me
Can see it in your eyes
Some kind of heartache, darlin'
Give it a try
I don't want pity
I just want what is mine, yea, yea yea

Could you cry a little
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feelin' a little more pain
I gave now I'm wantin'
Something in return
So cry just a little for me eee eee, yea
Cry just a little for me, wao ooo waa
Could you cry a little for me
Yea, yea---
