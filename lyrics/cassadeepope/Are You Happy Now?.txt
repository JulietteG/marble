Now, dont just walk away
Pretending everythings ok
And you dont care about me
And I know theres just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I dont care... yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that youre happy now, ohhh, ohhh
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased,
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

You took all there was to take,
And left me with an empty plate
And you dont care about it, yeah.
And I am givin' up this game
Im leaving you with all the blame cause I dont care, yeah, yeah yeah,

Could you look me in the eye?
And tell me that youre happy now, oohh oohhh
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased,
Are you happy now? Ohhh, ohhhh
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now? yeah, yeah, yeah.

Do you really have everything you want?
You can't ever give somethin' you ain't got
You cant run away from yourself

Could you look me in the eye?
and tell me that you're happy now, yeah, yeah
come on, tell it to my face or have i been replaced,
are you happy now? Ohhh, ohhhh
are you happy now?

Would you look me in the eye?
Could you look me in the eye?
Ive had all that I can take
I'm not about to break
Cause Im happy now, ohhh, ohhh
Are you happy now?---
