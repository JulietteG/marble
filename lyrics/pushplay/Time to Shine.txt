Monday, roll out of bed 
OK, 'cause I'm feeling dead 
I need a break Let's ditch school
and party all day Call in sick 'cause 
we're going all the way Are you ready? 
Now is our time to shine And have a 
good time 

We're doing fine We all need a break 
Work will have to wait For another day 
Today, is really great I can't wait to tell 
all my friends Everyone must know The 
sun's blaring, music is blasting I wish 
this day was everlasting 

I can't wait to do it all again 
I need a break Work will have 
to wait for another day Our 
time to shine and have a good
time we're doing fine We all need
a break work will have to wait for 
another day for another day

cause I need a break cause I 
need a break work will have to 
Wait for another day Its our time 
To shine were doing fine yeah 
We need a break we need a break
Its our time to shine its our time 
To shine---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
