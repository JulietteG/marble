I watched you walk into the room
I watched you while he was kissing you
And now it's he says, she says tell me the truth
You know I saw you, caught you, do what you do
You know I watched you doing what you do

You told me I'm the one
I hope you had your fun
I'm done and I want out of this

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna take you back, take you back
I'm never gonna break
I'll show you, I won't call you

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna live with that, live with that
My nightmare just came true
And now heart attacks on you

Do you miss me when you close your eyes?
And do you still see me in his disguise?
And now it's he says, she says all of the lies
Now I saw you, caught you, what a surprise?
Do you miss me kissing you tonight?

You told me I'm the one
Hope you had your fun
I'm done and I want out of this

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna take you back, take you back
I'm never gonna break
I'll show you, I won't call you

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna live with that, live with that
My nightmare just came true
And now heart attacks on you

And now my heart attacks on you
I'm out the door
And you're barely breathing
Now I'm leaving you

You really should have thought things through
I guess I wish you all the best
As long as your heart breaks in two

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna take you back, take you back
I'm never gonna break
I'll show you, I won't call you

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna take you back, take you back
I'm never gonna break
I'll show you, I won't call you

Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna break
Heart attack, heart attack
I'm never gonna break
My nightmare just came true
And now heart attacks on you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
