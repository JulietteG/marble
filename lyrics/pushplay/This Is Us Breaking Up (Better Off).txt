Baby, but I'm finally breaking out so roll the credits 
and just forget it Ill make it through somehow
And don't go and change your mind
Honey, but it's not gonna be work this time
I'm biting my lip, I'm holding it in
I'm leaving you behind

Tell me can you hear me screaming out?
The next time that you see me keep your head 
Down Cause I'm not gonna miss you I've got all 
the pictures and scissors, I'm cutting you out

Say that you need me Ill say that I'm leaving, 
Goodbye I'm better off here without you and I 
don't give a damn about you say that you need me
I'll say that I'm leaving, goodbye I'm better off here 
without you and thats just how I feel about you now

You can try and stand up tall girl you  know your 
back's against the wall the story is ending so stop 
pretending I cared for you at all

So call up the EMT baby, you're not gonna take this lightly
And for the record I burned your letters They meant nothing 
to me tell me can you hear me screaming out the next time 
that you see me keep your head down 'Cause I'm not gonna 
miss you I've got all the pictures and scissors, I'm cutting 
you out

Say that you need me I'll say that I'm leaving, goodbye
I'm better off here without you And I don't give a damn 
about You say that you need me I'll say that I'm leaving, 
Goodbye I'm better off here without you And that's just 
how I feel about you

I apologize for breaking down This is us breaking up, the
moment is over And I told you it's not working out So stop 
your crying now, it's off my Shoulders Tell me can you hear 
me screaming out the next time that you see me keep your head 
down 'Cause I'm not gonna miss you

Say that you need me I'll say that I'm leaving, goodbye Im better off here 
without you and I don't give a damn about you say that you need me
I'll say that I'm leaving, goodbye I'm better off here without you And that's 
just how I feel about you say that you need me I'll say that I'm leaving, 
Goodbye I'm better off here without you And that's just how I feel about 
you---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
