im wondering 
aimlessly to get yuh off of my mind
and the city lights shine so bright
brings back the look in your eyes
speechless.
motionless
can yuh hear me? can yuh hear me?
so here's your song for what i've done wrong
how could this happen?
singing we were dreamers
every single day
singing we were believers
in every single way
and im running out
just to try and catch yuh outta breath hopeless
and im running out
clever words to keep yuh
here with me till myy endd
keeping out the thousands of emotions
in my head, on the bed
so heres yuhr song for what i've done wrong
singing we were dreamers
every single day
singing we were believers
in every single way
not ready to go !
ohhhhhhhhh ohh
singing we were dreamers
every single day
singing we were believers
in every single way yeahh
i'll take yuh fast
i'll take yuh slow
just hold on and don't let go
faster now than ever before
close yuhr eyes and shut the door
i'll take yuh fast
i'll take yuh slow
just hold on and don't let go 
faster now than ever before ! 
dreamers !---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
