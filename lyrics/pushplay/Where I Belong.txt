The day's we spent together the night's 
will last forever but all good things must 
come to an end senior year is almost over
and I never felt closer to my friends that I 
can count on depend on and on ill say the 
more I stay the longer you wait cause 
California is so far away but day by day 

I feel the same and I don't want us to fade 
away so we're miles and miles and miles 
Away from the spot's that we made memories 
we said we'd be together that we'd be friend's 
Forever with promises and tears in our eye's 
we bit our lips and said goodbye knowing we
may never meet Again 

oh will meet again I promise well meet 
Again the more I stay the longer you'll 
wait cause California is so far away but 
day by day I feel the Same but I don't want 
us to fade away I promise you ill follow 
through and all the thing's you said I do
but most the time it won't work out that 
way the horizon seems to fade away

it's harder now than yesterday
cause where you are is where I belong
the more I stay the longer you wait
cause California is so far away
but day by day I feel the same
and I don't wanna us to fade away
the more I stay the longer you wait
cause California is so far away
but day by day I feel the same
and us to fade away just fade away---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
