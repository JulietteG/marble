Baby, baby got so much on his mind
Let's just forget about last night
And press rewind press rewind
Don't stress he's got nothing to do with you
It's just me I need some time to recoup 
And break free from you

Girl Stop staring Stop staring and go 
Stop caring Stop caring and go stop
staring Oh stop staring and go Stop 
Staring stop looking at me now 

Go 
through it I already told you Let 
this sink in your head there's no me 
and you Me and you I didn't expect 
to have to deal with all this Believe 
me It's not my lost romance Lost romance

Girl stop staring stop staring and go 
stop caring Stop caring and go stop 
Staring Oh stop staring and go
Stop staring stop looking at me now

What don't you get? 
What don't you get? 
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
What don't you get? 
What don't you get? 
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Girl stop staring stop staring and go 
stop caring Stop caring and go stop 
Staring Oh stop staring and go
Stop staring stop looking at me now---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
