Every time your eyes meet mine
It gives me chills up and down my spine
I can feel it through your fingertips
And I'm sensing that its mutual through your lips
First kiss by your front door
You're all I wanted and so much more
I promise you I that won't do wrong
If you just listen to my song
You're more than beautiful
And time is on your side

[Chorus:]
Days pass by
I wonder why
You're not by my side
I'm here without you
Sleepless nights
I try and try
To figure out why
I'm here without you

Every since the first day we met
First date we can never forget
Just walking through the city streets
Holding hands in the theater seats
Just you and me side by side
Two hearts ready to confide
I promise you that I won't do wrong
If you just listen to my song
You're more than beautiful
And time is on your side

[Chorus]

Without you ---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
