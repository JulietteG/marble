Oh noo, 
Last night I made a prediction,
It's not worth all the affliction,
I almost wish, I wish it wasn't my reality 
And it's totally non-fiction
Everything is a contradiction
That's right, baby what I've got is real
Whoahh

[Chorus]
Life has me right where it wants me,
it's so beautiful.
Time passes by,
choose to close my eyes,
far from beautiful.

And I'm not made out of plastic 
Got to get out, and be drastic
Cause what I've got, baby what I've got is real

[Chorus]
Life has me right where it wants me,
it's so beautiful. 
Time passes by,
choose to close my eyes,
far from beautiful

And I'm not made out of plastic
I'm not made out of plastic
I'm not made out of plastic
Out of plastic 
Out of plastic

Cuz i'm not made oh oh oh yeahhh!

[Chorus]
Life has me right where it wants me,
it's so beautiful.
Time passes by,
choose to close my eyes, 
far from beautiful

Last night I made a prediction,
it's not worth all the affliction
I almost wish, I wish it wasn't my reality
And it's totally non-fiction
Everything is a contradiction
That's right, baby what I've got is real. 

Whoah oh oh ooh oh oh oh.---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
