Love and it's consequences you can't 
win but you can't get out Leaving 
yourself defenseless So high you can't 
get back down Love and it's consequences
One long dramatic scene Though we all know 
the ending We still can make believe Danger, danger
Flying like a moth to light You can't save me this time

Woah don't give me a warning
Just be my next mistake Woah oh 
The sky is falling Falling down in flames
And I don't want to turn I love the way 
you make me hurt I'll light it up this one 
last time And watch it burn

Love and it's consequences Embracing 
pure defeat Covered in sweat and ashes
This is the last shit I need In the fallout 
of explosions Lost in the strangest dream
Watching it back in slow motion You wince 
before you scream Danger, danger So many 
reasons to ignite You can't stop me this time

Woah don't give me a warning
Just be my next mistake Woah 
the sky is falling Falling down in 
flames and I don't want to turn
I love the way you make me hurt
I light it up this one last time And 
watch it burn Woah
Maybe I've been too extreme And too 
Emotional But now this has to go
I can't be well enough alone

Woah
don't give me a warning
Just be my next mistake Woah
The sky is falling
Falling down in
Start a fire and watch it grow
I love to see my love implode
I light it up this one last time
And watch it burn Burn
And I don't want to turn
I love the way you make me hurt
I light it up this one last time
And watch it burn---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
