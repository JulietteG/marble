ba ba bada da dun da da du dun
dun ba da dum dum dummmm
The key, to my heart 
Is far out of your reach
Please detain me an intricate man
I stand dignity
Sure, so sure, that the avenue
Is more than an option to me
A contradiction to misery

Oh, oh oh
'Cause all's I need's a little oscillation
It picks up the pace and gets things moving..
Gets things.. moving for me
Oh, oh, oh
Get on your feet and start that motivation
Get ready, set, hit the floor tonight
I promise it's all right
All that I know
Is that change is the key to reinventing truth
Best on our own without you
Rise, rise above, the previously set boundaries
Are non-existent we don't need you know

Oh, oh oh
'Cause all's I need's a little oscillation
It picks up the pace and gets things moving..
Gets things.. moving for me
Oh, oh, oh
Get on your feet and start that motivation
Get ready, set, hit the floor tonight
I promise it's all right
All that I know
Is that change is the key to reinventing truth
Best on our own without you
Rise, rise above, the previously set boundaries
Are non-existent we don't need you know---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
