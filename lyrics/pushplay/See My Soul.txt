On a train full of strangers
Take a glance and look away
When a smile could be dangerous
Safer to be afraid

Building boxes and no one fits in
Everydays a judgment day
Makes me wonder

If you could see my soul
These walls would surely shatter
If you could see my soul
Our differences won't matter
Anymore, I'm letting go
Of all the history
that's come between us
Oh if you could see my soul

What I'm worth on the surface
Who I wear and who I know
don't give you a clue, about my purpose
Or how much deeper I might go
Without the chance I'll show my colors
No ones only black and white
don't you wonder..?

If you could see my soul
These walls would surely shatter
If you could see my soul
Our differences won't matter
Anymore I'm letting go
Of all the history
that's come between us
Oh if you could see my soul

I'm open, I'm waiting
My hand is reaching out
I'm hoping you'll take it
The moment could be now
don't you wonder..?

If you could see my soul
These walls would surely shatter
If you could see my soul
Our differences won't matter
Anymore I'm letting go
Of all the history
that's come between us
Oh if you could see my soul---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
