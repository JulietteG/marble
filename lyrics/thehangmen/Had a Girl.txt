I had a girl, the heart was broken jaded
I had a car, its rusted, its paint is faded
I had a dream, and it was overrated 
I had a heart, but it was confiscated

But when I met you, that's when luck run out on me 
When I met you, that's when luck run out on me

Look at my arms, they are the ones that hold you
Look at my hands, they are the ones that stole you

Now here she comes, she changes like the weather
Now here she goes, she ride that train forever

But when I met you, that's when luck run out on me 
When I met you, that's when luck run out on me
When I met you, that's when luck run out on me
When I met you, that's when luck run out on me
That's when luck run out on me
That's when luck run out on me---Lyrics submitted by dani b.
