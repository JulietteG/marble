Railroad man, walk the tracks,
where's my girl, want her back.
Railroad song, it's in my head,
lay away in my bed

Railroad love, starry skyes,
miss the light, it's in your eyes.
Railroad doll, lost it's way,
coming home, here to stay.

Well it's hard to understand,
i'm a railroad man.

Railroad man, don't look back.

Blood on the tracks, blood on the hands, i'm a railroad man
Blood on the tracks, blood on the hands, i'm a railroad man
Blood on the tracks, blood on the hands, i'm a railroad man
Blood on the tracks, blood on the hands, i'm a railroad man---Lyrics submitted by dani b.
