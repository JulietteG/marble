"Step in Faith" (LEO Acoustic Live)


I'm taking that next 
next step in faith
I don't need to know 
know what it takes

I don't need to claim
claim that i'll change 
everything, but one thing

Is if I take that next step
you will guide me to the next
All I gotta do is trust you
All I gotta do is trust you

im taking that one, one, one, one step in faith
two, two, two, two could be rescued today
three, three, three, three, is where its gotta be
just you, just you and God and me 

i do believe
believe in us
one step in faith
faith is enough

to hold us up
we can let go
believe that God 
is in control, so

im taking that one, one, one, one step in faith
two, two, two, two could be rescued today
three, three, three, three, is where its gotta be
just you, just you and God and me 

one, one, one, one step in faith
two, two, two, two could be rescued today
three, three, three, three, is where its gotta be
just you, just you and God and me 

it took me a while yeah i know
somehow i let all the fear inside of me grow
but things have changed you got in the way
now all i can see is that im not letting anything 

stop me from you
yeah ill do anything to find my way to you ohhh
yeah, ill do anything to find my way

im taking that one, one, one, one step in faith
two, two, two, two could be rescued today
three, three, three, three, is where its gotta be
just you, just you and God and me 

one, one, one, one step in faith
two, two, two, two could be rescued today
three, three, three, three, is where its gotta be
just you, just you and God and me 

it took me a while yeah i know
somehow i let all the fear inside of me grow
but things have changed you got in the way
now all i can see is that im not letting anything 

stop me---Lyrics submitted by LEO.
