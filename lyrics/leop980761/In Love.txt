"In Love" (LEO Acoustic Live)

I know I'm in love
Cause somehow I know
I won't give up
so you in my life, more than enough
Forever with you
I know I'm in love
so I wanna see you
when you I wake up
So you in my life, more than enough
Forever with you
all I think of

you taking, over over, over
you taking over me, yes you are

you taking, over, over, over
you taking over me, yeah you

you, all my thoughts are all over
you, i keep thinking of a life spent with
you, and me we could be, we could be happy

so imagine a life 
where you I 
you and i could be free
free to love, free to be
free to love, free to dream

so imagine a life 
where you I 
you and i could be free
free to love, free to be
free to love, free to dream

I know I'm in love
Cause somehow I know
I won't give up
so you in my life, more than enough
Forever with you
I know I'm in love
Cause I wanna see you
when you I wake up
So you in my life, more than enough
Forever with you
all I think of

you taking, over, over, over
you taking over me, yes you are

you taking, over, over, over
you taking over me

it could only be your eyes to
keep me mesmerized you
got me paralyzed to
smile everytime i see you 

will you marry me
will you marry me
will you marry me
will you marry me

will you marry me
will you marry me
will you marry me
will you marry me

it could only be your eyes to
keep me mesmerized you
got me paralyzed you
smile everytime i see you 

will you marry me---Lyrics submitted by LEO.
