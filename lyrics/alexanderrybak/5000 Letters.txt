5000 letters I keep in my bedroom
5000 people who open their hearts
Once they were strangers, today we are family
Mountains won't keep us apart

There is a girl who has drawn me a sunrise
That's how she wants every morning to be
A boy lost his tooth and he wants me to have it
How did this happen to me

I want to know all their faces
And I want to be there when they need a friend
5000 letters they wrote me
And some day I'll read them again

5000 stories I keep in my bedroom
5000 secrets I keep in my mind
I have been given a piece of their lifetime
Friendship is easy to find

I want to know all their faces
And I want to be there when they need a friend
5000 letters they wrote me
And some day I'll read them again

I want to know all their faces
And I want to be there when they need a friend
5000 letters they wrote me
And some day I'll read them again---Lyrics submitted by armanazar.
