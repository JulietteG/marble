The time has come for you to fly on your own
You don't have to be afraid
We'll always be here to catch you when you fall
Yes you're all grown up today

(Chorus)
So ready or not time to break out out of your shell into the blue
Spread your wings across the sky
Ready or not time to find out what does the future hold for you
Fly away fly away fly away

The time has come for you to open your eyes
There's a brand new world to see
You've got the power to face it on your own
And fulfill your destiny

Chorus

You gotta spread your wings
Spread your wings
Fly away and cast your fate to the wind, yeah
Remember don't look back
Don't you ever look back
Let the moment carry you

Chorus

Fly away fly away fly away---Lyrics submitted by Mark Keaton.
