Looks like the sun will shine again
for so long, I couldn't find a friend
Cause I've been walking down lonely avenue
it's the road I've had to take to get to you

So many times before
I've let a good thing slip away
but when you walk through the door
I'm doing all in my power to make you stay

Chorus:
So baby wait a minute
stop
hold it right there
Oh oo whoa oo whoa, don't you go nowhere

Now you might think that I'm not the one
and your friends say that I'm just having fun
so let's-a make this clear I'm not playing games
I think I love you and I hope that you feel the same

So many times before
I've let a good thing slip away 
but when you walk through the door
I'm doing all in my power to make you stay

Chorus

So many times before
I've let a good thing slip away
but when you walk through the door
I'm doing all in my power to make you stay

Chorus

I said wait a minute
stop
hold it right there
oh oo whoa oo whoa
don't you go nowhere

I said wait a minute
stop
hold it right there...---Lyrics submitted by Audrey Prisk.
