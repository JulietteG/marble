you only come out late at night
just like an animal in the moonlight
you're wrapped up tight in mystery
you got me so fogged in that I can't even see

my friends say I'm caught up in fairytales and dreams
and I confess with you it feels like make-believe

'cause you're a fantasy
you're just a fantasy, yeah
you're a fantasy, darling, to me

do I really think I see you in the moonligiht?
really wanna hold you cause it feels right
I really wanna see you tonight

last night i swore i heard you call my name
called through my window, took my hand
and stole me away
went to the drive-in
speeding like a runaway train
woke up and smelled your scent in the morning rain

my friends say I'm caught up in fairytales and dreams
and I confess, with you, it feels like make-believe

'cause you're a fantasy
you're just a fantasy, yeah
you're a fantasy, darling, to me

do I really think I see you in the moonlight?
really wanna hold you, 'cause it feels right
I really wanna see you tonight...

woke up this morning
couldn't get you out of my head
and I tried to call you up
but the number was dead
I drove by your place
convinced that you'd still be around
but I saw a wrecking ball a-tear your house down

my friends say I'm caught up in fairytales and dreams
and I confess, with you, it feels like make-believe

'cause you're a fantasy
you're just a fantasy, yeah
you're a fantasy, darling, to me

do I really think I see you in the moonlight?
really wanna hold you, 'cause it feels right
I really wanna see you tonight
really wanna see you tonight
really wanna see you tonight
really wanna see you tonight
really wanna see you tonight
really wanna see you
sleep-tight..---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa.
