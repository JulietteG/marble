I dont want to fight with the evangelists
Well I think that Im already on Gods guest list
Well I smoked like a chimney
and I drank like a fish
If these are my mistakes I think that Gods already pissed

I sin, I sin, I sin,
But Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Well I stole from my friends
And I know it was wrong
I lived every cliche like some shitty country song
And I make my amends and the list was frikkin long
Yes its easy to go on when everything is gone

I sin, I sin, I sin,
But Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Yeah

And Im sorry that it took so long in getting here
I was hypnotized by lust and by pride and funny fear
But God made me crazy so I could learn to care
He said you can choose truth but I choose dare

I sin, I sin, I sin,
But Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Now salvation is a tricky thing
You gotta lose a lot of faith to be saved from within
And I wish what Id done no one knew
But I love my life and Im not done

I sin, I sin, I sin,
But Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Amen, Amen, Amen,
Amen, Amen, Amen---Lyrics submitted by Samani Puhek.
