He drove away, I couldn't move
First bitter taste of what love can do
Sat on that porch alone and cried
It hurt so bad, I could've died

Then Mama came and wrapped her arms around me
Told me God has someone better for me
Dried my tears, and she just held me

That's what angels do
That's what love is for
Points you to a window
When you can't find a door
When you're all out of faith
And it's more than you can take
You're not strong enough
You need someone to pull you through
That's what angels do

Big city streets, bright city lights
Some days the dream's not worth the fight
Miss my hometown, wide open space
A clear blue sky, a slower pace
Then my phone rings and I hear his voice say
"Baby girl I'm proud of you, you're not alone"
He gives me hope, he lifts me up

That's what angels do
That's what love is for
Points you to a window
When you can't find a door
When you're all out of faith
It's more than you can take
You're not strong enough
You need someone to pull you through
That's what angels do

When you're all out of faith
And it's more than you can take
You're not strong enough
You need someone to pull you through
That's what angels do
Yeah, that's what angels do

When there's no way on earth
And you can't make it work
That's what angels do---
