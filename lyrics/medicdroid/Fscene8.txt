Get down girl go ahead now shake it shake it shake it shake it 
Get down girl go ahead now shake it shake it shake it shake it

I'm laughing at this battle, watching boys and girls play games
I watch you as you slowly falter, and how you strive for any status at all!
Well the night is so young, she's got her mini skirt on, hot damn that girls on fire. 
The boy just wants to get off, and she just needed a fix, let's see how far this gets you. 

Get down girl go ahead now shake it shake it shake it shake it 
Get down girl go ahead now shake it shake it shake it shake it

Let's stop and rewind, the scene is so played out with alterior motives desguised, and you facade is so cute, but with nothing to show for girl you need to simmer down
And I've seen enough now and that's right bitches I'm calling you out!

Well the night is so young, she's got her mini skirt on, hot damn that girls on fire.
Led to believe he'll get off, and she takes another hit, let's see how far this gets you. 

Why can't you see, why can't you see, what your doing to yourself. 
Why can't you see, why can't you see. 

She'll dance around this town, fucking young rock boys
Stand here and watch you crumble, stand here and watch you fall. 
You screwed everyone to make it through, but you ever got a clue, baby your just

Now the suns coming up, just as your coming down, got damn that girl's a train wreck
And that fool never got off, the scene bitch did all his drugs, now look how far this got you. 

Why can't you see why can't you see what your doing to yourself 
why can't you see why can't you see.---Lyrics submitted by Ash.
