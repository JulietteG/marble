The lights are out and the dance floors waiting
but you're too busy blending in the croud
The lights are out and the dance floors waiting
but you're too busy folowing the croud

When you come back down, now girl (X2)

When you were a young girl,
did ya wanna be something more, BABY
but now you feel you're so lost
your burning up inside, YEAH

We're clocking in to watch our fate come crashing down (X2)

I can't pretend I'm happy when...
[~And now i know it's pointless~]
I'm constantly on a down, and i'm tired of waiting, waiting

Climb to the top (X2)
[~Now you're falling again~]

The lights are out and the dance floors waiting
but your too busy blending in the croud
The lights are out and the dance floors waiting
but you too busy folowing the croud

When you come back down, now girl (X2)

When i was a young boy,
I wanted to be something more, BABY
But i can't dance, NO,
and I sure as fuck can't sing, YEAH

We're clocking in to watch our fate come crashing down (X2)

Why do we play into this motive?
What are you waiting for tonight?
You wonder, you wait,
and you can't get through this without a line!

Climb to the top (X2)
[~Now you're falling agian~]

Lets break it down (15)

YEAH...
[~lets go~]

I can't pretend i'm happy when...
[~And now i know it's pointless~]
I'm constantly on a down, and i'm tired of waiting, waiting

Climb to the top (X2)
[~Now you're falling again~]

I can't pretend i'm happy when...
[~And now i know it's pointless~]
I'm constantly on a down, and i'm tired of waiting

Climb to the top (X4)
