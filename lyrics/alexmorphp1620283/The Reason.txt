(feat. Natalie Gioia)

It's like sum'in I've never seem before!
Trapped in a place with no floors, doors.
No ceiling, just a bass and a feeling!
Serene, the music's beating!

All the fixed ideas we have!
Release them, material is nothing!
Once you've done so you'll enter this place.
No nothing... No nothing... Where the music's beating...

If you believe that you're meat then you will be eaten!
Reason! I'm just trying to reason.

I believe that we're all connected.
I believe that we're all connected. ---
