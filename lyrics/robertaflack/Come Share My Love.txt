Perhaps the love we feel today, tomorrow may be gone,
Perhaps we'll leave our dreams far behind,
But today is still today and before it all fades away,
While we're together and while there still is time,

Come share my life, come share my love
While we are young and we are free
Come and share my life, come share my love
Come and share the good times with me

I don't ask forever, I don't need much of your time,
Just time enough to love and laugh, for awhile
And if it lasts a lifetime, or only one more night
Whatever's meant to be will be and that'll be alright

Come share my life, come share my love
While we are young and we are free
Come share my life, come share my love
Come and share the good times with me
Come and share my love, come and share my life 
While we are young and we are free
Come share my life, come share my love
Come and share the good times with me
Come and share my love.....fade
Come and share the good times with meeee
Come and share my---Lyrics submitted by Jim Sweeney.
