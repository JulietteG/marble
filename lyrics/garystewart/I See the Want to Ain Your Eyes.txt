I see the sparkling...little diamond on your hand
Its plain to see that you've already...got a man
And I can tell you're not about to fall...for any of my lies

I see the want to in your eyes

Deep in your smile...there's a quiet soft desire
Like the embers...of a once raging fire
And you know I could light that fire again
But you know its not wise

I see the want to in your eyes

How strong is a band of gold?
Is it strong enough to hold?
When a love is growing cold
When a woman...wants a love that's warm

How many women just like you have silent scenes?
How many men like me do they sleep with in their dreams?

You can stay or you can go...but I can sympathize

I see the want to in your eyes

I see the want to in your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Victoria.
