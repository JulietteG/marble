An empty glass 
And a last cigarette
Closing time 
And I'm drunk again 
But somehow I'll make it home 
And cry myself to sleep 
And that's the way the day ends every night for me 

Every night I'm in some bar, 
Pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire 
Forgetting you is no easy thing 
Each night for me always ends the same 

With an empty glass 
An' a last cigarette 
Closing time 
And I'm drunk again 
But somehow I'll make it home 
And cry myself to sleep 
And that's the way the day ends every night for me 

Every night I'm in some bar 
I'm pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire 
Forgetting you is no easy thing 
Each night for me always ends the same 

With an empty glass 
A last cigarette 
It's closing time
I'm drunk again 
But somehow I'll make it home 
And cry myself to sleep 
And that's the way the day ends every night for me 
And that's the way the day ends every night for me---Lyrics submitted by Richard.
