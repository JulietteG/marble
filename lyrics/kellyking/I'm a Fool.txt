Baby...
I'm a fool
Since I left you, 
Baby I'm a fool, 
since I left you
Since I left you baby
I'm a fool
I went down, all over town
Looked for some more 
and I was after 
Runnin' around
Bringing me down
Can someone else disaster
The guys move green,
but now I see baby I'm a fool
Since you been gone
it's been so long
seems like forever 
baby come on don't you know 
we were so good together
Turn me away
Cause I ain't too proud to say baby
Baby I'm a fool
Baby I'm a fool
Since I left you
Oh I'm a fool
Since I left you
Since I left you baby
I'm a fool
Say it once
(music/instrumental)
Since you been gone 
it's been so long
seems like forever 
Baby come on, 
Don't you know 
we were so good
Come turn me away
Oh Cause I ain't too proud to say
Baby I'm a fool
Baby I'm a fool 
Since I left you
Baby I'm a fool
Since I left you 
Since I left you baby
I'm a fool
...
I'm in bed
Baby it's set
and you can't see what you got on
Carry it on
No way you're wrong
( I don't know this part) :( 
I'm in black and I don't mind, 
baby I'm a fool
I'm a fool
Since I left you 
Baby I'm a fool 
Since I left you 
since I left you baby
yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm a fool 
Since I left you
Baby I'm a fool 
Since I left you
Since I left you baby
I'm a fool
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
I left you 
I left you---Lyrics submitted by Eleni Stamenou.
