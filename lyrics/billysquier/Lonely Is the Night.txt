Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when theres no one left to call
You feel the time is right--(say) the writins on the wall

Its a high time to fight when the walls are closin in
Call it what you like--its time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely--your spirits sinkin down
You find youre not the only stranger in this town

Red lights, green lights, stop n go jive
Headlines, deadlines jammin your mind
You been stealin shots from the side
Let your feelins go for a ride

Theres danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite...the boys are set to howl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight--do you wanna take it all

Slowdown, showdown--waitin on line
Showtime, no time for changin your mind
Streets are ringin, march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down

Somebodys watchin you baby--so much you can do
Nobodys stoppin you baby, from makin it too
One glimpsell show you now baby, what the music can do
One kissll show you now baby--it can happen to you

No more sleepin, wastin our time
Midnight creepins first on our minds
No more lazin round the tv
Youll go crazy--come out with me---Lyrics submitted by Jackie.
