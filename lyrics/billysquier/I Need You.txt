I rise at the break of day--your smile sets me on my way
I need you
See the light shinin' in your eyes--see the hopes that I realize
For you
I am alone...my odds are long...s'all I can do...
I need you...

Take the road where the eagle flies--man follows where his fortune lies
I leave you
Shadows fall and the day is done--the curtain calls but more than anyone
I need you
When I feel low...my amps they blow...when I feel blue
I need you...

And I forget all my sorrow, I forget all my pain
I relinquish my doubts at the sound of your name
I can feel your desire when I walk through that door
I believe in the power that can even the score

Never knew it could take so long--never knew it could feel so wrong without you
They say a woman knows the reasons why--no man ain't supposed to cry
I need you
When after all...my tears they fall...when I pull through...
I need you...---Lyrics submitted by kate drake.
