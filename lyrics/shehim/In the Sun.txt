It's hard to be ignored
When I look at you
You look so bored
My baby, my darling
I've been taking a beating

Well all right
(Well all right)
It's ok
(It's ok)
We all get the slip sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun

It's hard to take the blame
When I look at you, you're so ashamed
My baby, my darling
I've been thinking of leaving

Well all right
(Well all right)
It's ok
(It's ok)
We all get the slip sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun

Well all right
(Well all right)
It's ok
(It's ok)
We all feel ashamed sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun---Lyrics submitted by Denis.
