Take it back oh
Take it back
I want you're loving
Anymore.

Let me live,
Oh let me live
It's no you who I sing for.
So don't sit next to me,
Sit by yourself.

I don't wanna wonder, whether you love me.
I don't wanna wonder, whether you care.
So don't try to woo me,
Don't try to fool me.
Oh I know all of your tricks.
It's a possibility of staying in my corner.

I don't wanna to wonder, whether you love me.
I don't wanna to wonder, whether you care.
So don't try to woo me, 
Don't try to fool me.
Oh I know all of your tricks.
It's a possibility of staying in my corner.---Lyrics submitted by veronica.
