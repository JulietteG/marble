We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

I can't forget the glamor
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

I can't recall in my imagination
A situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And at the center just you and me, dear

My heart beat like a hammer
Yours wound around me tight
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

We lived our drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Your stars fell on Alabama
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night---
