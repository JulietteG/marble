i thought i saw your face today 
but i just turned my head away
your face against the trees
but i just see the memories as they come, as they come

(bridge)
and i couldn't help but fall in love again 
no i couldn't help bu fall in love again

i saw it glitter as i grew 
and loved a boy i never knew
i thought this place was heaven sent
but now its just a monument in my mind, in my mind

(repeat bridge)

(chorus)
and the cars and freeways implore me to stay way out of this place
my mother said just keep your head and play as it plays
(whistles)

(repeat chorus)

i somehow see whats beautiful in things that are a famoral
i'm my only friend of mine and love is just a piece of time in the world, in the world

(repeat bridge)---Lyrics submitted by whitney.
