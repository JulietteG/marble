Stay awhile, let me hold you
Stay awhile, till I've told you, oh
Of the love that I feel tonight, oh yeah

Stay awhile, what's your hurry?
Stay awhile, 'cause I worry, oh
Any time that you're out of sight

I hate to see you go
Tell you what I'll do
I'll be good to you
I'll make you glad that you are mine
So come on, baby

Treat me right, must you run now?
For the night's just begun now, oh
Honey please, won't you stay awhile with me?

I hate to see you go
Tell you what I'll do
I'll be good to you
I'll make you glad that you are mine
So come on, baby

Treat me right, must you run now?
For the night's just begun now, oh
Honey please, won't you stay awhile with me?

so honey please, won't you stay awhile with me?, oh yeah
Honey please, won't you stay awhile with me?, oh yeah---
