Goodbye
I don't wanna
Feel the need
To hear your voice

Goodbye
I don't wanna
Feel the need
To see your face

I can't live with
All these things I would say
I can't live with
All these things that I say

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

You never really knew me
Never ever, never ever saw me
Saw me like they did

You never really loved me
Never really, never really loved me
Loved me like they did

With some time
I might wanna
See the way
That you changed

With some time
I might wanna
See how you've been
What you cannot blame

I can't stand it
All these things I forego
I can't stand it
All these things I've let got

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

You never really knew me
Never ever, never ever saw me
Saw me like they did

You never really loved me
Never really, never really loved me
Loved me like they did

You coulda told me
Goodbye
You coulda told me
Goodbye

You let me try
Knowing there was nothing I could do
To change you

You coulda warned me
Knowing there was nothing I could do
To change you

You never really knew me
Never ever, never ever saw me
Saw me like they did

You never really loved me
Never really, never really loved me
Loved me like they did

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

You never really knew me
Never ever, never ever saw me
Saw me like they did

You never really loved me
Never really, never really loved me
Loved me like they did---
