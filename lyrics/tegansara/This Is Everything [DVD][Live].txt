Climbed up on the rainbow
Just to see if I'd fall off
I'm a frosted lemon coward 
And I don't know how
No don't know to hold you 
Without shaking
No I'm not aware of how 
I could possibly love you 
Without aching
Yes I give you everything
Yes I give you anything
I gave you everything
Gotta watch myself
I've gotta love myself
And take care
And so keep the light on before 
Ya hop into bed
Cos, baby, this is the last
Honest look I'll ever give
I saved up all my sunshine 
Just to see you more clear
I'm a little short on solar 
But I haven't given in
No I'm going to hold you anyway 
And I'll do it without shaking
Yes I'll love you always 
And I'll do it without aching
Yes I'd give you anything
Yes I'd give you anything
I gave you everything
Gotta watch myself 
I've gotta love myself 
And take care
And so keep the light on before 
Ya hop into bed
Cos, baby, this is the last 
Honest look I'll ever give
I give you everything
I give you anything
I gave you everything
Gotta watch my self
I've gotta love myself
And take care
Yeah
Gave you
I gave you
I gave you everything
So I've gotta watch myself 
And love myself 
And take care
This is your last look
This is your last look
This is your last look
Yeah this is your last look
This is your last look
This is your last look
And so keep the light on before 
Ya hop into bed
Cos, baby, this is the last 
Honest look I'll ever give---Lyrics submitted by holly.
