Your crow bar swung through the, the restaraunt
more like a pub, yeah we drank alot
don't get over your head

I just want to be bad
oh, oh alright
I just want to be bad
oh, oh, alright

Your so tragedy and you were hard on me
Your so tragedy and you were hard on me

You might be dead, but it's hard to know
The night turns in, but your all go go
Don't get in over your head

I just want to be bad
oh, oh alright
I just want to be bad
oh, oh, alright

Your so tragedy and you were hard on me
Your so tragedy and you were hard on me

The morning came and  were in this together
The morning came and were in this together

I don't care how far we go
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

I just want to be bad
oh, oh alright
I just want to be bad
oh, oh alright

Your so tragedy and you were hard on me
Your so tragedy and you were hard on me---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
