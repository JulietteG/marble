You wait up to phone me as i wake up for you
Would you like some company or are you sick of me?
When your love lets you go you only want love more
even when love's not what you were lookin for
speak slow tell me low
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go?

You break down on thedral case
I don't know what to say
I leave my heart all this pain
and now i'm at it all again
on the streets, instead i leave
from weeks down and weeks of blame
when you want love 
does it matter what you're lookin for?

speak slow tell me low 
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go? ah ah
speak slow tell me low
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go?
(speak slow)

I'm so far away and i just can't see you
I'm so far along and i just don't need you
I'm so ah ah i don't
I'm so ah ah i don't
I'm so ah ah i don't
I'm so ah ah i don't
I'm so far away and i just can't see you 
I'm so far along and i just don't need you
I'm so ah ah i don't 
I'm so ah ah i don't 
I'm so ah ah i don't
I'm so ah ah i don't

When you're love lets you go 
you only want love more
even when love's not what you were lookin for
When you're love lets you go
you only want love more
even when love's not what you were lookin for
speak slow tell me low 
where do we go? ah ah
where do we go? ah ah 
where do we go? ah ah
speak slow tell me low
where do we go? ah ah 
where do we go? ah ah 
where do we go?
