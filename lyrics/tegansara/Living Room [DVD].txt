My windows look into your living room
well I'd spend the afternoon on top of you
I wonder what it is, that i did to make you move
in accross the way from me
I hope I never figure out who broke your heart
and if I do, If I dooo

I'd spend all night, losing sleep (chorus)
I'd sleep the night and id lose my mind
If I spent the night then id lose my mind

My windows look into your bathroom
and I'd spend the evening, watching, you get yourself clean
and I wonder why it is, that they left this bathroom so unclean
so unlike me! 
I hope I never figure out who broke your heart
and if I do, If I dooo

(chorus)
Instrumental break

I hope I never figure out who broke your heart
baby if i doo
I hope I never figure out who broke your heart
baby if I do
Well Id spend all night, losing sleep
I'd spend the night and I'd lose my mind..
If I spend the night then Id lose my mind!

(chorus) X2---Lyrics submitted by Banarama.
