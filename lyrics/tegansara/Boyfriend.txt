Tell you that I love you, that I can't hold back
The feeling that you give me, wanna give it right back
I know you always win at this particular game
I need to know the rules if you want me to play

You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a... like a very best friend
You kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up like you want your best friend
You turn me on like you want your boyfriend
But I don't want to be your secret anymore

I'm trying to be honest cause I can't relax
Oh, when I get around you I can't hide the facts
I let you take advantage cause it felt so good
I blame myself for thinking we both understood

You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a... like a very best friend
You kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up like you want your best friend
You turn me on like you want your boyfriend
But I don't want to be your secret anymore

Don't wanna, don't wanna play the crying game
Do you feel the same? You feel the same
Don't wanna, don't wanna spin the bottle again
Do you feel the same? You feel the same

You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a... like a very best friend
You kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up like you want your best friend
You turn me on like you want your boyfriend
But I don't want to be your secret anymore

You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a... like a very best friend
You kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up like you want your best friend
You turn me on like you want your boyfriend
But I don't want to be your secret anymore---
