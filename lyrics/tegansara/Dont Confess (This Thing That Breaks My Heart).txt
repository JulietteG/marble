Don't think I'll Confess,
Why Would I confess,
That I, 
Don't think I'll deny,
Why would I deny,
That I, 
Don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse,
Yeah You,
Send a little smile my way,
Don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse,
Yeah you,
Send a little love my way
Every second I spend waiting,
Drags me closer to this grave
I'm not alone
I'm just on my own,
It's a little cold outside
Don't think I'll escape,
Why would I escape you,
Don't think I'll replace,
How could I replace you,
And so,
Don't be so hard on yourself,
You won't get better till you're worse
And so,
Don't be so hard on yourself
You won't be better till your worse
So, send your love my way.---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
