I felt you in my legs,
before I ever met you.
And when I laid beside you for the first time,
I told you,
I feel you in my heart.
And I don't even know you.

And now we're saying bye,
Bye, Bye.
And now we're saying bye,
Bye, Bye.

I was nineteen,
(calling)

I felt you in my life before I ever thought to,
I feel the need to lay down beside you,
And tell you

I feel you in my heart,
And I don't even know you.

And now we're saying bye,
Bye, Bye.
And now we're saying bye,
Bye, Bye.

I was nineteen
(call me)
I was nineteen
(call me)

I flew home,
Back to where we met,
I stayed inside,
I was so upset,

I cooked up a plan,
So good except,
I was all alone,
You were all I had.

Love you.
You were all mine.
Love me.
I was yours right.
I was yours right.

I was nineteen
(call me)
I was nineteen
(call me)---Lyrics submitted by Jessi.
