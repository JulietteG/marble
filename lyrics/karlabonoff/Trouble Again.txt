Well I wake up in the night now
And don't you know I think of you
It's that fire in your eyes
It keeps on cutting through
There's nowhere I can run to
Can't seem to lose the thought of you
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again

Well I used to walk a straight line
I knew what I was doing all the time
There was nothing that could move me
I always held my ground
But you got me where you want me
And now you're always here to haunt me
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again

I still remember how it felt when you put
your arms around me
But if I thought that you would love me
I was blind

Well you'd think I would have learned by now
And I'd keep away from you somehow
Just like a little child
I keep coming back for more
But baby when you call today
Don't you know that I'll come out and play
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
Never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
Never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
