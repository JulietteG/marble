I can see,
Every time I look into your eyes,
You don't care a thing about those other guys.
Without words,
You made me understand whats on your mind,
The rhythym of your body close to mine.

I can tell by the way you dance,
That your gonna love me tonight

Sometimes its cold,
Sometimes its hot!
Loves either right or it's wrong.
Feels so good,
Love you a lot!
Right here beside me is where you belong.
I don't care,
If everybody knows the way I feel,
Until, the dream of holding you is real.

I can tell by the way you dance,
That your gonna love me tonight.

Sometimes its cold,
Sometimes its hot!
Loves either right or it's wrong.
Feels so good,
Love you a lot!
Right here beside me is where you belong.
I don't care,
If everybody knows the way I feel,
Until, the dream of holding you is real.

I can tell by the way you dance,
That your gonna love me tonight.

I can tell by the way you dance,
That your gonna love me tonight.

Mmmmm, I can tell by the way you dance,
That your gonna love me tonight.---Lyrics submitted by PATRICE GRUNDHA.
