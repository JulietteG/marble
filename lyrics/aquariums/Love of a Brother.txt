Well, I love my brother, and he cares for me
He prays for my soul right before he sleeps
I haven't been to church in years and I never pray
I got to get right with God and settle up today
Just talk and open your heart you'll know what to say
"Dear God I beg for forgiveness." 'Cause I've lost my way

Well, I love my brother and he cares for me
He prays for my soul right before he sleeps.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
