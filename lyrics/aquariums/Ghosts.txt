The voices resonate from below
With word of ideas and concepts I'll never know
Conversations on world affairs
Emanate from under my stairs

There's jelly on my counter
And spoons on my floor,
A box in the attic
With no locks on my door

Look in my window and
Peer through the shades
There's not much in here
And hasn't been for days,
Just the box in my attic
And spoons on my floor
Come on in there's no locks on my doors.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
