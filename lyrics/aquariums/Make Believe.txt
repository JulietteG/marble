You are not alone
In this land of make believe
You wail and you moan
And weep tears of disbelief

We paint the landscapes of a brighter tomorrow
The end is coming no time left to borrow
The leaves change and we must leave this place
Before the shadow of death falls upon your face
I knew a man with wisdom in his mind and rotten life on his breath
He said, "You will soon meet death."---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
