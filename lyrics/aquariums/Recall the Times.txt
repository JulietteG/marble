Come on in and have a seat
Sit back and listen you're in for a treat
As your mind wanders to some other plane

We're born then we die
In between multiply
Till we suck all the energy,
Suck all the life
In this world and recall the times
In our minds
And say, "it'll get better."---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
