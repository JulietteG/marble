Something is eating a hole in side of me and I can feel it
I've tried many things but none of them seem to fill it
The bottom doesn't get deeper
The surface just grows higher and higher again

I haven't spent enough time lately just thinking
Wish I could shut up sometimes and quit drinking
I find it hard to do what I should
I wouldn't save myself if I could

The rain it burns my eyes
It won't let up or part from my skies
Some things are larger than my understanding
My legs feel uneasy on this landing
I climb higher to see for miles
The view is hazy, distorts my smile

Something is eating a hole inside of me and I can feel it
I've tried many things but none of them seem to fill it
How much longer must I cry out there before I get an answer?---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
