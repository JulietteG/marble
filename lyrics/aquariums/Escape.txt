Their eyes they glisten
To the pulsating waves they listen,
Shrouded by linen in the dark
"Be quiet. Don't make a sound."
Don't want to arouse suspicion in this town
Soon you'll come to know
The look of a friend from the gaze of a foe
Soon you'll come to know

The mast is broken; the hull has sprung a leak
Floating dead water until we sink
Step out carelessly
Falling like lemmings into the sea

It won't be easy; no one must know
Leave across frozen water hidden by snow
Cover our tracks, but threats arise
Must leave in search of friendly skies

On a merchant's vessel far out at sea,
Radio for transport recklessly
"Identify yourselves."
Let us just hope that all is well.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
