To see you weep it breaks my heart,
As I lie next to you blanketed by the dark
When you wake in my arms
You feel a comfort that nothing can harm

Feel it beat from in your chest
Closing in feeling compressed
Everyone is so well dressed
Lovely mother she knows best

"Lay your hands upon my breast."
It beats twice no more, no less
"I'm here for you don't second guess."

And I can't begin to
Pretend to comprehend you
And how you must feel
I'll be right here
Ever near
Never further than an arms reach

'Cause at times like these I know you need me
And I will seek to keep you from being weak
The future's not nearly as bleak as you might think
She knows she has your love
And I'm sure when the time comes
She'll be looking down from above
In sweet admiration and adoration of her little girl

Lovely mother I know you are leaving
Don't go away before I get the chance to say goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
