Wake up mama you're sleeping
The circles form under your eyes
The clouds they form in the heavens
The darkness shuts out the light

The time has come to say goodbye
We all must leave here tonight
Don't be frightened no reason to pack
The things you have are no use to you now
For when you die who will remember
If we all go your history is lost

'Cause I know you will try to follow me there
With two handfuls of earth clenched in your palms
'Cause you want to hold on to the things you can't keep
Just leave it all behind and come with me.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
