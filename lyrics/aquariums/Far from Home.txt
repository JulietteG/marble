"When I was a young girl I had a nightmare."
Lost in the forest "I'd never been there."

Have we ever ventured this far before?
I've never been more than three steps from my door
Those earthly hands reach up with their claws
To pull me down into their jaws
And bite at my legs and tear up my flesh
I cry out to above

Lay your hand in mine, I'll lead the way
No time wander. No time to stray
Lay my hand in yours, you lead the way
No time to wander. No time to stray

We must hurry to make it out alive,
I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to die
Our feet leave the ground, we start to take flight
The sun's going down, it signals the night
"No don't close your eyes." Just fight off the rest
I promise that we'll make it out of this

Far from home.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
