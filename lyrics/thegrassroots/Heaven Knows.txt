With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven, Heaven knows

Every time we're together
Your love is movin' like lightnin' through me
It's such a beautiful feelin'
Never hearing good-bye said to me

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven, Heaven knows

I was living without you, tryin' to make it alone
But there is something about you, now your heart is my home
I got a song in my heart and a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure, oh, I couldn't feel any better

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven, Heaven knows

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven, Heaven knows

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven, Heaven knows

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven, Heaven knows---Lyrics submitted by Daniel Fredyma.
