Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC.
Didn't get to bed last night.
On the way the paper bag was on my knee.
Man I had a dreadful flight.

I'm back in the USSR.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the USSR.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place.
Gee it's good to be back home.
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case.
Honey disconnect the phone.

I'm back in the USSR.
You don't know how lucky you are boy

Back in the US, back in the US,
Back in the USSR.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out.
They leave the West behind.
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout.
That Georgia's always on my mind.

I'm back in the USSR.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the USSR.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out.
They leave the West behind.
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout.
That Georgia's always on my mind.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains
Way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm.
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out.
Come and keep your comrade warm.

I'm back in the USSR.
You don't know how lucky you are boy,
Back in the USSR---
