Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay? 
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way? 

I ain't tryna do what everybody else doing 
Just cause everybody doing what they all do 
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow 
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home 

So am I wrong 
For thinking that we could be something for real? 
Now am I wrong 
For trying to reach the things that I can't see? 

But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel 
That's just how I feel 
Trying to reach the things that I can't see 

Am I tripping for having a vision? 
My prediction: I'mma be on the top of the world 

Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide 
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel 
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no 
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel 

Am I wrong (am I wrong) 
For thinking that we could be something for real? 
(oh yeah yeah yeah oh) 
Now am I wrong (am I wrong) 
For trying to reach the things that I can't see? 
(oh yeah yeah yeah yeah) 

But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel 
That's just how I feel 
Trying to reach the things that I can't see 

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong 
I don't wanna be right, right 
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong 
I don't wanna be right 

Am I wrong 
For thinking that we could be something for real? 
Now am I wrong 
For trying to reach the things that I can't see? 

But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel 
That's just how I feel 
Trying to reach the things that I can't see 

So am I wrong (am I wrong) 
For thinking that we could be something for real? 
(oh yeah yeah yeah oh) 
Now am I wrong (am I wrong) 
For trying to reach the things that I can't see? 
(oh yeah yeah yeah yeah) 

But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel 
That's just how I feel 
Trying to reach the things that I can't see---
