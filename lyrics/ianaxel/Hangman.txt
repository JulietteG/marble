you and i together
this is not the way it's gonna be. 
please accept my honesty 
you are not my cup of tea. 
heres a thought it's over. 
no its not a temporary thing. 
blame this on your family. 
it's alll for you your majesty.

[Chorus]
your taking all your friends for granted
they aint gonna help you anymore
your never let it out until the money
my money aint gonna help you anymore


you will be forgotten
easier than permenant ink
even in the apple tree
you love that all it is

[Chorus]
your taking all your friends for granted
they aint gonna help you anymore
your never let it out until the money
my money aint gonna help you anymore

no

so many people put their feet on the wall and yell hangman[2x]
so many people put their feet on the wall...[2x]
so many people put their feet on the wall and yell hangman


[Chorus]
your taking all your friends for granted
they aint gonna help you anymore
your never let it out until the money
my money aint gonna help you anymore[2x]


you will be forgotten.
