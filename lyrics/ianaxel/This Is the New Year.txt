Another year you made a promise
 another chance to turn it all around 
and do not say this for tomorrow embrace the past and you can live for now 
and I will give the world to you

Speak louder than the words before you 
and give the meaning no one else has found
the role we play it is so important 
we are the voices of the underground
and I will give the world to you

say everything you always wanted 
be  not afraid of who you really are 
cause in the end we have each other and that is one thing worth living for
and I will give the world to you

A million suns that shine upon me
A million eyes you are the blue 
lets stare down the walls that divide us
and build a statue strong enough for two
it all gets back to you I will be for you cause I will give the world to you

this is a new year
a new begining  
we made a promise
you are the brightest
we are the voices
this is the new year
we are the voices 
this is the new year---Lyrics submitted by liv.
