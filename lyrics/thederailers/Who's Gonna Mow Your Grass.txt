Who's gonna dry
Your big blue eyes 
Day after day
Who's gonna jump 
When you say frog
Who's gonna bow and scrape
After I'm gone away

Who's gonna kiss ya
And who's gonna miss ya
And who's gonna hold your hand
And who's gonna chop 
Your kindle and wood
After I've made new plans
Hey, who's gonna be your man

Who's gonna bring you 
Your breakfast in bed
And who's gonna whisper goodnight
Who's gonna keep you warm as toast
On those cold winter nights

And who's gonna be 
Your puppy dog
When I'm a thing of the past
Hey, who's gonna mow your grass

Who's gonna bring you 
Your breakfast in bed
Who's gonna whisper goodnight
Who's gonna keep you as warm as toast
On those cold winter nights

And who's gonna be 
Your puppy dog
When I'm a thing of the past
Hey, who's gonna mow your grass
Who's gonna mow your grass---Lyrics submitted by Cathy Preston.
