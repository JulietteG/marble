Take it easy, take it slow, oh
Get on with the show, ah
That's what I know
I woke in a cold sweat last night
Seems what's been good for the music
Hasn't always been so good for the life

I've thrown my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life again
Y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks, oh yeah

I can't tell what you're sayin'
When you yell
At the same time
You could be tellin' me the story of your life
Your life
Is my malfunction so surprising
'Cause I always seem so stable and bright?
Ain't it always the quiet types?

I've thrown my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life again
Y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks,
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't blame New Orleans

Can't you people function for a little while
Without me bouncin' off the satellite for a night?

Drink it faster, drink it slow
That's what I know
When you've gotten to the bottom of it, it's time to go
And when you flip 200 feet, feel free to proffer your advice
But until that time, here's my autoreply:

I've thrown my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life again
Y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks

That's what I know
That's what I know---
