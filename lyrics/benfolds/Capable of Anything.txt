What is this?
It doesnt make much sense
They sing it like a pop song
Youre capable of anything!
And Im sure they meant you could be president
Or you could just forgive me

But I stopped caring what you think about me
I gave up
Were told we are capable of anything
But you dont seem to think that you are
Capable of anything

Swung and missed
I put my heart in this mythical holy good guy
I want so bad to be
I was weak and wrong
And when I owned it all
It only made you righteous
Now you get to blame your life on me

So I stopped caring what you think about me
I gave up
Were told we are capable of anything
But you dont seem to think that you are
Capable of anything

You are capable of anything
But you dont seem to think
That you could fly so low or sink so high
That you could ever love again or even try
That you could steal or cheat or kill or lie
But you might---
