It's just a thought
But where did it come from?
What would she do with it if it comes back?

A note from his assistant
There by the telephone
She sees it again as she turns off the light

Kylie is calling from Connecticut
She says you got the number
It says Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's there
On her mind
As she closes her eyes

She beileves
There are things you shouldn't know about
When you've been married for thirty-five years
And her heart belongs
To a man that she hadn't seen since
A magical night when the children where small

Kylie is calling from Connecticut
She says you got the number
It says Kylie is calling from Connecticut
it's there 
On her mind
As she closes her eyes

Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's probably nothing
Yeah, nothing at all
But Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's there on her mind
As she's reading old letters
That she hid in the closet
With the pictures she charished
And kept to herself
For a good thirty years

Now she closes her eyes...---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
