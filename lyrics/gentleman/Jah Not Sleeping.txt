Whats happening?!
Enough is enough now we cant take no more
Violation on a human life we got to close that door
Blood a run more than before
But the wrath of jah ago beat that for sure

Sometimes I wonder, do you think about the lives youre  takin away
When youre lying in your bed
(And now you toss and you turn)
 And when the faces of your victims all those coming back to you 
(what you ago do then)
do you cover up your head
(me cant believe so you nah learn)
How does it feel to know theyre gone and now their blood is on your hands
Now youre on the way to hell
(you are await to your judgement)
What goes around must come around, and just reminding you my friend
That your judgement will be more than sunken tail

For every life you take,
For every heart you break,
every soul you shake,
My xxx
You never get away,
Soon it will be your day
There is a price to pay,
I know that jah not sleeping

How can you make a living outta killing people
Youre bussing up your gun and take away good people
Never ever thought of about the  innocent people
And threw your dutty heart to evil
How many more will have to suffer from your senseless behaviour
Causing vehement of fair among we neighbour 
Invitation to frustration, 
and you dont have a clue what youre doing to the nation

so I am tired of dem war
tired fi see people get murdered pon the tar
tired to see desperation, the city is full of gun
we never thought it could reach so far
none  justify dem doing, what dem doing so bizarre
no love ina dem heart but we know who they are
long time dem big heads upon politics xxx
so much bloodshed but I am writing this bar

life has got a meaning, for every life there is a reason
we got a purpose here on earth, dont take it away---Lyrics submitted by AM.
