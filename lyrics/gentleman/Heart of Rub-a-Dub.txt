Verse1:
It doesn t get any harder than this
Rub-a-dub sound from the hardcore genesis
We play it slow and we playin it fast
Shelly wants to leave but she just can t go
She member the waterpumpee she know the della move
She say she nuh go leave until she get her stella groove
She do it cool and deadly inna her dancing shoes
Tonight she is a winner cannot lose

Chorus:
So here we go
This a the heart of a rub-a-dub sound
Straight from kingston the streets of jamdown
Here we go
This a the heart of the ragga ragga sound
Turn it up nuh go turn it down low
Here we go
This a the heart of the rub-a-dub sound
Straight from kingston the streets of jamdown
This a the heart of the rude boy sound
Turn it up nuh go turn it down low

Verse2:
Dem say call the police
Want put reggae music pon pause
Wanna put new clause inna laws
Beat man make dem mash up and a rub up inna gauze
No if not but because
Soundman hafi go stick to the task
Good music have to broadcast
Standing ovation round of applause
Dem say call the police
And nuff babylon just appear
From sky and road everywhere
Inna the vibe dem want interfere
But none a we have no fear
Just drink two guiness and beer
Me and me squaddy dem come from here
Selector go hard or lock off

Verse3:
That s what we live that s what we give that s how we feel
Like birds of a feather like magnet to steel
Big box steel horn with the sublow
Turn it up til it buck make the whole world know
This is the party maker budungkadung go shake the shaker
Broader than broadways the sounds of jamaica
Now feel the chemistry whole leap of energy
Put it in the big box and turn up the speaker---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
