VERSE 1 
I'm working 9 to 5 
It's like I'm buried alive 
My boss is always on my case and I hate him 

He's got a Mercedes Benz, 
With really lame ass rims 
And I'm stuck at the bus stop waiting! 

His girlfriend is 18, and my girl dumped me 
She said 'You can't afford me' and went for the money, the money, money, money, 

CHORUS: 
I wish I was a Rock Star, (Oh Oh) 
Breaking all the girls hearts (Oh Oh) 
If I was Eddie Vedder (Oh Oh) 
I bet you'd like me better (Oh Oh) 
Doing shots of Petrone, 
With P!nk and Emma Stone 
And the paparazzi stalk us when they carry me home 
I wish I'd learnt to play the damn guitar 

I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle) 
I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle) 

VERSE 2 
When I got home from work, it went from bad to worse, 
My roomie sold my x-box for a six pack 
I wanna kick his ass and get all my cash back, 
But he's six foot four and a douchebag 
So I'm heading to LA, with the guitar I can't play, 
Hoping to someday make a lot of money, money, money, money. 

CHORUS: 
I wish I was a Rock Star, (Oh Oh) 
Breaking all the girls hearts (Oh Oh) 
If I was Eddie Vedder (Oh Oh) 
I bet you'd like me better (Oh Oh) 
Doing shots of Patron, 
With P! nk and Emma Stone 
And the paparazzi stalk us when they carry me home 
I wish I'd learnt to play the damn guitar 

I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle) 
I wish I was a Rock Star (whistle) 

I learnt a couple of chords and kept the verses short, 
It was sad but now it's kinda funny, 
I wrote a catchy song that went to number 1, 
About a girl that left me for the money. 

CHORUS: 
Now I am a Rock Star, (Oh Oh) 
Breaking all the girls hearts (Oh Oh) 
Hanging out with Vedder (Oh Oh) 
I bet you like me better (Oh Oh) 
Doing shots of Patron, 
With P! nk and Emma Stone 
I bet that you wish that you could carry me home 

Thank God I learnt to play the damn guitar 
And I thank you for the way you broke my heart 

Cos now I am a Rock Star 
I am a Rock star 
I'm a Rock Star!---Lyrics submitted by ben burnley.
