Deeper
Falling deeper
Can't be rescued from your eyes
Restless
So damn restless
I won't let you off my mind
Timeless
You stand before me
Holding heaven in your hands

I, I'm not afraid
I can't explain
The way I'm feeling now
You, you fell from grace
Without a trace
My heart stopped bleeding on

Patience
Losing patience
I just want you by my side
Trust me
Why won't you trust me
Just take my hand tonight
Beautiful
You're so beautiful
You don't even realize

I, I'm not afraid
I can't explain
The way I'm feeling now
You, you fell from grace
Without a trace
My heart stopped bleeding on

I remember the day
When I first saw your face
The way you smile and just walked away

Yeah I remember the day
When I first saw your face
The way you smile and just walked away

Timeless
You stand before me
Holding heaven in your hands
Ohh

I, I'm not afraid
I can't explain
The way I'm feeling now
You, you fell from grace
Without a trace
My heart stopped bleeding on

I remember the day
When I first saw your face
The way you smile and just walked away

Yeah I remember the day
When I first saw your face
The way you smile and just walked away ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
