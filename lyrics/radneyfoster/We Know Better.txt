Elsa: Hello little baby, youre princess just like me
Bet youre thinking maybe its a pretty cool thing to be
But soon youll see that everyone expects a lot from you
Theyll say that there are things a princess should and shouldn't do
But you and me, we, we know better

Elsa and Anna:1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
You and me together, knees together, freeze together
Up or down together, princess crown together
Always be together, you and me

1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
You and me together, knees together, freeze together
Up or down together, princess crown together
Always be together, you and me

Elsa: They say a princess is full of charm and grace
They say she always knows her place
They say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes
They say she never laughs and snorts milk out her nose
They say shes calm, they say shes kind
They say she never speaks her mind or freezes nannys big behind

Both: But you and me, we, we know better

Nanny: You girls are in so much trouble, when I'm gonna tell your father!
Anna: How come you can do that and I cant?
Elsa: I dont know, I wish you could though...

Elsa: They say a princess is super duper sweet

Anna: She doesn't fight; she doesn't sweat

Both: And you never see her eat

Anna: They say a princess doesn't climb and scrape her knee

Elsa: They say a princess wouldn't freeze her tutors tea

Anna: They say shes poised

Elsa: They say shes fair

Both: She never mentions underwear!

Anna: Or longs to see the world out there

Both: But you and me, we, have big ideas of our own
For the distant someday when were grown

Elsa: When Im queen

Anna: And Im your right hand

Elsa: Youll get to travel

Both: Throughout the land

Anna: Ill tell them of my sister and the magic things she can do

Elsa: Well take care of our people and they will love

Both: Me and you
No one can tell us what a princess should be
As long as were together, you and me---Lyrics submitted by kyrene nicole.
