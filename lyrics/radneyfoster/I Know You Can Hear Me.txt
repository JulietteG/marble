I don't remember what it was
But like every kid I screwed up
Probably gave some lip,probably threw a fit
Pushed him 'till he'd had enough
I ran into the closet, figured i was hiding from a whippin'
But standing by the door that day all daddy did was say

I know you can hear me
You don't have to say a thing
My love is stronger, last a lot longer
Than your anger or your pain
You need to say you're sorry
Son, you can come out whenever you're ready
And I know you can hear me

I left home to whip the world
Got knocked down plenty of times
Day or night, wrong or right
Dad's words would ease my mind
Even at the very end he was still giving
Lying there fighting to live
I couldn't find the words so I used his

I know you can hear me
You don't have to say a thing
You've been so strong, you're not alone
And I know that you're in pain
I know that you love me
You can let go whenever you're ready
And I know you can hear me

In my midnight hours
Those words still have so much power

I know you can hear me
You don't have to say a thing
Love is so strong, I'm never alone
Though I'll never be the same
I know you can hear me
I know you can hear me---Lyrics submitted by Sydney.
