Feel like you`re slippin away
Reachin out
I just don`t know how to hold on
I just don`t know how to hold on

Feel like I`m losing you
Maybe you`re already lost
Disappearing into something
I just don`t understand

And I already miss you
Already miss you
Already miss you
Already miss you

Wish I had an answer
For this begging question why
Who could have guessed that love
Isnt always enough

Where is my answer
To this begging question why
No one ever told me that love
Isnt always enough

And I already miss you
Already miss you
Already miss you
Already miss you---Lyrics submitted by kelly pinto.
