you give and you give but you never seem to get 
back in return, but you give til your heart suffers
through 3rd degree burns, and in the end you just
want to give up on love, oh, but your gonna get
yours

[chorus]
sure as all that breath will die
and showers fall from April skies
a heart that pure wont be denied
the kind of lovin that'll rock ya
the kind of lovin that'll keep ya
hold you for a lifetime, even in the sad times

your gaurds up and your heart's cold
this might be the one, but you will never
know, your holding on to pain from so
long ago (you gotta let it go, you gotta let it go)
oh and i promise your gonna find love

[repeat chorus]

[bridge]
even in the hard times, even when its goin down
your gonna find someone's riding with you
you dont have to be alone, you just gotta hold on
your gonna find, true love

[repeat chorus 2xs]

even in the bad times---Lyrics submitted by Sharisse.
