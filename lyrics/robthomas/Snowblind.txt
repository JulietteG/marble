I think were snowblind
We've had a hard time
and we can't see where we are

Spending our whole lives
walking the same lines
and it doesn't seem to stop

(Verse)
well this is our life
its all that we get
the days are all numbered
and the nights are all spent
losing our focus
we're starting to drag
were running in circles
and we start to feel bad
but it don't mean that this ain't right
we just both need a little more time

(Chorus)
i think we're snowblind
we've had a hard time
and we can't see where we are
spending our whole lives
walking the same lines 
and it doesn't seem to stop

(Verse)
He's taking my throat
you're melting my hands
you cause me to wonder as much as i can
i feel it all over
it's starting to lack
we're spinning our wheels so much
that it's hard to turn back

(Chorus)

Oh, but when the night falls down on this place
i will be the one to hold you
when the tears run down your face

(Chorus 2X)

I think were snowblind
we've had a hard time
we're snowblind
we're snowblind---Lyrics submitted by Kim.
