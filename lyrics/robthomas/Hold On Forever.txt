Another night and here we are again 
All our faults laid out ahead 
Let it out, then let it right back in 
All those voices in your head 

And we both know everything, but we can't learn to leave 
So I'll tell you what you need 

First thing: we make you feel better 
Next stop: we pull it all together 
I'll keep you warm like a sweater 
Take my hand, hold on forever 
Just fall apart if you need to 
I'm here and I won't leave you now 
Don't look down 
Hold on forever 

Lay down all your troubles end to end 
They could reach up to the stars 
So many roads, you don't know where you've been 
But you still know who you are 

And if I seem preoccupied, I'm wondering what to do 
So here's my recipe for you 

First thing: we make you feel better 
Next stop: we pull it all together 
I'll keep you warm like a sweater 
Take my hand, hold on forever 
Just fall apart if you need to 
I'm here and I won't leave you now 
Don't look down 
Hold on forever 

And we both know everything, but we can't learn to leave 
So I'll tell you what you need 

First thing: we make you feel better 
Next stop: we pull it all together 
I'll keep you warm like a sweater 
Take my hand, hold on forever 
Just fall apart if you need to 
I'm here and I won't leave you now 
Don't look down 
Hold on forever 
Just take my hand; hold on forever 
Hold on forever 
Just take my hand; hold on forever---
