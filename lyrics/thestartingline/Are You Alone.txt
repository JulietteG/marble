Were all just everyday people
and there's a part of you
Connected with everyone else
and there's me, and there's you
Oh no...

This life can get so confusing
oh if you only knew,
If I could i'll take you with me
but I'm here and your there
oh no...

(chorus)
Are you alone? (oh no...)
Are you alone?

I'll say it so you can hear me
It's a lonely truth,
I've been spending all my time
by my self, without you (oh no...)

(chorus)
Are you alone? (oh no...)
Are you alone?

And if you are let me hear it
And if you're not make 
you say to yourself,
You're so lucky as hell

Have you ever needed help when 
you've been all by yourself? {yeah}
Have you ever needed help when
everyone's gone?

(chorus x3)
Are you alone? (oh no...)
Are you alone? (oh no...)

Are you alone?
Are you alone?

Are you alone?
Are you alone? {oh no}

Are you alone?...---Lyrics submitted by karina.
