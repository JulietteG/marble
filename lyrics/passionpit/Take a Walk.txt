All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once I was outside Penn station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone my wife and I
Before we married saved my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed awhile then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

I took a walk

Practice isn't perfect but the market cuts the loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once my mother in law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments now the accounts are overdrawn

I took a walk
Honey, it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much we had taxes
We had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
And tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes but see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need

I took a walk.---
