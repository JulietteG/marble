I filled the bucket
I spilled the bucket
Out on the floor
A mistake for sure
Consequences
Turned me hostile
I got so tied in
Made me docile
Then you applauded
When I was loving
Made me feel weak and
I start recovering
Now i feel silly
Selfish and dizzy
Now I got this feeling
That you'll forgive me

And you know
Oh my God just please dont ever let me go
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me and I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

Ooohh

Ooo there was the night we
Kissed in the moonlight
It was romantic
But didn't feel so right
Cause something was lost then
Today its replinished
But it was you who cleaned up my messes

And ooh
Oh my God just please dont ever let me go
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Let down your hair 
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Ooohhh

And ooh
My God just please don't ever let me go
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
That's just the way that things turn out
Whenever I'm lonely I'll just shout out

Let down your hair 
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Let down your hair 
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel 
Let down your hair

Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair

Oh but i don't wanna know
Where you go
And I don't wanna see
That you're coming along with me
And I don't wanna go
Wherever you go
I want the two of us to be
Just where we know

I dont want to know
Everything you know
And i don't wanna see
Everything you see
And I don't wanna go
Oh wherever you go
Oh ohhh ohh no
Oh no ohh no
Oh no---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
