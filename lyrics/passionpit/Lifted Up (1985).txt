Oh (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Tell me, what does it take to let go
How many years do you wait?
Oh, and now, all of the clouds are combining
That flickering light's just a flame

Oh, but yeah
I was so tired
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay to lay open the gates

Oh, but yeah
All my life, I've stayed here waiting
Every new year always making
Realize, though, there's nothing up there
One day you came out of nowhere

1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Out from the heavens, they called me a dreamer

Lifted off the ground
I took your hands to hold you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I would be lying if I knew that you belonged here

Well, how many years has it been now?
How many days went to waste?
Now the rain and the thunder are clashing,
The sun got a smile 'cross the face

Oh, but yeah
I was so tired

Lifted up
Lifted up
Lifted up---
