that was our fifth song,
and i hope you enjoyed it,
now this would be our best song you have ever heard,
the dirt bikes going on stage. thank you.

you're gonna drive me crazy
you're gonna drive me mad
you got an angel on you shoulder
makin hairpins outta glass

i believe in believing
the things that we don't see
and the skin violin is where the neighbors wont read meals
and the family heirloom jewelery
with sets and heaps of thieves 
will cast down things
that you've never even
seen like the gods
like the glory like the stories
that your fathers set before you
ride the tiger round the kingdom
oh no oh no
oh no there's a meeting in the canyons
oh no this is rising to the clouds

you're gonna drive me crazy
you're gonna drive me mad
you got an angel on your shoulder
makin hairpins outta glass

baby don't be unhappy
baby don't be sad
better things are coming
i swear there's truth in that

i'm shooting off the cannons
of the clouds begin to flow
and baskets weave ???????? but the ones we'll never keep
just pretend that things are mobile and will never stay put
and the way we were the day we climbed to the top of the
steeple with its people spewing angels out their mouths and letting tables turn to charcoal in the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening oh no
oh no we were waving like the trees
oh no then they moved us to the sky

you're gonna drive me crazy
you're gonna drive me mad
you got an angel on your shoulder
makin hairpins outta glass

baby don't be unhappy
baby don't be sad
better things are coming
i swear there's truth in that

two or three times the bell will ring but when when we look for the better things we search for this we have
not built i feel it crash upon your skin
i find it hard to believe there are more
of these things behind the door
do you miss me like i miss you
do i miss you like you miss me

you're gonna drive me crazy
you're gonna drive me mad
you got an angel on your shoulder
makin hairpins outta glass

baby don't be unhappy
baby don't be sad
better things are coming
i swear there's truth in that

baby don't be unhappy
baby don't be sad
better things are coming
i swear there's truth in that---Lyrics submitted by Lydia.
