you know had done hear time to time
to cut you down
don't want to hang up on my heads
don't want to sit deliring
eat you alive
just want to shut out red and blue

shut out red and blue (6x)

you know had time for me sit and watch
as you subway
your favorite times I can tell
don't want to sit deliring
eat you alive
just want to shut out red and blue

smiling, shaking off (6x)

you know had done hear time to time
to cut you down
don't want to hang up on my heads
don't want to sit deliring
eat you alive
just want to shut out red and blue

shut out red and blue (3x)---Lyrics submitted by Arcelio.
