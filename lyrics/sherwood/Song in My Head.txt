Oh I don't believe it
That I could be so deceiving
And bringing you down to feel this lack of loyalty

You were a song in my head
The warmth of the sheets in my bed
A story forever told but never old
A warm arrival never left so cold

Don't blink don't close your eyes
And most of all don't apologize
It's me who's got the demons to wrestle now

Oh I don't believe it
That I could be so deceiving
And bringing you down to feel this lack of loyalty

You were a song in my head
The warmth of the sheets in my bed
A story forever told but never old
A warm arrival never left so cold

Don't blink don't close your eyes
And most of all don't apologize
It's me who's got the demons to wrestle now

There's a patch of blue in the stormy sky
A memory of a brighter time
When everything was new and less watered down
Before the summer turned to brown

Don't say you can't believe it now
But you're almost settled down
Cuz you'll be right here when I come back around

Don't blink don't close your eyes
And most of all don't apologize
It's me who's got the demons to wrestle now

There's a patch of blue in the stormy sky
A memory of a brighter time
When everything was new and less watered down
Before the summer turned to brown

Don't blink don't close your eyes
Before the summer turned to brown

Don't blink don't close your eyes
Before the summer turned to brown---Lyrics submitted by Jackie.
