And my ear drum, reminds me
His name was just... downing my feet
And this moment, feel hard to breathe
You can't control, something left here free
And the rhythm's, exciting
Oh when I start this road full of streets
I'm glad you get this one for cheap

In hallow, when I started to breathe
Your name was like a soundtrack to me
When I was a girl, my daddy was my world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything

It feels just like it should
I wake up, this, this is for the good time
So don't miss this, this is for the good time
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

The best favorites, get... I press the strings, I love everything
Hurtful pain, forget the time and keep staying
Hold the doors, dance and give it away
Just around me, I hear it,
And melody was right over me
But... happen for me

It feels just like it should
I wake up, this, this is for the good time
So don't miss this, this is for the good time
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

Your name was like a soundtrack to me
When I was a girl, my daddy was my world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything

It feels just like it should
I wake up, this, this is for the good time
So don't miss this, this is for the good time
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

Your name was like a soundtrack to me
When I was a girl, my daddy was my world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything.---
