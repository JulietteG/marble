[Intro]

[Verse]

Fle
The time when things would change
Still I was a slave
Waitinto be saved

Dre

The body sleeps, but I
not too proud to roll
On the bad streets

So, so
Simple when you know
You'll know this when its time to go

[Verse]

Strange,
The ?son? you leave behind
The lonely ?past you've sold?
Paradise ?

Scre

The body leaves the ?bone?
To sit upon the throne
The battle waits for ?life?

Dre
Dreyour sins away
Sinyour dres away
Your holdinback's, not holdinback a ?chain?

Huh

[Solo]
Say, you love me tonight
Save, your love for me tonight

[Bridge]

And I feel you now
I lie awake in my ???
I....feel you
But I...

Heavenly demons outside my window
Sent here to see my outside this world
I call the shadow, you call the season
That...salted...wound?...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
