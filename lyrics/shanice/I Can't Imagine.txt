(Verse 1)
Once again the sun is shining in this loving heart of mine.
I feel nothing but joy as he bless me with child.
Life is full of happiness when things don't get me done.
I learn more about myself since you came around.

(Chorus)
You mean the world to me, my baby, you given me, knew everything would make my life complete. Your everything I dream. Oh yeah. Oh baby
I'm so thankful for you. 
I can't imagine! I can't imagine my life without you.
I Can't imagine. I can't imagine. I can't imagine my life without you.
I Can't imagine. I Can't imagine my life without you. I can't imagine.
I can't imagine my life without you.

(Verse 2)
Every time I look at you, I see a reflection of myself. I amaze that I could give life to somebody else. You are precious gift, a angel with no
disguise. Love Defeat the meaning when you came around.

(Chorus)
You mean the world to me, my baby, you given me, knew everything would make my life complete. Your everything I dream. Oh yeah. Oh baby
I'm so thankful for you. 
I can't imagine! I can't imagine my life without you.
I can't imagine. I can't imagine. I can't imagine my without you. 
I can't imagine. I can't imagine my life without you I can't imagine.
I can't imagine my life without you.

(Verse 3)
Your world make mine world go around.
Because of you I am found.---Lyrics submitted by Judy Myers.
