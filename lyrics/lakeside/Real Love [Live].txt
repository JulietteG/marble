For once in my life
I found someone who makes me smile

Everything I do is just for pleasin' you
Only thing that seems worth while

Honey, it's real love
The kind you know will last forever
We are the perfect pair (the perfect pair)
Oh baby, it's real love and I'm glad I met you, honey
And I know you care, oh
I've been waitin' for you all my life
Waitin' such a long time

It's good, good to be alive
Knowin' someone like you is by my side
ooh Like a bicycle built for two
Girl, I'm made for you
Lovin' you is what it's about
Oh, yes it is girl

Honey, it's real love
The kind you know will last forever
We are the perfect pair (the perfect pair)
Oh baby, it's real love and I'm glad I met you, honey
And I know you care, oh
I've been waitin' for you all my life
Waitin' such a long time

Hey girl (I've searched so long to find a love that's real)
And I love, I love the way it makes me feel

(Finally found the girl that treats me right)
Cuz I love you I'll begin to sacrifice

(Tell you exactly what I'm gonna do)
Gonna give, gonna give all my love to you

Cuz it's real love, it's real love
Oh baby......Oh baby

Honey, it's real love
The kind you know will last forever
We are the perfect pair (the perfect pair)
Oh baby, it's real love and I'm glad I met you, honey
And I know you care (you care)
I've been waitin' for you all my life
Waitin' such a long time
Oh it's real.... (the perfect pair)---Lyrics submitted by Timi Adelekan.
