[intro:]
"I don know what I was thinking about,"
"Oh no, whats wrong with me?"
"I should have been home, oh wow oh wow"

Its 5:00, Im just getting home, Roaming on my own
What can I tell her, That she might understand
Why does a man so in love, spread himself so thin
When he could never, never win, In the end  

(Ooh) Just the thought of me loosing her
Makes me want to cover my tracks baby
If I were to loose her love, Id drown in a river of tears

I need an Alibi, or Ill be caught in the wrong
Dont want to have to tell a lie (Dont want to have to tell a lie)
But the thought of me loosing her 
I dont think I can handle that

(Ooh) Its not as bad as it may seem, I keep finding trouble 
Busting the bubble, of the good life weve been sharing
Its best to be safe than sorry they say, better to lie than to lose 
Then Ill have it my way, more love  

(Ooh cos) the thought of me loosing her
Makes me want to cover my tracks baby
If I were to loose her love Id drown in a river of tears

I need an Alibi, or Ill be caught in the wrong
Dont want to have to tell a lie (Dont want to have to tell a lie)
But the thought of me loosing her
I dont think I can handle that

I need an Alibi, or Ill be without the one I love
Dont want to have to tell a lie (Dont want to have to tell a lie)
But the thought of me loosing her
I dont think I can handle that

Do you know what I mean, Do you know what I mean
Heeeeeey  Oooooo Talk to me Otis 

(Hey) the thought of me loosing her
Makes me want to cover my tracks baby
If I were to loose her love Id drown in a river of tears

Hey girl, I made a mistake and Im sorry baby
Oh I really love you girl, I made a mistake and Im sorry 

I need an Alibi, or Ill be caught in the wrong
Dont want to have to tell a lie (Dont want to have to tell a lie)
But the thought of you leaving 
Oh, Dont think I can go on any longer

I need an Alibi, or Ill be without the one I love
Dont want to have to tell a lie (Dont want to have to tell a lie)
But the thought of you leaving me
I dont think I can handle that

I need an Alibi  ooh baby---Lyrics submitted by Timi Adelekan.
