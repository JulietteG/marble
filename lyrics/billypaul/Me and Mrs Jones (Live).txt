Me and Mrs. Jones -
we've got a thing going on.
We both know that it's wrong,
but it's much too strong
to let it go now.

We meet every day
at the same caf
6:30 I know - I know she'll be there.
Holding hands - making all kinds of plans
while the jukebox play our favourite song.

Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones
we've got a thing going on.
We both know that it's wrong,
but it's much too strong
to let it go now.

We've gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high.
'Cause she's got her own obligations
and so - and so do I...

Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones
we've got a thing going on.
We both know that it's wrong,
but it's much too strong
to let it go now.

Well it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much - it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way
And I'll go mine.
Tomorrow we'll meet the same place - the same time.

Me and Mrs. Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones - Mrs. Jones
we've got a thing going on.
We've gotta be extra careful.
We can't afford to build our hopes up too high.

I wanna meet,
and talk with you,
at the same place,
the same caf,
the same time
And we're gonna hold hands like we used to
We're gonna talk it over, talk it over
We know, they know, and you know and I know that it was wrong
But I'll make it strong...
We've gotta let 'em know now
We've got a thing going on...
...thing going on...---Lyrics submitted by brigith cortes.
