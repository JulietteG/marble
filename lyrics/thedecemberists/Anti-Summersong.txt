[Verse:] 
Here now, long gone, three fix and a belly gone 
Went to the river, but the river got down 
Only good people were hangin' around 
Too little, too late, everybody gotta medicate 
Through the window and the wind comes down 
There's city guns a-hangin' around 

[Chorus:] 
I'm not goin' on just a-singin' that ol' summersong 
So long, farewell, we're gone, everybody fell in love with them 

[Instrumental] 

[Chorus: X2] 
I'm not goin' on just a-singin' that ol' summersong 
So long, farewell, we're gone, everybody fell in love with them---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
