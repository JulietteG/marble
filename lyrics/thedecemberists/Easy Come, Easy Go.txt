[Verse:] 
Lumber Jack had landed on his back 
Was badly on the medic when the riggy went slack 
Was a moonless night, the stars were leaning right 
Was leering in the mirror when the road went right 

[Chorus:] 
You never really gonna know 
When the whistle's gonna blow 
You never really gonna know 
Easy come and easy go 

[Verse 2:] 
He was a sap old gent but no-one knew his? 
And all the lil bones that he hid in his vent 
She was the come-on queen, two along the scene 
You found her in the shower, she'd been gone for seven weeks 

[Chorus:] 
You never really gonna know 
When the whistle's gonna blow 
You never really gonna know 
Easy come and easy go 

[Instrumental] 

[Chorus:] 
You never really gonna know 
When the whistle's gonna blow 
You never really gonna know 
Easy come and easy go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
