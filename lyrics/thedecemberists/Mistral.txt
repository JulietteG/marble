[Verse:] 
So we already wrecked through the reservoir 
And I've already lost my way 
But feel entoombed in this cursed bar 
For a day, anyway 
So lay me out in the cover storm 
And infer this aching jib 
The streets are built on ancient bones 
And the crib are the? 

[Chorus:] 
While the mistral blow it all away 
While the mistral blow away 
While the mistral blow it all away 
Won't it blow, won't it blow, won't it blow 

[Verse 2:] 
So it's me and you and the baby boy 
And a thorn to shed the wait 
Reeking out the little joy 
What a waste that we stayed 

[Chorus:] 
While the mistral blow it all away 
While the mistral blow away 
While the mistral blow it all away 
Won't it blow, won't it blow, won't it blow 

[Instrumental] 

[Chorus:] 
While the mistral blow it all away 
While the mistral blow away 
While the mistral blow it all away 
Won't it blow, won't it blow, won't it blow---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
