[Chorus:] 
They came down from the mountains 
They strained too long from the fountain 
And all the while 
All the while they longed for us 
But I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't 
No, I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't 
Till the water's all long gone 

[Verse:] 
And you, my sweet flower 
And how you proved more sweet by the hour 
And loath those eyes, loath those eyes 
To lose you 
My tender rose, my slender rose, my darling 
My tender rose, my slender rose, my? Darling 
But my darlin's long long long... 

[Chorus:] 
They came down from the mountains 
They strained too long from the fountain 
Oh my girl, oh my love, I've lost you 
But I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't 
No, I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't betray, I won't 
Till the water's all long gone---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
