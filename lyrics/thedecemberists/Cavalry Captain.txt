I am the cavalry captain, I am the remedy to your heart 
I am the common collector, I am imprinted upon your skies 

And when you shine, shine your eyes, looking lost, looking bright 
We're away on a light brigade and it's only for a second 
And if only for a time, and if only for a second 
And if only for a time we'll be alive 
We'll be alive, oh oh oh oh oh 

I am the cavalry captain, I am the remedy to your heart 
I am the common collector, I am imprinted upon your skies 

There is a world, there is a time, lookin' calm, lookin' kind 
We'll all wait at the end of day and it's only for a second 
And if only for a time, and if only for a second 
And if only for a time we'll be alive 
We'll be alive, oh oh oh oh oh 

I am the cavalry captain, I am the remedy to your heart 
I am the common collector, I am imprinted upon your skies---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
