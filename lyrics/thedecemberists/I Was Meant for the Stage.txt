I was meant for the stage, 
I was meant for the curtain. 
I was meant to tread these boards, 
Of this much i am certain. 

I was meant for the crowd, 
I was meant for the shouting. 
I was meant to raise these hands 
With quiet all about me. oh, oh. 

Mother, please, be proud. 
Father, be forgiven. 
Even though you told me 
'Son, you'll never make a living.' oh, oh. 

From the floorboards to the fly, 
Here I was fated to reside. 
And as I take my final bow, 
Was there ever any doubt? 
And as the spotlights fade away, 
And you're escorted through the foyer, 
You will resume your callow ways, 
But I was meant for the stage. 

The heavens at my birth 
Intended me for stardom, 
Rays of light shone down on me 
And all my sins were pardoned. 

I was meant for applause. 
I was meant for derision. 
Nothing short of fate itself 
Has affected my decision. oh, oh. 

From the floorboards to the fly, 
here i was fated to reside. 
And as I take my final bow, 
Was there ever any doubt? 
And as the spotlights fade away, 
And you're escorted through the foyer, 
You will resume your callow ways, 
But I was meant for the stage.---Lyrics submitted by Grace.
