I am a philistine,
It's the biggest sin,
It's a phetamine,
And I'm on a role.

And through my villain - I
I see you and I,
I see Paraguay,
And I've got to know.

Am I the real Darth Vader?
I'll see dragons too.

I am a killer-bee
It's the modesty
I'm a colony,
And I'm on a role.

And through my skin and bones,
I look man-a-go, I see Navaho,
And I got know.

Am I the real Darth Vader?
I'll see dragons too.
If that's what I got to do.

Am I the real Darth Vader?
(It's a phetamine, and I'm on a role)
Am I the real Darth Vader?
(I see Paraguay, and I've got to know)
Am I the real Darth Vader?
(I'm a colony, and I'm on a role)
Am I the real Darth Vader?
(Am I the real)

I'll see dragons too.
If that's what I got to do.---
