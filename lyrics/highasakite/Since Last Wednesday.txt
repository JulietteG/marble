He would never do grafitti or vandalize that house
And he would never be caught spray painting on those peoples walls

But no one has seen or heard from him since last Wednesday
Oh oh oh oh..

And he would never buy a weapon and bring it to our home
And he would never be foolish and lie about that now

But no one has seen or heard from him since last Wednesday
Oh oh oh oh..

But no one has seen or heard from him since last Wednesday

Hold me forward is one option but not the only one

But no one has seen or heard from him since last Wednesday

Call me forward is one option but not the only one

But no one has seen or heard from him since last Wednesday

Oh oh oh oh...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
