[Verse 1 (Karina's ad-libs)]
I don't like the way you look at her, she looks at you
It's frustrating (ohh)
People say when we're together it looks more like you two are dating (more than you and me)

[Hook (Karina's ad-libs)]
I tell you somethings you do that make me feel uncomfortable
You tell me I'm trippin and that I should let it go
Though, I wonder to myself would you still think it's all good if the shoe was on the other foot 
I don't think you would (Noo)

[Chorus]
What if your friends started paying more attention to me?
Would you handle it?
Tell me could you handle it, boy?
What if your friends started paying more attention to me?
Would you handle it?
Tell me could you handle it, boy?

[Verse 2 (Karina's ad-libs)]
Hey boy
What if I told you tony said I was pretty? (Ohh ooo)
When you're not around he goes out his way to chill with me (Ohhh ooo)

[Hook (Karina's ad-libs)]
I tell you somethings you do that make me feel uncomfortable
You tell me I'm trippin and that I should let it go
Though, I wonder to myself would you still think it's all good if the shoe was on the other foot 
I don't think you would (Noo)

[Chorus (Karina's ad-libs)]
What if your friends started paying (Yeah) more attention to me?
Would you handle it? (Hey!)
Tell me (would you handle it) could you handle it, boy?
What if your friends (tell me boy what would you do) started paying more attention to me? (Whoa)
Would you handle it?
Tell me could you handle it, boy?
