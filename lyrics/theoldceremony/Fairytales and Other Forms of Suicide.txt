You led me down the winter heavy forest trail
I introduced myself again to no avail
But then the spring arrived, all red and full of life
You laughed and all the birds harmonized

Now fairytales and other forms of suicide 
can fill your head while poison gases cloud your eyes
But I, for one, can see I've found the one for me 
The one to make me love the night

Well alright, alright, alright, it's alright
Alright, alright, alright, it's all...

Now when you fall asleep and start to worry babe
And throw away everything you meant to save
Well I will wake you up and fill your coffee cup
With grateful tears and love unchanged

Well alright, alright, alright, it's alright
Alright, alright, alright, it's alright
Alright, alright, alright, it's alright
Alright, alright, alright---Lyrics submitted by Mackensie.
