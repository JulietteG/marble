Well that eagle flew right out of the blue
And dropped off a little overtime pay
So I threw the wolves a bone and I shined up the chrome
On my new getaway
And I picked my baby a handful of daisies from the shotgun side of the road
Now here we go

Come on make some noise everybody lets have a little fun tonight
Forget about your worries ain't nobody in a hurry to see that morning light
Find a cup fill it up
We got more than enough to rock on and on all night
Nothing like a good time spent with a few good friends of mine

Yeah with the crowd and drinks
Somebody's personal ink
Is bound to pop on out
And some well fed dude is gonna get half nude
And crash out on the ground
Yeah them good time Charlies they sure love to party
Throw down at the end of the day
Now what do ya say

Come on make some noise everybody lets have a little fun tonight
Forget about your worries ain't nobody in a hurry to see that morning light
Find a cup fill it up
We got more than enough to rock on and on all night
Nothing like a good time spent with a few good friends of mine

Whoa whoa whoa
Yeah come on
Yeah

Come on make some noise everybody lets have a little fun tonight
Forget about your worries ain't nobody in a hurry to see that morning light
Find a cup fill it up
We got more than enough to rock on and on all night
Nothing like a good time spent with a few good friends of mine

Yeah
With a few good friends of mine
Whoa
A few good friends of mine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
