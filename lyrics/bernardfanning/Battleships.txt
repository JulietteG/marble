Battleship, battleship
Grey is the colour that i choose
Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour without you

I have sipped, i have sipped 
Oh on the bottle of untruth
I have sipped, i have sipped 
Oh on the bottle of untruth

Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour that i choose
Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour that i use

I have slipped, i have slipped 
Oh on the trouble that i brewed
I have slipped, i have slipped 
Oh on the trouble that i brewed

Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour that i choose
Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour that i knew

You are exactly what i need 
to get me back up on my feet
I lost direction now i see
It's by your side that i should be
When i put myself into your place 
I watched you drift so far away
And now this burden that we bear 
We can rebuild we can repair

Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour that i choose
Battleship, battleship 
Grey is the colour without you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
