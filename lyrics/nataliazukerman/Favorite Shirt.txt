Wish I knew that song you're always singin' 
- alone or in a crowd -
 you sing it right out loud.
If you don't know the words, 
you don't stop, 
you'll just sing the parts you know and then you sing La La La La.

When I learn to make a sound they said it should be written down, practiced and learned, 
my children, 
seen and not heard.

So when I'm ready to join in, 
that's when your song's about to end.

And what do you see if you always look over your shoulder?
Why can't we be happy to dance when the music's over?

I wish we'd been a book you could re-read; 
over and over; each page you'd savor - 
finding something new in those old lines,
learning something from what we've read a hundred times.
But we're just a short story. 
Love with no glory. 
Virtue with no sin. 
Over as we begin.

Once upon a time...that's what you get, 
if you always look over your shoulder. 

How soon we forget, we can dance when the music's over.

I wish I was your favorite shirt,
when you're in doubt - it's the one you pick out first.
You don't know where it came from, you got it on a whim - 
just like that song you're always singin'...

la la la la, 
la la la la la la la, 
la la la la, 
la la la la la la la---Lyrics submitted by Leah Humphries.
