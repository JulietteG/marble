He drinks, he smokes,
hell cuss, he swears he tells bad jokes
And he ropes, and he rides,
he lives life fast and loves to fight
He's a booze, a loser
he calls me up when he's had too much
He's a schemer, a dreamer when I tell him to change his ways,
but he just turns, to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Whooooaahh!!

I ain't givin up on him just yet,
cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No he won't quit, but you can bet,
I'm sticking to it I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter

Well he chews, and he spits,
well he flirts too much and he loves
blonde chicks
And he struts, and he strolls,
he looks so cool and yep he knows!
He's a beauty, a cutie, his body rocks and the girls they flock
He's afflictin', addictin' I tell him to change his ways,
but he just turns to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Whooooaahh!!

No, I ain't givin up on him just yet,
hmm cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm sticking to it I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter.. Wahoo!

Ooh, his body rocks and the girls they flock,
he's afflicted, addicted I tell him to change his ways,
but he just turns to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Whooooaahh!!
I ain't giving up on him just yet
Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No, I ain't givin up on him just yet,
hmm cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No he won't quit, but you can bet
sticking to it I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter..---
