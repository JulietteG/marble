Don't.. don't you wish we tried
Do you feel what I feel inside
You know love is stronger than pride
Don't.. no don't
Let your anger grow
Just tell me what you need me to know
Please talk to me don't close the door
Cause I wanna hear you.. wanna be near you

Don't fight.. don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away.. don't tell me to go

Don't.. don't give up on trust
Don't give up on me.. on us
We could just hold on long enough
We can do it.. we'll get through it

Don't fight.. don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away.. don't tell me to go

Don't pretend that it's ok
Things won't get better that way
And don't do something you might regret someday
Don't..
Don't give up on me

We can do it.. we'll get through it

Don't fight.. don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away.. don't tell me to go

Don't fight.. don't argue (Don't give up on me)
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry (say that I'm sorry)
Just let me love you (Don't give up on me)
Don't turn me away.. don't tell me to go

Don't fight.. don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you (don't give up on me)
Don't turn me away.. don't tell me to go---
