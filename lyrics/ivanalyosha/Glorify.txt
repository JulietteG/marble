I left my family and my home
to fight the battle on my own
I stole a car and drove away
but in my hate St Paul did say

Glorify the Lord above
with your drink and making love
Glorify the Lord, my son
with your whiskey and your guns

I shot my foe, now I feel better
I beat my wife, now I feel sad
I curse my brother and my friend
I broke my mother's heart again

Glorify the Lord above
with your drink and making love
Glorify the Lord, my son
with your whiskey and your guns

And I'll tune my heart and tune my strings
and see what giving thanks might bring
For all I have was always thine
but I was fool to think it mine

We'll glorify the Lord above
with your drink and making love
Glorify the Lord, my son
with your whiskey and your gun

Well if you stay or if you go
or if you stand or you're brought low
We'll drink the wine, we'll eat the bread
But don't forget what Jesus said

Glorify the Lord above
with your drink and making love
Glorify the Lord my son
'till your work on earth is done

I said to glorify the Lord above
oh if you've plenty, if you've none
Glorify the Lord my son
with your whiskey and your gun---Lyrics submitted by Hawley.
