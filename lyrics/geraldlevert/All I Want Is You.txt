[Kelly Price](Gerald Levert) 
(Hmm, oh) 
Oh baby, baby 
My love I must confess 
I don't know what to do 
(Please tell me what is wrong) 
You're seeing someone else 
But I really care for you 
(Please tell me girl how long) 
It's been a little while 
And mama thinks I'm wrong 
(Sure you're right, I know you're right yeah) 
Oh yes she does 
She thinks that you're the one 
And you and I belong, ooh 
(Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm) 
So if you take me back 
I promise to be true 
(Will you? Will you?) 
I've made up in my mind 
That all I want is you 

All I want is you 
But baby I've been cheating 
All I want is you 
Don't know what I was thinking 
I've made up my mind 
It's time to say goodbye 
To him and him and all the other men 
Cause all I want is you 

[Kelly Price](K-Ci) 
My love I must confess 
I care for him it's true 
(Girl I ain't gon' play no fool, no) 
I've still been seeing him 
While I've been seeing you 
(So what'cha gonna do?) 
He wants to settle down 
What you don't wanna do 
Why won't your marry me baby-babe? 
(Oh) 
I thought you came around (Oh) 
But you just can't be moved (Oh) 
But I made up in my mind 
That what you want is cool 
(Baby, yeah) 
As long as you're around 
Then all I want is you 

All I want is you 
But baby I've been cheating 
All I want is you 
Don't know what I was thinking 
I've made up my mind 
It's time to say goodbye 
To him and him and all the other men 
Cause all I want is you 

All I want is you 
But baby I've been cheating 
All I want is you 
Don't know what I was thinking 
I've made up my mind 
It's time to say goodbye 
To him and him and all the other men 
Cause all I want is you 

[All] 
But, but, but, but 
You've been playing games 
(Do you really love me girl?) 
Oh yes I do (Do you really?) 
I do love you but it's not the same 
Sorry that I told a lie 
But I couldn't say goodbye 

All I want is you 
But baby I've been cheating 
All I want is you 
Don't know what I was thinking 
I've made up my mind 
It's time to say goodbye 
To him and him and all the other men 
Cause all I want is you 

All I want is you 
But baby I've been cheating 
All I want is you 
Don't know what I was thinking 
I've made up my mind 
It's time to say goodbye 
To him and him and all the other men 
Cause all I want is you 

All I want is you 
But baby I've been cheating 
All I want is you 
Don't know what I was thinking 
I've made up my mind 
It's time to say goodbye 
To him and him and all the other men 
Cause all I want is you 

[Kelly Price] 
I got you over here 
I got him over there 
And all I want is you 
(Prove it baby) 
To be my teddy bear 
(Prove it baby) 
Oh baby, baby, baby 
(I'm crying inside, oh, oh, oh) 
All the other men 
(Ooh wee) 
All I want is you 
All I want is you 
(Somebody help me, somebody help me) 
Don't know what to do 
(Somebody help me) 
Tell me what to do, hey, hey 
(Kelly don't do this, Kelly don't it, don't it) 
(Kelly, Kelly don't do it) 
Gerald baby, K-Ci baby 
All I want is oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Kim.
