It must of been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
you've been content to let me shine
you always walked a step behind
I was the one with all the glory
While you was the one with all the strength
only a face without a name
i never once heard you complained

Chorus:
Did you ever know that your my hero?
And everything I would like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

It might of appeared to go unnoticed
That I Got It all here in My Heart
I Want you to know i know that truth
I would be nothing without you

Chorus

Cause- you - are- the - wind- beneath-my - wings---Lyrics submitted by tavia.
