Chorus 
Have mercy on me 
Have pity on me 
You're making me weak 
Your love is so sweet 
Please have mercy on me 

Have mercy on me 
Have pity on me 
You're making me weak 
Your love is so sweet 
Please have mercy on me 

I never met a girl like you 
To keep me coming back 
For the things you do 
You make every little thing alright alright 

When you rub me down you relax me girl 
And just your foreplay makes me toes curl 
Please don't stop you got me so confused 
Oh Lord have mercy 

Chorus 

Please don't do that 
If you want me to last 
'Cause my temperature's rising 
And It's rising fast 

Girl you know just how 
To turn me on baby 
But you like having that control 
Don't you like making me hot 

The feeling too damn strong 
When I'm inside I'm so fulfilled 
You're like a doctor 
A doctor without the pill 

Girl you make me so excited 
I hollar and curse 
Slow down baby slow down baby 
I'm about to burst 

Chorus 

Don't do that baby 
Don't do it like that 
Slow down let me 
Let me keep my past 

Chorus 

Said you going to make me do that 
Don't you want this love to last 
Oh oh baby have mercy on me 

Have mercy on me please 
Baby if feels so good inside of you 
Slow down baby ohoo ohoo ohoo ohoo 
ohoo baby 
Please baby oh baby stop it
