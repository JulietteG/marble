Anything but you
Just won't do
I could carry on forever

When my heart stands still for a reason
I'm in love with you
When my heart stands still for a reason
There's nothing that I cannot do
And my breathing follows you
In my mind my actions too
And in every thing I do
And my heart stands still, and my heart stands still for you

Anything but you
Just won't do
I could carry on forever
Until I find the truth
Anything but you
Just won't do
I could carry on forever

2x
To dream
In a worn out world, in a plastic world
Is to win
To dream
In a sought out world, in a broken world
Is to begin

Anything but you
Just won't do
I could carry on forever
Until I find the truth
Anything but you
Just won't do
I could carry on forever

Repeat---Lyrics submitted by Vicky.
