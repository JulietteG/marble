It seems all of these words 
Couldnt be further from The truth, 
how did I get here 
What did I do
Your eyes, telling me lies
And making me fight myself
While you have your agenda
A life to pursue

chorus:
So please
Let me be free, from you.
And please, let me be free
I can face the truth.

Im blind to all of your colors
That used to be rainbow then
My eyes, where did they go to
Why disappear
Its hard to be all alone
I never got through your Disguise, 
I guess I'll just go
And face all my fears

chorus:
So please
Let me be free, from you.
And please, let me be free
I can face the truth.

Put down your world
Just for one night
Pick me again

chorus:
So please
Let me be free, from you.
And please, let me be free
I can face the truth.---Lyrics submitted by carl.
