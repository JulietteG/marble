It's four AM, I'm waking up to your perfume 
Don't get up, I'll get through on my own 
I don't know if I'm home 
Or if I lost the way into your room 
I'm spiraling into my doom 
I'm feeling half alive but I know one day 
You and I will be free, 

To live and die by our own rules, 
Free.. 
Despite the fact that men are fools. 

I'm almost alive, and I need you to try 
And save me. 
It's okay that we're dying, 
But I need to survive tonight, tonight. 

Well excuse me while I get killed softly, 
Heart slows down and I can hardly tell you I'm okay 
At least 'til yesterday, 
You know you got me off my highest guard, 
Believe me when I say it's hard. 
We'll get through this tonight 
And I know one day you and I will be free 

To live and die by our own rules, 
Free.. 
Despite the fact that men are fools. 

I'm almost alive, and I need you to try 
And save me. 
It's okay that we're dying, 
But I need to survive tonight, tonight. 

And you touch my hand ever so slightly 
(Girl we're not ready for this yet) 
And the deadly look she cast upon me 
I won't regret, I won't regret 
I won't regret. I won't regret... 

And I was trying to disappear, 
But you got me wrapped around you 
I can hardly breathe without you 
I was trying to disappear 
But I got lost in your eyes now, 
You brought me down to size now. 

I'm almost alive 
And I need you to try and save me. 
It's okay that we're dying 
But I need to survive tonight, tonight 
Tonight... 

I'm almost alive, and I need you to try 
And save me. 
It's okay that we're dying, 
But I need to survive tonight, tonight. 
I need to survive tonight, tonight---Lyrics submitted by yazmin.
