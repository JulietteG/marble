I left everything behind me
Searching for the strength I thought I
Had inside me
Left you behind
So lonely
Praying for the day that you would somehow find me

I was young
You were wrong
But I tried
I was strong
And the years that I have lost are all I see

All I can say
Is I am not afraid
Of the world that I have tried to push away
I fight everyday
But I am to blame
I am not innocent
But I am not afraid

I lost all faith
Inside me
Still I find myself without the will to
Free me from you
I'm a slave
Unhappy
Wanting oh so much for you to someday
See me

Tell me how
I want to
Say it loud
I need you
To be the one who catches all my dreams
Hear me now
All I can say
Is I am not afraid
Of the world that I have tried to push away
I fight everyday
But I am to blame
I am not innocent
But I am not afraid
Anymore

I'm tired of sleeping
Alone I've been grieving
The life that I gave up to feel alive
I want to feel alive

I'm not afraid anymore, I'm not afraid anymore

I want to feel alive, I want to feel alive
I want to feel, I need to feel
I want to feel alive

Hold on tight
Let's make this right
Take me, make me
Feel alive tonight---Lyrics submitted by jinny.
