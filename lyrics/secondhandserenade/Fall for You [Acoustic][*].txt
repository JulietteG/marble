Best thing about tonight's that were not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before
I know you dont think that I am trying
I know youre wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that i will fall for you
Over again
Dont make me change my mind
Or I wont live to see another day
I swear its true
Because a girl like you's impossible to find
Youre impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed
But I have loved you from the start. Oh..

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Dont make me change my mind
Or I wont live to see another day
I swear its true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Its impossible

So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
Im yours to keep
And hold onto your words
Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight
When youre asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Dont make me change my mind
Or I wont live to see another day
I swear its true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Dont make me change my mind
Or I wont live to see another day
I swear its true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Youre impossible to find---Lyrics submitted by Gianna.
