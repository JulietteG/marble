I did a lot, I know you say
I've got to get away
"The world is not yours for the taking"
Is all you ever say
I know I'm not the best for you
But promise that you'll stay
'Cause if I watch you go
You'll see me wasting,
You'll see me wasting away 

'Cause today you walked out of my life
'Cause today your words felt like a knife
I'm not living this life

Goodbyes are meant for lonely people standing in the rain
And no matter where I go it's always pouring all the same
These streets are filled with memories
Both perfect and in pain
And all I wanna do is love you
But I'm the only one to blame

'Cause today you walked out of my life
'Cause today your words felt like a knife
I'm not living this life

But what to do I know if your leaving
All you did was stop the bleeding 
But these scars will stay forever 
These scars will stay forever
And these words, they have no meaning
If we cannot find the feeling
That we held onto together
Try your hardest to remember

Stay with me or watch me bleed
I need you just to breathe

'Cause today you walked out of my life
(Stay with me or watch me bleed)
'Cause today your words felt like a knife
(I need you to just breathe)
I'm not living this life---Lyrics submitted by Caroline.
