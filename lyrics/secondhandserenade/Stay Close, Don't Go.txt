I'm staring at the glass in front of me,
Is it half empty?
Have I ruined all you've given me?
I know I've been selfish,
I know I've been foolish,
But look through that and you will see,
That I'll do better.
I know, baby I can do better.

[Chorus]
If you leave me tonight,
I'll wake up alone,
Don't tell me I will make it on my own.
Don't leave me tonight,
This heart of stone will sink 'til it dies,
If you leave me tonight.

Sometimes I stare at you while you are sleeping,
I listen to your breathing,
Amazed how I somehow managed to,
Sweep you off of your feet girl,
Your perfect little feet girl,
I took for granted what you do,
But I'll do better.
I know, baby I can do better.

[Chorus]
If you leave me tonight,
I'll wake up alone,
Don't tell me I will make it on my own.
Don't leave me tonight,
This heart of stone will sink 'til it dies,
If you leave me tonight.

And don't you know,
My heart is pumping,
Oh, it's putting up the fight.
And I've got this feeling,
That everything's alright.
Don't you see?
I'm not the only one for you,
But you're the only one for me.

If you leave me tonight,
I'll wake up alone.

[Chorus]
If you leave me tonight,
I'll wake up alone,
Don't tell me I will make it on my own.
Don't leave me tonight,
This heart of stone will sink 'til it dies,
If you leave me tonight.
Don't leave me tonight.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
