Something isn't right
I'm losing faith in everything I know
What do I know

You told me I should fight
Not to be self destructive thinking I should go
What do I know

Stay away from me
I need you too badly
And it's tearing me apart

Wont you stay a part of me
I need you too badly
I need you too badly 
I need you too badly

I wrote this song tonight
Just to feel like I was not alone
But I am alone

I don't have the right
To ask for your forgiveness on the phone
I am alone

Stay away from me 
I need you too badly
And it's tearing me apart

Wont you stay a part of me 
I need you too badly 
I need you too badly
I need you too badly

This feeling's never ending
And I can't keep pretending 
That it's you I want
That it's you 
I'm not okay
I'm not okay

Stay away from me 
I need you too badly
And it's tearing me apart

Wont you stay a part of me
I need you too badly 
I need you too badly 
I need you too badly---Lyrics submitted by Gracie Benson.
