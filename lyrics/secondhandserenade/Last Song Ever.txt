Verse:
Em
I wish my life was this song,
cause songs they never die
i could write for years and years and never have to cry
i'd show you how i feel without saying a word,
i could wrap up both our hearts i know it sounds obsurde,

Chorus
and i saw the tears on your face, i shot you down,
and i slamed the door but couldn't make a sound so,
please stay sweet my dear, don't hate me know,
i can't tell how this last song ends

Verse:
the way that i feel tonight 
so down so down,
i pray i can swim
just so i won't drown,
and the waves that crash
over me i'm gasping for air
take my hand so i can breathe (as i write this last song down)

Chorus:
and i saw the tears on your face, i shot you down,
and i slamed the door but couldn't make a sound so,
please stay sweet my dear, don't hate me know,
i can't tell how this last song ends

Bridge:
the broken glass 
your moistened skin was everything, was everything
and your broken voice
was quivering(you're every thing)
your everything, your everything
scream at me make it the best i've ever heard,
laugh out loud i know it sounds obsurd,
scream at me make it the best i've ever heard,
your everything, your everything

(Repeat x2)
your heart beats slowly, pains are growing, 
does she love you, that's worth knowing
your everything.---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
