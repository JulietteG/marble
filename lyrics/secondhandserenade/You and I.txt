I'm feeling distracted,
And likewise attracted,
To all the things that you let me know,
All the things that you can't let go.
You're waiting for friction,
This empty addiction
Is forcing me to intervene.
Let's break out of this scene.

I know, I'm not alone.
I'm not the only one who is broken.
And I know I'll never let you go.
I could watch the world pass by,
Just as long as it's you and I, you and I.

I watch you take over.
I'll give you this offer:
Take my hand and we'll run away,
Leave behind our past to stay.
Decaying 'til it's rotten.
A we'll have long forgotten
The memories that will haunt your heart.
Let's tear this town apart.

I know, I'm not alone.
I'm not the only one who is broken.
And I know I'll never let you go.
I could watch the world pass by,
Just as long as it's you and I, you and I.

We watch the world go by,
But if it's you and I
Then we will never die, 
No we can never die
[x2]

I know, I'm not alone.
I'm not the only one who is broken.
And I know I'll never let you go.
I could watch the world pass by,
Just as long as it's you and I, you and I.
