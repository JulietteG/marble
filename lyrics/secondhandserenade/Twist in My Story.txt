Slow down,
The world isn't watching us break down,
It's safe to say we are alone now,
We're alone now.

Not a whisper,
The only noise is the receiver,
I'm counting the seconds until you break the silence,
So please just break the silence.

The whispers turn to shouting,
The shouting turns to tears,
Your tears turns into laughter,
And it takes away our fears.

So you see,
This world doesn't matter to me,
I'll give up all i had just to breathe,
The same air as you,
Till the day that i die,
I cant take my eyes off of you.

I'm longing,
For words to describe how i feeling,
I'm feeling inspired,
My world just flip-turned
Upside down
And turned around,
Say what's that sound?

Its my heartbeat
Its getting much louder,
My heartbeat,
Its stronger than ever,
I'm feeling so alive,
I'm feeling so alive,

The whispers turn to shouting,
The shouting turns to tears,
Your tears turns into laughter,
And it takes away our fears.

So you see,
This world doesn't matter to me,
I'll give up all i had just to breathe,
The same air as you,
Till the day that i die,
I cant take my eyes off of you.

I'm finally waking up,
A twist in my story
It's time i open up,
And let you love right through me
I'm finally waking up,
A twist in my story,
Its time i open up,
And let your love right through me

Cause that's what you get,
When you see your life,
Through someone else eyes,
That's what you get
That's what you get.

So you see,
This world doesn't matter to me,
I'll give up all I had just to breathe,
The same air as you,
Till the day that I die,
I can't take my eyes,

So you see,
This world doesn't matter to me,
I'll give up all i had just to breathe,
The same air as you,
Till the day that i die,
I cant take my eyes off of you.---Lyrics submitted by Caroline.
