you can say goodbye
to all the things that you have ever known
you can say goodbye
and leave behind the life that you have grown
what's the point
you try to start from scratch, but get let down
you can say goodbye
just to realize there's no one left around

so what am i fighting for?
tell me?

is there anybody out there?
am i swimming through this empty sea alone
am i looking for an answer?
or am i trying to find a way to get back home
is there anybody out there?
would you hear me if i screamed or if i cried?
i'm looking for an answer
and just trying to find a way to survive

you can live and die
without the chance to find out what your worth
you can live and die
and never find the one that she'd deserve
you can walk alone
and live inside the shadows in your heart
you can say goodbye
only to find you've been alone right from the start


so what am i fighting for?
tell me?

is there anybody out there?
am i swimming through this empty sea alone
am i looking for an answer?
or am i trying to find a way to get back home
is there anybody out there?
would you hear me if i screamed or if i cried?
i'm looking for an answer
and just trying to find a way to survive

never thought that i would end up all alone
every day i'm feeling further away from home
u can't catch my breath
but i'm holding on

is there anybody out there
is this the last time i have to say goodbye
am i staring at my future
is it time to take charge of my life?

is there anybody out there?
am i swimming through this empty sea alone
am i looking for an answer?
or am i trying to find a way to get back home
is there anybody out there?
would you hear me if i screamed or if i cried?
i'm looking for an answer
and just trying to find a way to survive

a way to survive
and i'm holding on---Lyrics submitted by arnold.
