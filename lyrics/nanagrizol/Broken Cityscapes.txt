Pushing forward, highway miles are cheaper than in town 
If you left something behind, well try your best not to let it get you down,
The city is full of bullshit, I don't sleep there anymore
I don't want its schmoozy eagerness, I don't want to be it's whore. 

Oh but we we are so awestruck by the way that things just start 
Like how the sun shines til its night time, we fall asleep to the sound of passing cars
Its that sinking sunken feeling, that you get on the roofs of tall buildings
Staring out over the bay or broken cityscapes  that make you cry

And its not sad its just  don't know how to begin to ask why
Just a few more cigarettes and I'll come back inside
And do you ever the feeling that something somewhere in you is still alive
And saying Oh and its a big life As big as it can be and if you cannot see the beauty well don't give up so easily 
And its a weak-kneed conversation telling your new revelation to a choir of a more cynical nature
Being you ego and your id, the part that swears to you you never want kids 
The part that drinks away each night and in the morning wakes at ten and goes to work 
So lets not be so bitter, at least not just yet I keep meaning to say everythings okay, well how presumptious is that
 And sure we all get hurt sometimes and sure we all feel ashamed,
 But if our friends can't help us through these things I don't know what friendship means 
And I don't know just what it is I'm trying to say.---Lyrics submitted by James.
