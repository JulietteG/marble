You were the only one. 
I fancied you all I had left. 
We knew it was true and instinctively left one another to mend our own holes in our chests

In a dream we were pieces of ships
We were attached from our feet to our hips
And forgetting that icebergs were only the tips 
As we crashed I could read the relief on your lips

But most dreams were better and we all were one
And everyone just became part of the sun 
And then shot back out in a gajillion rays
All our ancestors and children and futures they made
Would just shine down and light up the day
And light blended better than our bodies ever could
In the days when we were made out of flesh or wood
Yeah we weren't the same color though we knew that we could be 
We were ourselves but blended at the edges like it should be

And now, separated, your color still shines on my sleeve
With my parents, favorite teacher, first ever pen-pal and me
The more that we share, yes the more that we grow
And we all became tiny rainbows.---Lyrics submitted by James.
