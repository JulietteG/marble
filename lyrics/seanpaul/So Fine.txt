{chorus} x2

Listen to my voice and vocal
lock off your phone, tell your man dont call
i'm gonna give you this love total

cah we are di top pro gyal
international or local
your man dont got it like me not at all
cah ya man dont firm and ya man no tall
im a bruk out di diamond and di opal
im a try buy love but now di love stall
look lik im not dont no hope at all
im not come good with di approach at all
hang him up like picture inna photo hall
every man gwan buy new protocol
S.P im di man you fi call
i want f-a-a-all
