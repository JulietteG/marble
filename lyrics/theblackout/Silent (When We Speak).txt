Please don't say, it's over today
I never wanted to walk away
I never asked to anyway

Please don't make, don't make this mistake
I'm too afraid to walk away
Do I have what it takes to stay?

We're silent, (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, it's killing me (X2)
Time and time again (X3)

So take my hand, I'm falling to pieces
Help me understand, I want to believe
When the end began, (I can't be on my own)
When it all turned into sand, (Don't leave me alone)

We're silent, (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, it's killing me (X2)
Time and time again

We're silent, (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, (we're silent)
We're silent when we speak
We're silent, it's killing me (X2)

Time and time again
Please don't say, 
Time and time again
It's over today, 
Time and time again
I never wanted to walk away, 
Time and time again
I never asked to anyway, 
Time and time again---Lyrics submitted by Sophie.
