Woaaaaahhhhh [x7]

So this is how it's gonna be 
You and me are history 
We will never look the same
But the end is coming.
Your time is running out 
The rain is pouring 
So raise your voice and shout

This is a blackout
And you'll find out
It's gonna come and take everything you love away
A blackout, coming to your town
We'll never run away so stand and fight another day.

So this is where it all began
This is were the story ends 
We will never need to leave
We keep running
The walls keep coming down
This is a warning
So raise your voice and shout.

This is a blackout
And you'll find out
It's gonna come and take everything you love away
A blackout, coming to your town
We'll never run away so stand and fight another day.

Oh!

Going out [x39]

This is a blackout
And you'll find out
It's gonna come and take everything you love away
The blackout coming to your town
Well never run away so stand and fight another day.

This is a blackout [x3]
