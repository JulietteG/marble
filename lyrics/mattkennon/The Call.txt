Today was gonna be the day, he'd already wrote the note
he parkked that chevrolett at the end that dead end road
had his finger on the trigger, just about to end everything
he was taking one last long breath when he heard his cell phone ring

and his best friend said man where you been?
we're heading down to the lake this weekend
you better not miss it cause buddy i swear it wont be the same if you aint there
and i told that girl that you like so much that you were comming along and her eyes lit up
I better let you go man i really hope i didnt catch you in the middle of anything
He said you kinda did but i dont mind at all 
I'm glad you called.

In another town down the road, in the back seat of a car
two 18 year olds had let a kiss go to far
He said how we gonna have this child when were both headed off to school
he convinced her late one night theres only one thing to do
She was scared to death in that waiting room when the nurse asked how far along are you
she said 5 weeks and just about then her phone lit up and his call came in

He said baby i was wrong about everything i already bought you a dimond ring
were gonna start a life would you be my wife boy or girl pink or blue yeah either way 
all she could say as she felt those tear drops fall i'm so glad you called

If someone you know is weighing on your mind, and needs a friend on the other end of the line 
dont hesitate what you say may seem so small but who knows they might be glad you called

So make the call---Lyrics submitted by nikky.
