Should have seen both faces from the start
Beholden to the hate within your heart
You cast the world aside, hiding from your burden one more time
Could it be your efforts were in vain?
Could it be your life is full of shame?
You threw it all away
You let it fall to pieces here today

You waste your time
You hide too much, don't ever let me find what you're thinking
What's in your head?
You ask too much, don't ever let me be
Who are you?

We won't need to take it when you're gone
Won't embrace the liars very long
But you're afraid to go
You're afraid to face it when you've lost
All the ties were severed when you came
But what if I could mend them once again
You're afraid to learn
Forced to watch those bridges as they burn

You waste your time
You hide too much, don't ever let me find what you're thinking
What's in your head?
You ask too much, don't ever let me be
Who are you?

Who are you?---Lyrics submitted by Josh Bartmus.
