I set out on the voyage of the conquering fools, lookin' for the gold and the modern day jewels
It come to pass what was stuck in my head, if I didn't quit on-looking that I'd probably be dead

I hit the road and I rolled up North, lookin' for the origin, the place of my birth,
I didn't notice when I ran a red sign, hopin' that everything would really be fine

People come and people go but they never know what is going on
So they gotta try to be what they wanna be
What the hell is happenin' to me?

I hit the road and I rode up North, lookin' for the origin, the place of my birth,
I didn't notice when I ran a red sign, hopin' that everyhing would really be fine 

Well i sat down about an hour ago, looking for my gold and i'm saying it ohhh
and i went down looking for that big
that big, baby, big brass show
so i, i went and then he started to go
walking down the same old, same old road
thinking to myself, this quite a struggle
what am i gonna do tomorrow
im gonna find my gold
and conquer me some fools
yeeaaaaaaahhh

long long time ago 
i found myself looking for fools
and what i did not let myself know
was that these fools were inside my mind
i'd love to do right all the time 
but i found there are times
when i love to do so wrong
and i know, that the fools 
are at the bottom of it all

when no substance can control you
you done conquered that fool
when that alcohol can not own you
you done conquered that fool
and when no one person runs you
you must conquer that fool
and when you learn in them books everything ya need to know
well you can conquer them fools
you can conquer them fools that ya like
yall dont have to go---Lyrics submitted by Derrick.
