I climb a mountain for you
I stay up here
I wait yes I wait for you
Till' you believe in our love

Using up my oxygen
Can you breath for me?
Freezing air is getting thin
Still you believe in our love

I know that you were my mountain
I know that you were my peak
Washing your hands in the fountain
Breaking the fall with concrete ---
