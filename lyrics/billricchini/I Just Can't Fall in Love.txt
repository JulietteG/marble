You are to blame
Before I always felt the same
Is it gonna hurt
Ive never felt those fireworks
Is this a mistake
Or will this thing take
I dont know
But we can see

Chorus:
I saw a cloud up in the blue sky
But this is something I cant deny
And know Im thinking I just might try
Won't make a difference cuz I just cant fall in love
But there's a crackin in my armor 
And I can't stop thinkin' about her
Oh man I shouldnt even bother
Won't make a difference cuz I just can't fall in love

Does she exist
Oh those lips I cant resist
No false alarms
I want to be in her arms
Oh run for your sake
Avoid the heartbreak
Turn around 
And youll be free

Chorus:
I saw a cloud up in the blue sky
But this is something I cant deny
And know Im thinking I just might try
Wont make a difference cuz I just cant fall in love
But theres a crackin in my armor 
And I cant stop thinkin about her
Oh man I shouldnt even bother
Wont make a difference cuz I just cant fall in love---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Hughes.
