The chemistry was instant
The moment we met
I'm there in your daydreams
You teased me I laughed

Is it real love or illusion
I can never decide
I'm lost in confusion
I've nowhere to hide

Always something new

It's the sparkle in your life
It's the sparkle in your life
It's the sparkle in your life

My gaze are easy
So play me again
Feel the heat come closer
No need to pretend

Always something new

It's the sparkle in your life
It's the sparkle in your life
It's the sparkle in your life

Always something new

It's the sparkle in your life
It's the sparkle in your life
It's the sparkle in your life---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
