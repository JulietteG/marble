Im sorry for everything
Oh everything Ive done

Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that Im looking for an empty space
Oh Im wishing youre here
but Im wishing youre gone
I cant have you and Im only gonna do you wrong

Oh Im going to mess this up
Oh this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

Im sorry for everything
Oh everything Ive done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through
Everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
when I keep saying that Im looking for a
way to escape
oh Im wishing I had what Id taken for granted
I cant help you when Im only gonna do
you wrong

In the meantime can we let it go
At the roadside that
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bayside
Where you used to show
In the moonlight
Where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

And theres always time to change your mind
Oh theres always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away---
