If you love somebody
Better tell them while theyre here cause
They may just run away from you

Youll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

Ive had the highest mountains
Ive had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not til you prove it

Now take it in but dont look down

Cause Im on top of the world, ay
Im on top of the world, ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
Ive been waiting to smile, ay
Been holding it in for a while, ay
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
Im on top of the world.

Ive tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldnt have cause
Ive traveled all this way for something

Now take it in but dont look down

Cause Im on top of the world, ay
Im on top of the world, ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
Ive been waiting to smile, ay
Been holding it in for a while, ay
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
Im on top of the world.

Cause Im on top of the world, ay
Im on top of the world, ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
Ive been waiting to smile, ay
Been holding it in for a while, ay
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know its hard when youre falling down
And its a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now. ---
