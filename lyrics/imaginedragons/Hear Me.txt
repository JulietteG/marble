Try to hear my voice
 You can leave, its your choice 
Maybe if I fall asleep, I wont breathe right 
Maybe if I leave tonight, I wont come back 

I said it before, I wont say it again 
Love is a game to you, its not pretend 
Maybe if I fall asleep, 
I wont breathe right 

Can nobody hear me?
 Ive got a lot thats on my mind 
I cannot breathe 
Can you hear it, too?

You kiss and you kiss 
And you love and you love 
Youve got a history list, and the rest is above 

And if youre warm, you cant relate to me 
From the floor to the floor 
And the sky to the sky 
Youve got to love and adore and the rest is awry 

And if youre warm, then you cant relate to me 
I said it before, I wont say it again 
Love is a game to you, its not pretend 
Maybe if I fall asleep, I wont breathe right, right, right? 

Can nobody hear me? 
Ive got a lot thats on my mind
 I cannot breathe 
Can you hear it, too? 

Leave your shoes at the door, baby 
I am all you adore, lately
 Come with me and we will run away 

Can nobody hear me? 
Ive got a lot thats on my mind 
I cannot breathe 
Can you hear it, too? 

Can nobody hear me? 
Ive got a lot thats on my mind 
I cannot breathe 
Can you hear it, too?---Lyrics submitted by Ada Barach.
