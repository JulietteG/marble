In the morning light let my roots take pride
Watch me from above like a vicious ghost
They dont see me come, who can blame them?
Never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why

I wont fall asleep
I wont fall asleep

Higher, dont let em know were coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher

From your slender dream see the morning dew
Sink into the soul, watch the water boil
They wont feel it like who can blame them?
They never know if they see me fly, so I never have to run

I wont fall asleep
I wont fall asleep

Higher, dont let em know were coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher

Nobody else, nobody else
Nobody else, you take me higher
Nobody else, you take me higher
Nobody else, you take me higher
Nobody else..

Higher, dont let em know were coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher

Higher, dont let em know were coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher---Lyrics submitted by Christopher Redd.
