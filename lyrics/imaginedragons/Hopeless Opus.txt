Hey Mr. cage man let me get a fresh breath 
Cherry bomb head strong I could fake my own death 
Hey Mr. fate man shuffle me a ninth life 
Ive been wrong, go long 
throwing me a sharp right 
Its not a picture perfect life 
Not what I had in mind 
Let me write my own line 

Ive got this place 
That Ive filled with empty space 
Oh Im trying not to face what Ive done 
My hopeless opus 
Im in this race and Im hoping just to place 
Oh Im trying not to face whats become of me 
My hopeless opus 

Hey Mr. safe man hustle me an okay 
I could slide take a dive take it for the home team 
Hey Mr. postman slip me one more green note 
Ive been low hit the floor looking just to make broke 
Its not a picture perfect life 
Not what I had in mind 
Let me write my own line 

Hey Mr. 
Hey Mr. 
Hey Mr. cage man 
Cherry bomb 
Let me get 
Cherry bomb 
Cherry bomb---
