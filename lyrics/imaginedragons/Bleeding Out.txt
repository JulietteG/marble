Im bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
Ill bleed out for you
So I peel my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you (for you)

When the day has come
But Ive lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

Cause Im bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
Ill bleed out for you
So I peel my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you (for you)

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel theyre not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

Cause Im bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
Ill bleed out for you
So I peel my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you (for you)

Im bleeding out for you (for you)
Im bleeding out for you (for you)
Im bleeding out for you (for you)
Im bleeding out for you

Cause Im bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
Ill bleed out for you
So I peel my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you (for you) ---
