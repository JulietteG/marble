First comes the blessing of all that youve 
dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and 
rings
Only at first did it have its appeal 
but now you cant tell the false from the real
Who can you trust, who you can you trust

When everything, everything, everything you 
touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch 
turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands 
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have is turning stale and 
its cold
Oh you no longer feel when your hearts 
turned to gold
Who can you trust, who can you trust?

When everything, everything, everything you 
touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch 
turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold

Im dying to feel again 
Oh anything at all
but oh I feel nothing, nothing, nothing, not so

When everything, everything, everything you 
touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch 
turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold

Believe
I want to believe...

When everything, everything, everything you 
touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch 
turns to gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold---
