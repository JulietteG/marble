Just one more time for our goal
I'll let you know
And all this time 
I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

Stars can only be visible in the darkness
Fear is always changing in
And I I I can poison these eyes

Nobody can save you now
The king is down
It's do or die
Nobody can save you now
Nowhere safe
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die

Nobody can save you now
The king is down
It's do or die
Nobody can save you now
Nowhere safe
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die

Just one more time for our goal
I'll let you know
And all this time 
I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now---
