I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Hate is gone and money's tight
This little home that I'm living in

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
'Cause doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

What is with you?
I've never seen this side of you
What is with you?
I've never seen this side of you

We are all living 'til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling

I don't think it's quite insane
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
'Cause doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

What is with you?
I've never seen this side of you

We are all living 'til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling

We are all living 'til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling

We are all living 'til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
Now let me hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling---Lyrics submitted by Adina Semmens.
