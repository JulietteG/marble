You got me feeling like a pantomime
That why I only love you part time
It's just a matter of
Oh don't touch me
Don't you don't you touch me no more

You got me feeling like a paradigm
Your friends all want me in the mean time
Its just a matter of
Oh don't touch me
Don't you don't you touch me no more

Hey you've got all the money honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

You left me baby for another man
He's looking tall he's got a deep tan
I'ts just a matter of 
Oh don't touch me
Don't you don't you touch me no more

Hes got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cell phone
Its just a matter of
Oh don't touch me
Don't you dare touch me no more

Hey you've got all the money honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey you think all your friends are funny
well all your friends are way overfed

If you've got to go I wont stop you
Hear me singing you 
Glory glory hallelujah
You've made it easy for the both of us

If he's got a chest and some arms
You'll hear me singing you 
glory glory hallelujah
You've made it easy for the both of us

Hey you've got all the money honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

If you've got to go I wont stop you
Hear me singing you 
Glory glory hallelujah
You've made it easy for the both of us

If hes got a chest and some arms 
You'll hear me singing you
Glory glory hallelujah
You've made it easy for the both of us---Lyrics submitted by christalfire.
