I see the colours of the world they're rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging all
I think a little about a lot I'm introverted
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
Bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life 
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight 
This is our destination

Take me back to ninety one
I had a love life there, it's a loaded gun allright
I see the colours of the world they're rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but are changing
All of our energy
Bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life 
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight 
This is our destination

Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh

We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life 
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight 
This is our destination

Oooh Oooh Oooh (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
