When you stopped me in my tracks
The very first time
Had me going
The very first night
Waved goodbye, your keys locked inside
I knew you were the only one
With your crazy voice mails and your spotted toes
Weight from the earth and anyone knows
With your daddy's eyes and your grandma's gun
You're the only one
That little crook in your teeth and your 5 inch feet
When you tie your hair up in the bun
Whatever the weather, we'll stick together forever
'Cause you're the only one

Seven billion in the world, baby
I only wanna be with you
I don't want another girl, baby
I only wanna be with you
Waiting for you all my life
I can't wait another night
Seven billion in the world
And you're the only I want, it's true
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I only wanna be with
Only wanna be with
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Only wanna be with you

And you put too much salt on everything you eat
Wake up freezing 'cause I stole the sheets
And you talk with the wild, pop your gum in your sleep
You're the only one
And you worry about your dad on his motorbike
The way your voice cracks when you wanna fight
And you never wanna sleep so I talk all night
To the only one
Turn up the lights and hold me tonight
We don't need the sun
Whatever the weather, we'll stick together forever
'Cause you're the only one

You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Searched the whole world for a while
Looking for your pretty eyes
Seven billion in the world baby
I only wanna be with you
I don't want another girl baby
I only wanna be with you---
