I not gonna give up all of this
Ain't no room left for me to fly

If our love is a hurricane
Of broken phones and broken doors
Baby, you know I can't stand the rain
That it lift us off the floor

Use your words just like a criminal
Cut like a bullet from a gun
That shadow found me years ago
I've been bought, I've been shot with the lawless love---
