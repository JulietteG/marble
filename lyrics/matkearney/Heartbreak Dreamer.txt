I was turning nineteen, on a cold December night
Burning like kerosine for nearly half of

And as I pack my bags and headed to a foreign land
One way ticket on a one way plane
Laying my head down to home each night
The same devil's calling that same old fight
'Cause this one's for little sons living in the middle of
Where they covered from a halfway rush of love
This ones for those first prayers to heaven
On a road that seems never ending

For all the heartbreak dreamers waiting for light
Looking for just one reason to get through the night
Every little lost believer caught in the fire
All the heartbreak dreamers gonna be alright
Everybody sing

I was turning twenty five in a city that don't sleep
Was feeling only half alive to the dreams that I keep
And I kept on waiting, only she's waiting for me
You burning down lane on a quarter tank of pain with soles off your feet
And you've been waiting
So this one's for Mike still waiting for his wife
This one's for grandma losing the love of her life
This ones for those---
