She said I don't know if I've ever really
Have ever really trusted anybody
And ain't nobody ever really know me
Except the ghosts that come each night to haunt me
When there's so much that I still can't remember
so many memories I can't surrender
The kind of cold that comes under your sweater
Cuts to the bone like you're alone forever
Like a stolen car tonight running
On a road with a broken lines
Running all the changing lights
To hide what's fallen from your eyes

There's got to be more than just this flesh and bone
Tell me on more than just the scars I've known
It's all that we've loved is all we've ever owned
We're more than one, more than one heart beating alone
More than one heart beating alone

Last night I felt like I was going crazy
I kept on hearing all those words replaying
Sometimes it feels like nothing is ever changing
Stuck like Groundhog Day in the wars were waging
And when it hurts so bad that she wanted to die
Maybe we crash into each other to feel alive
When the ones you love are the ones that always say goodbye
The things you hate you do for no good reason why

Like a stolen car tonight running
On a road with a broken lines
Running all the changing lights
To hide what's fallen from your eyes

Give me one reason one to believe
And tell me there's something left to believe in
To the rhythm of the heart, to the rhythm of one heart
I'm still chasing cracks in the pavement
Looking for the ghosts that left me waiting
To the rhythm of one heart, to the rhythm of the heart---
