Here we go at it 3 years later
will youhelp me dream it all up again
tired of the same song everyones singin
rather be lost with you instead
wont you come around here,
come around here anymore
dragin my fears dragin my fears out the door

(chorus)
all i have (x3)
well you know its yours
every breath every step every moment im lookin for
all i have (x3) is yours
and you watch
my heart break a little bit more (x3)

is it cold yet in new york city
round here the trees been blowin our breath
everyones talkin bou change on the airways
and i still get you all my pret
wont you come around here come around here anymore
dragin my fears dragin my fears out the door

chorus

lord im still tryin to dis my heartache
wont you pick up a song rom the fall
cripple in the corner off in darkness
just to crack light in it all

chorus---Lyrics submitted by maddie.
