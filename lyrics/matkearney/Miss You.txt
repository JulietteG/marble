Close my eyes and put it in the picture
Carve your name in my heart like a scripture
Said darling it's the way we fall
The day we fall begins

Every time I break these chains
Every time I feel this way
Nothing really ever change
I'm gonna miss you
Even if I'm in the dark
Even if the world's apart
I can feel your beating heart
I'm gonna miss you

Now I'm driving
Found alone with you tonight
Somewhere flying
High up in the clouds
We were breezing
First no light would ever sing
I still believe in
Every thing I dream it would be

And I saw headlights shining in the window
Looking down at the phone that will never call
Look darling, it's the way we fall
It's the way we fall

Last night I dream you were waiting
On a corner in the coat that you gave me
Said darling we were born alive
We were born again---
