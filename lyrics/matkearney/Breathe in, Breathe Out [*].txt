Breath in breathe out
Tell me all of your doubt
If everybody bleeds this way
just the same
Breath in breathe out
Move on and break down
If everyone.. goes away
I will stay
We push and pull,
and I fall down sometimes
I'm not letting go,
you hold the other line

Cause there is a light
In your eyes, in your eyes
Hold on, hold tight
From out of your sight
Everything keeps moving on, moving on,
Hold on hold tight
Make it throught another night
Everyday there comes the sun with the dawn
We push and pull, and I fall down sometimes
I'm not letting go, you hold the other line

Cause there is a light
In your eyes, in your eyes
There is a light
In your eyes, in your eyes

Breath in and breath out (x4)

Look left, look right
to the moon and the night
Everything under the stars in your arms
There is a light
In your eyes, in your eyes
There is a light (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
