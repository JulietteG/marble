'Cause it was Bell Biv DeVoe playing on the radio
And I have Wu Tang Clan living in my stereo
Mama said we're 6th generation Oregonians
I was rocking in Jordans with reflected tongues
Two kids with Metsmit living down in their souls
They say what gets scarred when you're young
Stays there when you're old
So misunderstood they say, you're up to no good
And now we're trying our best to start it over again

If I had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family's a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

For crying out loud I wanna know
How the waves keep on crashing down the doors
Feel the weight of the world and they keep on bringing more
If it's just you and me on the floor
Go back and come in I'll drive us home
Like we were just kids
Just, just, just kids
Just, just, just kids
Like we were just kids
Just, just, just kids
Just, just, just kids

Bob Marley was painted on my high school walls
But I just disappeared into the darkroom hall
Never thought I'd ever make it quite this far
Teacher put up my photographs
Say "son you'll be a star"
It was smoking mirrors running down through my veins
I kept on running downtown, running from God's grace
Every morning I'd climb back through loose window panes
And tried my best to ride it out over instrumental tapes

If I had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family's a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

For crying out loud I wanna know
How the waves keep on crashing down the doors
Feel the weight of the world and they keep on bringing more
If it's just you and me on the floor
Go back and come in I'll drive us home
Like we were just kids
Just, just, just kids
Just, just, just kids
Like we were just kids
Just, just, just kids
Just, just, just kids

I can feel it in the way we try
I can feel it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids

I can hear it in the way we try
I can hear it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids

I can hear it in the way we try
I can hear it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids

I can hear it in the way we try
I can hear it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids---
