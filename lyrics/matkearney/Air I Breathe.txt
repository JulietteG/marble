Born and raised under the rain and a Western Wind
Felt the weight trying to live up to they say I am.
Is it any wonder Shame comes calling my first name
Is there any question if I'm the one here left to blame

It's the same fight all over again
It's the same bite breaking in my skin
It's the same light when you let me in
You let me in you let me in.

You are the air I breathe
You are the song I bleed
You are the war that I can't win
This is my white flag in the wind
Every word you speak
Is the air I breathe.

I feel like a contender
Bringing my fist to pistol war
I surrender that I need you now and you've loved me more
It's like an ocean over my head and I'm under the light
In slow motion tonight

It's the same fight all over again
It's the same bite breaking in my skin
It's the same light when you let me in
You let me in you let me in.

You are the air I breathe
You are the song I bleed
You are the war that I can't win
This is my white flag in the wind
Every word you speak
Is the air I breathe.

I hear you calling my name out name out
Is there any other way now
I hear you calling my name out name out
I got nothing left to say now say now

You are the air I breathe
You are the song I bleed
You are the war that I can't win
This is my white flag in the wind
Every word you speak
Is the air I breathe.---
