Because I'm moving on
Letting go
Forget the past and give it up the ghost
All we are is fading stars
Life's too short to stay where are

Forget and let it move on
Tell me that you're going to make this number
Forget and let it move on

Baby, I'm broken
Baby, it's the faith
Baby, it's the moment
She said I had changed
When thirteen years ago
Like I didn't know you at all---
