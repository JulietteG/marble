War...

Do you hear revolution's call?
Time to fight our own denial
Warmongers keep us locked in fear
Invoke the past, a moment of tears

An ugly truth, put forth by our youth
Under the threat of a patriotic brute
So use your rage
It is a weapon we all must engage
Let trumpets sound our call
Or by their lives we will fall

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing
Sing revolution's song
(When they say die)
Die for America

War!

They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money

So fight as one
Without a fucking gun
Words are the bullets to this revolution
Use your pain
The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze
Excess will pave their path
The winds of change our bloodbath

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing
Sing revolution's song
(When they say die)
Die for America

Power
And prejudice
Actions they use to pit against
Terror
Insurgency
Words used to scare confomity
It's propoganda
It's their hypocrisy
Free to choose our own slavery
Suffer, humanity

Fight

So fight for all that you love
Scream, choking with foot open throat
Blind star spangled eyes
Death, no more the truth you will hide

No, No

So how do they sleep,
While our mothers weep?
They're selling our souls
And our blood for oil

Our generation can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed of corrupt nations
Have no shame
You're not alone in thinking this is fucking insane

Rise up and take your stand 
You curl the fingers of your hand

I don't know what to do
Cause I don't have the answers
With every ounce of strength
I've gotta fight this cancer
Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground
I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So far from fucking perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse
There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter

War...

Clenching the fists of dissent

Lies...

Clenching the fists of dissent

Fear...

Clenching the fists of dissent

Changed

Clenching to hope---Lyrics submitted by nick.
