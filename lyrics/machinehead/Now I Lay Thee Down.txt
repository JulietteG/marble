I want to know
How it feels
When we die
Can you take me under?

[Chorus:]
Dream over
Grieve no more
And breathe one last time
Now I lay thee down

She watched me leave
Me bleeding
On the floor
As she takes me under

[Chorus]

Godless mimicry
White lights cemetery
Flashes of the angel's ivory wings
Images so many broke dreams
Of pain
Terror
Fear
Crippling

Follow the light into the tunnel
Or will it end up in a black hole?
Follow the light into the tunnel,
Dead in its end

What is love?
What is murder?
Within the eye of the beholder

[Solo: Demmel, Flynn, Demmel, Flynn]

What have I done?
I've gone and killed the only one I love
How could I do this?
I'm screaming at God
Why do you curse me?
Fuck it, load it, sever the day

[Chorus]

Now I lay thee down,
Underground---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
