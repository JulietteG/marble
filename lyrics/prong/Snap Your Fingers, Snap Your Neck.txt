nothing breeds more contempt for this world
than memories now formed every moment
a new seed is grown to no reason the
trouble unfolds for the trials of today
i'm no jury really don't care how you feel 
the pleasant notion of miraculous change
drifts into multiple jeers 

CHORUS:
you want the good life
you break your back you snap your fingers
you snap your neck 

seconds drip thru my hands
washed of moments unborn all the spaces
between bleed a tribute to a sacrament
never exposed a message to the forces,
I've no pity don't know how thankful to feel expectations
of my daily bread gives me the hunger to steal

CHORUS:
you want the good life
you break your back you snap your fingers
you snap your neck 
you want the good life
you break your back you snap your fingers
you snap your neck 

instrumental:

CHORUS:
you want the good life
you break your back you snap your fingers
you snap your neck 
you want the good life
you break your back you snap your fingers
you snap your neck 

snap your fingers snap your neck
snap your fingers snap your neck
snap your fingers snap your neck
snap your fingers snap your neck---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
