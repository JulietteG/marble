You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby,
There was something missin'.
You should've known by the tone of my voice, maybe,
But cha didn't listen.

You played dead,
But you never bled.
Instead you laid still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'.

Even though I know all about those men,
Still I don't remember.
Cause it was us, baby way before then,
And we're still together.

And I meant, every word I said,
When I said that I love you,
I meant that I love you forever.

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you,
Cause it's the only thing I wanna do.
I don't wanna sleep,
I just wanna keep on loving you.

(Guitar Solo)

And I meant, every word I said,
When I said that I love you,
I meant that I love you forever.

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you,
Cause it's the only thing I wanna do.
I don't wanna sleep,
I just wanna keep on lovin' you.

Baby, I'm gonna keep on lovin' you,
Cause it's the only thing I wanna do.
I don't wanna sleep,
I just wanna keep on lovin' you.---Lyrics submitted by Naomi.
