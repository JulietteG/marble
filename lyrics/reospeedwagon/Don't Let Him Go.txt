So you figure that you've got him all figured out.
He's a sweet talkin' stud,
Who can melt a girl's heart with his pout.
He's the kind of lover that the ladies dream about.

(Oh, Yes he is.)

He's got plenty of cash, he's got plenty of friends.
He drives women wild,
then he drives off in a mercedes benz.
He's got a long wick, with a flame at both ends.

(He's Hot)

But don't let him go.
Just give him a chance to grow.
Take it easy, take it slow.
And don't let him go.

He makes you feel so angry, he makes you feel so sore.
The wait may be worth it,
But how can you wait anymore.
When you're wondering what you're waiting for.

(You said "I don't know")

But don't let him go.
Just give him a chance to grow.
Take it easy, take it slow.
And don't let him go.
Don't let him go.---Lyrics submitted by david meyer.
