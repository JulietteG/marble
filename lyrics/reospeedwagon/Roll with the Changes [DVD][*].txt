As soon as you are able
And I am willing
To make the break that we are on the brink of

My cup is on the table
My love is spilling
Waiting here for you to take and drink of

So if you're tired of the same old story
Oh turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes

Yeah, yeah, woo

I knew it hadda happen
Felt the tables turning
Got me through my darkest hour

I heard the thunder clapping
Felt the desert burning
Until you poured on me like a sweet sun shower

So if you're tired of the same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
oh, yeah

woo

So if you're tired of the same old story
Oh baby turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes

Baby 

Roll with the changes
Oh you know, you know, you know you got to

Keep on rollin' Oh yeah
Keep on rollin' 
Oh, roll with the changes

Keep on rollin' (Keep on rollin')
Oh yeah, (keep on rollin')
Oh, got to roll with the changes
Oh baby (keep on rollin')
Oh baby (keep on rollin')
Oh, you got to learn to roll with the changes
Got to, got to, got to, got to keep on rollin'
Got to keep on (keep on rollin')
Oh you got to learn to, got to learn to, got to learn to roll

Keep on rollin',  keep on rollin', ooooh, ooooh
Keep on rollin',  keep on rollin', ooooh, ooooh
Keep on rollin',  keep on rollin', ooooh, ooooh
Keep on rollin',  keep on rollin', ooooh, ooooh, ahhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Hugh.
