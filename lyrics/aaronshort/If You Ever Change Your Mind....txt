Sure I understand
Of course, I'll be fine
You had to change your plans,
Oh well, I'lL just change mine
But if it turns out bad
And if your nights get long
And if she makes you sad
No need, to be strong
(Chorus)
And if you ever change your mind
And find you miss those feelings that you left behind
We can give it one more try
Some magic place in time
If you ever change your mind

I guess I'd better go
You know I hate goodbyes
Let's not drag this out babe
I'll see ya 'round sometime
(Repeat Chorus)
(Bridge)
Go, don't look back
Let the heartachE pass
(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by ken.
