Sometimes we laugh
Sometimes we cry
Sometimes we fall
I dont know where you are
Or how you got so far from me

CHORUS:
Cos people make mistakes
Shame it makes your heart break
Theres nothing left to say
No promises to break
We all make mistakes
People make mistakes

You told me that youre lost
But at what cost to me
I know I was wrong
Theres only this song left to sing

CHORUS:
Cos people make mistakes
Shame it makes your heart break
Theres nothing left to say
No promises to break
We all make mistakes
People make mistakes

If only I could turn, turn, turn
Maybe I would learn, learn, learn
Instead Ill just burn, burn, burn
If only I could turn, If only I could turn

CHORUS:
'Cos people make mistakes
Shame it makes your heart break
Theres nothing left to say
No promises to break
We all make mistakes
People make mistakes---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
