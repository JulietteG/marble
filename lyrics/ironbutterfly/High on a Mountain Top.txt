Never knowing the world without you
Never knowing gone to live without you
Never knowing just where you come from
Never knowing gone be someone with you

High on a mountain top
where only I could see
I hold the love for you
And you would come to find
Whats upon my mind
Just a little the hole in my life

Never knowing how hard I love you
Never knowing if my hearts above you
Never knowing how hard we try
Never knowing if I live or die with you

High on a mountain top
where only I could see
I hold the love for you
And you would come to find
Whats upon my mind
Just a little the hole in my life --->x2

High on a mountain top
The hole in my life
High on a mountain top
The hole in my life
High on a mountain top---Lyrics submitted by Jim.
