When dreams grew black
I didn't want to see the light
Cross through hell in snow
Dreams were gone within yourself
Taught me to know what it's like
Don't shout it, stay
I don't want to let you down
Plead your cause
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down

Decompress and calm your head
Teach you not to rush
Turn them out, to see your words
Trust me, stay and stay
Overboard
I don't want to let you down
Overboard
I don't want to let you down
Crazy hell
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down---
