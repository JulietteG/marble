It was a close call,
Sitting in the back of the room with the beau you know
that they didnt know,
Closing on my black eyes, feel safe at times
Certain emblems tell me its time

Serpents in my mind, looking for your crimes
Everything changes
I dont want life to this time

You enjoy sucking on dreams,
so I will fall asleep
with someone other than you,
I had a thought, you would take me
Seriously and listen but

Serpents in my mind,
I am searching for your crimes
Everything changes, in time you'll stay, frozen in time
Garaging girls, controlling minds
You hold the mirror, to everybody else

Serpents in my mind, trying to forgive
Your crimes
Everyone changes, in time
I hope he changes, this time.---Lyrics submitted by awfawf.
