there he goes
i finally close the door
i turn the lock feeling more
confused than before

what gives?
you said that you would love more
now you're a coward, sure
then he rains in your eyes

surprise, he loves you.

well, well
i'm bad 
well, well, hell
i'm bad
at loving

he smiles.
he leaves me wanting more,
knowing that i gave less,
and knowing why.

time, time is what i would need,
full of myself, indeed.
just walk away.

surprise, look in his eyes, he loves me.

well, well, well,
i'm bad.
well, well, hell,
i'm bad
at loving.

trust.
you know that i trusted you,
but i cannot let you do
to just fall in.

try, wanting to try for you,
wanting to die for you,
dramatic things.

surprise.
he loved you.

well, hell, 
i'm bad
at loving.

well, well, hell,
i'm bad at loving.

all right.
all right, so i figure out
what i am all about,
or relate to.

love
is what i thought i could have,
but only i push away.
better watch for you.

surprise.
i miss you.

well, hell, 
i'm bad.

well, well, hell,
i'm bad at loving you.

surprise.
look in my eyes.---Lyrics submitted by Linnea.
