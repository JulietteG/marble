Yea, c'mon 
C'mon, yea, c'mon 
Let's take a trip but not of the physical 
Sense of direction on a kid who's artistical 
Through a gallery of thoughts, of course it's dope 
Pay it tough like the name on my rope 
Watch it be weary instead of steppin wit the boys 
A musical massacre of inadequate noise 
By the new authority 'cause of majority 
Of peers who hear will award superiority 
To those who know you knew now it's inedable 
I laid the track and it's simple unforgettable 
Time had hold me better than gold, I sold 
And in front of a group of soul is a new episode 
So like see if you can grab a pawn yet another one 
Take it to the everyday like it's done the son 
Words connected up to another degree 
And if an artist who planned it there, potrait of a masterpiece 
It's unquestionable 
The lyrice used, the D.O.C.'s a professional 
Nothing exquisite to prohibit you from listening up 
Crisp and clean that I'm only seven up 
I preside ill dippy dope to frantic to panic 
And just a man on a mission wit something more in the attic 
I'm just an ordinary, faring very few 
Do it to the mic, is the D.O. to the C., you 
Made the choice that doesn't need to pretend 
I'm on the extend, I know about the ?(elevator end)? 
But anytime between I'm spinning 
Play strong, write it like it never ending 
Keep creating while suckers are hating me now 
Keep the upper hand 'cause the respond is gonna plow 
No one can handle the physical torture 
I've been taking and no matter what, I'll support'cha 
Goals and dreams although is seems it won't come true 
All of that is up to you, yo 
But if you can't handle 
You need a check, 'cause rap's like a gamble 
Basically outspoken, keeping them choking on 
But you recall, yo, a helluva rap song 
Doing it forever together wit Dre, it will never cease 
Plenty of records like Potrait of a masterpiece 
Not an exceptionalist 
Set of teh norm, walking and holding my testicles 
?(swoon for a six)?, spell out what it means to be dope 
The D.O. to the C., they can't cope 
Deal the real, yo, it's better 'cause I had to be 
Better than any 'cause of majority 
Negative never, I'm all about a positive force if you recall 
It's the D.O.C. on the ball 
Rap much greater, Dre upon the fader 
Pump the bass and the pace 
Most like by the D.O.C and this is it 
'Cause when it's hype, then I feel that it's shit 
Word, never would I stop, I drop the beat I will 
Especialy when I have to kill 
I'm an annihilator, standing a full 6' 3 
And I really don't think you wanna deal wit me 
Potrait of a, 
Hold on Dre stop the beat, let me catch my breath 
(Dr. Dre) (ayo man, why ya stopping that was funky) 
To catch my breath 
(Dre) alright you got it (yea) kick it 
(The D.O.C) 
Strong blowing kisses to the wind 
The D.O.C. in fact to attack the wicky wack 
And take the rightful place at a rightful time 
The D.O. to the C. and it's mine 
Move, 'cause no one's gonna take the site
Doing the groove, why, 'cause it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. 
(Dr. Dre) 
Yea that's cool, let's go to the next record---
