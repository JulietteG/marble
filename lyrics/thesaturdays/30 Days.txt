I woke up in the morning
Felt so far away
Marks on my calendar
Don't hurry up the days
I wish I could speed up time
Till that moment you are mine
Subtract the distace
Fly in the speed of light
Crazy how I miss you
I'm hurting deep inside
I know you can feel this pain
But don't worry I'll be back again

Pretty soon I'll be coming home, home, home

30 days to us
30 days to love
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do
What I wanna do when I get to you
One month, four weeks, too many hours
Sunrise sun fall
I'm growing tired
30 days to love
30 days to love

Each day you're not here
Feels like a thousand years
Need a magician to make time disappear
Once you're near I won't let go
You're what I need and all I know

I can't wait to say I'm coming home, home, home

30 days to us
30 days to love
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do
What I wanna do when I get to you
One month, four weeks, too many hours
Sunrise sun fall
I'm growing tired
30 days to love
30 days to love

How it feels on day one
It doesn't get better till I have your love here forever
There's nothing I want more than you right now

30 days to us
30 days to love
Each second I'm here thinking what I wanna do
What I wanna do when I get to you
One month, four weeks, too many hours
Sunrise sun fall
I'm growing tired
30 days to love
30 days to love---
