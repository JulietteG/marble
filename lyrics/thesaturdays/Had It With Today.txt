Woke up this morning, feeling bad
Almost forgot what day I had
And there was something not quite right
Cos' everything was so against me I had no power to fight
And I was all alone, ohhh

I've had it with today
Wish it were yesterday
I can't wait for tomorrow
It's just one of those days
When nothing goes my way
At least I know it will past and elaspe

I've fallen sick and cannot smile
I'm hardening up inside (ooohhh)
Even the weather shows my pain (shows my pain)
If life were like this constantly I think I'd surely go insane
The pitch feeds my pain
To my veins, ohhh

I've had it with today
Wish it were yesterday
I can't wait for tomorrow
It's just one of those days
When nothing goes my way
At least I know it will past and elaspe

Oohh
If there were no lows, there'd be no highs
I'm glad now I've realised this low can only go
Higher and higher...

I've had it with today
Ohh-ohh, I've had it
It's just one of those days
Just one of those days, ohh-ohhh
I wish it were tomorrow

I've had it with today
Wish it were yesterday
I can't wait for tomorrow
It's just one of those days
When nothing goes my way
At least I know it will past and elaspe

Had it with today, had it with today
Oh-oh-whoa-oh-yeah-yeah
Just-just want to go

Had it with today, had it with today
Oh-oh-whoa-oh---Lyrics submitted by Asal morvaridi.
