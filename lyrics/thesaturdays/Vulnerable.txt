Verse
Felt the heat of the fire, caught a cold from the rain
Love just left me standing with nothing but a name
Pick my heart off the ground as I set to the sky
Never will I let somebody ever make me cry

But just a smile from you tore through my defences, it made no sense
Now I got to confide and tell the truth cos
Boy I'm left wide open, open
You won't leave me broken

Chorus
You think, but now I've seen it all
That my heart, should be indestructible
But your touch, made it impossible
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable
You think, but now I've seen it all
That my heart, should be indestructible
But your touch, made it impossible
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable

Verse
Thought that I was a fighter, one of loves sole survivors
Strong enough to keep my love from breaking me again
But you got my attention, wrote your name on my wall
So I've been laying, praying that you won't hurt me at all

I've been trying to play it cool but I've fallen and I'm all in
Now I've got to confide and tell the truth cos
Your arms are my protection now
Please take care of what you've found

Chorus
You think, but now I've seen it all
That my heart, should be indestructible
But your touch, made it impossible
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable
You think, but now I've seen it all
That my heart, should be indestructible
But your touch, made it impossible
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable

No you're not him, for all that it's worth
And I'm trying to love like I've never been hurt
But sometimes I know that I push you away
Cos underneath I'm still afraid

You think, but now I've seen it all (seen it all)
That my heart (my heart), should be indestructible
But your touch, made it impossible (yeah)
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable
You think, but now I've seen it all
That my heart (my heart), should be indestructible
But your touch (your touch), made it impossible
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable

I'm vulnerable, woooooh
Cos underneath it all, I'm vulnerable---Lyrics submitted by Balazs.
