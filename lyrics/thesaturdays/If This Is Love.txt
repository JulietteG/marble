Tell me baby in the night do you think of me?
(When you open up your eyes am I there?)
Are You standing by my window when I'm asleep
(Why you quiet when you know that I'm near?)

You know I love you
You thought I would leave you
But baby I've got you still
You think you want to be by yourself don't you?
But baby you never will

If this is love
Then I don't want to know what is

I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit or miss
We're both going to hurt
If this is love
(If this is love, yeaahh)

Are you picturing me lying across your bed?
(Are you thinking you were wrong to hurt me?)
I forgive you, I'll forget everything you said
(You will love, and you will not desert me)

You think I'm crazy
I'm not I'm your baby
I promise I'll always be
You think eventually this too will pass
But I promise I'll never leave

If this is love
Then I don't want to know what is
I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit or miss
We're both going to hurt
If this is love
(If this is love, if this is love)

Baby, baby if this is love
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
Baby, baby if this love I will not accept it and will not if this is

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is
I won't say another (no, no) word
If this is love (ooh ooh)
Then I'm about to hit on this
Were both going to get hurt if this is love

Then I don't wanna know what is (oh yeah)
I won't say another word (ooh)
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit on this
Were both going to get hurt if this is love
(If this is love, if this is love)
(Yeah)---Lyrics submitted by Bagel.
