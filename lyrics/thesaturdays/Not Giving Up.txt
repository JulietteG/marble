[Verse 1: Rochelle]
You took my heart from the dark
I'm falling hard
With you its like you kill the shade my burning pain

[Pre-chorus: Una]
I feel like something starting,
Starting playing in my head
And its beating loud
I feel like something starting,
starting walking on the edge
'Til we're crashing down

[Chorus: All]
Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open [2x]

If you tell me no I'm not giving up no
If you tell me no
I'm not giving up
No never giving up
Not giving up on love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]

[Verse 2: Mollie]
You're under my skin
Just stay right there
I want you there
Let the rest fade away
It's just you and me
What was meant to be

[Pre-chorus 2: Vanessa]
I feel like something starting,
Starting playing in my head
And its beating loud.
I feel like something starting,
Starting walking on the edge
'Til we're crashing down

[Chorus: All]
Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open [2x]

If you tell me no I'm not giving up no
If you tell me no
I'm not giving up
No never giving up
Not giving up on love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]

[After chorus: Frankie]
Got me on overload
I'll be your rock of gold
Can we get overdose on love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]

[Chorus: All]
Hit me so hard I don't know where
Starstruck up in the air
Got me got me with my eyes wide open [2x]

If you tell me no I'm not giving up no
If you tell me no
I'm not giving up
No never giving up
Not giving up on love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [2x]---
