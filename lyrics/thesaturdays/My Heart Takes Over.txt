What's it gonna be?
Are you willingly walking away from this?
What's it gonna take,
Can you really break this love?
Where you gonna go? 
Tell me do you know 
When does your heart emit?
'Cause if you leave baby,
Then leave 
Make up your mind
Before you shut the door

'Cause if there's a chance
We might've missed,
And if there's 
A ray of light in this,
Baby you should know that
This is where my heart
Takes over, over, over 

Going back in time 
You know that we 
Have tried to hard to
Let this fade
Almost disappeared
So we made it here,
Baby 
And look me in the eye
Promise I won't cry
This is your choice
To make
'Cause if you go
Baby then go
You change your mind 
I won't be here no more

'Cause if there's a chance
We might've missed,
And if there's 
A ray of light in this,
Baby you should know that
This is where my heart
Takes over, over
And there's a small
Piece left of us
Somewhere in the 
Battles we have lost
Baby look at me
'Cause this is 
My heart takes over,
Over, over

This is where my heart
Takes over, over
This is where my heart
Takes over, over 
This is where my heart
Takes over, over
This is where my heart
Takes over, over

What's it gonna be? 
Are you willing 
Walking away from this?

'Cause if there's a chance
We might've missed,
And if there's a 
Ray of light in this
Baby you should
Know that
This is where
My heart takes
Over, over 
And if there's a 
Small piece left of us
Somewhere in the battles 
We have lost
Baby look at me
'Cause this is where
my heart takes
Over, over, over

This is where
My heart takes
Over, over
This is where
My heart takes 
Over, over
This is where 
My heart takes
Over, over
This is where
My heart takes
Over, over---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Warren.
