Mollie:
Baby the harder you work the further you get with me, with me
I think you can, I think you can
Turn up prepared and make sure that you can keep up with me, with me
I think you can, I think you can

But be aware, I always get what I deserve
Keep your focus, keep your nerve
Ready, set, go

Chorus - together
Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on baby get to
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work

Vanessa:
I tend to get what I want to, are you starting to see, to see
I think you do, I think you do
It's time for you to step up if you wanna be with me, with me
I think you do, I think you do

Frankie:
But don't go slow
That is not the way we play
Slowly ain't my kinda game
Ready, set, go

Chorus - together
Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on baby get to
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work

Rochelle:
And it's up to you how far we take this
Yes it's up to you so take the lead
And it's up to you so tell me what I gotta sign
Waiting at the finish line baby
Ready, set, go

Chorus - together
Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on baby get to
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work

Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work (work)
You know you gotta work, work
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on baby get to
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work, work, work
Oooh yeah
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work
You know you gotta work, work---Lyrics submitted by Balazs.
