[Mollie:]

[All:]
You oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
I've got the bruises from the letting go
You said you only needed time to breathe
A little time alone
So who the hell is she?!

I don't need the lies
And I'm not the type of girl to fight

But, you oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
And I'm gonna throw them at your karma
At your karma
Throw them at your karma

[Mollie:]
Oh, I'm gonna throw them at your karma

[Una:]
I saw you yesterday, you were walking with her holding hands (yeah)
Man I hope you choke on some really hot coffee

What goes up now, what goes up
It's gonna come down, down, down
