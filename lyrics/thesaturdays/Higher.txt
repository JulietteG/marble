Im doing nothing
Cause at least im doing nothing wrong
And im gonna stay here on my own and turn up my telephone
If nothings gained nothings won
And you can tell them
Yeah you can say whatever i dont care eh
Then if you wanna play it cool i got news for you its getting hotter hotter in here
So when i speak listen this is my decesion and you keep on messing up the words
So when i speak listen cause you keep on pushing like i need permission to be heard
Im gonna lift to lift it higher
Im gonna lift to lift it higher
So when i speak listen this is my decesion and you keep on messing up the words

Im getting closer closer im moving nearer and nearer and i think you know
Cause i am sick of playing games and im not gonna say no names but you will know who to blame
So you can tell yeah you can go ahead pull a straight
Cause i am innocent myself and i dont not need your help im gonna do this do right
So when i speak listen this is my decesion and you keep on messing up the words
So when i speak listen cause you keep on pushing like i need permission to be heard
Im gonna lift to lift it higher
Im gonna lift to lift it higher
So when i speak listen this is my decesion and you keep on messing up the words
Im gonna lift to lift it (When you go higher i go higher)

Im gonna lift to lift it (Yeah you can try but i go higher)
Im gonna lift to lift it (The only thing boy you can do is listen so yh listen)
So when i speak listen this is my decesion and you keep on messing up the words
So when i speak listen cause you keep on pushing like i need permission to be heard
Im gonna lift to lift it higher
Im gonna lift to lift it higher
So when i speak listen this is my decesion and you keep on messing up the words---
