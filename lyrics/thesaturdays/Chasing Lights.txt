Go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, go on.

I've been doin' this my way, your way, our way, 
I can't make it work, when all I have is not enough.
I've been doin' all I can, my plan, your plan, and all I get is hurt. 
This game we're playin' has to stop.
I got you stuck in my head, and all you do is breakin' me, I can't continue takin this.
I try my best to understand, but I cannot make sense of you.
I got to take a stand and Baby,

I don't wanna waste another day, 
I don't wanna live my life this way. 
I'm tired. I just wanna lie back down and,
I don't wanna waste another night, 
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights so go on, go on, go on. 
Go on, go on, go on, bye bye.

I remember I met you, let you get your way in everything.
You took complete control of me.
I remember you lying, crying, trying to get away with it.
But now I know 'cos now I see.
I believed all that you said.
I never questioned any lies, I never opened up my eyes.
And all your words got me mislead.
But I am standing, I'm alive.
I never had you on my side and,

I don't wanna waste another day, 
I don't wana live my life this way.
I'm tired. I just wanna lie back down and,
I don't wanna waste another night,
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights so go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, go on, bye bye.

Bye bye oh.

I've been doin' this my way, your way, our way, it doesn't work,
when all I have is not enough.
I've been doin' all I can, my plan, your plan, and all I get is hurt. 

I don't wanna waste another day, 
I don't wana live my life this way.
I'm tired. I just wanna lie back down and,
I don't wanna waste another night,
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights so go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, go on, bye bye.

I don't wanna waste another day, 
I don't wana live my life this way (bye bye).
I'm tired. I just wanna lie back down and,
I don't wanna waste another night (bye bye),
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights so go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, go on, bye bye.

Mmmm bye bye.

Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, bye bye.---Lyrics submitted by Balazs.
