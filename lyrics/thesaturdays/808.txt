Rochelle (All):
Drop like an 808
(Drop like an 808)
Drop like an 808
Come drop that 808
Drop like an 808
(Drop like an 808)
Drop like an 808
(808)

Vanessa:
Heard you got a lot of records, lot of records
That I wanna hear
So you better play my song, play my song,
Or I'm outta here

Mollie (Frankie):
Won't wait for nothing, you should see me now
I started something, threw the old beat out
It ain't a problem if I like it loud
(So turn it up to amazing)
To amazing

Rochelle:
I'll make it drop like an 808
Hit like a heavy weight
Said you can handle it
Come drop that 808
Fight like an animal
Bang like a cannonball
Come drop that 808 (808)

Vanessa:
So tonight it's time to do it, do it, do it,
So loud all night, so do it, do it, do it,
Right now cause I am waiting for your love
So make it drop like an 808

Rochelle:
Get an amplifier, take it outside
Park out front, cause you got a sick ride
Only one night, it's you and I
Yeah you can run but you better not hide
Now I am in your face, give me that bass
Speakers' so hot, blowing out to space
So what's it gone take? tonight we'll wait, wait

Una (Frankie):
We'll wait for nothing, you should see me now
I started something, threw the old beat out
It ain't a problem if I like it loud
(So turn it up to amazing)
To amazing

Rochelle:
I'll make it drop like an 808
Hit like a heavy weight
Said you can handle it
Come drop that 808
Fight like an animal
Bang like a cannonball
Come drop that 808 (808)

Vanessa:
So tonight it's time to do it, do it, do it,
So loud all night, so do it, do it, do it,
Right now cause I am waiting for your love
So make it drop like an 808

Una:
Like an 808

Vanessa:
So tonight it's time to do it, do it, do it,
So loud all night, so do it, do it, do it,
Right now cause I am waiting for your love
So make it drop like an 808

Rochelle:
So tonight it's time to do it, do it, do it,
So loud all night, so do it, do it, do it,
Right now cause I am waiting for your love
So make it drop like an 808---Lyrics submitted by Callum Patterso.
