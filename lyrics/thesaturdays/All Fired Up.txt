Blow my mind

Blow my, blow my,blow my,blow my
Blow my mind DJ blow my mind

I put my head against the speakers
Singing blow my mind

Put my head to the speakers
Singing blow my mind

All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
I feel alive, I feel alive

All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel alive

We make the party super naughty
Dancin' on the ball
We're dancin' on the ball
We make the party super naughty
Dancin' on the ball
D-Dancin' on the ball

We're all outta mo

Outta mo, outta mo, mo,mo,mo,mo

We're all outta mo

So getcha claws out
Getcha getcha claws out

All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
I feel alive, I feel alive

All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive
All fired up and I feel alive

We're so close to the edge of disire
Feel so hot hot got that fire

We're so close to the edge of disire
Feel so hot hot got that fire

We're so close to the edge of disire
Feel so hot hot got that fire
We're so close to the edge of disire
