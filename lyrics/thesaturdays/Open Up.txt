i didn't say it but i meant to tell you
i didn't call but i was just about to
i know you're mad and thinking where have i been
i know it's five am but i can explain
i lost my jacket had no credit on my phone
i was worried about you here alone
i tried to babe, i couldn't get a taxi
i' really tired, just wanna crawl in next to you

and i'm sorry that i'm so late
and im sorry i'm in this state, baby
i'll make it up to you, baby

chorus
oh baby open the door
open up, open up
i promise never no more
open up, open up
i will be a good girl
good girl
i will be a good girl
good girl
so baby let me back in
open up, open up
don't make me ask you again
open up, open up
i will be a good girl
i ain't sleepin on the damn floor
so now open up the damn door
damn door

i hear the tv, so i know you're in there
you wanna punish me, but this is not faif
i pay the rent and do the same things you do
i lost the keys and if you keep this up, i will

find away to knock the door down
i'm not playin
unlock the door now, baby
yeah, i'll call the police, baby

chorus

ooh, yeah
open up, open up
hmm, oh
open up, open up
i ain't sleepin on the damn floor
so now open up the damn door

and i'm sorry i'm in this state, baby
i'll make it up to you, baby

chorus

open up, open up
i ain't sleepin on the damn floor
so now open up the damn door
damn door, dan door
