Oh, yeahhh, mmmm

Lettin' you go, is pretty damn difficult
'Cause there was a time I would be for you
What you need from me

I would do what, whatever to be rollin' with you
And you know
I took it as far as I can go
So I'm gonna lay it out right for you
You're not good to me

I know, I've bin
Blind, but I have opened my eyes
And I see just what you are
Not for me, I don't know why
I wanted you
I don't want you
I deny, oh

All that you did
And all that you didn't
All that you said
And all that you wouldn't
Deny, I deny it
Defy, everythin'
Oh, all that we were
And all that we called up
All that you are
And all that you made up
Defy, I defy it
Deny, everythin'
You are
And, everythin' we were
And, everythin' you are
And, everythin' we were
Ooh

You took your time
Well baby you should take up all of mine
So when I say you should leave
Don't question me
When I'm tellin' you

I don't want you, hidin' up my mind anymore

I don't want you
You can go
Leave my keys
And close the door
I don't need somebody like you
I deny, oh, I deny!

All that you did
And all that you didn't
All that you said
And all that you wouldn't
Deny, I deny
Defy, everythin'
Oh, all that you were
And all that you made up
All that we were
And all that we called up
Defy, I defy it
Deny, everythin'
You are
And, everythin' we were
And, everythin' you are
And, everythin we were
Ooh

Don't tell me
You never thought that we would come to this
Standin' here
Givin' up, all that we have been
Woah, and don't blame me!
This is not about what I have done
I've done more
I could do
Still we fought
Still you try me, baby

I deny!
(Woooo!)

(All that you did
And all that you didn't
All that you said
And all that you wouldn't
Deny, I deny it
Defy, everythin', oh!)

I deny it!

All that you were
And all that you made up
(Ohh, woahh!)
All that we were
And all that we called up
Defy, I defy it
(Wooo!)
 I deny, everythin'!
Ohh!

All that you did
And all that you didn't
All that you said
And all that yu wouldn't
(Woah!)
Deny, I deny it
I defy, everythin!
Ohh!
All that you were
And all that you made up
All that we were
And all that we called up
Defy, I defy it
I deny, everythin'
You are
And, everythin' we were
And, everythin' you are
And, everythin' we were

Ooooh, woah, I deny!---
