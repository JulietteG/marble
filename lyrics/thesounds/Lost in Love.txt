Everybody gets a little lost, sometimes
When you feel your time is running out
You know your love has stalled
When you feel alone and dreams from your younger years
Are telling you what's gone
Then ask yourself why people fall apart
'cause they don't realize that something just ain't right
When you lay down on your pillow at home tonight
You got to realize your holding on to something that ain't right

[Chorus]
I believe in this fire burning inside of me
You're never alone but you're always on your own
Lost in love and desire, never again
I promised myself I'd be searching for someone new

Smothered by his words
he's selling freedom that you can afford
To everyone but yourself
You're down on luck tonight
You're down, down, down there's nowhere left
To turn cause now you're all alone
Standing on the outside looking in
That is when I realize, his love don't mean a thing

[Chorus]

When you feel your troubles closing in
You got to realize you're holding on to something that ain't right
Oh, oh

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Jimmy.
