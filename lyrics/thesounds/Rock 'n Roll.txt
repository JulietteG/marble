1, 2, 3, 4
No, I want more
5, 6, 7
It's not OK
How come you taste so good?
This time I'm really hooked

It's half past ten, it's getting late
But the night is young and I can't wait
You know I like it loud
You should know me by now

Something sweet or something strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like boy need girl and girl need boy
Got a nasty habit called rock'n'roll

But you don't know what it's like
I've done things you've only dreamed about
More than once or twice
It keeps me up at night
Jump up, bubble up, what's in store?
Bryan looked for love, but I want more
I found another beat, there's no time for sleep

Something sweet and something strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like the girls in suits and those pretty boys
I gave my heart to rock'n'roll
To rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll (x2)
Oh, oh..

So you can call the police
I'm sorry 'bout my manners, but you see,
I'm a bit drunk as you can see
I bet you would like to undress me

Something sweet and something strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like boy need girl and girl need boy
Got a nasty habit called rock'n'roll

Something sweet and something strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like the girls in suits and those pretty boys
I gave my heart to rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll (x2)
Oh, oh..---Lyrics submitted by Ambrosia.
