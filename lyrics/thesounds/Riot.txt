Well high or low, our hearts are cold. Well that's the only life we know.
Well just because we don't trust, don't get down your knees and pray for us.
Yes we're young, but not that dumb, now we're ready like a loaded gun.

And Sid was not that vicious, he killed his little mistress. Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah.

Well high or low, our hearts are cold. Well that's the only life we know.
And just because we don't trust, don't get down your knees and pray for us.

And Sid was not that vicious, he killed his little mistress. Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
And Johnny's not that rotten, in case you have forgotten. Oi. Oi. Oi.

We're gonna start a riot, a riot, a riot.
Well now we're gonna start a riot, a riot, a riot.
Well now we're gonna start a.....

Well now we're gonna start a riot, a riot, a riot.
Well now we're gonna start a riot, a riot, a riot.
My my my sweet riot, yeah ooh ha ha
