Youre travelling along an empty highway.
How long will it last?
Whatever happened to fire baby?
Youre burning out too fast?
Theres something in your voice thats telling me
You dont care, anymway
Theres something in your eyes thats telling me
How you long, to belong.
Youve got to change your way
Youve been down this road before
You better change your way and get out, 
Out on the floor! 

You got to Shake Shake Shake! 
Shake! Shake! Shake! Shake! 
With somebody like me! Yeah! 
You got to Shake Shake Shake! 
Shake! Shake! Shake! Shake! 
With somebody like me! Yeah! 

Try to walk a mile in my shoes baby
And ou will know
If you have what it takes to make it
In the 21st Century show
Youve got to change your way
Youve been down, this road before
You better change your way, and get out, 
Out on the floor!
