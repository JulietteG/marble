Waking up, with sunbeams in my eyes
And the world outside, seems to pass me by
Embrace the land, where the ocean meets the sand
And emotion fades away, until you take my hand

I will be coming with you, tonight
Youre all that I want, youre all I have, youre all I need
Oh, oh you will be shining on me
Like a midnight sun youre the only one who can set me free
You will set me free

Still so young and anxious to be free
But now Im trapped inside, with all these memories
Theres more than this, if you open up your eyes
And then soon you will realize, those days are all gone

I will be coming with you, tonight
Youre all that I want, youre all I have, youre all I need
Oh, oh you will be shining on me
Like a midnight sun youre the only one who can set me free 

We need to find a way to live
Theres more to take, theres more to give
We try so hard, we try so hard and this time
Were on our way

I will be coming with you, tonight
Youre all that I want, youre all I have, youre all I need
Oh, oh you will be shining on me
Like a midnight sun youre the only one who can set me free
Like a midnight sun youre the only one who can set me free
Like a midnight sun, like a midnight sun, like a midnight sun---Lyrics submitted by lana.
