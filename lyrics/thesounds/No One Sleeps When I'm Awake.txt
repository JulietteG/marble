I'm watching people losing all of their faith,
Before they knew what they were looking for,
I swore I'd never ever do it again, till this day.
Words are all i have to give to you, 
You never seem to see it my way,
Standing in the shadows I hear, People say;
I've got confessions to make, listen up.
No-One sleeps when I'm awake.

The dreams I dream, the songs i sing for you,
There coming from my heart, 
Is my message getting through.
You know it hurt so bad, 
Just like I knew that i would,
But I'd do it again, do it again if i could.
Do it again if i could.

I dont think you know what its like, 
You should be careful what your wishing for,
And try to set your ego aside, you will find;
A false piece of mind, you fall behind, 
And everybody's getting tired of you
Standing in the shadows i hear, People say;
I've got confessions to make, listen up,
No-One sleeps when i'm awake.

The dreams I dream, the songs i sing for you,
There coming from my heart, 
Is my message getting through.
You know it hurt so bad, 
Just like I knew that i would,
But I'd do it again, do it again if i could.
Do it again if i could.

Hey, hey, hey.
I want you to know, know, know, know.
Hey, hey... hey!

*Instrumental*

Cos the dreams that i dream,
And the songs that i sing,
When i lost myself at a different meaning,
Shot down and close to mad, the door closed,
Hundreds of dreams taking place around you.
Hurt so bad just like i knew that it would,
But I'd do it again, do it again if i could.

But I'd do it again, do it again if i could.
I'd do it again... I;d do it again,
I'd do it again, I'd do it agian if i could.......---Lyrics submitted by Nick.
