[Verse 1:]
Beautiful God
Laying Your majesty aside
You reached out in love to show me life
Lifted from darkness into light
Oh

[Verse 2:]
King for a slave
Trading Your righteousness for shame
Despite all my pride and foolish ways
Caught in Your infinite embrace
Oh

[Chorus 1:]
And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compares to this love love love
Burning in my heart

[Verse 3:]
Saviour and Friend
Breathing Your life into my heart
Your word is the lamp unto my path
Forever I'm humbled by Your love
Oh

[Bridge:]
Take my life
Take all that I am
With all that I am I will love You
Take my heart
Take all that I have
Jesus how I adore You

[Chorus 2:]
And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compare to this love love love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
