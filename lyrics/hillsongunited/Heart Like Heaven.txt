Holy
No measure knows your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first

If you sought perfection
I'd die tryin' to reach it
But this broken heart is all you want

Singin' holy
Heart like heaven
Singin' holy
God almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singin' holy is your name
Singin' holy is your name

Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singin' holy is your name
And if it lifts you higher
Burn in me your desire
A passion worthy of your name

Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singin' holy is your name
And if it lifts you higher
Burn in me your desire
A passion worthy of your name

And I'll throw my weakness
Into your greatness
If this broken heart is all you want

Singin' holy
Heart like heaven
Singin' holy
God almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singin' holy is your name

Singin' holy
Heart like heaven
Singin' holy
God almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singin' holy is your name
Singin' holy is your name

You are worthy of all praise
You are worthy of all praise
For you are worthy
Jesus saviour
You are worthy
King forever
Hear my soul cry out
Singin' holy is your name---
