A thousand times I've failed 
still your mercy remains
And should i stumble again still I'm caught in your grace

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame

My heart and my soul I give you control 
Consume me from the inside out Lord
Let justice and praise, become my embrace to love you from the inside out

Your will above all else, me purpose remains 
the art of losing myself in bringing you praise 

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame

My heart and my soul, Lord I give you control
Consume me from the inside out Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace
To love you from the inside outt

Everlasting, Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame 
and the cry of my heart is to bring you praise 
From the inside out, O my soul cries out

My soul cries out to you
My soul cries out to you
to you, to you 

My heart and my soul, Lord i give you control 
Consime me from the inside out Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace 
To love you from the inside out

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending,  Your glory goes beyond all fame
and the cry of my heart is to bring you praise 
form the inside out, O my soul cries out

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise
form the inside out, O my soul cries out
From the inside out, O my soul cries out
From the inside out, O my soul cries out.---Lyrics submitted by Sydni Gilbert.
