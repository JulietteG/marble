If I could break away half of all your pain
I'd take the worst of it and carry you like you carry me
You say that you're alright when tears are in your eyes
We're strong enough for this and I need you
It's okay that you need me
So put your armor on the ground tonight
Cause everyone's got to come down sometime

You don't have to be Superman
You don't have to be Superman
You don't have to hold the world in your hands
You've already shown me that you can
Don't have to be Superman

I know I've been gone too much
We talk about me too much
I'm selfish and distracted
But I'm here, I'm here and listening
And It's just you and me and these four walls
And we are only human after all

You don't have to be Superman
You don't have to be Superman
You don't have to hold the world in your hands
You've already shown me that you can
Don't have to be Superman

And oh
Rest your eyes now, take my hand
Even heroes fall down now and then
You can let it go

You don't have to be Superman
You don't have to be Superman
You don't have to hold the world in your hands
You've already shown me that you can
Don't have to be Superman
You don't have to be Superman---
