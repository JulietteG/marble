Let's meet up far away
Where astronauts and gravity
Have opened up the atmosphere
We'll be so safe up here
Navigating the space, we'll create our own star
And I'll name it after you
We'll be so calm up there, we'll fly around with the quiet air
The sun will bring us 'round again, inhaling and orbiting
Our great planet will fit on the tip of your thumb
You'll say I finally see how time stops
And everything that hurts us drops off

I'll be what you want when everything is gone
Let the world disappear, there are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find

I know it's safe from being called out or evaluated
And people change on a whim, so cue the violence
Let's go rescue a planet that's been thrown away
You'll name it after me
Cause after all we're only one triumphant bang away
From resting in infinity or darkness or some brighter place
Let's not waste one more second on caring about
Trying to figure out what looks right
Cause that can't take away that you're mine

I'll be what you want when everything is gone
Let the world disappear, there are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find
I'll be what you want when everything is gone
Let the world disappear, there are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find

Mine, suddenly the stars got flash light
Universe will make your eyes shine
Can't you feel away that time stops?
Everything that hurts drops off

Now I'll be what you want when everything is gone
Let the world disappear, there are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find
I'll be what you want when everything is gone
Let the world disappear, there are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find---
