I'm turning you up; I'm turning you on
Your head's saying "danger, danger," but your heart must be drunk
And I know you don't settle and I know you're not weak
But I think you can't help it, help it, when it comes to me, ooh

I really got a hold on you
You're begging me for more
You never seen nobody do the things I do before
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah
Yeah, I drive you crazy and your heart's about to break
You're begging me for more; see, don't know how much I can take
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah

Tonight I'm so cold and I'm calling you back
But tomorrow we'll cuddle, cuddle, my legs in your lap (you know it)
And your friends try to warn you: "she'll tear you apart"
"She's nothing but trouble, trouble
She's playing you hard"

I really got a hold on you
You're begging me for more
You never seen nobody do the things I do before
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah
Yeah, I drive you crazy and your heart's about to break
You're begging me for more; see, don't know how much I can take
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah

Baby don't worry, I'm sugar and sweet
Baby don't worry, I'm good as can be
Baby don't worry, I'm sugar and sweet
Baby don't worry, I'm good as can be

I'm singing hallelujah when you touch me
Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley
Coming home to all my clothes out on the street
Five minutes later asking me where we eating
Makin' me feel good when you put me on my knees
Love me like you should and you make me wanna scream Hallelujah; can't win
I don't wanna lose you; all in

I really got a hold on you
You're begging me for more
You never seen nobody do the things I do before
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah
Yeah, I drive you crazy and your heart's about to break
You're begging me for more; see, don't know how much I can take
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah

I really got a hold on you
You're begging me for more
You never seen nobody do the things I do before
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah
Yeah, I drive you crazy and your heart's about to break
You're begging me for more; see, don't know how much I can take
Singing hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah---
