We threw words like they were sharp knives
Fell like we tripped over a landmine
You said we lost love
You made your mind up
And I just got quiet, my body went numb

And I pretend that I can handle it and if I hold my head up, I won't drown
Can't let go, you're like the chemical, you're racing through me
My heart just pounds, pounds, pounds...

It's getting louder and louder
Every time I think about you, about you
I'll be better off without you, without you
I wish my heart would stop, I wish my heart would stop
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Beating me up

You've moved on, I know I should too
My cuts are all gone, my pain feels brand new
Who turned the lights down? Who took my flashlight?
Why does my heart sound like it might burst tonight?

It's getting louder and louder
Every time I think about you, about you
I'll be better off without you, without you
I wish my heart would stop, wish my heart would stop
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
I wish my heart would stop
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
I wish my heart would stop

I won't let you get the best of me
How'd my heart become my enemy?
I won't let you get the best of me
How'd my heart become my enemy?

(Beating me up, beating me up)
(Beating me up, beating me up)

It's getting louder (louder, louder) every time I think about you (about you, about you)
I'll be better off without you (without you, without you)
I wish my heart would stop
I wish my heart would stop
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Beating me up
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Whoa, whoa
Wish my heart would
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Wish my heart would stop
Beating me up

Beating me up---
