Hey my fists are tight and I'm afraid
Cause I cannot, I cannot explain
Your heart is like a hurricane
But can't you see I'm so in pain
Guess I'm not cause I don't talk
And then you write me off again
And I don't think you understand at all

I don't wanna use my mouth
Don't know how to spell it out
Every time I try, it sucks
I just wish you could open me up
And see-e-e-e all the confusion
And the love, the hurt, the wrong words I'm using
Cause tonight, it feels like...

Like you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh

Why, you say I never really see
That it's only ever about me?
Like I don't listen when you speak
Like it doesn't kill me when your tears fall out
And I cannot catch it
And I do not have the perfect expression
And I don't think you understand at all

I don't wanna use my mouth
Don't know how to spell it out
Every time I try, it sucks
I just wish you could open me up
And see-e-e-e all the confusion
And the love, the hurt, the wrong words I'm using
Cause tonight, it feels like...

Like you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
You, you don't know, you don't know my heart

Feels like eh
Like you don't know my
Feels like eh
Like you don't know my
Feels like
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh, eh, eh, eh

I don't wanna use my mouth
Don't know how to spell it out
Every time I try, it sucks
I just wish you could open me up
And see-e-e-e all the confusion
And the love, the hurt, the wrong words I'm using
Cause tonight, it feels like...

Like you don't know my heart
Feels like
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
Like you don't know my heart
Feels like
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like
You don't know, you don't know my heart
Feels like eh---
