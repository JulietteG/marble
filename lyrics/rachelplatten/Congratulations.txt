I'm stupid and confused
My ego's raw and bruised
Your words were weapons and
They tore me down again
We play our conversation
You threw your accusations
I'm always so complaisant
I never change the station

Help me find a sharper knife
I need to cut you out my life
I take it all, I let it slide
But hey, you went too far this time

Congratulations, got what you wanted, your winning now
Congratulations, you got your shot and you wore me down
And I really don't think you get it now
No I really don't think you get it now
It's killing me, I admit it now
Congratulations, you tore my heart out, congratulations

It must feel good digested to be so damn aggressive
But the pounding in my chest is, begging for protection
You think you're innocence, pure gold and heaven sent
But, my tears are instruments, they sound like consequences

Help me find a sharper knife
I need to cut you out my life
I take it all, I let it slide
But hey, you went too far this time

Congratulations, got what you wanted, your winning now
Congratulations, you got your shot and you wore me down
And I really don't think you get it now
No I really don't think you get it now
It's killing me, I admit it now
Congratulations, you tore my heart out, congratulations

Save me from myself cause I, need somebody's help
Yeah, I dig the deepest wells and I get lost
You, you got it all I guess
And me, I'll take the fall for this

Ohhh

Help me find a sharper knife
I need to cut you out my life
I take it all, I let it slide
But hey, you went too far this time

Congratulations, got what you wanted, your winning now
Congratulations, you got your shot and you wore me down
And I really don't think you get it now
No I really don't think you get it now
It's killing me, I admit it now
Congratulations, you tore my heart out, congratulations
