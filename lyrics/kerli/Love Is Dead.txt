This is the hardest part
When you feel like fading
All that you have's become unreal
Collapsing and aching

All I want, all I want is right here

But love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

Love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

I know that you think of me when you're
Beside her, inside her
It must be so hard for you to
Deny it and hide it

Oh, all I want, all I want is right here

But love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

And love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

And love don't live here anymore, hey
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore 
Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore
Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

And love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

And love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

Love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone
Love don't live here anymore)

Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
