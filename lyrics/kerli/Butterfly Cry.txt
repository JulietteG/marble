Did I hurt you
Did I ever make you bleed inside
Did I kill you
I didn't mean to make you hide yourself
Find you in you beautiful
Do not grow the seeds of pain in you
Goodbye...

*CHORUS*
Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
And you just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful

Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
And you just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful
All across the world is wonderful

I have been there
I used to believe there was no light
But I found out 
Our life is far too short to fight
Lose yourself, let go your pain
I'll taste the air you breathe and kiss the sky
Goodbye...

*CHORUS*
Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
You just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful

Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
And you just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful
All across the world is wonderful

*CHORUS*
Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
You just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful

Let the butterflies cry
Let them cry for you
And you just dry your eyes
Because the world is wonderful

All across the world is wonderful
Yeah, Across the world is wonderful---Lyrics submitted by celina.
