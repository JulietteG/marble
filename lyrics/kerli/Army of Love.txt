(Hello, children. Prepare to take over the universe) 

(x2)
Say it loud, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
We love to love to love ya
Love to love to love ya

I put my name on the line for love 
This is what Ive been waiting for
I saw it all like a sign above
So follow me, follow me

Tell me baby that you love me (love me)
Theres nothing higher, higher than me (me, me) 
If love and freedoms all that we need (that we need)
Then follow me, follow me

(Chorus):
(x2)
Say it loud, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
We love to love to love ya
Love to love to love ya

I put my name on the line for love
Together well break down the walls
This is a different kind of war
So follow me, follow me

Tell me baby that you love me (love me)
Theres nothing higher, higher than me (me, me) 
If love and freedoms all that we need (that we need)
Then follow me, follow me

Come one, come all
Were building an army, building an army,
Just come down, come down 
Building an army, an army of love 

(Chorus)

So lets go on, lets go on
On and on for love
So lets go on, lets go on
On and on for love 

For love 
(Tell me baby that you love me)
For love
(Theres nothing higher, higher than me) 
For love 
(If love and freedoms all that we need)
For love, for love
(Then follow me, follow me)

(Chorus)
We love to love to love ya
Love to love to love ya
We love to love to love ya
Love to love to love ya---Lyrics submitted by Kay.
