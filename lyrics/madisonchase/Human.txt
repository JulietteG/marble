Human beings with their humanistic qualities I share.
Human beings with their humanistic qualities I share.

If I leave,
Will you follow me?
Dont despair.
Its only fantasy.
Righteous love wont let me be.
Humanistic qualities.
Human.
Human.

(Dont take my love for granted.)
Human beings with their humanistic qualities I share.
(Thought Id be a fool, your puppet to lead.)
Right or wrong, you werent human to me.

If I leave,
Will you follow me?
Dont despair.
Its only fantasy.
Righteous love wont let me be.
Humanistic qualities.

If I bleed,
Will you fall for me?
Dont despair.
Its only fantasy.
Righteous love wont let me be.
Humanistic qualities.
Human.
Human.

[6x]
(If I leave. . . )
Will you follow me?---Lyrics submitted by Madison Chase.
