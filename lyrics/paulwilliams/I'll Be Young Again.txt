This old body is getting tired and feeble
And I just cant get around
Like I did when I was young and fair
But with eyes of faith I see
A brand new bible thats waiting for me
Ill be young again when I get over there

Chorus:
Ill be young again when I get to heavens shore
All the burdens that Ive had, up there Ill have no more
No more sorrow, no more pain, and Ill never grow old again
Ill be young again, when I get over there

You know sometimes my hands are not so steady
And I know my steps are slow, and theres silver in my hair
But Im as happy as I can be, because I know whats waiting for me
Ill be young again, when I get over there

Chorus:
Ill be young again when I get to heavens shore


Repeat
No more sorrow, no more pain, and Ill never grow old again
Ill be young again, when I get over there---Lyrics submitted by zachary a worth.
