Time and tide
Your rolling rhythms
Are the music of my past
Hard times move slowly
While the good times move so fast
The good times move so fast

Roll on time and tide
Your summer sunlight
Seems to melt away disguise
Reflects the woman waiting
In a young girl's eyes,
In a young girl's eyes,

And love
There is love enough for two
In every mornin'
Come let us taste it
Find the love
In a life so quickly thru
An April warning
We must not waste it

Time and tide
I've watched your perfect sunsets slip into the waves
Your light has gone,
Your beauty, mind and mem'ry saves
My sweet mem'ry saves---
