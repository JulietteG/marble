Roll on thunder shine on lightnin'
The days are long and the nights are frightnin'
Nothing matters anyway and that's the hell of it

Winter comes and the winds blow colder
Well some grew wiser you just grew older
And you never listened anyway
And that's the hell of it

Good for nothin' bad in bed
Nobody likes you and you're better off dead
Goodbye  We've all come to say goodbye
Born defeated died in vain
Super destruction you were hooked on pain
And though your music lingers on
All of us are glad you're gone

If I could live my life
Half as worthlessly as you
I'm convinced that I'd wind up burning too

Love yourself as you love no other
Be no man's fool be no man's brother
We're all born to die alone y'know
That's the hell of it

Life's a game where they're bound to beat you
And time's a trick they can turn to cheat you
And we only waste it anyway
And that's the hell of it

Good for nothin' bad in bed
Nobody likes you and you're better off dead
Goodbye - We've all come to say goodbye
Born defeated died in vain
Super destruction you were hooked on pain
And though your music lingers on
All of us are glad you're gone---
