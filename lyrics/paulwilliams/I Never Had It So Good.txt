I never had much money
I never won a race
My jokes don't end up funny
And I've had doors slammed in my face
But I think you've charmed me
I always hoped that someone would
I never had a love like this before
I never had it so good

I'm not the kind that's trusted
Always tripping over logs
And often I've been busted
Chased by friendly dogs
But I think you've charmed me
I always hoped that someone would
I never had a love like this before
I never had it so good---
