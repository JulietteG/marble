Hello such a simple way to start a love affair
Should I jump right in and say how much I care
Would you take me for a mad man or a simple hearted clown
Hello with affection from a sentimental fool
To a little girl who's broken of every rule
One who brings me up when all the others seem to let me down
One whose nice to be around

Should I say that it's a blue world without you
Nice words I remember from an old love song
But all wrong, cause I never called it love before
This feeling's new - this came with you

And I know that the nicest things that never seem to last
That we're both a bit embarrassed by our past
But I think there's something special in the feelings that we've found
And you're nice to be around
And you're nice to be around---
