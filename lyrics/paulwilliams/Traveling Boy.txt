Wake up my love beneath the midday sun
Alone, once more alone.
This travelin boy was only passin through,
But he will always think of you.

One night of love beside a strange young smile, 
As warm as I have known.
The travelin boy and only passin through,
But one wholl always think of you.

Take my place out on the road again
I must do what I must do.
Yes, I know we were lovers but a drifter discovers,
That a perfect love wont always last forever.

Well I wont say that Ill be back again,
But time will tell the tale.
So no goodbyes from one just passin through,
But one wholl always think of you.

Take my place out on the road again,
I must do what I must do.
Yes, I know we were lovers but a drifter discovers,
That a perfect love wont always last forever.

Well I wont say that Ill be back again,
But time will tell the tell.
So no goodbyes from one just passin through,
But one wholl always think of you.

This travelin boy was only passin through,
But I will always think of you.---Lyrics submitted by RENE.
