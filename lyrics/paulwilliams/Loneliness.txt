Loneliness
Takes the romance out of falling stars
Fills the wishing wells and fills the bars
Loneliness
Takes the romance out of falling stars
Fills the wishing wells and fills the bars
Run and hide the scars of loneliness

Loneliness
Makes the winter's night seem twice as long
Makes the summer sunlight much too strong
Nothin's really wrong
It's only loneliness

So stay awhile
We both have stories that are hungry to be told
Your eyes are warm but I can feel your hands are cold
Still they're nice to hold
It only takes a simple yes
The time we spend leaves that much less for

Loneliness
Like a love song or an old cliche
Has its hideouts but it's never far away
Look around you've found
It's only loneliness

So stay awhile
We've worn the night away and now it's almost done
If you could stay a bit of breakfast might be fun
It's too much work for one
And though it's just a simple guess
We're stronger now we've made the best of

Loneliness
Waits in silence while the shadows grow
Waits and wonders if it's finally time to go
The yes in our hello said no to
Loneliness---
