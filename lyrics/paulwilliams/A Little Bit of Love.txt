She's the kind who says goodbye to houses
When she's leaving them for good
Thinks about the beauty of the forest
When she burns a piece of wood
Says hello to strangers
And every hungry stray weighs on her mind
Sees good in everybody
That few of us would take the time to find
She says every act of kindness
Is a little bit of love we leave behind

She's the kind who lays awake and worries
When the headline tensions grow
Thinks about the unborn generations
And a time she'll never know
Seems it's always after midnight
When we talk it out and slowly both unwind
She says every act of kindness
Is a little bit of love we leave behind

Every summer sun
That has passed our way
Serves to light every day
And in time will stay
Like a golden ghost in our mind
So when we have gone
What we do lives on
You know every act of kindness
Is a little bit of love we leave behind
