You better come on in my kitchen   its going to be raining outdoors

When woman get into trouble
Everybody throws her down
Looking for her good good friends
None can be found 
You better come on in my kitchen its going to be raining outdoors

The woman I love took her from my best friend
Some joker got lucky and stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen its going to be raining outdoors.

Oh shes gone,   I know she wont come back
I took her last nickel out of her nation sack
You better come on in my kitchen its going to be raining outdoors

Oh, cant you hear that wind howling

When woman get into trouble
Everybody throws her down
Looking for her good friends
None can be found 
You better come on in my kitchen its going to be raining outdoors

When that times coming its gonna be cold
You cant make the winter baby
That drives so long
You better come on in my kitchen its going to be raining outdoors---Lyrics submitted by Carol.
