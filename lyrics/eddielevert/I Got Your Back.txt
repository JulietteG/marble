(Eddie Talking)
You know sometimes we can seem to take things for granted
Especially the things that are there all the time
But sometimes you gotta sit back and realize that 
Some people arent so fortunate
You know they arent so blessed to have someone they can talk to
Somebody they can sit with and say 
Ill always be there for you
I love you, I got your back
First Verse

(Gerald Singing)
I know you have those days when it seems like the whole worlds 
Against you nobodys with you
You know the days when it seems like you woke up on the 
Wrong side of the bed and you wish you were dead
But Im the one to pick you up when youre down
Help you get your feet firmly on the ground
See Im your friend when youre rich or poor
See youll never be alone

(Chorus) 
I got your back
And Ill go to the war for you 
I got your back
And I will take the fall for you
I got your back
Ill remember everything you do 
You got it like that (like that)
Like that (like that)
You know its true Im here for you 

(Father Singing) 
Im the one you can call when youre in pain 
Or when youre hurting
Ill never be a burden
And Ill understand those times 
That you dont want to be bothered
I love you my father so
Just know Im here
When you need somebody to talk to
Ill come running
Say you got it like that and I

(Chorus) 
I got your back
And Ill go to the war for you 
I got your back
And I will take the fall for you
I got your back
Ill remember everything you do 
You got it like that (like that)
Like that (like that)
You know its true Im here for you

(Bridge) 
Oh, take me to the bridge
Want you to know that I appreciate you for being here
You are my shoulder when nobody seems to care
When you did not have to go out your way
I could call on your words of wisdom everyday
So I take the time to thank you for being you
Understanding everything I was going through 
You see daddy 
My son 
Together see we are as one 

Oh Im down
Im down
All the way down for you
Yeah, yeah
Ive got your back 
Ive got your back Daddy
Say Im down
You cant do no wrong 
You cant do no wrong 
In my eyes
And you got it like that
Said you got it like that
I know youre got it oh, oh

(Chorus) x2 
I got your back
And Ill go to the war for you 
I got your back
And I will take the fall for you
I got your back
Ill remember everything you do 
You got it like that (like that)
Like that (like that)
You know its true Im here for you---Lyrics submitted by Parris.
