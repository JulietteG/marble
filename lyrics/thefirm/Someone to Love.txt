Love's, sweet, music that I hear,
I, found someone to love,
All, my, troubles disappear,
I, found someone to love,

And I, will, always want you near,
I, found someone to love, (yeah)
I, found, some, one, to love,

And when the darkenss falls,
That's when your lovin' calls,
And in the shadow light,
That's when I know,
That's when I know it's got to be, got to be so right, 
(yeah,   oh yeah, listen honey)

She, gives, me, music in my soul,
I, found someone to love
And I, will, never let this go,
I, found someone to love, (oh baby)

She, just, has to let it show,
She, found someone to love, (yeah)
She found, some, one, to love,

And when the darkness falls,
That's when your lovin' calls,
And in the shadow light,
That's when I know,
That's when I know its got to be got to be so right,

(guitar solo)

I, found, some, one, to love,

She, gives, me, music in my soul,
Yes I found someone to love,
And I, will, never never let her go,
I found I found someone to love, (yeaqh baby)

She, just, has to let it show,
She found she found she found someone to love, (oh baby)
I, found, some, one, to love...---Lyrics submitted by Joseph Girouard.
