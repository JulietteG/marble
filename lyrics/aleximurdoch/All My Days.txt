I have been searching all of my days
All of my days

Many a road you know, I been walking on
All of my days

And Ive been trying to find
Whats been in my mind
As the days keep turning into night

And Ive been standing quietly in the shade 
all of my days

Watch the sky breaking on the promise we made
All of this rain

Ive been trying to find, whats been in my mind
As the days keep turning into night

Many of night I find myself with no friends standing near
All of my days

I cried aloud, shook my hands what Im doing here
All of these days

For I look around me
My eyes confound me
And it is just too bright
As the days keep turning into night

Now I see clearly, see that youre Im looking for
All of my days
So a smile, Ill know I feel this loneliness no more
All of my days

For I look around me, 
and it seems that you found me, and it is coming into sound 
As the days keep turning into night, As the days keep turning into night

Even breathing feels alright
Yes even breathing feels alright
Now even breathing feels alright
Yes even breathing feels alright---Lyrics submitted by Jeff.
