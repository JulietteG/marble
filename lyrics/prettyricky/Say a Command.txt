Climb on top of me (say a command) 
Take it all off (say a command) 
Lets make computer love (say a command) 
Cause my hard drive is burning up (BURNING UP BABY) 

Climb on top of me (say a command) 
Take it all off (say a command) 
Lets make computer love (say a command) 
Cause my hard drive is burning up (BURNING UP girl) 

Did you say take my clothes off (oh oh oh oh) 
Did you say take my clothes off (oh oh oh oh) 
Did you say take my clothes off (oh oh oh oh) 
Did you say take my clothes off (oh oh oh oh) 

[Spectacular:]
I cant believe I got my self in this situation 
That computer love got my heart speed racing 
I like to get you hot hotter than a oven 
I know what turn you on like a power button 
When I plug you up I put it in a socket 
Hit you with that power button make you yell stop it 
Keeping you out rated get you new cords 
Got so tight I went to meet them other boys 
Baby girl I love you and cant nobody tell me that it aint true 
If I lose you its like cutin a orderly 
The love of my life you will always be apart me 

[Chorus:]
Climb on top of me (say a command) 
Take it all off (say a command) 
Lets make computer love (say a command) 
Cause my hard drive is burning up (BURNING UP GIRL) 

Did you say take my clothes off (oh oh oh oh) 
Did you say take my clothes off (oh oh oh oh) 

[Diamond Blue:]
This computer love girl take them tight off 
Nedd to let it breath your lips Microsoft 
Shorty hold that weave until you get me off 
If you wanna talk 

[Slick'em:]
Every time you have a problem time to restart 
Hit the control the alt delete space box 
Escape 
Escape
Escape

[Chorus:]
Climb on top of me (say a command) 
Take it all off (say a command) 
Lets make computer love (say a command) 
Cause my hard drive is burning up (BURNING UP GIRL) 

[Slick'em:]
I got the master pass code if you got that thing on lock 
Lose your wear and tear so I can see them thongs drop 
On my laptop (yeah) still making top 
Smooth operator type my address in you navigation system 
Chillin now 
Chillin with my verchaul baby 
We gonna have some verchaul babies 
You so sexy grown girl kiss me though the iphone 

Was that your final command!!!---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey Lennon.
