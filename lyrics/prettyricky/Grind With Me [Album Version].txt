[Chorus]
Baby grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me
Now come and sex me till your body gets weak
With slow grindin'
Baby grind on me (Sloww griind)
Relax your mind take your time on me (Sloww griind)
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me (Sloww griind)
Now come and sex me till your body gets weak (Sloww griind)
With slow grindin' babe

[Verse 1]
When I hit 'em I make 'em say (ohh)
Sex be my day (job)
I hit 'em in the back of my (car)
Make 'em ride like a see (saw)
I make 'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Suckin' on the nipple
Lick the whip cream from the middle
Girlfriend I'll never go (raw)
I rip off panties and I pop off (bras)
B.L.U.E.S.T.A. (R)
Ask around the block how freaky we (ah)
I drink Red Bull so I keep stamina
Run in you belly and bust yo brain
What's my name, what's my name
Pretty Ricky, pretty boy doing pretty good thangs
Makin' pretty good change
Gettin' good brain
From these pretty, pretty chicks
Gettin' pretty damn rich
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky and the Mavericks

[Chorus]
Baby grind on me (Sloww griind)
Relax your mind take your time on me (Sloww griind)
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me (Sloww griind)
Now come and sex me till your body gets weak (Sloww griind)

Baby grind on me (Sloww griind)
Relax your mind take your time on me (Sloww griind)
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me (Sloww griind)

[Verse 2]
Lay on your back let me rub this cream on ya baby
Slow motion 'bout to put this thing on ya baby

[Verse 3]
Slick got mo' game than a lil' bit
Baby girl five-five brown eyes with the thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar honey ice tea
Baby girl is the shit and a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she coming home
Lights out with the Cherry thong
Eat her up like a Sundae cone
But as of morning
You got me open
Love John is strokin'
No jokin'
Coochie swollen
The bedroom smokin'
Get some air up in this room girl (ah ah ah ah)
If lovin' you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
So I'mma take my time and do it right
'Cause we got all night
'Cause we got all night
Baby girl just...

[Chorus]
Baby grind on me (Sloww griind)
Relax your mind take your time on me (Sloww griind)
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me (Sloww griind)
Now come and sex me till your body gets weak (Sloww griind)
With slow grindin'
Baby grind on me (Sloww griind)
Relax your mind take your time on me (Sloww griind)
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me (Sloww griind)
Now come and sex me till your body gets weak (Sloww griind)---
