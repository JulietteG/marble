[Talking: Lingerie]
Yea, I'm just sitting alone in this four cornered room playing with my guitar.
(Oh baby yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I wanna try something new tonight, are you down?

[Chorus:]
Let's have a Menage A Trios, you me and my guitar
Let's have a Menage a trios, you me and my guitar

[Hook:]
I'm stroking these guitar strings and stroking your body,
Stroking these guitar strings and stroking your body,
Stroking these guitar strings and stroking your body,
We gonna make a love song, we don't need no body but my guitar.

[Verse 1: Baby Blue]
Yea, Baby Blue, Whoa
We make love each and every night,
I love it ah ah, love it ah ah, love it ah ah
We make love each and every night,
I love it ah ah, love it ah ah, love it ah ah
Till it get so and I can't beat it no more,
Yo sex is so electrical, never a shortage cus I ain't low
Keep it strapped up on my shoulders, legs wrapped up around my shoulders,
Pulled over on the shoulder, let me pop that cherry soda,
Shake my hand in it when I'm in it, like Jimi Hendrix,
She said I'm the best that every did it like Jimi Hendrix,
She said I'm the best that every did it like Bob Marley,
I hit it and never quit, I abuse it and I'm sorry,
And I can't help that I'm addicted to it like bob Marley,
I beat that pussy leave that pussy purple like barney,
Menage a trios, kama sutra, eat that pu na-na until you sing like the choir

[Lingerie:]
Girl it's me and you but we ain't alone,
Cus when I strongly skip all strings it makes a sexy tone
The way you dance all nite girl I can't explain,
Unto the music we making, I hear you say my name,
Then you say lingerie, why they call you lingerie,
And then I show you why the fuck they call me lingerie,
No one could make a better melody than me and you girl

[Verse 2: Slick em]
(That right)
Yay, I got a phone call from this one broad, she said she in town,
Wanna lick me cus she miss me, she wanna throw me around,
Now, I know you got a man boo but we can be friends,
She said I know you got a girl too, but we can pretend,
So I met her like 12:30 one summer afternoon,
She was in a PT Cruiser chilling with her junior,
I got my
She said you kinda icy, but specs the jeweler,
And you know those blue star niggas is way cooler, and way smoother,
Talk rough, nigga she ain't use to
Putting the sound on ya like I'm lex luger, slice like freddy kreuger,
Don't need no kama sutra, it's roof. ---Lyrics submitted by shonesty watts.
