(Pleasure-Hook)
Yeah...
Its da voice of Pretty Ricky
And i know some of yall sexy ladies
Wanna know how we do it 

I like it real slow like walking through the door
Sexy in a trench coat
Makin love on the stove
We can take it to the floor
Gimme gimme some more
How long can u go
I just thought Ill let u know girl

(Chorus)
Up and down we go
Like the sunlight and the moon light
Can i get u right
Round and round we go
Like in the end love
That good love, that butta love
Up and down we go
Like a see-saw
I love it when you vibin babe
Round and round we go
Dont tell me no

Caressing your body until u get hot

Got a couple mill out the da deal for my six pack

(Chorus)
Up and down we go
Like the sunlight and the moon light

That good love, that butta love
Up and down we go
Like a see-saw
I love it when you vibin babe
Round and round we go

Girl can u imagine being with me 
Having da time of yo life with a G
Hands look tight let me pop them buttons

Aint nothing for me to freak u, up and down
We going between sheets boo, this thang so
Good wanna take me to da hood if u could
And let me meet yo people cause I, Im
Da king of freaking come here girl let me kiss them 
Lips, Im telling u boo I know about relationships
So let me give you a tip, by da headboard
I leave dents, mattress frame I leave bends
U can call me da night out king because
I hit them on da floor when I represent


(Chorus)
Up and down we go
Like the sunlight and the moon light

Round and round we go
Like in the end love
That good love, that butta love
Up and down we go
Like a see-saw
I love it when you vibin babe
Round and round we go
Dont tell me no
Don tell me no
