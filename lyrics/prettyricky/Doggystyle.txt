[Chorus (Lingerie)]
Let me hit ya from the back
You say that you like my doggystyle
You say that you like my doggystyle
You say that you like my doggystyle
You say that you like my doggystyle

[Verse 1 (Spectacular)]
Let me hit ya from the back with ya tongue out
It ain't been five minutes and she sprung out
Say she like it from the back you done showed out
If I'm getting too deep let me know now
Let me know now cause if it goes down
If you can't make it cum I better know how
Matter of fact let me see you throw it back
Where its at we can do it till you have a heart attack
Uh

[Chorus (repeat)]

[Verse 2 (Diamond Blue)]
Let me hit ya from the back
Make it walk to me
Clap clap clap make it talk to me
Make it clap clap make it clap clap
Make it clap clap clap clap clap for me
Let me hit ya from the back
Make it bounce for me stand on one leg
Make it barrel like a dog for me
Eddie Murphy ain't got nothing on it
I'm like lions in the jungle hitting it doggystyle raw homie
Let me hit ya from the back
On the mattress no covers no rubbers
Ha whose is this
Let me hit ya from the back from a coupe
Pouring Gin and juice on your back feeling like Snoop
Slick what they do

[Verse 3 (Slick)]
Now missionary is so overrated
Put a pill in that ass now she x-rated
Sex rated and I'll be G-rated
Tattoo Wrustare yea a nigga hating
Tell a nigga face it ain't no telling
If I'm eating that cause there ain't no smell in it
Bust it open pussy pink like a watermelon
You ain't heard bitch all dogs go to heaven

[Chorus (Repeat)]

[Verse 4 (Jo Hound)]
Yea ha ha I go by the name of Hound
Jo' Hound
Like I told you I run through your mind
Girl like its ??
You got a lot of ass I gotta sub pass
You say your man lame yea I got swag
Bluestar keep it coming I go by the name of Hound
Better get you on it
You say a tattoos what a playa really wanted
If I leave wit her you can get her in the mornin' (in the mornin')
Let me hit from the back just like that
A bucket of ice goose and the cognac
That's all I need and I'll be ready like that
Let me taste it then get it from the back

[Bridge (Lingerie)]
On your knees
Face down
Let me give it to you doggystyle
Oh yea
Let me hit ya from the back ---Lyrics submitted by shonesty watts.
