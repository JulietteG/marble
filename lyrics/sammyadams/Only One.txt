O-only one
O-only one o-one
O-only one

You were so out of my league
Like i was lost for words
I couldn't even begin to speak right
Not to mention each night
Couldn't seem to spark that conversation
I kept stalling out just waiting
At the green light
G-g-g-green light
Push the clutch and finally broke the damn ice
Would have done it sooner had i knew you were intrigued by me
Had no idea kept making these excuses
Now you're mine and i'm gon' prove it
I'm gon' prove it, i'm gon' prove it

Just had to say you're the only one
I can't deny it or stall any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can't even lie you're the only only only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only one
Ohhhhh ohhhhh
Girl you're the only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only only only one

Girl, you would so be on that fly shit
And i can't even tell you or explain how wide my eyes get
When you walk in the room it's
Hard to keep a friendly conversation
Cuz everyone's stuck on my chick
My my my my my my chick
Everyone look at my chick
She got the touch and moves to make me lose it
When we grinding
She make the room light up but that's the last thing on her mind
Dude told me this would happen i just thought that he was lying

Just had to say you're the only one
I can't deny it or stall any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can't even lie you're the only only only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only only only one
Ohhhhh
O-only one
Ohhhhh
O-only one o-one
O-only one

Crazy never thought this would happen
But your love knocked me out
So before i write a flatten
Any question thought or doubt
And now i'm stuck deeper
Yup, and i swear it's true
But i can't go out and i can't look around
Cuz none of these girls compare to you

Just had to say you're the only one
I can't deny it or stall any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can't even lie you're the only only only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only one
Ohhhhh ohhhhh
Girl you're the only one
Ohhhhh
Girl you're the only only only one---
