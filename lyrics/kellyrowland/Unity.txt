Mmmmm...
Mmmm...

Picking up the pieces of a life that I once knew {pause}
What will Tomorrow bring
Grey Skies all Around me 
I dont know where to turn {pause}
Can you help me with this pain?

{Chorus}
A shooting star 
A ray of light, A breeze that calms me in the night

I got your message yesterday
 I feel you here I wish that you could stay with me 
Two hearts forever
Your were the spark that lit the flame
Hoping that you'd stay with me this loves forever
In my heart you will remain, til we meet again


Sitting here cold waiting for the sun
Will he every shine again? 
Picture frames the better days
swirling in my head will they ever find a way

Chorus

i got message yesterday 
i feel you here I wish that you could 
Stay With Me..Two hearts forever
Your were the spark that lit the flame
Hoping that you'd stay with me 
This loves forever
In my heart you will remain, Til we meet again 
ohhhh ohhhh...Til we meet again 
ohhh ohhhh 
You gotta slow down...Just Slow down  {repeat}---Lyrics submitted by Cierra.
