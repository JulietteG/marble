[Chorus]
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When youre soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

[Verse 1]
While my sister was on stage, killing it like a motherf-cker
I was enraged, feeling it like a motherf-cker
Bird in a cage, you would never know what I was dealing with
Went out separate ways, but I was happy she was killing it
Bittersweet, she was up, I was down
No lie, I feel good for her, but what do I do now?
Forget the records
Off the record, I was going through some bullshit
Post-survivor, she on fire, who wanna hear my bullshit?
Meanwhile, this nigga putting his hands on me
I swear yall dont know the half of this industry

[Chorus]
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When youre soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

[Verse 2]
And its almost been a decade
Im behind them black shades
Roll up like its all good, right up out that escalade
Fix my make-up, get it together, Kelly, get it together
Then we make up, well get it together, nigga, get it together
Kinda lucky, I was in her shadow
Phone call from my sister, whats the matter?
She said, Oh no, baby - you gotta leave!
Im on the kitchen floor - he took the keys
I was mad at everybody, I mean everybody
Yeah, her, her, her her everybody
Five years later, I got my shit down pat
Think I had it good, and they dont know how bad
Fooled everybody, except myself
Soaking in this hurt, bathing in the dirt

[Chorus]
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When youre soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

[Verse 3]
So here I am in the spin cycle
Were comin and were goin
Nobody can know this
And I was trapped in his house, lyin to my mama
Thought it could get no worse as we maximize the drama
Started to call them people on him
I was battered
He hittin the window like it was me, until it shattered
He pulled me out, he said, Dont nobody love you but me
Not your mama, not your daddy and especially not Bey
He turned me against my sister
I missed ya

[Chorus]
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Lets do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When youre soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry---Lyrics submitted by ChanielleWatson.
