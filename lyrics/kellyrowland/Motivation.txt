[Kelly Rowland]
Oh lover, dont you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, your almost there now
So go lover, make my mother proud
And when were done, I dont wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel youre hands all over me baby
You cant stop there, music still playin in the background
And youre almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

So baby Imma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Motivation
Go, go, go, go

Oh Lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same
Wont let ya get up out of there again
So lover, dont it make me rain

And when were done, I dont wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel youre hands all over me baby
You cant stop there, music still playin in the background
And youre almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, girl I turn that thing into a rainforest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, but oh, I go deeper
Make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then do the dishes

She my motivation, Im her transportation
Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like Im racing
When Im done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby

[Kelly Rowland]
And when were done, I dont wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel youre hands all over me baby
You cant stop there, music still playin in the background
And youre almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here---Lyrics submitted by Jordan's Mommy .
