You put in over time, over night, doing everything I like, go for ride yeah
You hold me close, please me tight, look me deep inside my eyes, baby don't we love here
But nothing can compare to when you kiss me there
And I cant lie when I lie I your arms baby I feel so sexy

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
Youre one of a kind, thats why I gotta make you mine

Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
Now I'm really goin

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

Baby get a little rough tha's okay
Baby go ahead do your thang, ride away
And I love it when we misbehave
Me and you together babe, we can do anything
Boy, if someone could see the way you kiss on me
Oh they wont believe it, cause even I don't believe it but I love the way I'm feeling

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
Youre one of a kind, thats why I gotta make you mine

Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
Now I'm really goin

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

Speed it up, heat it up, let it go, let it go, let it go
Till I get, get enough, you never know, never know, never know
I like that there, yeah that there,
A little more to the left

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
Youre one of a kind, thats why I gotta make you mine

Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
Now I'm really goin

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that ---
