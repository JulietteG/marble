Wake up
7:32am.
Can't believe it's time to do it over again
Yesterday it took all that you had
And wondering if you'll ever get it back
The whole wide world is waiting for
Waiting for you to step out that door
'Come on, let your life be heard today

[Chorus:]
You've got something to say
If your livin' and your breathin'
You've got something to say
And you know if your heart is beating
You've got something to say
No one can say it like you do
God is love and love speaks 
Though you got it, 
You got it, 
You've got something to say

Yeah-hey-yeah
Something to say, yeah
Ohhhh

Listen up,
I've got a question here
"Would anybody miss you if you disappeared?"
Well your life,
Is the song that you sing
And the whole wide world is listening
The answer to the question is
"You are created your life is gifted"
Lights are shining on you today
'Cuz you've got something to say!

(Chorus)

(Na na na na na na na na)
You've got something to say
(Na na na na na)
Come on
Come on, yeah
I said, "na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na, yeah"

Listen up,
I've got a question here
"Would anybody miss you if you disappeared?"
Well your life, 
Is the song that you sing
And the whole wide world is listening
Ohhhhhh ohhh
You've got something to say
No one can say it like you do
God is love and love speaks
Through you got it,
You got it,
You've got something to say, yeah
(Na na na na na na na na)
Something to say
Come on,
Come on, yeah
And the world is listening now
And the lights are shining down
Shining down on you today
'Cuz you got something to say
So just say it.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
