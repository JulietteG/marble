86,400 seconds, 86,400 seconds, 86,400 seconds
Make 'em count, make 'em matter
Make it now, live forever

Is this all there is?
Seconds and minutes and hours and days?
That's all we get and when it ends
Do we faint like the flowers they put on our graves
Am I just a dash
Between the numbers that fate will decide
Is true that nothing lasts
Or is there a way to outlive my life?

I don't wanna live for now
I don't wanna live for now
I wanna live forever
I wanna live forever
I just wanna make it count
I don't wanna live for now
I wanna live forever
I wanna live forever starting now

86,400 seconds
Make 'em count, make 'em matter
Make it now, live forever

They say you get one life
Go on, do whatever feels right
There's no consequence
Here and now is all that counts
But I know this is not as good as it gets
There's more to life than what my eyes can see
I want my song to sing for eternity
I wanna live like I know the life
That waits for me is something heavenly

Gotta keep my eyes on the prize
There ain't no change in my mind
More than a moment in time
I'm gonna live, live forever
I know I'm just passing through
To the other side of the blue
This world's got nothing on you
I'm gonna live, live forever

86,400 seconds, 86,400 seconds, 86,400 seconds
Make 'em count, make 'em matter
Make it now, live forever---
