You've got your hand on the door 
And your ready just to walk out
Well the fight that you had
Filled your mind up with all this, 
Doubt.
And your losing your mind
And your losing your faith
And you can't remember why you fell in love in the first place

Go back,
Go back,
To the moment of truth
When she walked down the isle
And you first said, "i do"
When this life makes you wonder
What have you got to lose?
Go back,
Go back ,
To the moment of truth

You've got your hand on a habit
And you can't seem to let it go
It used to be your escape
But now it's out of control
And now it's you in the mirror
But you don't recognize your face
And your looking for a reason
Not to throw it all away.

Just go back,
Go back,
To the moment of truth
With three words
"It's a girl"
And she looks just like you
When this life makes you wonder
What have you got to lose?
Go back,
Just go back,
To the moment of truth

You've got your hand on the bible
But your heart feels like stone
'Cuz you think you've made to many mistakes
To come home
And you're losing you're will
And you're losing you're faith
And now you wonder if you even believed in the first place

Just go back, 
(Just go back,)
To the moment of truth
(To the moment of truth)
When you first talked to Jesus
And He reached out for you
Whoa ohhh
He's still reaching
He's still reaching out for you
So when this life makes you wonder
What have you got to lose?
Just go back,
Just go back,
To the moment of truth
Just go back,
Go back,
To the moment of truth
Ohhhh
Just go back.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
