In a world full of dirt, you're a diamond
In a world full of hurt, you're smiling
In the darkest dark, you're shining
Shining like a shooting star
You live your life like you're here on a mission
Yeah, you're not afraid of being different
You hear the doubters, but you don't listen
'Cause you know who you are
Yeah, you know who you are

This is to all the world changers
Keep walking on, don't you ever
Lose that fire in your soul
Lose that fire in your soul
This is to all the world changers
You know you are history makers
This world's never gonna change you
You're gonna change
You're gonna change
The world (yeah)
The world

In the face of fear, you're fearless
You don't care about being famous
And the world may never know your name but
The world will never be the same 'cause
From the ends of the earth to your hometown
To the lost, to the hurt, to the broke down
You're the arms wide open
A love that's showing every one of us the way now
Yeah yeah yeah

This is to all the world changers
Keep walking on, don't you ever
Lose that fire in your soul
Lose that fire in your soul
This is to all the world changers
You know you are history makers
This world's never gonna change you
You're gonna change
You're gonna change
The world (yeah)
The world (You're gonna change the world)

Keep on fighting the fight
Keep on running the race
Keep on winning the crown
Keep on keeping the faith
Keep on leading with love
Keep on standing your ground
Don't you ever give up

You give it all, you give it all
And when you're knocked to the ground, you don't stay down
You get up, you get up
And you fight another day
You're a hero unsung
But the world knows a hero when it sees one

This is to all the world changers
Keep walking on, don't you ever
Lose that fire in your soul
Lose that fire in your soul
This is to all the world changers
You know you are history makers
This world's never gonna change you
You're gonna change
You're gonna change
The world (yeah)
The world (You're gonna change the world)
The world (yeah)
The world (You're gonna change the world)
The world (yeah)
The world (You're gonna change the world)

Keep on fighting the fight
Keep on running the race
Keep on winning the crown
Keep on keeping the faith
Keep on leading with love
Keep on standing your ground
Don't you ever give up---
