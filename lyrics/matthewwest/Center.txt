I gotta a feeling 
As a matter of fact
It's like
The whole world just came under attack
And I,
Can hear a voice telling me turn back
'Cuz I must be on to somethin'
It happens ever single time
I get close to
Everything I know
Is good, and right, and so true
It's like somebody doesn't 
Want me to love You and
I must be on to somethin'
So help me hold on,
Help me be strong 
'Cuz I don't wanna move 
Unless You move me

[Chorus:]
I wanna know how it feels to be
Standing in the center of Your
Will for me
I wanna know what surrender means
Keep me in the center
Of Your will for me

(Keep me in the center!)
God forbid 
I start to think I'm on 
A roll now
'Cuz I do believe there is
A battle for my soul now
And I can feel the world
Bottled and controlled now
I must be on to something,
So help me
Hold on just a little bit longer
'Cuz all this trouble's gonna
Do is make me stronger
This is the evedent pray of my heart
I just wanna stay where You are!

[Chorus]

Lord, help me hold on
Help me be strong
'Cuz I don't wanna move
Unless.
You.
Move.
ME!, yea-yeah
Oh, I wanna know how it
Feels to be
Standing in the center 
Of Your will for me
(Center of Your will)
I wanna know what surrender means
(I surrender)
Keep me in the center
(I surrender)
Of Your will for
Will for me
(I wanna know, know)
I surrender
I surrender 
(Keep me in the center)
I wanna know, know, know, know
You've gotta help me hold on
Yea-ya
Help me hold on.
Help me hold on.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
