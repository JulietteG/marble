Take a look at the mountains stretching a mile high Take a look at the ocean far as your eye can see (all)


Take a look at the mountains
stretching a mile high
Take a look at the ocean far as
your eye can see
And think of me
Take a look at the desert
Do you feel like a grain of sand
Im with you forever
where ever you go is where I am
And Im always thinking of you
Take a look around you
Im spelling it out one by one

(Chorus)
I love you more than the sun, and the stars
That I taught how to shine
You are mine and you shine
For me too,
I love you
Yesterday and today
And tomorrow I say it
Again and again,
I love you more

Just a face in the city
Just a tear on a crowded street
But you are one in a million
And you belong to me
And I wanted you to know
That Im not letting go
Even when youve coming undone

(Chorus)

I love you more (yaya)
Shine for me
Shine for me
Shine on
You shine on
You shine for me

(Chorus 2x)

I love you more
I see you and I made you
And I love you more
More than you can imagine
More than you can fathume
I love you more than the sun and you shine for me---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
