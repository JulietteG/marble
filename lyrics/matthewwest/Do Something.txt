I woke up this morning
Saw a world full of trouble now
Thought, howd we ever get so far down
Hows it ever gonna turn around
So I turned my eyes to Heaven
I thought, God, why dont You do something?
Well, I just couldnt bear the thought of
People living in poverty
Children sold into slavery
The thought disgusted me
So, I shook my fist at Heaven
Said, God, why dont You do something?
He said, I did, I created you

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, its time for us to do something
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Its not enough to do nothing
Its time for us to do something

Im so tired of talking
About how we are Gods hands and feet
But its easier to say than to be
Live like angels of apathy who tell ourselves
Its alright, somebody else will do something
Well, I dont know about you
But Im sick and tired of life with no desire
I dont want a flame, I want a fire
I wanna be the one who stands up and says,
Im gonna do something

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, its time for us to do something
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Its not enough to do nothing
Its time for us to do something

We are the salt of the earth
We are a city on a hill (shine shine, shine shine)
But were never gonna change the world
By standing still
No we wont stand still
No we wont stand still
No we wont stand still

If not us, then who
If not me and you
Right now, its time for us to do something
If not now, then when
Will we see an end
To all this pain
Its not enough to do nothing
Its time for us to do something [x3]---
