I reached for you this morning
Woke up with empty arms
Once again it's sinking in how far away you are
I still pour two cups of coffee
And tell you all about my dreams
This kitchens way too quite
You should still be here with me

And even though i cried like crazy
Even though it hurts so bad
I'm thankful for the time God gave me
Even though we couldn't make it last
I'm learning how to live without you
Even though i don't want too
And even with you gone
Love lives on

I still call your mom on sundays
Ya it's good to hear your voice
She always tells me that same story 
about her stubborn little boy 
And I kept your favorite t-shirt
You know that one i used to hate
Ain't it funny how it's the one thing now
I just can't throw away

And even though i cried like crazy
Even though it hurts so bad
I'm thankful for the time God gave me
Even though we couldn't make it last
I'm learning how to live without you
Even though i don't want too
And even with you gone
Love lives on

She comes with me on your birthday
Little flowers in her hand
Shes always known that something is missing
But too young to understand
And someday she is going to ask me
What kind of man you were
I'll tell her all the ways i loved you
And all the you i see in her

And even though i cried like crazy
Even though it hurts so bad
I'm thankful what God gave me
And she's the perfect way to make it last
I'm lovin how to live without you
Baby i don't want too
But even with you gone
Love lives on

Baby love lives on
Love lives on

ohhhhhhh

I reached for you this morning
