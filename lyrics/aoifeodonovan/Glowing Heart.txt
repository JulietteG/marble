I lost you in the broken twilight.
Under-neath the California Sky.
You could live it in the dark and then took to flight.

If I had known which way you headed,
I'd have strapped on wings and hit the night.
But your incandescent beam was out of sight.

Later on when I got home,
I found an owls feather in my hand.

I tried to make some since of it.
the who, 
the why, 
the what, 
the when,
the where are you now,
where have you landed, 
where is your mouth,
are you hungry for some candy
where are you goin'
what is it your lookin' for
where is your glowin' heart now

If I could take back everything
I ever said to you 
would we be fine?
would the ripples in the water taste like wine?

The night is young the air is heavy,
drink up now my love for you goes on
In the thickening of dusk I sing this song.
Your trembling Before me now
looking like you might just start to cry.

No matter how hard I looked 
I could never find the reason why your still here
Why your not fleeting
Why cant you love me
What is it your feeding on
Tonight are you crazy 
Or are you just along for the ride
Where is your glowing heart now

(where are you now)
(hoooh ahh eh aaah)---Lyrics submitted by Thecoffeeguy.
