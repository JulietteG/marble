Cradle me, I'll cradle you
I'll win your heart with a whoop-de-whoo
Pullin' shapes , just for your eyes
So with toothpaste kisses, and lines
I'll be yours and you'll be .. 

Lay with me, I'll lay with you
We'll do the things that lovers do
Put the stars in our eyes
And with heart shaped bruises and late night kisses, divine.

So with toothpaste kisses and lines, 
Stay with me, stay with you
Doing things that lovers do
What does to do?---Lyrics submitted by john.
