If loving you were a crime,
 I'd to the hardest time
 You are perfection, nail it every time
 You know it kills me
 I can't always be right here
 'Cause right now you love me
 Then you disappear

 Wish I could always have you here with me
 Wish I could hold ya, never let you leave
 Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up
 If you wanna hear your voice inside of me
 I'll drink it up and you're alive in me
 Then I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up, bottle you up

 Right now you're mine
 But we're running out of time
 It's part of the rush, it's taking me high
 You know it kills me
 We can't always be right here
 'Cause right now you love me
 Then you disappear

 Wish I could always have you here with me
 Wish I could hold ya, never let you leave
 Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up
 If you wanna hear your voice inside of me,
 I'll drink it up and you're alive in me
 Then I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up

 Wish I could always have you here with me (here with me)
 Wish I could hold ya, never let you leave
 Wish I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up
 If you wanna hear your voice inside of me,
 I'll drink it up and you're alive in me
 When I can put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Then I could put it away, save it for a rainy day
 Wish I could bottle you up
 Bottle you up---Lyrics submitted by naomi neal.
