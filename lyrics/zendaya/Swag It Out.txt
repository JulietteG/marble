Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-gonna swag it out [x5]

[Verse 1]
Don't watch me watch the t-t-tv
I'm swaggin' when you se-e-e me
I'm shining bright you'll fall in lo-o-o-ove (in love)
I'm a rider, I ride like a harley
Start it up and start up the party
Livin' it up swag it out my way
Nicki Minaj havin' "Pink Fridays"
Shalalala make lots of paper
Nananana don't trip off haters
Got my hair it's done, my nails they're done
Swaggin' so hard
So all eyes are on me

[Chorus]
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-gonna swag it out [x4]

[Verse 2]
Pretty like Beyonc, big time like Kanye
Imma rock out rock out like Green Day
Imma act out act on no screen play
Swag it out Whassup?
I really wanna I promise that I'm gonna
Swag it all out show off like a stunner
I really wanna I promise that I'm gonna
Swag it all out stay hotter than the summer

[Pre Chorus]
Shalalala make lots of paper
Nananana don't trip off haters
My hair it's done, my nails they're done
Swaggin' so hard
So all eyes are on me

[Chorus]
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-gonna swag it out [x4]

[Bridge]
Let the bass bang
Throw your hands in the air (air, air)
Hands in the air (air, air)
Throw-Throw your hands in the air (throw your hands in the air)
Let the bass bang
And throw your hands in the air
H-H-hands in the air
Throw-Throw your hands in the air

[Chorus]
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-gonna swag it out [x4]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ---
