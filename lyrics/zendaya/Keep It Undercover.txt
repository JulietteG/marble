Oh, when danger come to you 
You know I'll stand beside you 
Cause ain't nobody keep their head so cool 
I always find a way, a way out of the fire 
But don't tell nobody, tell nobody 

I'm not perfect, so many things I 
Wanna tell you, but I 
I keep it undercover 

Living my life on red alert 
Doing my thing, gon' make it work 
Know I'm the realest 
Baby I'm fearless 
But I always got your back 
Nobody can do it like I can 
I gotta find out who I am 
Ain't gotta worry, about me 
It's all part of the plan 

I keep it undercover 
I keep it undercover 

You know, I'll always find the truth 
No matter where it's hiding 
So you can always run but you can't hide 
Keep it classified 
I'll always come out fighting 
Cause it's all or nothing 
All or nothing 

If you're back's against the wall 
Then all you gotta do is call me 
I'm doing the impossible 
So you just gotta trust me 
Ya ain't gotta worry about it 
Ain't gotta ever doubt it 
I'll be there no matter what it takes 
I keep it undercover---
