(dig down, dig down,)
(dig down, dig down)

(dig down deep and break the street)
(dig down, dig down)
(dig down deep and break the street)
(dig down, dig down)

you can watch your garden grow,
and skim along the surface, and take it slow,
just let nature have its way,
and let your little flowers bloom where they may,

(chorus)
if you dig down deeper, (dig down deeper)
under the ground, (ooh yeah)
you gotta dig down deeper, girl you can,
if you're wanting to win, 
then you better begin,
to get a little bit dirty and 
dig
deep 
down

(ooh yeah-ah)

you can keep things as they always been,
and you'll never leave the row you been planting in,
take a chance, and make the leap,
cause any thing can happen when you dig down deep,

so dig down deeper, (ooh-oh yeah)
under the ground, (under the ground)
you gotta dig down deeper, girl you can,
if you're wanting to win, 
then you better begin,
to get a little bit dirty and 
dig
deep 
down
yeah,yeah

come on and dig deep down!

(dig down deep and break the street)
(dig down deep and break the street)
(dig down deep and break the street)
(dig down, dig down)
(dig down deep and break the street)

(ahhhhh)

so you decide to make your stand,
step up and put the world to shame,
there may be mud upon your head,
but you didnt choose this game,
(no, no no no)
you dont wanna lose this game

so dig down deeper, (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
under the ground (under the ground)
you gotta dig down deeper, girl you can,
if you're wanting to win,
(if your wanting to win)
then you better begin,
to get a little bit dirty and 
dig
deep 
down

you gotta dig deep down yeah!

(dig down deep and break the street)
(dig down, dig down)
(dig down deep and break the street)

oh, you gotta dig deep down.---Lyrics submitted by lucy.
