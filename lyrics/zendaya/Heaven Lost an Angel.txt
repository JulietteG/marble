I'm walking like a model 
 He watching like Movado 
 We act like where the spaces
 Get down like where the bases
 I'm real though, you want the deal though
 You're so hot, I'm so frozen 
 Got my heart in the choco, 
 Love on overload 

 Real recognize real 
 And I know that's what you are, yeah 
 Like a hundred dollar bill
 Quick frankly, I've been waiting this way time with you 
 Time with you

 Pre-Chorus:
 Somebody turn the heads down for me 
 Don't take your eyes off of me 
 Just keep your eyes all over me 
 Somebody turn the lights down 
 For me, the only place I need to be 
 It's right here with you next to me, next to me 

 Chorus:
 And I know, I know, I know, 
 Heaven lost an angel .. tonight 
 And I know, I know, I know, 
 Heaven lost an angel 
 'cause you're right here, getting right here 
 Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me 
 Heaven lost an angel 'cause you're right here yeah right here 
 Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me 
 Heaven lost an angel.. tonight tonight 

 I hope you throw on, if not 
 Not need em just like you 
 I know God we're having fun 
 When you know that extra time on you 

 Pre-Chorus:
 Can somebody turn the lights down for me 
 Don't take your eyes off of me 
 Just keep your eyes all over me 
 Somebody turn the lights down 
 For me, the only place I need to be 
 It's right here with you next to me, next to me

 Chorus:
 And I know, I know, I know, 
 Heaven lost an angel .. tonight 
 And I know, I know, I know, 
 Heaven lost an angel 
 'cause you're right here, getting right here 
 Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me 
 Heaven lost an angel 'cause you're right here yeah right here 
 Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me 
 Heaven lost an angel.. tonight tonight 


 I'm walking like a model 
 He watching like Movado 
 We act like where the spaces
 Get down like where the bases
 I'm real though, you want the deal though
 You're so hot, I'm so frozen 
 Got my heart in the choco, 
 Love on overload
