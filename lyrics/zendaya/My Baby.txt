[Chorus:]
We should have listened to each others hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby - [2x]

Still we beat thats how Im feeling,
Let' em know we in the buildin'
From the floor up to the ceiling
If you bout it lets start chillin
Doing moving we can party
Whos in our business? Everybody
But its alright cause Im still living
Like 2 Chainz baby Im different, come here now

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me tell you little some little some
That you might wanna know about me
I dont play no game, baby listen
Baby you can love me then come show me!

[Chorus:]
We should have listened to each others hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby - [2x]

Darling we should take a ride
Cruising, flirting while we drive
Nothing could come kill our vibe
Got no worries on my mind
Now were living, living good
Young and misunderstood,
Got me tripping, you drive me crazy
You know you wanna be my baby.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me tell you little some little some
That you might wanna know about me
I dont play no game, baby listen
Baby you can love me then come show me!

[Chorus:]
We should have listened to each others hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby - [2x]

Even though Im on the grind
Think about you all the time
Now I know, that youre the one
Lets have fun, have fun, now we on.

[Chorus:]
We should have listened to each others hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you bout that action

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby - [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Aalyah.
