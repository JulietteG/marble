Whenever I was frightened
Or if I ever felt alone
I turned to the night sky
And a star I call my own
Somewhere I could run to
Just across the Milky Way
If you like I could take you
It's just a light year and a day

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
Bring us back home
In a place so far away
We'll be young that's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command
When we find ourselves in Never Neverland

Through all my make believe
There's some reality
In your reflection
There's much more than you see
All that you hope for
You hope for today
Is the love someone gives you
In an unconditional way

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
Bring us back home
In a place so far away
We'll be young that's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command
When we find ourselves in Never Neverland

Picture a land you never have seen
Life is eternal and evergreen
Future of happiness all in your hands
All in this place I created
That I call Neverland

We can sail away tonight
On a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars
To bring us back home
In a place so far away
We'll be young that's how we'll stay
And with your hand in my hand
I am closer now
To finding Neverland

And with your hand in my hand
I am closer now
To finding Neverland
Neverland
Neverland---
