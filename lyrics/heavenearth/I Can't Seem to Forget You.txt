I can't seem to forget you
I can't seem to forget you
Ummm hummm
it seems my heart is aching all the time
and the thought of you
stays in the back of my mind
I can't let that catch me
I can't even fake
(la la la la la)
Enemies to me 
I felt the whole human race
(la la la la la)
Hard times, together we face
and oh I haven't found nobody
to take your place

so tell me
howwwwwwwwwww
can I forget you

howwwwwwwwwww
(I can't seem to, I can't seem to)
can I (I can't seem to) forget you
forget you

I was through, I was through,
so very through
when you come to see me 
I would act just like a fool
My friends, they were calling me
they say how can this be
(la la la la la)
A sweet young lady like yourself
digging a fool like me
(la la la la la)

but hard times, together we face
and oh I haven't found nobody
to take your place

so tell me
howwwwwwwwwww
can I forget you

I........ can't seem to forget you
forget you hooo
(ooo oooo oooo ooooo)
(la la la la la)

(ooo oooo oooo ooo ooo)
(la la la la la)

(ooo oooo oooo ooo ooo)
(la la la la la)

(ooo oooo oooo ooo ooo)
(la la la la la)

I........ can't forget you
no baby

I......... (ooo oooo oooo ooooo)
(la la la la la) can't  seem 
to forget you (ooo oooo oooo ooooo)
(la la la la la)Noooo
no no baby

I can't forget you

I......... (I can't seem to, I can't seem to)
can't seem (I can't seem to) to forget you

I........ can't seem to forget you
(ooo oooo oooo ooooo)
(la la la la la)

(ooo oooo oooo ooooo)
