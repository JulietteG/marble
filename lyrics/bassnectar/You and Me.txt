(feat. W. Darling)

Here we are
On the road together
Racing time
You & I

Trying to climb
The snakes and ladders
Then block the shine
And blind your eyes

'Cause it's easy to feel weighed down
And it's easy to blame ourselves
When the sky is filled up with clouds
Raining down, yeah

'Cause it's you and me against the world now
And it's you and me against the world now
'Cause it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me
It's you and me
It's you and me
Against the world

Oh it's you and me against the world
And it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world now
And it's you and me against the world
And it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world now

Waiting now
On the side of nowhere
Spinning tires
Worn and tired

Reading maps
Lead us somewhere
We didn't plan
But here we stand

And it's easy to feel weighed down
And it's easy to blame ourselves
When the sky is filled up with clouds
Raining down

'Cause it's you and me against the world now
And it's you and me against the world now
'Cause it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world now

Oh it's you and me against the world
And it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world now
And it's you and me against the world
And it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world now ---
