It's gonna be kicking hard cause it's ugly
This beat will knock your ass down cause it's ugly
Hey, we're rolling through your town looking ugly
And we're moving all around looking ugly
And we moving all around, moving moving all around
And we moving all around looking ugly
And we moving all around, moving moving all around
We don't want ... cause it's ugly

Ugly, ugly,
Sometimes it gets ugly
And we moving all around, moving moving all around
And we moving all around, moving moving all around
And we moving all around 

Ugly, ugly,
Sometimes it gets ugly
And we moving all around, moving moving all around
And we moving all around, moving moving all around
And we moving all around---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
