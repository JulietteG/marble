Even though they werent with us too long
Your life is the most precious thing that we could lose
While you were here the fun was neverending
Laugh a minute only the beginning
Jason (my brother)
Matthew Thirsk this ones for you

Present past and beyond
Even though they werent with us too long
Your life is the most precious thing that we could lose
While you were here the fun was neverending
Laugh a minute only the beginning
Jason (my brother)
Matthew Thirsk this ones for you

To our best friend,
Present past and beyond
Even though they werent with us too long
Your life is the most precious thing that we could lose
While you were here the fun was neverending
Laugh a minute only the beginning
Jason (my brother)
Matthew Thirsk this ones for you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
