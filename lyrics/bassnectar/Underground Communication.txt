Lost, now we can all get a piece of it
Peace never preceded the people from the peacefulness
Greedy illegitimate, democratic republicans
sell guns for fun, indigenous exterminates

Listen, Love, One world nation
True clear channel with rhythm and information
Internet connect, network private stations
Media free, Underground Communication---Lyrics submitted by Reigh.
