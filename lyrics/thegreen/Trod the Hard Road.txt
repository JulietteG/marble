Trod the long road my hidren, Only love rastafari 
Trod the hard road my sistren, Will you wait for me near thee end?  

Cause I'll be there. I'll be there.
Cause the rain, cause the rain will fall and the night is cold. A little rest for my body and such. 
Sitting and thinking.
Trying not to think too much. 
Im smoking, you're drinking. 
Try your best to call my bluff, you're hearing that I'm leaving. 
Stay awhile now please don't rush make the most cause lifes with time is not really made up. 

(Repeat first verse)
Trod the long road my hidren, Only love rastafari 
Trod the hard road my sistren, Will you wait for me near thee end? 

Just like soul mates from a time long ago. and the memories flow just like water from the sea from the rivers past the trees down the mountain from the clouds below, the sky above.  
(Repeat verse 2x)
Trod the long road my hidren, Only love rastafari 
Trod the hard road my sistren, Will you wait for me near thee end?---Lyrics submitted by Nessa.
