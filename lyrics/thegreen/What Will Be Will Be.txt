CHORUS:
I can feel it in the way, read it in the signs,
Catch it on the warmest breeze. And watch it come from above
And wait a little bit longer what will be will be.
I can feel it in the way, read it in the signs,
Catch it on the warmest breeze. And watch it come from above
And wait a little bit longer what will be will be.

VERSE 1:
Out here in the country. sky and water both clean and clear.
Rub a dubbin in the jungle. Say we feel so nice wanna stay right here.
Cooking dinner in a big black pot with an open fire and a smokey haze.
Congregating in a big open circle cause we pass round the chalice
Make we give jah praise.

CHORUS:
I can feel it in the way, read it in the signs,
Catch it on the warmest breeze. And watch it come from above
And wait a little bit longer what will be will be.
I can feel it in the way, read it in the signs,
Catch it on the warmest breeze. And watch it come from above
And wait a little bit longer what will be will be.

VERSE 2:
Playing music til the early morning
Cause it raise I man to a higher place
A cup of mate just to keep I warm
And a little bit of honey puts a smile on my face.
Stars above will be shining bright
In a the pale moon light coming down on you.
Come the morning feel the open ocean set these wheels in motion
Weve got work to do.

CHORUS:
I can feel it in the way, read it in the signs,
Catch it on the warmest breeze. And watch it come from above
And wait a little bit longer what will be will be.
I can feel it in the way, read it in the signs,
Catch it on the warmest breeze. And watch it come from above
And wait a little bit longer what will be will be.---
