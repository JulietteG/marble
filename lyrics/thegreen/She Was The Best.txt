Chorus:
Oooohhh tell me I, now tell me baby!
She was the best, cause she always came running 
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!
She was the best, cause she always came running
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!

Well, when she greet em with a smile,
Oh yes she greet me with a kiss
Never alone she leaves, yeah
Just ask her wait a while until I come along
Cause never alone she leaves, yeah
No, she never leaves me alone
No, she never leaves em alone!

Chorus: 
She was the best, cause she always came running 
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!
She was the best, cause she always came running
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!

Oh, and she always come around
Every time Im feeling down
Cause never alone she leaves me!
And she always bring my style
When my times are feeling odd
Cause never alone she leaves me!
She dont waste my time, no
Yeah, when she comes around, oh, with joy
Cause never alone she leaves em, baby, no, no
No, she never leaves em alone, uh, yeah, yeah!

Chorus: 
She was the best, cause she always came running 
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!
She was the best, cause she always came running
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!

She was the best, she was the best, girl
She was the best, she was the best, girl

She was the best, cause she always came running 
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!
She was the best, cause she always came running
Always came running to me!
Thinking about her how she loved and was loved,
Loved and was loved by me!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
