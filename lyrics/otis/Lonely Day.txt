Once, I was of the mind
to be like you.
Dead days.
Calling me the way I like her to.

Give it all away.
You know it's all
the same to you.

Make the plans to
leave the lonely day.
( Lonely day )

You bring me down,
recovering the only 
thing I need.

When you come down,
you're looking like you
always do to me.

No one, 
ever told me love
could cry like you.

These days.
Pass me by the way 
I like them to.

Give it all away.
Get it all away to you.

Make your plans to leave
the lonely day.
( Lonely day )

You bring me down,
recovering the only thing
I need.

When you come down,
you're looking like you
always do to me.

You know I need it,
all the time.

Give it all away.
You know it's all the
same to you.

Make your plans to 
leave the lonely day.---Lyrics submitted by Gabriel Crespo.
