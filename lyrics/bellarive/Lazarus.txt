Out of place, a permanent condition
Taking by the night.
This burning flesh cant find a reason
To breathe in again.
He said

Come out!
Come out from your hiding!
And just how you are,
Come out from the dark!

Even when the dead mans sleeping!
Resurrection calls to restore
Even here and now you are one hes calling for.
So take your place and break the night
Strange into the light,
Wind of guide, dig up the grace
Breathe into the slay!

Hes for sure a permanent solution,
Swallowed up the night.
A voice so pure giving bones a reason
To breathe in again!
Well, he said

Come out!
Come out from your hiding!
And just as you are,
Come out from the dark!

Even when the dead mans sleeping!
Resurrection calls to restore
Even here and now you are one hes calling for.
So sleep no more!
So take your place and break the night
Strange into the light,
The wounds of time to the grace
Came breathing into this life!
Came breathing into this life!
Breathe into this life!---
