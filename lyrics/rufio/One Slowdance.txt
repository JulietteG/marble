Youre standing there alone
And so am I
But I want you here by
My side
Youre smile at me
Is everything
The (stare)staring game
That song of love

I look you in the eyes
I tried to read your thoughts
I ask you to go with me
To a far off place ohh
I look you in the eyes
I tried to read your thoughts
I ask you to go with me
To a far off place

Cho:
You and me dancin tonight (away)
You can feel my heart beating so hard
We look eye to eye and Im swept away
On the moonlit walk on the beach
Watchin the sunrise for the first time
Im in a trance
With that one slow dance (from d top)

We dont have to talk
We dont have to laugh at all
I just want you here with me
We dont have to talk
We dont have to laugh at all
I just want to be
You and me(Cho:)---Lyrics submitted by monbe.
