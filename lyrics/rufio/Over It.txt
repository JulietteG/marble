guy: Hello
girl:Hey, do you know what
I don't need this
You know, I cannot believe you
...Over her
And why you gotta lie about it
That's it, I'm over it"

Everytime I saw you
Trying to pretend
Now, I think you're caught in...
A spin

Said that I could trust
You'd be my everything
Falling from the shadows
Now, I see...

All of those times were wasted
When you tried to hide it from me (oh, oh)

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it (I'm over it)

So why is it so hard to see (I'm over)
All the lies you tell me (I'm over)
I'm getting out, I'm moving on (I'm over)
I'm over it (I'm over it)

I'm over it (I'm over it)
I'm over it (I'm over it)
(I'm over it)

Tried to walk away
But my heart was sayin' no.
Can't believe it took so...
Long to go

Now, the past is fading
I hardly know your name
Don't know what you're doin'
Ya lost the game

All of those times were wasted
When you tried to hide it from me

I don't care what you're sayin' (I don't care)
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it (I'm over it)

So why is it so hard to see (I'm over)
All the lies you tell me (I'm over)
I'm getting out, I'm moving on (I'm over)
I'm over it (I'm over it)

I don't care (I'm over it)
Never (I'm over it) (I'm over it)
So, why is it gettin' (I'm over) (I'm over it)

(I'm over it)
I'm over it (I'm over)

I don't care what you're sayin' (I'm over)
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me (I'm over)
I'm over it (I'm over)

So why is it so hard to see (I'm over)
All the lies you tell me
I'm getting out, I'm moving on (I'm over)
I'm over it (I'm over it)

I don't care what you're sayin' (I'm over)
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me (I'm over)
I'm over it (I'm over)

So why is it so hard to see (I'm over)
All the lies you tell me
I'm getting out, I'm moving on (I'm over)
I'm over it (I'm over)

I'm over it (I'm over it)
I'm over it (uh, huh)
I'm over it (I'm over it)
I'm over it (I'm over it)
I'm over it (I'm over it)
I'm over it (I'm over it)
I'm over it (I'm over it)---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
