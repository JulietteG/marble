I'm wishing you a-well
Mind and peace within your cell
Covers up, I cast you off
I'll be watching as you breathe
I lie still, you move, I send you
Off Around The Bend

I hold your head deep in my arms
My fingertips, they close your eyes
Off you dream, my little child
There's a sun Around The Bend, yeah
There's a sun Around The Bend

All the evenings close like this
All these moments that I've missed
Please forgive me, wont you dear
Please forgive and let me share
With you Around The Bend

You're an angel when you sleep
How I want your soul to keep
On and on Around The Bend---Lyrics submitted by William.
