Consider me an object, put me in a vacuum
Free of all conditions, free of any friction
And I'll be hangin upside down and there I will swing
For all eternity

Feel it risin, yeah, next stop fallin
Feel it risin, comatose, and oh here I fall, yeah

Consider me a absess, leave me in my vacuum
Runnin all the pistons, runnin my transmission

Feel it risin, yeah, next stop fallin
Feel it risin, comatose, and oh here I fall, yeah
Feel it risin, yeah, next stop fallin
Feel it risin

Oh, high above, I'll break the law
If its illegal to be in love 
Leave the hatred on the cross

Yeah, I'll be hangin upside down and there I will swing
For all eternity

Feel it risin, yeah next stop fallin
Feel it risin, comatose, and oh here I fall, yeah
Feel it risin, yeah next stop fallin
Feel it risin, something never thought to be bothered---Lyrics submitted by William.
