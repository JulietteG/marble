How long must she stand
Before the ground, it gives way to an endless fall
She can feel this war on her face
Stars on her pillow, she's folding in darkness
Begging for slumber

I'm not blind, I can see it coming
Looks like lightning in my child's eye
I'm not frantic, I can feel it coming
Violently shakes my body

Her son's slanted, always giving her the sideways eye
An empty chair were dad sits, how loud can silence get?
And mom, she reassures to contain him
But its becoming a lie
She tells herself and everyone else
Father is risking his life for our freedoms

I'm not blind, I can see it coming
Looks like lightning in my child's eye
I'm not frantic, I can feel it coming
Darling, you'll save me if you save yourself---Lyrics submitted by William.
