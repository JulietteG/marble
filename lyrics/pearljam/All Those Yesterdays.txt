Dont you think you oughta rest
Dont you think you oughta lay your head down
Dont you think you wanna sleep
Dont you think you oughta lay your down tonight

Dont you think you've done enough
Ah, dont you think you got enough, well maybe
You dont think there's time to stop
There's time enough for you to lay your head down tonight, tonight

Let it wash away all those yesterdays

What are you running from, taking pills to get along
Creating walls to call your own
So no one catches you drifting off and doing all the things that we all do

Ah, let them wash away all those yesterdays
All those yesterdays, all those yesterdays, all those yesterdays
All those paper plates, all those yesterdays, all those yesterdays


You've got time, you've time to escape
There's still time, its no crime to escape
Its no crime to escape, its no crime to escape
There's still time so escape
Its no crime, I know you cry

All those yesterdays, all those yesterdays---Lyrics submitted by William.
