The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here and I'm a mess
I'll take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head

I don't wanna take what you can't give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I can't walk
Guess I'll lie alone, just like before

I'll take the varmint's path
Oh, and I must refuse your test
Ah, push me and I will resist
This behavior's not unique 

I don't wanna hear from those who know
They can buy, but can't put on my clothes
I don't wanna limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
I don't wanna be held in your debt
I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed
I'm already cut up and half dead
I'll end up alone, like I began

Everything has changed
Absolutely nothing has changed
Take my hand, not my picture, spilled my tincture

I don't wanna take what you can't give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
All the things that others want for me 
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't be what you want because I'm...

I ain't supposed to be just fun
Oh, live and die, let it be done
I figure I'll be damned
All alone, like I began

(It's your move now
I thought you were a friend, but I guess...
I guess I hate you)---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
