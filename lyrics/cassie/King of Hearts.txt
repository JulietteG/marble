You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts

If you're winning
You might as well admit it
And looking come and get it
Boy you can just forget it, forget it
If you're winning
You might as well admit it
And looking come and get it
Boy you can just forget it, forget it

You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts

You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts

Hear what you saying
Baby how you came in
It's obvious you playing
But you can just keep playing me, keep playing me

Keep playing, baby why you playing
It's obvious you gaming
But you can just keep playing me, keep playing me

You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts

You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts

And we go, and we go go go go
Boy we go, and we go go go go
King of hearts
King of hearts
King of hearts
King of hearts

You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts

And we go, and we go go go go
Boy we go, and we go go go go---
