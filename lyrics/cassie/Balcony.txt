I dont wanna scream, I dont even wanna tell you
How good it is,
Because if its a dream
Id only wake myself up
And baby I dont wanna ruin this
Honestly, I was scared cause
I know you, were prepared
And you know what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares
The same love on the balcony
Right there in New York city
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square in New York City
Its the world baby
She sassy, she classy, hair like she Cassie
Say why your voices so raspy
Uh, I hope she nasty
Last night, good kush and Sirrock with a super freak
Told him put it on my black card,
Get it super sweet
We can do it right now girl, I dont give a fuck
Right here in the valley, we can do it in the truck
Got her legs on the dashboard, yeah I got a boulder
Dont know if the kush heat with the 
Go, but Ill be back though
Had a couple drinks, later air it was perfect
The  enjoying the scene, now breathe
We couldnt help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew, through my hair love
I stunned by your stare
From the sight of you, standing there love
I could walk, walk on air
Then we made love on balcony
Right there in New York city
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was mine
I told her look, baby talk to me, you know Ima talk 
You know that tic talk yeah you gonna get the
Look I got you soaking wet
Yeah you my needle white, swish
Turn it right,
Tear you like Im Kevin Hard, you gonn learn tonight
I aint no funny nigga nah I aint got jokes
Wake up in the morning tell your girls that you got choked
Bust it wide open, turn it up, blew it back
Turn that presidential suite, swerving deep, like a crack house
Were at the rich and I got her on the balcony
One stop shop aint nobody coming after me
Then we made love on balcony
Right there in New York city
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was ours
Turn the lights on.---Lyrics submitted by babydisaXo.
