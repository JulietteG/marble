If it don't stop raining 
I Think I'll lock myself indoors with you
Keep you entertained until the sky outside is clear and blue
On four slippery tires we'll roll down the turnpike
The moon turns the night sky to fire and wine
I got a pillow we can both lay our heads on 
She's got that beautiful look in her eye

If you trust me I can show you 
I'm the one you're dreaming of 
It would be much easier 
If I could learn to trust myself
Well I have a feeling my words have more meaning
Than they ever may have held in the past
The wind has been blowing in a whole new direction
A new world is blooming as we watch the sunrise

Dance on moonbeams, bathe in sunlight
Sleep beside a baby stream
There's a happiness that lies beneath the shade of every tree

If I've got a voice, and you've got your voice
And we put our voices together as one
Maybe we could sing a song to catch the ears of everyone
(Humming)

Well it's too bad we're too scared to take back our voices
'Cause the people who stole them have the money and guns
Out  here there's none of those troubles and worries
Out here it's just you, me, and sweet mother earth---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
