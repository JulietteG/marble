(Feat. Tiff Lacey)

Hey sunshine, where did you come from?
And youre all mine, my miracle from God
I love to have you in my life, lucky you're young
To make you smile is my delight
Its always in my plan
Did you know I count my blessings every day?
I see you

My very own little ray of sunshine
So special, so sweet, and all mine
My very own little ray of sunshine
You chase them away with your smile

Hey sunshine, I love to kiss you
When youre not around sometimes
O how much I miss you
I love to have you in my life, lucky you're young
To make you smile is my delight
Its always in my plan
Did you know I count my blessings every day?
I see you

My very own little ray of sunshine
So special, so sweet, and all mine
My very own little ray of sunshine
You chase them away with your smile

My very own little ray of sunshine
So special, so sweet, and all mine
My very own little ray of sunshine
You chase them away with your smile

With your smile
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah

My very own little ray of sunshine
So special, so sweet, and all mine
My very own little ray of sunshine
You chase them away with your smile

My very own little ray of sunshine
So special, so sweet, and all mine
My very own little ray of sunshine
You chase them away with your smile

With your smile
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
