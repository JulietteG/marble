you know what simon says 
he tells you what to do
but if he told you to 
take off all your clothes and dance
in your birthday suit


sure it's the latest craze
we all get influenced
the little secret they 
don't want you to know,no,no..

(Chorus)
we're only humans seperated by are thoughts
so hang on to them or you'll find you might get caught..
caught up in the..
hey monkey see and monkey do
musn't get brain washed by whats surrounding you
didn't you know that every little thing's contagious
oh yes, every little thing's contagious.


it's when you watch t.v.
and everything you see
the virus seeping through
and you start to want 
what they tell you you should want

it's in the air you breathe
it's hidden up their sleeves
their even marketing
what i say right now
watch out

(Chorus)

na na na na na na na
were only humans seperated
na na na na na na na
were only humans seperated
only humans seperated

caught up in the..

hey monkey see and monkey do
must I get brainwashed 
by what's surrounding you
didn't you know that
every little thing's contagious
oh yes every little thing's contagious

hey monkey see and monkey do
must I get brainwashed 
by what's surrounding you
didn't you know that
every little thing's contagious
oh yes every little thing's contagious---Lyrics submitted by lexi.
