Bang, boom, the beat
My baby is the bang, the boom, the beat
Bang, boom, the beat
My baby is the bang, the boom, the beat
Bang, boom, the beat
My baby is the bang, the boom, the beat

My boyfriend is music
My boyfriend is music
Yeah, music is my boyfriend
He never takes the pressure off [x2]

At night on my pillow
The beat says hello
He knows I'm gonna follow
My headphones are on-a
His low end is thumping
Just me and him bumpin'
The walls they are watchin'
I'm turning red blushing
You know that

I don't need no silly boys
I just need my boyfriend
I don't need no silly boys
I just need my boyfriend
Don't you know
Don't you know that

My boyfriend is bang, the boom, the beat
He's beatin' down the door to get to me
Yeah music is the shock, the shake, the shit
The needle in the groove, the grind, the grit
My boyfriend is music

My boyfriend is music
My boyfriend is music
Yeah, music is my boyfriend
He never takes the pressure off [x2]

Get up to go shower
I'm dancing for hours
He knows the way I like it
He knows just how I want it
You see my hips swaying
The moment's delaying
It's inside my body
My boyfriends a hottie
You know that

I don't need no silly boys
I just need my boyfriend
I don't need no silly boys
I just need my boyfriend
Don't you know
Don't you know that

My boyfriend is bang, the boom, the beat
He's beatin' down the door to get to me
Yeah music is the shock, the shake, the shit
The needle in the groove, the grind, the grit
My boyfriend is music

He's making me lose it
I'll sing along lalalalala
My boyfriend is music
He's making me lose it
I'll sing along lalalalala
Lalalalala
I'll sing along lalalala
My boyfriend is music
He's making me lose it
I'll sing along lalalala
lalalalala

Bang, the boom the beat
He's beatin' down the door to get to me
You know that he's the shock, the shake, the shit
The needle in the groove, the grind, the grit

My boyfriend is bang, the boom, the beat
He's beatin' down the door to get to me
Yeah music is the shock, the shake, the shit
The needle in the groove, the grind, the grit
My boyfriend is grit
My boyfriend is grit
My boyfriend is music---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
