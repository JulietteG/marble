Don't ignore my call
Cuz I got a lot to say
Gonna tell you what went wrong
Why I had to run away

'Cuz youre in my face
Always on my case
I just need some space
Away from you

I need a Vacation cation cation!
Yeah, I need a Vacation cation cation!
There's nothing you can do
Does it matter where I go
Just as long as it's away from you

No more stupid fights
No more searching through my phone
Feels like paradise
When I think about beein' alone

'Cuz youre in my face
Always on my case
I just need some space
Away from you

I need a Vacation cation cation!
Yeah, I need a Vacation cation cation!
There's nothing you can do
Does it matter where I go
Just as long as it's away from you

I need a Vacation cation cation!

Just as long as it's away from you

I need a Vacation cation cation!

There's nothing you can do
Does it matter where I go
Just as long as it's away from you

WOAHHOO!!!
I don't need you anymore and
WOAHHOO!!!
now it is my turn to take control

I need a Vacation cation cation!
Yeah, I need a Vacation cation cation!
There's nothing you can do
Does it matter where I go
Just as long as it's away from you

I need a Vacation cation cation!
