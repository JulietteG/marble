Nobody knows where we come from
Nobody knows where we go
We live and die, we fall and fly
Into the greater no

And a bird will cross the ocean
For a place shes never known
Shell get there on a silent prayer
On a long, long way back home

You the birds beside me now
That draws me tour the sun
And whispers in my darkest dark
Another day will come

Dear sweet forgiveness
For the hard road we have known
We will walk together
On our long, long way back home

There is one Jerusalem
Where believers come to pray
They making a lifetime journey
And its always been that way


You are my true companion
On this journey of my soul
You fill my life with loving
On our long, long way back home

Youre the face beside me now
That warms me like the sun
And even in my darkest dark
Another day will come

Though my breath will forsake me
You will never be alone
Ill be there beside you
On our long, long way back home

Ill be there beside you
On our long, long way back home---Lyrics submitted by Sandie Grosmann.
