Laying here feeling so rough 
Guess the pink bubbles didn't do enough 
To cover up the way I feel 
What's the point in wearing these heels? 
Still my make-up's on 
Mascara's run 
Not sure if it was tears or heavy one 
I'm losing it, but now you're gone 

You got me singing a sad song 
Ooh oh oh it's cold sleeping in this bed alone 
Oooh oh oh I just wanna let you know 
I've been living in denial 
Trying to raise a smile, life is picking on me, me, me 
Looking at your pictures, 
Who's that bitch with ya 
She ain't a patch on me 

'Cause you're in California 
And I'm in London city, ay 
Tell what have I done, done, done to deserve this 
Ooh oh oh 
'Cause you're in California, ay 
And I'm in London city, ay 
Tell what have I done, done, done to deserve this 

You're full of shit, she's buying it 
You got yourself a hole 
Go and lie in it! 
If that's a game, well nothing's changed 
I still want you the same 
This ain't me, I've been weak 
I'm so sick of this hide and seek 
I'm losing it, but now you're gone 

You got me singing a sad song 
Ooh oh oh it's cold sleeping in this bed alone 
Oooh oh oh I just wanna let you know 
I've been living in denial 
Tryina raise a smile, life is picking on me, me, me 
Looking at your pictures, 
Who's that bitch with you 
She ain't a patch on me!! 

'Cause you're in California 
And I'm in London city, ay 
Tell what have I done, done, done to deserve this 
Ooh oh oh 
'Cause you're in California, ay 
And I'm in London city, ay 
Tell what have I done, done, done to deserve this 

Can you make me feel better? 
(I'll make you feel better) 
Come on make me feel alright 
Gimme some whatever, 
Something that will get me through the night 

Ooh oh oh it's cold sleeping in this bed alone 
Oooh oh oh I just wanna let you know 
I've been living in denial 
Tryina raise a smile, life is picking on me, me, me 
Looking at your pictures, 
Who's that with you 
She ain't a patch on me!! 

'Cause you're in California 
And I'm in London city, ay 
Tell what have I done, done, done to deserve this 
Ooh oh oh 
'Cause you're in California, ay 
And I'm in London city, ay 
Tell what have I done, done, done to deserve this---
