Tripping out 
Spinning around 
I'm underground, I fell down 
yeah, I fell down 

I'm freaking out 
Where am I now? 
Upside down 
And I can't stop it now 
You can't stop me now 

I, I'll get by 
I, I'll survive 
When the world's crashing down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop it 
I, I won't cry 

I found myself in Wonderland 
Get back on my feet again 
Is this real? 
Is it pretended? 
I'll take a stand until the end 

I, I'll get by 
I, I'll survive 
When the world's crashing down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop it? 
I, I won't cry	

I, I'll get by 
I, I'll survive 
When the world's crashing down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop it? 
I, and I won't cry---Lyrics submitted by Shanell.
