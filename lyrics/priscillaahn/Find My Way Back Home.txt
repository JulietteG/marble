Don't you go,
Away, I know,
Without your love,
I'll never find my way back home

'Cause you and me,
So happily,
Make all our dreams of make believe reality

La la la La la la La la la la la

Troubles, never find us there
Oh, bubbles, float through the air,
Float through the air
Float through the air air air air

La la la La la la La la la la la

So don't you go,
Away, I know,
Without your love,
I'll never find my way back home,
I'll never find my way back home,
No, no,
I'll never find my way back home,
No, no,
I'll never find my way back home.---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
