Just watch the sunrise
On the other side of town
Once more I've waited
And once more you've let me down

This would be the perfect time
For me to die
So I'd like to take this
Opportunity to cry

You gave your word
Now I return it to you
With this suggestion
As to what you can do

Just exchange the words "I love you" 
For goodbye
While I take this
Opportunity to cry

I'd like to see you
But I'm afraid
I don't know wrong from right
And if i saw you
Would I kiss you
Or want to kill you on sight?

It's been a long night
So I think I'll go home
And feed my nightmares---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
