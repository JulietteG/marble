Morning sunrise
Open my eyes

I can tell it's gonna be
A good day
I can tell it's gonna be
A good day

Did you sleep well?
Did you dream at all?
Can you tell me the time
On the alarm clock?

I can tell it's gonna be
A good day
I can tell it's gonna be
A good day

But you can sleep in
You just keep dreaming for us

I can tell it's gonna be
A good day
I can tell it's gonna be
A good day

A good day---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
