Stand up, stand on your own
That's what they tell me
You can make it alone

Where does it say I have to move
Far away from you
To prove I'm strong
Oh when, all it really proves
Is I'm lonely without you
And loneliness has to be wrong

I live for your love
Every minute
I live for your love
want you in it
I live for your love
I admit it
I live for your love

I wake up, with no one to kiss
Sometimes I wonder (wonder, wonder)
If I just exists

I know there are people I can see
Places I can be
And friends who call

Oh but, what good does it do
There's no substitute for you
I want you, or nothing at all

I live for your love
Every minute
I live for your love
want you in it
I live for your love
I admit it

I live for your love and your kisses
You know how I miss it
Your sweet tender touch
I need you so much that I just can't go on anymore
What I wouldn't give for
Cause darling

I live for your love
My baby, baby yeah
I live for your love, oooohhh---
