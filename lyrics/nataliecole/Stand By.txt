You've got to learn
You've got to learn how to follow the leader
You've got to turn
Turn off your pride and you're life will be sweeter

Love comes from God
Surely, surely, surely you can see that
If you check out your heart
There's a part that you're keeping from me

Why don't you hold on tight
Make this flight, we've got the whole night
Saddle up your gear
Have no fear, we are here, hey
Better make it soon
Give me room, come on and stand by me
Come on and stand by

'Cause there is no time, no time to sit
I'll bet you'll be quick about it
And I know you will
Once you learn that you can't live without it

Lord only knows how long
How long, how long I have waited
And the moment is near
Line 'em up, get 'em ready at the gate

We're gonna keep 'em strong
Moving on, we've got the whole night
No looking back
Where it's at, it's right now, hey
Better make it soon
Give me room, come on and stand by me

There's gonna be no looking back
So baby, take everything you'll ever need
Sure 'nough moving on, keep it strong
It's a whole new game and a brand new street

You know, uh, you said you would if you could
I'll make it good to ya
Don't you stop 'til we get to the top, hey
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do, stand by me

Hey, hey
If it's real, what you feel, come on and stand by
Don't you stop 'til we get to the top, hey
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do, stand by me
Come on and stand by

Ha, stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey

Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey

Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey

Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey

Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey
Stand by me, hey, hey, hey---
