Hey, Mr. Melody, you're on my mind constantly
And I think of you the whole day long
Hey, Mr. Melody, you mean the whole world to me
Without you I would have no song
Hey, Mr. Melody, you got me hummin' to your crazy beat
The more I hear it the more I like it
You really made a hit with me
Mr. Melody, Mr. Melody
You are my melody, you do the sweetest things to me
Please won't you stay here for all time
You are my melody, you're just as sweet as you can be
And it's good to know you're mine all the time (yeah)
Woh Mr. Melody, your lovin' ooh it makes me sing
I like lovin' you, you like lovin' me please don't ever change
Mr. Melody (Mr. Melody), Mr. Melody (Mr. Melody)

Mr. Melody, you got me hummin' to your crazy beat
The more I hear it, the more I like it
You really made a hit with me
Mr. Melody (Mr. Melody), Mr. Melody (Mr. Melody)---
