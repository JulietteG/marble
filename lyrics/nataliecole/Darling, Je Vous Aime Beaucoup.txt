Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
Je ne sais pas what to do
You know you've completely
Stolen my heart

Morning, noon and nighttime too
Toujours wondering what to do
That's the way I felt
Right from the start

Ah, cheri
My love for you is trs, trs fort
Wish my French were good enough
I'd tell you so much more

But I hope that you compris
All the little things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
I love you, yes I do

Wish my French were good enough
I'd tell you so much more
But I hope that you compris
All the things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
I love you, yes I do

I love you, yes I do---
