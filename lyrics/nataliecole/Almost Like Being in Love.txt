What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
there's a music of life; seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peel
I would swear I was falling, swear I was falling

- It's almost like being in love

The music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing just for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peel
I would swear i was falling, swear I was falling
- It's almost like being in love---
