Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

From the minute that you got my attention
I was taken and I have to mention
I was trying not to let it show
But I knew that I wasn't gonna let you go
From the way that you came right to me
Looking all hot with the style that threw me
No one would've ever known it
You would be the one who take this heart and hold it

You got that extraordinary way
Got to be next to ya every single day
You do something that I just can't explain
Wanna take the chance and tell you you're the one for me

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Do you know it
Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

You can say anything you want to
No stress 'cause I understand you
We got a vibe you can't define
Want everyone know that boy is mine
We won't fight and stop and stare at the way you hold me
You take me there at times
I feel I lose control
Forget everyone but the hand I'm holding

You got that extraordinary way
Got to be next to ya every single day
You do something that I just can't explain
Wanna take the chance and tell you you're the one for me

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Can you feel it
Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

Please know this
I'll always be right here
And you don't have to look
Nowhere else babe
Don't think for a minute
This love will change
Oh you should know that

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Can you feel it
Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Can you feel it
Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes, they'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know---Lyrics submitted by carlo.
