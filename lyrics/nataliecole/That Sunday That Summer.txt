(If I had to choose just one day) 
If I had to choose just one day to last my whole life through 
It would surely be that Sunday; the day that I met you 
Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills 
Summer was a coming in but fast 
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills 
Nodding all together, I can almost hear them whisper 
Go on kiss him; go on and kiss him 
If I had to choose one moment to live within my heart 
It would be that tender moment recalling how we started 
Darling it would be when you smiled at me 
That way, that Sunday, that Summer 

Go on kiss him; go on and kiss him 
And if I had to choose just one moment 
To live within my heart it would surely be that moment 
Recalling how we started 
Darling it would be when you smiled at me 
That way, that Sunday, that summer 
(If I had to choose just one day)---
