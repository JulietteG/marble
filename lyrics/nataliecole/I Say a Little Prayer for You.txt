the moment I wake up
before i put all my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
while combing my hair now
and wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you.

chorus
forever and ever you`ll stay in my heart
and I will love you
forever and ever, we ever will part oh,
how I love you
together, forever, that`s how it must be
lo live without you
would only meen heartbreak for me.

I run for the bus, dear,
while riding I think of us, dear,
I say a little prayer for you  
at work I just take time 
and all through my coffe break time
I say a little prayer for you

chorus
forever and ever you`ll stay in my heart
and I will love you
forever and ever, we ever will part oh,
how I love you
together, forever, that`s how it must be
lo live without you
would only meen heartbreak for me.

my darling belive me, 
(belive me)
for me there is no one but you 
please love me too 
(answer his prayer)
and I`m in love with you
(answer his prayer now babe)
answer my prayer now babe 
(answer his prayer)

chorus
forever and ever you`ll stay in my heart
and I will love you
forever and ever, we ever will part oh,
how I love you
together, forever, that`s how it must be
lo live without you
would only meen heartbreak for me. ooohhh---Lyrics submitted by Iliana.
