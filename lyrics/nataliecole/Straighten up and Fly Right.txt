A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air
Monkey thought that everything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
But the monkey grabbed his neck and said "Now listen, jack"

"Straighten up and fly right
"Straighten up and stay right
"Straighten up and fly right
"Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
"Ain't no use in divin'
"What's the use of jivin'
"Straighten up and fly right
"Cool down papa, don't you blow your top."

The buzzard told the monkey "You are chokin' me
"Release your hold, and I will set you free"
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye
And said "Your story's so touching but it sounds like a lie"

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa don't you blow your top

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in divin'
What's the use of jivin'
You better, straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa don't you blow your top

Fly right---
