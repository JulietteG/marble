(Oooo) that's all that matters (oooo)

I may never be the one that gets a second glance 
I may never be the one they call the prettiest
But that's alright with me 

And maybe I don't follow every crazy passion
Spend all my time trying to get a good reaction 
But that's okay with me 

This world is like a trampoline 
High and low no in between 
Jumping at the chance to please
Everyone but that's not me

Chorus:
'Cuz all that matters is
All that matters is
I know your love has set me free 
And that's all that matters to me
(Whoa ohh)
Cause all that matters is 
All that matters is
I know your love has set me free
And that's all that matters to me 

Some people tell me to step out and do my own thing 
And others say I got to blend in just to be the same 
And stop being me 

But this shallow world is no longer what I'm made of 
I've been changed by grace
I've been saved by love 
What more do I need 

(Chorus)

My life comes from THE ONE
Who made the stars and brought the sun 
He loves me more than these 
So I don't need another identity 
Ohhh yeahh!

(Chorus)

Yeahhh! (ooooo)
That's all that matters
(Oooo)
That's all that matters
(Oooo)
That's all that 
That's all that matters (oooo)
Whoa ohh.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
