Come on, it's me you're talking to
There's something going on inside of you
Don't have to say it, but I wish you would
Cause it would be much easier

You always hide behind yourself
You walk a lonely road with no one's help
I hate to break the news
You're headed for a fall

Chorus:
And if I have to jump
Then I'll jump
And I won't look down
You can cry, you can fight, we can scream and shout
I'll push and pull
Until your walls come down
And you understand I'm gonna be around

I'm sticking with you
(I'm sticking with you)

Even if you try and shut me out
I'm staying here cause that's what love's about
I might let you down, but I won't let you go
no, no, no
So lean into me, I want to know
Everything about the fear you hold inside
Cause you and I are better than just one, 

(Chorus) 

I'm sticking with...

If that's what it means to love you
If that's what it means to have your back
If that's what it takes to show you
Then I'm in, I'm in!

(Chorus)x2


'Cuz I'm sticking with you.
I'm sticking with you
I'm sticking with you.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
