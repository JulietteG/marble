(Oohh-oohh,
I've got it made, that's what I'm talking about,
Goin' down to the fashion store and get myself that-a, hah,
Goin' down to the dealers, bought myself a brand new phone,)

[Big Ken]
Heavy on the 24's,

[Yeah you know I look fly,
Don't I look fly,

I wake up in the morning, I get fresh as a bitch,
I look right in the mirror, tell myself I'm the shit,
And you know that I'm rich,
You should look at the kicks,
Look at the blow, look at the GRIP,
Everyday I'm the same,
I'm moving bitch I'm the train,
I started feelin' this dough,
And no,
She ain't see me the same,
Now don't get mad,
Cause my swag,
Nigga,
Treat my gun, like my chickens, yeah I keep them in a coup,

[Hook]

[Sawed-Off]
YEAH,
Yeah,
Yeah,
They call me supaman,
I'm fly enough buddy, you can't see that,
Stacks in my pocket,
Clockin',
Know you wanna be that,
Man like me, I bought a key just to sit on,
Straight chickens get spit on,
I've been this way for too long,
I'm like a bird... I shit on haters and keep movin',
In this Jeep cruisin',
I'm the winner y'all the losers,
Ain't nothin' to it,
Pimpin', payments, so I just do it,
I spit influence,
So let me-,

[Rich Boy]
Ey,
I'm flyer than a mothafucka,
Hater wanna see me dead like chum chuckas,
I'm in that big bad, 550 S Class,
I hit the gas,
And watch them hoes waving through the glass,
Pimps, playas, I'm ridin' new, in 2008,
I hit the mall,
And send 'em home,
You take 'em on a date,
That white Gucci, check and let 'em know there's money here,
I grip the grain and sit on seats that's made of cashmere,
5 Karats in my ear, you see them all chopped,
Bitch there's a whole lotta rocks,
Up in that Pradda watch,
I'm writing letters to the pens for my brother Irvin,
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin',
Hotter than a fish fry, cooler than some ice cream,
Gotta please myself, I must be living in a dream,
My Cadillac mean,
But my '88 a bitch,
If being fly againgst the law, then BITCH! call the police,

[Big Ken]
Trick I'm pai-ai-aid,
(Trick I'm pai-ai-aid),
Money to ma-a-ake,
(Money to ma-a-ake),
Yes, I'm fly-y-y,
(Yes, I'm fly-y-y),
Shades on my face and my eyes,
Got my favorite car outside,
I guess that's why they say I'm fly,
So... So... So,
EY!,
Sounds so good,
Can I buy you a dra-ank,
(Now wipe me off, now wipe me down,
Now wipe me off, now wipe me down,
Now wipe me off, now wipe me down,
Now wipe me off, now wipe me down,
Now wipe me off,)
I got money in the ba-a-ank,
(Now pour it out,
Now pour it out,
Then pour it out,
Now pour it out,
Then pour it out,)

(Oh yeah,
Yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah.)---Lyrics submitted by Edwin.
