Semalam I call you, you tak answer,
You kata you keluar pergi dinner
You kata you keluar dengan kawan you
But when I called Tommy he said it wasn't true

So I drove my car pergi Damansara
Tommy kata maybe you tengok bola
Tapi bila I sampai, you, you tak ada?
Lagi lah jadi gila

So I called and called sampai you answer
You kata "Sorry sayang tadi tak dengar"
"My phone was on silent, I was at the gym"
Tapi latar belakang suara perempuan lain

Sudahlah sayang, I, don't believe you,
I've always known that your words were never true
Why am I with you, I pun tak tau!
No wonder lah my friends pun tak suka you

So I guess that's the end of our story,
Akhir kata, she accepted his apology
Tapi last last kita dapat tau
She was cheating too

With her exboyfriend's best friend,
Tommy
