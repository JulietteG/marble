Like a swell window
I will wait for you,
We'll ride the moment 'til I catch you again.
'Til I catch you again.
Ooh

I met with a young man
Who has an ocean romance
And he calls it the way of life.
He tells me how he feels when he's alone
With the raging sound of calm.
The raging sound of calm.

Fully untainted sacred place...

Like a swell window
I will wait for you,
We'll ride the moment 'til I catch you again.
'Til I catch you again.

Like a swell window
I will wait for you,
We'll ride the moment 'til I catch you again.
'Til I catch you again.
Ooh

Little doses count
This time will come around.
We're all riding the same waves.
We're all riding the same waves.

Soon we'll all be face to face.

Like a swell window
I will wait for you,
We'll ride the moment 'til I catch you again.
'Til I catch you again.

Like a swell window
I will wait for you,
We'll ride the moment 'til I catch you again.
'Til I catch you again.
