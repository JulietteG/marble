What is this all about?
Settle down. Please don't yell or shout. 
The landlord, he lives downstairs. 
We'll get evicted, please don't be too loud. 

You say I'm passive aggressive. How can I not be when you're talking at me?
You say I'm unresponsive, and here you are, talking over me. 

You make me want to throw this shoe right through that concrete wall. 
Maybe you should pack your things. If it's that dreadful, then just leave it all. 

Ooh...

Don't want to keep on sharing my bed with someone that I have to love less and less. 
Every time I try to make you smile, you say that I'm being a child. 
Well, I tried my best. 
You say that I need therapy. Well, my darling, so do you. 
Don't need for you to tell me what is wrong in all I say or do.

Please don't try to throw this shoe right through that concrete wall. 
Maybe you should pack your things. If it's that dreadful, then just leave it all.

Ooh...
