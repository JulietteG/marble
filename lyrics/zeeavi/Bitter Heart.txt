Sun rise come down, as seen when it hit the ground,
children spinnin' around, till they fall down down down.
I wait for you, it's been two hours now,
and you're still somewhere in town, your dinners getting cold.

I rest my case, you are always this late,
and you know how much I hate, waiting around 'round 'round.

[chorus] Bitter heart, Bitter heart, tries to keep it all inside.
Bitter heart, bitter heart, shawdows will help you try to hide.
Bitter heart, my bitter heart, is getting just a little fragile.
Bitter heart, Bitter heart of mine.

And then you come and tell me the same reason,
as you did yesterday, so tell me what's her name.

do, do, do, do do dou dou dou dou dou dou do do dun dum dum dun dun dun,
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daun dun dun dun dun nun nun nun.

Bitter heart, bitter heart, tries to keep it all inside.
Bitter heart, bitter heart, shawdows will help you tried to hide.
Bitter heart, my bitter heart, is getting just a little fragile.
Bitter heart, bitter heart of mine.

Of mine.
Of mine.
Of mine.
Of mine.
Of mine.---Lyrics submitted by Brianna.
