Excuse me girl
Can I talk to you
maybe get you name
and you number too

I don't need to be bad
but baby I know I got that thing you need [girl]
Say what you want
I can make sure you get it on the count of three
We can move slow or we can move fast to get there right a way
must know were a body like that go insane
U got me so [so turned on]
every little thing you do
has got me so [so turned on]
Let me take a look at you
without a dout
I'm higher now
girl I'm higher now
every little thing has got me so

girl you got me so
got me hot on you
and I'm so turned on
by the things you do
so I came to be shy
but don't ya deny 
that I got the thing you need [girl]
I say what I want and you can make sure I get it on the count of three [girl]
I Dream if I say a body like that would come along everyday [girl]
maybe I'm over confident
but say my name

U got me so [say my name]
U got me so [so turned on]
every little thing you do
has got me so [so turned on]
Let me take a look at you
without a dout
I'm higher now
girl I'm higher now
every little thing has got me so [got me so]

I can tell I'm good for you  [good for you]
I can tell you see it too [ooh yeah yeah]
Do you wanna leave tonight [tonight]
should we go to yours or mine
[papapapapa ooohhh papapapapapa papapapapapa papapapapapa ]

U got me so [so turned on]
every little thing you do 
has got me so [so turned on] 
let me take a look at you
without a dout
I'm higher now

every little thing has got me so

U got me so [so turned on]
every little thing you do
has got me so [so turned on]
let me take a look at you
without a dout 
I'm higher now
girl I'm higher now
every little thing has got me so
