Verse:
You got my attention at hello
We had this connection that wouldnt let go 
There was something sexy bout your voice
Anything you say makes a beautiful noise 

And now we break up to make up right away
Just an excuse to lay in bed all day
I know that this thing we have wont ever change 
And thats why I have the confidence to say

CHORUS:
A lot of girls are sexy
but you know how to use it 
You can keep me up on the phone all night
We say lets hang up on 3 but we dont ever do it
Aint it crazy how after all this time
We got that you hang up no you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up no you hang up kinda love

Verse:
Every time you call me, I wont lie
I still get the goose-bumps I felt the first time
That I saw you walk into a room
Girl you hand me hooked on that beautiful view

And now we break up to make up right away
Just an excuse to lay in bed all day
I know that this thing we have wont ever change
And thats why I have the confidence to say 

CHORUS:
A lot of girls are sexy
but you know how to use it 
You can keep me up on the phone all night
We say lets hang up on 3 but we dont ever do it
Aint it crazy how after all this time
We got that you hang up no you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up no you hang up kinda love

Bridge:
And baby you still know just how to 
Blow my mind 
After everything that weve been through
It still feels right
And I know, that I cant 
Picture living my life without you

CHORUS:
A lot of girls are sexy
but you know how to use it 
You can keep me up on the phone all night
We say lets hang up on 3 but we dont ever do it
Aint it crazy how after all this time
We got that you hang up no you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up no you hang up kinda love---Lyrics submitted by Erica.
