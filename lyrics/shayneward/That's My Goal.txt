You know where I've come from, 
You know my story, 
You know why I'm standing here... 
Tonight, 
Please don't go, 
Don't be in a hurry, 
I'm here to make it clear, 
Make it right, 

Well I know I've acted foolish, 
But I promise you no more, 
I've finally found that something 
Worth reaching for, 

I'm not here to say I'm sorry, 
I'm not here to lie to you, 
I'm here to say I'm ready, 
That I've finally thought it through, 
I'm not here to let you're love go, 
I'm not giving up oh no, 
I'm here to win your heart and soul, 
That's my goal. 

Please don't go, 
You know that I need you, 
And can't breath without you, 
Live without you, 
Be without you, 
Well I know I've acted foolish, 
But i promise you no more, 

I'm not here to say I'm sorry, 
I'm not here to lie to you, 
I'm here to say I'm ready, 
That I've finally thought it through, 
I'm not here to let you're love go, 
I'm not giving up oh no, 
I'm here to win your heart and soul, 
That's my goal. 

Well i won't stop believing, 
That we will be leaving together, 
So when I say i love you, 
I mean it forever and ever, 
ever and ever.... 

I'm not here to say I'm sorry, 
I'm not here to say I'm sorry, 
I'm not here to lie to you, 
I'm here to say I'm ready, 
That I've finally thought it through, 
I'm not here to let you're love go, 
I'm not giving up oh no, 
I'm here to win your heart and soul, 
Yes I'm here to win your heart and soul, 
Thats my goal....---Lyrics submitted by Koppany Kiss.
