Hey baby, when we are together, doing things that we love.
Every time you're near I feel like Im in heaven, feeling high
I dont want to let go, girl.
I just need you to know girl.

I dont wanna run away, baby youre the one I need tonight,
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms

Here tonight

Hey baby, when we are together, doing things that we love.
Everytime you're near I feel like Im in heaven, feeling high
I dont want to let go, girl.
I just need you to know girl.

I dont wanna run away, baby youre the one I need tonight,
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms

I dont want to run away, I want to stay forever, through Time and Time..
No promises

I dont wanna run away, I dont wanna be alone
No Promises
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, now and forever my love

No promises

I dont wanna run away, baby youre the one I need tonight,
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms.

Here tonight.

I dont wanna run away, baby youre the one I need tonight,
No promises.
Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms
Here tonight. ---Lyrics submitted by khaled saif.
