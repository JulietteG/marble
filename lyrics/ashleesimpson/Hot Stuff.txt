Listen,
I walk into your joint
With a hoodie on,
I don't need a short skirt
To get it on,
I goes ooooooooooooon,
Here she comes,
Sunday school girl wantin some,
Ah, she's wearin that?
Better expect the boys attack,
Oooh, truce
I want some of that happy juice,
Hm, what kind of soda
People in here would die for John Walker
Ow, ah wait a sec,
Everybody down, hit the deck

(CHORUS)
People say youre goin out your mind
To think you're hot stuff
Gotta think you're hot stuff
Watchya gonna do they talk about it anyhow,
You think you're hot stuff
I know i'm hot stuff

Okay 1,2
Everybody look what I can do 
I can bring my leg up all the way
(Can she do it?
Can she do it)
Piece of cake
Show off,
She just wanna take her clothes off,
(UGH)
FIIIIYYYYYAH
I got that,
get you
HIIIIIYYYYAH
One to another 
You will discover
That's the way it is

(CHORUS 2x)

What yah gonna do when yaaah
Zip it...
Chad flip it
Feels like I'm in Candyland
I'm going down the chute again
With unicorns and fairy wings
I think I had too much to drink

(CHORUS 2x)---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
