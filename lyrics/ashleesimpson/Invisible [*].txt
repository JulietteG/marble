Like a grain on the beach
Like a star in the sky
Far too many to count with the naked eye
They won't see you

Go ahead
Walk on by
You don't know I'm alive
Maybe one day you'll find
You should open your eyes
You don't know me

You're the one who looked right through me
Now you're saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And you're the one who walked right through me
Now you're saying that you knew me
When I was invisible

Little things adding up
Try so hard not to rush
Giving in, letting go of the world we know
They won't see you

Force it down
Lose the taste
[ Invisible lyrics found on http://www.completealbumlyrics.com ]
They all think it's a waste
We don't need to believe every word they say, no
They don't know me

You're the one who looked right through me
Now you're saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And you're the one who walked right through me
Now you're saying that you knew me
When I was invisible

It's so easy to be lost
But maybe you're not lost at all

Do you recognize me?
Do you know who I am?
Do you see me now?
Do you see me now?

You're the one who looked right through me
Now you're saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
And you're the one who walked right through me
Now you're saying that you knew me
When I was invisible
I'm invisible
I'm invisible---Lyrics submitted by Caitlyn.
