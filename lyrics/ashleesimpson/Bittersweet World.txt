Tragic.
Everybody tryin' to hide
All of those girls
Habits it's
Kinda bizzarre when it's who you are
It's tragic that it's come to this
I bury all of my vices
Tryin' to keep my head up over it
When everything's whatever

It's the be all end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know
You can tell
It's a bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along
In this bittersweet world
Everybody's reapin' what they sow
In this sweet world

Whatever happened to the magic
That was keepin' us
The faith that was on stardust
Now
The hypocrites pointing fingers
With three fingers pointing right back
And all were left with is (x6)
The foolish pride and the quick fixes
Ya

It's the be all end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know
You can tell it's a 
Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along
In this bittersweet world
Everybody's reapin' what they sow
In this bittersweet world
With closets full of skeletons
I'm a bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me
As I stand alone

There's a universal bottom line
Everybody's in disguise 
Even you and I
Behind the facade tryin' to get by
Don't wanna play with fire again
There's a universal bottom line
Everybody's in disguise 
Even you and I
Behind the facade tryin' to get by
You wanna play with fire
You're gonna get burned

It's the be all end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know 
You can tell it's a
Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along
In this bittersweet world
With closets full of skeletons 
I'm a bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me
As I stand alone---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
