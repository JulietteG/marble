I found myself wrong again,
Staring out my window,
Wondering what it is i should have said,
I found myself at home again,
Waiting for the after call,
From a fallout that feels like such a mess

Oh, I can only be myself,
I'm sorry that hell for you,
Hey, so whats my damage today?
Don't let me get in your way, let it out like you always do,
The trouble between me and you, 
Is nothing new

So I listen to you complain and then
I bite my tongue in vain again,
As i let it all just slowly settle in,
Such a pretty picture that you paint,
I'm so vile while your a saint,
Funny how your eyes say thick not thin

Oh, I can only be myself,
Your looking for someone else,
Hey, so whats my damage today?
Don't let me get in your way, let it out like you always do,
The trouble between me and you, 
Is nothing new

You know how to give it,
But you can't take it,
It's all just a waste,
Now you can save it,
No matter what I do it's never good enough,
Never good enough

Hey, so whats my damage today
Don't let me get in your way, let it out like you always do,
The trouble between me and you,
Is nothing new,
Is nothing new!

Save your breath cause here comes the truth,
I'm over the drama of you,
And thats something new!

Oh I'm staring out my window, 
wondering what it is I should have,
