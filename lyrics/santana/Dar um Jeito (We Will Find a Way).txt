Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)

When you got nothing to eat
And you find it hard to sleep
How you struggling on the streets
And you can't escape the heat

But your heart could feel that beat
So you get up off your feet
Ain't no mountain you can't reach
Grab a star and make a wish

We're celebrating and we're wavin' all our wrath
We are united even though we're different flags
We are one voice, one heart
One soul, once we set that goal
You know we're gonna start

Here we go, oh oh oh
That's all we know oh oh oh
So here we go, oh oh oh
That's all we know

Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
We gon find a way, yeah we gon find a way
Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
We gon find a way, yeah we gon find a way

Voc nasceu pra brilhar
Est escrito em seu olhar
 to forte a sensao
De vestir uma nao

Quando o jogo comear
Ningum vai te segurar
Sua determinao
 de um grande campeo

E ns celebramos e vibramos por vocs
O mundo inteiro est torcendo outra vez
Ns somos uma voz, corpo e alma
Corao, ento vamos gritar
Explode a emoo

Here we go, oh oh oh
That's all we know oh oh oh
So here we go, oh oh oh
That's all we know

Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
We gon find a way, yeah we gon find a way
Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
We gon find a way, yeah we gon find a way

Here we go
Here we go

Here we go, oh oh oh
That's all we know oh oh oh
So here we go, oh oh oh
That's all we know

Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
We gon find a way, yeah we gon find a way
Dar um jeito (oh oh oh)
We gon find a way, yeah we gon find a way

Here we go
