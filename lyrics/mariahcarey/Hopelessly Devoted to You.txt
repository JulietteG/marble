Mariah: 
I loved this song when I was little, I won a talent contest singing this song, 
and I believe it was a little something like this: 

Guess mine is not the first heart broken 
My eyes are not the first to cry 
I'm not the first to know there's 
Just no getting over you 

Ladies and gentleman, Olivia Newton John! 

Olivia: 
You know I'm just a fool who's willing 
To sit around and wait for you 
both: 
(But) baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do 
I'm hopelessly devoted to you 

But now there's no where to hide 
Since you pushed my love aside 
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you 
Hopelessly devoted to you (you) 
Hopelessly devoted to you 
Whoo 

Mariah: 
Olivia Newton John! ---Lyrics submitted by tua.
