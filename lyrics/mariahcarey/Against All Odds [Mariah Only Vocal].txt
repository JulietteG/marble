ohhhhh.......
How could I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath
With you ohhhh

You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

How could you just walk away from me?
When all I could is watch you leave
Cause' we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

You're the only one 
Who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
Cause' there's just an empty space
there's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face

So take a look at me now
there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me
is against the odds
and that's what I gotta face

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And wait for you
Is all I can do
And that's what I've
gotta face

Take a look at me now
Cause' I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me 
Is against all odds 
That's the chance I gotta take~yea

ohhhhh....

Take a look at me now

ohhhhh........---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
