I shouldn't have walked away, 
I would've stayed, 
if you said we could've made everything okay, 
but we just, 
through the blame back and forth,
We treated love like a sport, 
the final blow hit so low I'm still on the ground. 
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall. 
Shattered in pieces curled on the floor,
 Supernatural love conquers all,Remember we used to touch the sky. 

[Chorus] 
And lightning don't strike. 
The same place twice, 
when you and I 
Said goodbye 
I felt the angels cry. 
Cause true loves a gift. 
But we let it drift 
in the storm. 
Every night 
I feel the angels cry. 

Come on babe can our love be revived. 
Bring it back and we gon' make it right. 
I'm on the edge just trying to survive. 
As the angels cry,

Limitless omnipresent kind of love 
Couldn't have guessed it, would just stop 
And disappear, in a world where 
Here I am 
Walking on this narrow road. 
Wobbling but won't let go. 
Waiting for a glimpse of the suns glow. 
I know I can stand just pull me back up. 
Like there aint a hurricane its just us. 
I'm willing to live and die for our love. 
Baby we can get back that shine. 

[Chorus] 
And lightning don't strike. 
The same place twice, 
when you and I 
Said goodbye 
I felt the angels cry. 
Cause true loves a gift. 
But we let it drift 
in the storm. 
Every night 
I feel the angels cry.

Come on babe can our love be revived. 
Bring it back and we gon' make it right. 
I'm on the edge just trying to survive. 
As the angels cry,

Baby Im missin you
dont allow our love to lose
we gotta ride it through
im reachin for you 
Baby Im missin you
dont allow our love to lose
we gotta ride it through
im reachin for you 
Lightning dont strike
The same place twice
You and I
Said Goodbye
Felt the angels cry
True loves a gift
But we let it slip
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry---Lyrics submitted by Phillip.
