Don't forget about us
Don't baby , Don't baby , Don't let it go 
No baby, no baby, no baby
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go (My baby boy)

Just let it die, with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both pay the price
Tears in my eyes, 
You know sometimes it'll be like that baby, Ohhh

Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But, I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby I must confess, We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best

                   (Chores)
Late nights, Playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy you'll always in my heart
I can see it in your eyes
I just don't want it so don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from my experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So, I hope this will remind you
When its for real, when its forever
So don't forget about us

They say that your in a new relationship 
but we both no nothing come close to what
we had it perseverse that we both
can't forget it how good we used
to get it there's only one me and you and how we
used to shine no matter what
you go through we are one thats a fact
they cant deny so baby we just cant
let the fire pass us bye forever we
both regreat

Late nights, Playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy you'll always in my heart
I can see it in your eyes
I just don't want it so don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from my experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So, I hope this will remind you
When its for real, when its forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head messed up now, Thats the trickery
She'll want to have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC
Baby don't you, don't you forget about... 

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When its for real, when its forever
So don't forget about us---Lyrics submitted by Danyiel.
