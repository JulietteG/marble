Once upon a time 
we swore not to say goodbye
something got a hold of us and we changed
and you sat alone in pride
and I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairytale just end up this way?

we went round for round 
til we knocked love out
we would lay in the ring not making a sound
and if there`s a methaphor of you and I
why is this so hard to say goodbye?

I cant wait to H.A.T.E.U 
make you pain like I do
Still Can`t shake you off
I cant wait to break through these emotional changes
It seems like such a lost cause
I cant wait to face you
Break you down so low
there`s no place left to go
I cant wait to H.A.T.E.U
OOhh OOooohh

This was a life we lived and that no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again 
I`d sit and press rewind
And watch us every night
wanna pause it but I can`t make it stay 

we went round for round 
til we knocked love out
we would lay in the ring not making a sound
and if there`s a methaphor of you and I
why is this so hard to say goodbye?

CHORUS

No need to call on my phone
Coz I`ve changed my number today
A matter of fact 
I think I`m moving away (away)
Sorry to frustrations got me feeling a way
And I just keep having one last thing to say!

And I just wanna hold you
touch you
feel you
Im near you
I miss you
baby baby baby
I'm tired of trying to fake through
but there`s nothing I can do
Boy I cant wait to H.A.T.E.U---Lyrics submitted by Diamond.
