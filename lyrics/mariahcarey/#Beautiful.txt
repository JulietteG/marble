(feat. Miguel) 

Ah, ah, youre beautiful
(Yeah)
Ah, ah, youre beautiful

Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, youre killing me, you know it aint fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, youre killing me, baby do it again

Youre beautiful, and your mind is f-cking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
Youre beautiful, good lord, youre f-cking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

I like when you run red lights
Dont stop til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I dont know
But I dont care, take me anywhere
Cause its beautiful, ooh you make me feel undressable
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You dont know what youre doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Dont you worry darling---
