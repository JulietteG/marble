I ain't going to dream no more 
Falling on my face across the floor
One line....
You belong to me.

Dirty face and cloudy mind 
Can't escape the sunshine
Once I drank you in my wine,
You devour me.

Chorus:
Dirty heart - Dirty mind
Stay with me - sometime

Take my life and take my heart
Tell me we will never part
Well I see words going wild,
You divide me.

I ain't going to burn for you
Hiding your face the way that you do
Life is more than loving you, baby,
You belong to me.

Chorus:
Dirty heart- dirty mind
Stay with me - sometime---Lyrics submitted by chris bennett.
