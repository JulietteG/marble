There is this thing
That's like touching except you don't touch
Back in the day
It just went without saying at all

All the world's history
Gradually dying of shock
There is this thing
That's like talking except you don't talk

You sing
You sing

Sing for the bartender
Sing for the janitor, sing
Sing for the cameras
Sing for the animals, sing

Sing for the children
Shooting the children, sing
Sing for the teachers
Who told you that you couldn't sing

Just sing

There is this thing
Keeping everyone's lungs and lips locked
It is called fear
And it's seeing a great renessaince

After the show
You cannot sing wherever you want
But for now let's just pretend
We're all gonna get bombed

So sing

Sing 'cause it's obvious
Sing for the astronauts, sing
Sing for the president
Sing for the terrorists, sing

Sing for the soccer team
Sing for the ganja weed, sing
Sing for the kid with the phone
Who refuses to sing

Just sing

Life is no cabaret
We don't care what you say
We're inviting you anyway
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
