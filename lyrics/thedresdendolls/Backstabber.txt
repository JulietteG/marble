the record goes from blue to gold 
so thank you for all your help 
I know you want to jump around 
but try to contain yourself 
you always struck me as the type to take it lightly 
but now youre gonna have to shut your mouth or fight me 

backstabber, backstabber. 

youre all alone youre all over  
the popular magazines will never care what do you care 
youre down with the japanese 
but youve got no right to sit there saying I abuse it 
when you only sleep with girls who say they like your music 

backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber 

backstabber! hope grabber! 
greedy little fit haver! 
god, I feel for you, fool.. 
shit lover! off brusher! 
jaded bitter joy crusher! 
failure has made you so cruel. 

rotten to the core  
rotten to the core 

rotten like a crackwhore 
backing out out the backdoor 
show us what youre good for 
stick it to the noise board 
come on join the bloodsport 
show us some support, still 
working at the drugstore 
is it because youre A FUCKING 

backstabber! hope grabber! 
greedy little fit haver! 
god, I feel for you, fool.. 
shit lover! off brusher! 
jaded bitter joy crusher! 
failure has made you so cruel. 

so dont tell me what to write 
and dont tell me that Im wrong 
and dont tell me not to reference my songs within my songs 

so here we go the open road 
is covered with taco stands 
and you can stop well drop you off 
and write to you when we land 

backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber 

backstabber! backstabber!backstabber! hope grabber!greedy fucking fit haver! BACKSTABBER!---Lyrics submitted by DanielleZiel.
