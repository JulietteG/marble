there's no end to the love you can give
when you change your point of view to underfoot
very good 
you may be flat but you're breathing

and there's no doubt he's at home in his room
probably watching porn of you from the fall 
it's last call 

and you're the last one leaving
and you thought you could change the world 
by opening your legs
well it isn't very hard
try kicking them instead
and you thought you could change his mind
by changing your perfume to the kind his mother wore
o god delilah why?
i never met a more impossible girl....

in this same bar where you slammed down your hand
and said Amanda, i'm in love
no you're not
you're just a sucker for the ones who use you
and it doesn't matter what i say or do
the stupid bastard's gonna have his way with you...

you're an unrescuable schizo
or else you're on the rag
if you take him back
i'm gonna lose my nerve
i never met a more impossible girl....
i never met a more impossible girl....

at four o'clock he got off 
and you called up 
i'm down at denny's on route one
and you won't guess what he's done 
is that a fact delilah?
larry tap let you in through the back
and use his calling card again
for a quick hand of gin

you are impossible, delilah: the princess of denial
and after 7 years in advertising you are none the wiser

you're an unrescuable schizo
or else you're on the rag
cause if you take him back
i'm gonna lose my nerve
he's gonna beat you like a pillow
you schizos never learn
and if you take him home
you'll get what you deserve

so don't cry delilah
you're still alive delilah
you need a ride delilah? 
let's see how fast this thing can go.....---Lyrics submitted by Erica.
