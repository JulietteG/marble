Missed me, missed me
Now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister
I might tell my sister
If I tell her, mister
She might tell my mother
And my mother, mister
She might tell my father
And my father, mister
He won't be too happy
And he'll have his lawyer
Come up from the city
And arrest you, mister
So I wouldn't miss me
If you get me, mister, see

Missed me, missed me
Now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister
You must think I'm pretty
If you think so, mister
You must want to fuck me
If you fuck me, mister
It must mean you love me
If you love me, mister
You would never leave me
It's as simple as can be

Missed me, missed me
Now you've got to kiss me
If you miss me, mister
Why do you keep leaving?
If you trick me, mister
I will make you suffer
And they'll get you, mister
Put you in the slammer
And forget you, mister
Then you'll miss me, won't you?
Won't you miss me?
Won't you miss me?
Won't you miss me?

Missed me, missed me
Now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister
Take responsibility
I'm fragile, mister
Just like any girl would be
And so misunderstood

Missed me, missed me
Now you've gone and done it
Hope you're happy
In the county penitentiary
It serves you right
For kissing little girls
But I'll visit
If you miss me
Say you miss me
How's the food they feed you?
Do you miss me?
Will you kiss me through the window?
Do you miss me, miss me
Will they ever let you go?
I miss my mister so---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
