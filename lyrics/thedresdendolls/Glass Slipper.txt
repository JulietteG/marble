No one's asking to go dancing, it's not like that anymore
It's romantic if they mean it when they shut your fingers in the door
It's a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
Don't be picky, it gets tricky, if the slipper fits you wear it, whore

How many tips can I take home tonight without them getting mad?
How many stitches do you think it takes to fix a cut that bad?
How many minutes until midnight and you get your eyesight back?

Not to knock it I've been off it never moving very much at once
It's so awkward I still offer it when it's that time of
Other girls shower but I give out flowers 
To curious strangers who throw dollars at my feet

How many crimes can I try spotting dry before it leaves a stain?
How many times say that I love you 'til it doesn't mean a thing?
How many fittings must I sit through with my big feet blistering?
How many times until it hits me and my big mouth strikes again?

I'm not asking to go dancing I'm not that dumb anymore
It's exhausting to keep smiling when your toes are falling on the floor
It's a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
Don't be sorry just ignore me because honestly
I'm too sore from fitting exactly to ride into setting suns 
Aching to stand on my own two feet

How many wishes do I still have left to fix the way it ends?
How many princes will it take to put a girl like this back together again?
How many instances can you point out when I was less than kind?
How many happy endings do you need to change your fucking mind?
And how much time do we have left before it's midnight and
You see that I was never the right size?---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
