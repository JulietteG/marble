Nothing is crueler than children who come from good homes
God'll forgive them I guess but whose side are you on?
Driving around the old town I remember it all
Dropping my lunchbox and Tampax all over the hall

And they said "You are a socialist cokehead we know from your clothes
You are a Satanist worshipper of things evil
Think you're a poet a folksinger poser nah-oh
A volleyball player you've got to be kidding us all"

So we hide from the guns on our night reconnaissance
Steal flamingos and gnomes from the dark side of the lawn

No one can stop us the script is a work of genius
No one has bought the rights yet but we're not giving up
Every unwanted lawn jockey fits in the script
Directed by Spielberg and starring the Masochist Club

Mary, you look like hell
Stuck in that ridiculous shell
Give us some light and God's pure love
We know what you've been dreaming of
Give us some light and God's pure love
We know what you've been dreaming of
Give us some light and God's pure love
We're taking you to Hollywood

Hollywood

And we hide from the guns on our night reconnaissance
Steal flamingos and gnomes from the dark side of the lawn

One plays a socialist cokehead we dress in my clothes
One plays a Satanist worshipper of things evil
One plays a poet who starts up a band of his own
One plays a volleyball player with both her wrists broke

And we hide from the guns on our night reconnaissance
Steal flamingos and gnomes from the dark side of the lawn
And we give them good homes give them love they've never known
In the loft in the barn in the town where I was born
In the loft in the barn in the town where I was born
In the loft in the barn in the town where I was born---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
