coin operated boy
sitting on the shelf 
he is just a toy
but i turn him on and he comes to life
automatic joy
that is why i want 
a coin operated boy
made of plastic and elastic
he is rugged and long lasting
who could ever ever ask for more
love without complications galore
many shapes and weights to choose from
i will never leave my bedroom
i will never cry at night again
wrap my arms around him and pretend
coin operated boy
all the other real ones that i destroy
cannot hold a candle to my new boy and i'll
never let him go and i'll never be alone
go and i'll never be alone
go and i'll never be alone
go and i'll never be alone
not with my coin operated boy
this bridge was written to make you feel smittener
with my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
can you extract me from my plastic fantasy
i didn't think so but i'm still convincable
will you persist even after i bet you
a billion dollars that i'll never love you
and will you persist even after i kiss you
good-bye for the last time
will you keep on trying to prove it?
i'm dying to lose it
i'm losing my confidence
i want it
i want it
i want it
i want to
i want you
i want you
i want a
i want a
i want a
i want a coin operated boy
and if i had a star to wish on
for my life i cant imagine
any flesh and blood could be his match
i can even take him in the bath
coin operated boy
he may not be real experienced with girls
but i know he feels like a boy should feel
isn't that the point? 
that is why i want a coin operated boy
with a pretty coin operated voice
saying that he loves me that he's thinking of me
straight up to the point
that is why i want 
a coin operated boy---Lyrics submitted by Holly.
