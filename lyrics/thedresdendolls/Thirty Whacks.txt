Thirty licks with a belt, same old tricks on myself
And I wonder, does everyone else live this way?
A succession of tests, a triumphant success
Each time I'm still intact at the end of the day

Thirty drops in the glass, keep my temper and pass
With my breath held, you bastards, you lucked out again
It's not really so bad, theres still mom, theres still
Damage to do before they wrest the axe from my hands

It's no mystery, you should obviously go
Before I break everything
Youre always telling me that you're dying to know
But youre not really listening

How do I manage to station myself in harms way
And only get hit with a ticket for loitering
That I have no way to pay and no strength to argue?
My personal demons can scheme with professional flair
Oh, God, they're after me
If I could shut them out just for a second I swear
I could stop this catastrophe

Thirty day guarantee 
But they can't have meant me
After all, I was born to a childproof world
No sharp corners or glass
Small objects or plastic bags
Please, these are death to a delicate girl

It's no mystery, you should obviously know
That Ill destroy everything
So don't go telling me that you're dying to know
'Cause youll get what you're asking for

And I still manage to station myself in harm's way
And only get hit with a ticket for loitering
Stating I came the wrong day
Now all the demons are screaming, their wages aren't fair
I've left a secret kept
If I could shut them up just for a second, I swear
Itll look like an accident
I could be decent yet
It'd be magnificent
I could be president---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
