I see an end
Our sun will dive
Blood alone won't bring you life

Darkness falls
Curtains rise
But you and I just can't survive

Like broken glass
I see through you
I can't believe the things that you do

With open eye's been cut before
Now I see through closing doors
Watch what you wish for, you know you just might get it

Completely without me
What's in your head is on your hands
Completely without me
I over turned, I understand that, 
Everything you want ain't always what you need
Completely without me
Completely without me

It's hard to sleep in the bed you make
With all the bones that you daybreak

You taught me well
Sure I learned that most of us get what we deserve

Give me your heart of rusty nails
And now you ask why it impales

What you hide you can't conceal
Through your eyes all is revealed
Watch what you wish for, you know you just might get it

Completely without me
What's in your head is on your hands
Completely without me
I over turned, I understand that, 
Everything you want ain't always what you need
Completely without me
Completely, 
I can't feel your... 

Completely without me
What's in your head is on your hands
Completely without me
I over turned, I understand that, 
Everything you want ain't always what you need
Completely without me
Completely without me
Completely without me
Completely without me---Lyrics submitted by jose.
