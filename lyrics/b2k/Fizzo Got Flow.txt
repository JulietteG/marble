[Verse 1]
One, two, three, four,
Fizzo came through and I'm blazin out the door
Hold five to six hoes
Causin frenzies round the globe
And my belly stay froze, cuz my chain hang low
Now I'm gettin paid, every single day
Wit my niggas, my niggas Chris and J
Now its best you move out my way
Cuz yall been havin bad days ever since I took place
Who's with fast names
Casin um wit a race
Don't try to spit dog
If you can't make a hit
Don't try to make her shake
If she don't move like a snake
Throw it on her like a Cham-pien
Bouncin like a tramp-line
I'm telling you sweet thing
They think I'm mean
It's only right that we get this green
Start the game is open
I'm takin it like I-V
Rappers boy
I have a place like Kobe

[Chorus]
Fizzo Got Flow
The Fizzo Got Flow (what)
Fizzo Got Flow
The Fizzo Got Flow (C'mon)
Fizzo Got Flow

You think you know, but you have no idea.
The Fizzo Got Flow
The Fizzo Got Flow (what)
Fizzo Got Flow
The Fizzo Got Flow (C'mon)
Fizzo Got Flow
The Fizzo Got Flow
You think you know, but you have no idea.

[Verse 2]
I came through this game abrupt
Yall said who's him
Slim wit the tilted brim
On Prada blue Timbz
It wasn't long 'for I filled my chain wit gems
Turned linen into Benz
Bought an E Class Benz
Now yall wanna say how he speak so fluent
How he keep the crowds movin
I hope he's neva truin
Do I hafta say that I'm betta than yall
When your album can't compare to my sixteen balls
Yall got me confused, I don't kick it wit nerds
Im a gown man, yall kids like big bird
Look dog, man I don't think you heard
Hit um up, 
Spit um up,
Get um up,
Word.
