See I bought you diamonds
And a brotha stop lying
I bought you Donna
Ralph lauren and procta
I know I made you leave
Got a brotha beggin please
Got a brotha on his knees
I bought you a two way
I even left Chantae
I won't cheat again
I need you my friend
All a brotha want for Christmas
Is to have you back right in my life

[Chorus 4 times]
Why'd you leave me 
Why'd you leave me
On this Christmas 
Why'd you have to go

[Second verse]
See I'm beggin now
Do what I do for you
See I'm so confused
Got me stuck on you
My mama say 
Why do I deal wit you
Said I'm a crazy fool
Betta stay away from you
I dissed my family
Just to get next to you
I bought you a cell phone
Can't even talk to you
All a brotha want for Christmas
Is to have you right back in my life

[Repeat chorus 4 tomes]

[J-boog talking]
I mean why 
Why'd you have to leave
I put the gifts under the tree
And dissed my family
Baby why
Baby I had the mistletoe under the doorway for you
Why'd you have to go
Please come back
I don't know what to do
Aww if I had one wish for Christmas
It'd be to have you back in my life

[repeat chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
