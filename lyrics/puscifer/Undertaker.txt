You were way out of line.
Went and turned it all around on me again.
How could I not smell your lie through the smoke and arrogance?
But now I know.
So you will not get away with it again.
I'm pissing in those hollow eyes for I have reached my end. 

Thank you for making me feel like I am guilty.
Making it easier to murder your sweet memory...

Before I go, tell me...
"Were you ever who you claimed yourself to be?"
Either way, I must say goodbye.
You are dead to me.

Thank You for making me feel like I'm guilty.
Making it easier to murder your sweet memory...
I'm severin' the heartline, I'm leavin' your corpse behind not dead, but soon to be, though I'm not gonna be the one that kills you.

I'm gonna leave that up to you.
I'm gonna leave that up to you.
I'm gonna leave that up to you.
I'm gonna leave that up to you.

I told you so.
I told you so.
I told you so.
I told you so.
I told you so.
I told you so.
I told you so.
I told you...

Severin' the heartline, I'm leaving your corpse behind not dead, but soon to be and I'm gonna be the one to say I told you so.---Lyrics submitted by Jakob Hamilton.
