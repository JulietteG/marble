Lampin' like I'm campin'
Bumpin' fitty with a forty
Whatcha 20, honey, poppa's all alone
Empty hizzy, left me dizzy
I'm a pirate lost his booty
I'm a pimp without a dog without a bone

Where all my honey gone?
Pooh bear be cryin'
Some Oreo cracker song
Wigger be tryin' to get his queen to come on home

So pardon all the cheesy
Wigger pimp is feelin' crazy
Daisy dukes, my kryptonite, Im fumblin'
My pimpin' hand gone limp
And I'm a trippin' plain and simple
All the po po's, wolves and dogs are Closing in

Where all my honey gone?
Pooh bear be cryin'
Some oreo-cracker song
Wigger be tryin to get his queen to come on home

Now I know I ain't no player
Heavy hitter, roller, spitter
Those legit can go ahead and giggle on ('Cause mos def)
I ain't no cracka' quitta
Gonna do my best to get 'er back to daddy
Honey, bring your sweet ass home

Where all my honey gone?
Pooh bear be cryin'
Some Oreo cracker song
Wigger be tryin to get his queen to come on home

Where all my honey gone?
Pooh bear be cryin'
Some Oreo cracker song
Wigger be tryin to get his queen to come on home

Where all my honey gone?
Pooh bear be cryin'
Some Oreo cracker song
Wigger be tryin to get his queen to come on home ---Lyrics submitted by Jakob Hamilton.
