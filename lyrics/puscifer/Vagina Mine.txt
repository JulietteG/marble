Out to run a train at the railway station
Shotgun Betty stopped me dead in my shoes

Out to run a train at the railway station
Shotgun Betty stopped me dead in my shoes

Cock on lock down, she said, "Learn the damn alphabet
I cum before you, get to payin' your dues"

Head down to the tunnel, to get on this Puscifer
Tongue roll, call cadence, hear the school bell ring
This vagina mine, teach ya patient diligence
Keep the chain gang swinging, make a cat-bird sing

Down this vagina mine
Down this vagina mine

Head down to the tunnel, to get on this Puscifer
Tongue roll, call cadence, hear the school bell ring
This vagina mine, teach ya patient diligence
Keep the chain gang swinging, make a cat-bird sing

This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down

Down this vagina mine
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
Down this vagina mine
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down
This vagina mine, one track tunnel vision down ---Lyrics submitted by Jakob Hamilton.
