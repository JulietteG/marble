Thank you for making me, feel like I am guilty,
making it easy to murder your sweet memory

You were way out of line
went and turned it all around on me again
how could I not smell your lie 
through the smoke and arrogance
But now I know
so you will not get away with it again
Im distant in those hollow eyes
for I have reached my end
So..

Thank you for, making me, feel like I am guilty
making it easy to murder your sweet memory

Before I go, tell me
were you ever who you claimed yourself to be?
either way I must say goodbye
your dead to me
So I...

Thank you for making me feel like I am guilty
making it easy to murder your sweet memory

Im severing the heart then Im
leaving your corpse behind
not dead but soon to be tho
Im not going to the one who kills you
Jus leave that up to you.

Im not going to be here to revive you
Im not going to be here to revive you
Im not going to be here to revive you
Im going to be the one who said I told you so..
I told you so (8X)
I told you---Lyrics submitted by Kayla Damron.
