Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
Ash and urn and silence
Talk to me
Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway without me

Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing about you
What's left of you is
Ash and urn in this silent... horizon

Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
Ash and urn and silence

Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway without me

Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing
What's left of you is
Ash and urn in this silent... horizon

Swirl and sway without me
Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing about you
What's left of you is
Ash and urn in this silent....---Lyrics submitted by Kenna Hale.
