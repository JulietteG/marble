Whadda You know?
The birds and the bees got wise to the lies.
So they took to the trees and took to the skies.
On top of the chain, but safe from the rain.
Whatcha know about the ways on the underside?

Whadda You know?
Bought a hot shot gat from a north end Guinea
Cuz were hip to the bull and hip to the lies.
Anti up with yer ass cuz you aint got a penny
Whatcha know about the ways on the underside?

Chorus:
Whadda You know?
Bought a hot shot gat from a north end Guinea.
Anti up with yer ass cuz you aint got a penny
Droppin Bombs from above, cut yall down to size.
Cuz were hip to the bull and were hip to the lies.

The streets rose in 2 perfect waves in the night.
Crashes on my left and one on my right
Its all fire n brimstone, baby. So lets go outside.
Its all fire n brimstone, baby. Got my brand new pistol, Baby

Chorus:
Whadda You know?
Bought a hot shot gat from a north end Guinea.
Anti up with r ass cuz you aint got a penny
Droppin Bombs from above, cut yall down to size.
Cuz were hip to the bull and were hip to the lies.

Bridge:
Our turn to decide who lives n who dies.
Now wise to the lies, its time to get up.
But Whadda You Know?---Lyrics submitted by Adam mourning.
