No I never said enough
It's hard to talk when you were always acting tough

Something in your eye
And you don't need someone to tell you life gets tough
Boy you made a movie
Owed it all to love

Nothing left to chance
You won't be disappointed anymore

You don't really wanna know
Keep the shadows' shadows and they'll follow you
Spin the bottle baby and let's see what's new

Simplify the maths
Add but don't subtract and in my word for you
I try to be the person that you want me to
Nothing left to chance
you won't be disappointed any more

la...

You don't really wanna know
Keep the shadows' shadows and they'll follow you 
Spin the bottle baby and let's see what's new---Lyrics submitted by Aaron McFaull.
