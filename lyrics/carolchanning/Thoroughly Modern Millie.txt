Everything today is thoroughly modern
Check your personality
Everything makes yesterday slow
Better face reality
Its not insanity
Says vanity fair
In fact, it's to stylish to 
Raise your skirts and bob your hair
In a rumble seat it isn't cozy
If the boy is kissable
And the tango dance they wouldn't allow
Now is quite permissible
Good-bye, good goody girl
I'm changing and how
So beat the drums 'cause here comes
Thoroughly modern millie now
Everything today is thoroughly modern
Bands are getting jazzier
Everything today makes yesterday slow
Cars are getting snazzier
Today it's criminal, what women'll do
What they're, forgetting is its 1922
Have you seen the way they kiss in movies
Isn't it delectable?
Painting lips and pencil lining your brow
Now is quite respectable
Good-bye good goody girl
I'm changing and how
So beat the drum 'cause here comes
Thoroughly modern millie---Lyrics submitted by Casey Dorman.
