Ive been around the world - hey, hey
Ive been around the world - hey, hey

In the kitchen where Im cooking what is good for me
Spices from the globe
Little by little its the finest meal

Its appetite for hope - come and see

You mix it all together in your dreams
Ingredients from the seven seas and
Im realizing things aint what they seem
Thats the riddle of it
Thats the spirit of it
Thats the power of life

Ive been around the world (round the world)
And Ive seen it all (seen it all)
Ive been around the world (round the world)
The sun will always rise and fall
Ive been around the world (round the world)
And I want you to see (seen it all)
Ive been the only girl (round the world)
All surrounded by mystery

In the living room Im cleaning up from top to floor
The place I love the most
The wall is covered up with all my souvenirs
Ive got from coast to coast - come and see

You mix it all together in your dreams
Ingredients from the seven seas and
Im realizing things aint what they seem
Thats the riddle of it
Thats the spirit of it
Thats the power of life

Ive been around the world (round the world)
And Ive seen it all (seen it all)
Ive been around the world (round the world)
The sun will always rise and fall
Ive been around the world (round the world)
And I want you to see (seen it all)
Ive been the only girl (round the world)
All surrounded by mystery

Im still coming around
I keep chasing dreams
Girl, I keep coming around - hey, hey
I keep coming around
And I can never stop
Girl, I keep coming around
Cause if I do Ill walk
Around around - around the world

Ive been around the world (round the world)
Hey hey (seen it all)
Ive been around the world (round the world)
All surrounded by mystery
Ive been around the world (round the world)
And Ive seen it all (seen it all)
Ive been around the world (round the world)
The sun will always rise and fall
Round the world---Lyrics submitted by Chrystal.
