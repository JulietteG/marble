We dreamed a dream...
Woke up and lived it...
We had the music in our hands...

The drops of rain...
Became a river...
And now it's time to end this dance
So "Thank You!"

My mamma said that the best thing in life was getting me to love
Somebody higher than anything else in this world, baby
My mamma said she would give her life up for me

My mamma said
My mamma said
My ma-ma-mamma

My mamma said that the worst thing in life was getting used to love
Somebody is harder than anything else in this world, baby
Knowing you're going to, knowing you're going to lose it all...

1! 2! 3! 4!

Mamma don't leave
Don't go
Don't run
Don't hide
Don't cry
Don't ever feel scared now

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

Circling protons
Soul vibrations
Circling neutrons
All vibrations

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

And now you're lying there
Taking your last breath
I'm holding back the tears

Oh, mamma don't die...

My mamma said that the best thing in life was getting me to love
Somebody higher than anything else in this world, baby
My mamma said she would give her life up for me

My mamma said
My mamma said
My my-my-mamma..

My mamma said that the worst thing in life was getting used to love
Somebody is harder than anything else in this world, baby
Knowing you're going to, knowing you're going to lose it all

(Oh!)

My mamma said,
My mamma said!
My mamma said,
My mamma said!

Mamma, hold on
Give in
Let go
Release yourself
From everything
Out there

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

Circling electrons
Soul vibrations
Circling electrons
All vibrations

Mamma just crossed
Just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed
She crossed
To the multiverse

And now you're lying there
Taking your last breath
I'm holding back the tears
Oh, mamma don't die...

My mamma said that the best thing in life was getting me to love
Somebody higher than anything else in this world, baby
My mamma said she would give her life up for me.

My mamma said
My mamma said
My ma-ma-mamma
My mamma said
My mamma said
My ma-ma-mamma
My mamma said
