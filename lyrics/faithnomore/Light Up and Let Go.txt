The way you're holding me
I'm gonna blow up in your face
You know the way
You gotta light up and let go

(I won't, I won't, I won't)
You'd better let go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)

Let go
You better let go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)

You wanted flames
But now your tears won't put out the blaze
Before you run away
Know that I cannot let go

(I won't, I won't, I won't)
You'd better let go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
Let go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
You'd better leg go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)

???

The way you're holding me
I'm gonna blow up in your face
You know the way
You gotta light up and let go

(I won't, I won't, I won't)
You'd better let go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
Let go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
You'd better leg go
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
