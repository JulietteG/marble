If you want to open the hole
Just put your head down and go
Step beside the piece of the circumstance
Got to wash away the taste of evidence
Wash it away (evidence)
I didn't feel a thing
It didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify:
I didn't feel a thing
Anything you say, we know you're guilty
Hands above your head, you won't even feel me
You won't feel me (evidence)---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
