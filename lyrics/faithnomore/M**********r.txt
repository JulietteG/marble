Force fed more than we eat in the wild
Grazed on a mash that can suffocate a child
Bloated, promoted in an ode to pomped style
Moistened in the feed while were choke upon the bile
Corner in the market on the geese without the bones
Hushing out the public in a strike without a drone
The cage became collapsable
Our sticks equipped with stones

Get the m**********r on the phone, the phone

Hello m**********r
My lover
You saw it coming

Set aside the scruples in a stratagem of strain
A smallpox-laden blanket, invisible with stains
Inoculated bastards, bloody pecked pain
Distemper has a hold, distemper has a hold
We took a second sip from a cup we made of bones
The first it was a ruse, a trick so aptly thrown
The truth is that our youth was a carpet laid with stones

Get the m**********r on the phone, the phone

Goodbye m**********r
My lover
You saw it coming
Goodbye m**********r
My lover
You had it coming

Get the m**********r on the phone, the phone---
