It only tickles now,
I used to kick and shout
Now I just cling to the ????
Footprints gone,
you never love someone
Only what they leave behind And I won't forget you,
And I won't forget you,
And I won't forget you,
And I won't when I'm in hell I'm taking all those things,
The things that no one brings
The packing of those memories
And when I come up the Mountain of Needles
And I swim in a Lake of Blood
NO!
And I won't forget you
When I'm in hell I won't forget you---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
