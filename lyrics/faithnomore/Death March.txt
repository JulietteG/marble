There's nothing I'd like more than to let you in
But now you're on the other side and there's no way...
To feel your breath of life upon my face
Cause with the state you're in there wouldn't be a trace
No I wake up every night with this emptiness inside
Hasn't been the same since you left without a trace
Quit the human race, did you? Camina con la muerto?---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
