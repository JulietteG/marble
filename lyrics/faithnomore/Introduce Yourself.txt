From the day I was born, I took the bull by the horns, and gave you
plenty to scorn, well right on! Then you said in a song that life was
gettin real tough, but hey I think that you're bluffing, what of it?
Introduce yourself (right on!)
Now two de
cades gone by and I know that's a long time, para tiempo means
nada nunca. Cause I'm still the same asshole and I still wet my pants
every time that I see your face (who are you?)
Introduce yourself (right on!)
Hey Mr. Biggs, Hey Mr. Bestall, Hey Mr.
Warner what's up?
Hey Mr. Enigma, Hey Mr. Bigtime, Hey Mr. Epic, What's going on?
Introduce yourself (right on!)---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
