(Duet with Alicia Keys)

I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'

Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy or worse
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a seal
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress

Seems to get brighter
Now it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
Now it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
Now it's good
Perception that you never had
Now it's good

I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'

Say your name, enclave, to live life, on the edge
Want you to know, I see, the power, is in me
No more, vacuous, standin' up, with no stress
I will do, what I need, 'til every woman on the Earth is free

Seems to get brighter
Now it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
Now it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
Now it's good
Perception that you never had
Now it's good

I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'

Let me tell you all one time
I don't mind
I know what you're feelin'
Feelin', feelin'

I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'

And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time
We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad?  There's people i this world that don't know how this feels

I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know you are you are, and I know what you're feelin'---
