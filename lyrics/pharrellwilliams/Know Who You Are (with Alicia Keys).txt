I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy hours
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a sail
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress

When your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
You know it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good

You know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

(I want every woman to make a pledge with me)
Say your name, I pledge, to live life, on the edge
Want you to know, I see, the power, is in me
No more, acquiesce, standin' up, with no stress
Will do, what I need, 'til every woman on the Earth is free

Let me tell you all one time
I don't mind
I know what you're feelin'
Feelin', feelin'

And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time
We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels---
