I'm havin' a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam blowin' wherever I see,
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam blowin' wherever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam blowin' wherever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam blowin' wherever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam blowin' wherever I see,
Huh, despicable me
I'm havin' a bad bad day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Huh, despicable me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
