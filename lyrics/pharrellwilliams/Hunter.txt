Just because its the middle of night
That dont mean I wont hunt you down
Cause something deep inside
is pulling me and I want you now
You and I should be getting it right
Aint no sense in you roaming around
If I cant have you nobody can
This an animal speaking thatll hunt you down

And I hope you know that look in my eye (hey!)

Something say you aint alone!

Something say its time to go!
