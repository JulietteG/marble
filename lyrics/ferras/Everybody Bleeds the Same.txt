if its fear that you feel
the fear exists
on a larger scale
spin the world and stop and stare 
anywhere you land anyone you killed

you are gonna find that!
everybody bleeds the same
everybody feels the same
hey
and the preches, preches and the ride it all down like you know
but the secret is everybody bleeds the same

i am you, and you are me (you are me)
were the same mistake
back is diffrently
who is your god?
when you pray
if you brake it down
to the DNA

you are gonna find that!
everybody bleeds the same
after all
everybody feels the same
hey
and the preches, preches and the ride it all down like you know
but the secret is everybody bleeds the same

while solders pull the covers
over there den
roll over to your lover
say put your arms around me
suround me in the darkness and i pray to ever god on myself to keep
'cuz im never ever goin to get sleep
help me dream (everybody bleeds the same) and i wana dream forever (everybody feels the same)
and the preches, preches and the ride it all down like you know
but the secret is everybody bleeds the same
damn, i wana dream forever (everybody bleeds the same everybody feels the same)
damn, i wana dream forever (everybody bleeds the same)---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
