she was a snow flake
i was an earth quake
she was a flash blur
we made electricity

im frozen up
im outta luck
ive been shut down for so long
nothin gets through but theres somethin 'bout you
that makes me cry 

watchen you makin the sunshine
bringin the flat light
kissin my heart alive

somethin 'bout you
she killed my super side
theres somethin about you
makes me cry 

she was a bright light 
i was a fist fight
if i was a brick wall she'd run right into me
the freeways stuck
the sky is gray
another ordinary day to get through
but theres somethin 'bout you
that makes me cry 

watchen you makin the sun shine
breakin the flat light 
kissin my heart alive
somethin 'bout you
she kill my super side
somethin about you
makes me cry

and time i surrender
im ready to feel again
wana remember
how it feels
to get back on my knees again
open my heart and bleed again
i'll be alright
on the other side of the cirb

watchen you on the subway in the sunlight in four in the morning holdin onto light
(makes me cry)  makes me cry
and your reversing at a hundred miles an hour speeding twords me in a medeor shower
(makes me cry) makes me cry (somethin about you)
and ya still not finnished somethin i said yesterday that it wasnt even funny
(makes me cry) that makes me cry (somethin about you)
and im ready to breath and to hurt and to love and to burn and to crumble at your will
(makes me cry somethin bout you she killed my super side) 
makes me cry
something about you
that makes me cry---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
