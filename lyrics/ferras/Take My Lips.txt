i cant describe
i can relieve how i feel inside
i know i just met you the other night
but ive known firm and thin it just felt so right 

i want you to take my lips 
make them yours
take my lips and let my heart soar
cuz ive never felt like this before 
so wont you take my lips
make them yours

i can feel your body next to mine
everytime i close my eyes every time
i feel your breath on my skin
i cant wait to be with you again and again

so would you take my lips 
make them yours
take my legion and let my heart soar 
'cuz ive never felt like this before
so wont you take my lips and make them yours
and baby i oh i wana take your body
your body so close to mine
and i ooh i wana your body
make love and let all time for a time alright 
yeahh
you know i wana makes me love 
wana makes me love to you baby

so would you take my lips
make them yours
baby take my legion
i want my heart to soar 
because ive never felt like this before
so take my lips and make them yours
c'mon now
heyy
so will you take my lips
an make them yours---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
