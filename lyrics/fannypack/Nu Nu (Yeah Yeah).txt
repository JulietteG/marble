Push up to you, ready to do you
Then play it off like I thought I knew you
What's up, boy? What's yo' name?
What's yo' sign? What's the time

I'm gonna go and get this freak
Peeka boo, yo, can I take a peek?
Saw you walking down the street
You looked so fine I just had to meet

You for a drink at the cafe
Limo so stretched, I call it taffay
Come for a ride, boy, I won't bite
Unless you ask me real polite

When I saw him walking down the street
He looked so fine, I just had to meet
I asked his name, does he wanna play?
As we walked, all that I could say was

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
(All that I could say was)

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
(All that I could say was)

I know you feelin' me and boy, I feel you too
You joke and laugh with me and call me your boo
Walk me to the J train almost every day
When we're together all that I can say is

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
(All that I could say was)

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
(All that I could say was)

Can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind

Oh, yeah, goddamn
Run up on you and I take ya hand
Hey, now lay down
Now, it's time to play now

On boardwalk and park place
All up in each others face
I know you shy but it's alright
As long as you keep that body tight

Now don't you worry 'bout a thing
Isn't he lovely looking?
Just wanna shout it from the roofs
He's my boo and that's the truth

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
(All that I could say was)

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
(All that I could say was)

Hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah, yeah
