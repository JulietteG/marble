Time doesn't erase the demons you don't see still dancin' in your dreams
Draggin' up all the ways, temptation is overgrown looks like we're all alone
Truth is coming don't lie, so let me show you

Can't keep me here in the dark
I'll set you off like a spark into oblivion, (into oblivion)
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into stone into oblivion

Rise wrath of the rage those spineless spirits bleed the only half of me
Crawling out of my skin, shed every trace of you just one last thing to do
Truth is coming don't lie, so let me show you

Can't keep me here in the dark
I'll set you off like a spark into oblivion, (into oblivion)
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into stone into oblivion
Can't keep me here in the dark
I'll set you off like a spark into oblivion
Ayo ayooaaa

So let me show you
Can't keep me here in the dark
I'll set you off like a spark into oblivion, (into oblivion)
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into stone into oblivion
Can't keep me here in the dark
I'll set you off like a spark into oblivion, (into oblivion)
Can't take me down to the boat
I'll turn you back into stone into oblivion---
