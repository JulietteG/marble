Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

Its been a long bumpy ride sittin back in the saddle
Its time to get down, dirty up our knees in the battle
Come on, round up the boys, gonna make the walls rattle

Oh, our flag is tattered
And our bones are shattered
But it doesnt matter
Cause were movin forward

Round em up, round em up, lets go
Round em up, lets go

Oh, my eyes are seein red
Double vision from the blood weve shed
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

They dont know, where weve been
We got that concrete street skin
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

Weve been shot up, beat up by the fallin of the arrows (arrows, arrows, arrows)
Yeah, Im full of deep cuts right down to the marrow
But theres no doubt well get out from the bottom of the barrel

Oh, our flag is tattered
And my bones are shattered
But it doesnt matter
Cause were movin forward

Round em up, round em up, lets go
Round em up, lets go

Oh, my eyes are seein red
Double vision from the blood weve shed
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

They dont know, where weve been
We got that concrete street skin
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

Can you hear me now, can you hear me now
Im comin back for more
Do you feel me now, do you feel me now
Im breakin down your door

Im not speakin under my breath
Cause the harder you push, the rougher I get
Cause Im not shakin, when the earth starts quakin
Got my own foundation with no hesitation and the

Oh, my eyes are seein red
Double vision from the blood weve shed
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

They dont know, where weve been
We got that concrete street skin
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head

The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head
The only way Im leavin is dead
Thats the state of my, state of my, state of my head---
