Lookie here got 'em all lined up
Same bitchy girls and boys
On their hands, on their knees
Slither through the streets
Programmed to seek and destroy
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

Oh my my, no one's on my side
Too paranoid to listen to me
You can cast me out, you can tape my mouth
But you can't get a stone to bleed
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

You know I love it when you say you're afraid
But you hate it when I'm making you shake
Hang the truth from a noose
Put a hitman on the loose
Now you're countin' on him making your day

There ain't no magic bullet
There's no cure for the weak
There's no sympathetic shoulder here to put you to sleep
You're a long, long way from where you thought you would be
Ever murder has a motive, but you ain't killin' me
And it all adds up (Got something to say?)
It all adds up (Say it!)

Riddle me this before I take it all back
Been stealin' my shit for years
So kiss my choir but bad man's fire
Cause you know I'm gonna bring you to tears
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

Shake shake shake
Callin' all the snakes
Been itching for the new payroll
Bang bang bang
Blow down the new slang
You can't keep all the money you stole
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

You know I love it when you say you're afraid
But you hate it when I'm making you shake
Hang the truth from a noose
Put a hit man on the loose
Now you're countin' on him makin' your day

There ain't no magic bullet
There's no cure for the weak
There's no sympathetic shoulder here to put you to sleep
You're a long, long way from where you thought you would be
Every murder has a motive but you ain't killin' me
And it all adds up

There ain't no magic bullet
There's no cure for the weak
There's no sympathetic shoulder here to put you to sleep
You're a long, long way from where you thought you would be
Every murder has a motive but you ain't killin' me
And it all adds up---
