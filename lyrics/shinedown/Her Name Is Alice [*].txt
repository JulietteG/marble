If I had a world of my own
everything will be nonsense
nothing will be what it is
because everything will be what it isnt

I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time
And every creature lens themselves to change your state of mind
And the girl that chase the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill
Has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels

To stand outside your virtue
No one can ever hurt you
Or so they say

Her name is Alice (Alice)
She crawls into the window
Shaped in shadows
Alice (Alice)
And even though she is dreaming, she knows

Sometimes the curiosity can kill the soul but leave the pain
And every ounce of innocence is left inside her brain
And through the looking glass we see she's painfully returned
But now off with her head I fear is everyone's concern

You see there's no real ending
It's only the beginning
Come out and play

Her name is Alice (Alice)
She crawls into to the window
Shapes in shadows
Alice (Alice)
And even though she is dreaming
She's a locked for meaning for you
This kingdom good riddance good freedom and innocence
Has brought this whole thing down

Her name is Alice (Alice)
She crawls into to the window
Shapes in shadows
Alice (Alice)
And even though she is dreaming
She's a locked for meaning

She's a locked for meaning for you

In contrariwise
what it is it wouldnt be
and what it wouldnt be it would
