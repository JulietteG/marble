You can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name.
You can have the light of the world blind you, bath you in grace.
But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands.
Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand.

You can be an angel of mercy or give into hate.
You can try to buy it just like it every other careless mistake.
How do you justify I'm mystified by the ways of your heart.
With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart.
Wooaahh!

No one gets out alive, every day is do or die.
The one thing you leave behind.
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed.
But while you're on your knees.
How did you love, how did you love, how did you love?

Nothing ever feels the quite same when you are what you dreamed.
And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, loose our way from the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate or duplicate, gotta find your own way. Wooaahh!

No one gets out alive, every day is do or die.
The one thing you leave behind.
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed.
But while you're on your knees.
How did you love, how did you love, how did you love?

This ain't no cross to carry.
We are the judge and jury; we are the judge and jury.

No one gets out alive, every day is do or die.
The one thing you leave behind.
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed.
But while you're on your knees.

How did you love, how did you love, how did you love?

This ain't no cross to carry
We are the judge and jury, we are the judge and jury

How did you love, how did you love?
How did you love, how did you love?---
