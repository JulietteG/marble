Listen up, there's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top
So how are you feeling down there?
It's a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught, stuck, here with your enemies!

Who do you think you are?
Tearing us all apart
Where did you think you could go?
Cause everyone already knows
It's twenty to one
Mister you better run!

You got the world on it's knees
You're taking all that you please
You want more! (You want more!)
But you'll get nothing from me
You're like the burden we bear
You love the hate that we share
You want more! (You want more!)
But you'll get nothing from me
We're enemies! Enemies!

You started something that you just couldn't stop,
You turned the ones that you love into the angriest mob.
And their one last wish is that you pay for it
And there's no way you're getting out of this.

Who do you think you are?
Tearing us all apart
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It's twenty to one
Mister you better run!

You got the world on it's knees
You're taking all that you please
You want more! (You want more!)
But you'll get nothing from me
You're like the burden we bear
You love the hate that we share
You want more! (You want more!)
But you'll get nothing from me
We're enemies! Enemies! Enemies!!!

Where did you think you could go?
Cause everyone already knows
It's twenty to one
Mister you better run!
You got the world on it's knees
You're taking all that you please
You want more! (You want more!)
But you'll get nothing from me
You're like the burden we bear
You love the hate that we share
You want more! (You want more!)
But you'll get nothing from me
We're enemies! Enemies! Enemies!!!
