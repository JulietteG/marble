Come on in, take a seat.
Tell me how you feel this weak.
Are you cursed? Are you blessed?
Are you still inside the mess?
All those feelings wrapped around you,
Hold you down so you
can't break through.
It's a trap, so don't
ask. it's a shadow on
Your back. It don't
burn, it don't bleed,
Still it cuts you at the knee.
All this pressure that surrounds you,
Holds you down but you know you
Gotta break through.

[Chorus]
Hey, c'est la vie.
Remember me? I made you, dressed
And trained you.
Hey, it's bitter sweet.
You can't kill me with kindness,
I don't buy it.
Strip down, show me flesh and bone.
(Strip Down.)
'Cause now I own you.

Take a breath, hold it in.
Now look up, let's begin.
Lesson learned, take a turn.
Now you come around again,
All those feelings wrapped around you,
Hold you down so you
can't break through.

Time is up, take your shot.
'Cause your story's all you got.
Don't back down, don't say no.
Just stay still and let go.
All this pressure that surrounds you,
Holds you down but you know
You've gotta break through.

[Chorus]
Hey, c'est la vie.
Remember me? I made you, dressed
And trained you.
Hey, it's bitter sweet.
You can't kill me with kindness,
I don't buy it.
Strip down, show me flesh and bone.
(Strip Down.)
'Cause now I own you.

(You can't kill me with
kindness, no I don't buy it.)
Strip down, show your flesh and bone.
'Cause now I own you.

[Chorus]
Hey, c'est la vie.
Remember me? I made you, dressed
And trained you.
Hey, it's bitter sweet.
You can't kill me with kindness,
I don't buy it.
Strip down, show me flesh and bone.
(Strip Down.)
'Cause now I own you.

Now I own you. [x3]
You know I own you.---Lyrics submitted by Tim.
