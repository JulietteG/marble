For fear the hearts of men are failing,
These are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading,
God's word declared it would be so

(Chorus)
I'm going where there's no Depression,
To a lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble,
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there

In that bright land, there'll be no hunger,
No orphan children crying for bread,
No weeping widows, no toil or struggle,
No shrouds, no coffins and no death

(Chorus)

That dark hour of midnight nearing
Tribulation time will come
The storms will hurl in midnight fear
Sweep lost millions to their doom

(Chorus X2)---Lyrics submitted by Andy McCullough.
