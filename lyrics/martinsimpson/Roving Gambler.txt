Im a roving gambler I've gambled all around
And whenever I see a deck of cards, well I lay my money down, boys,
I lay my money down

And I have gambled down in Georgia, Ive gambled up in Maine
Im a going on down to Texas for to gamble my last game, boys,
To gamble my last game

Now as I came into Danville town, I got stuck on a Danville girl,
I said, boys the chick was out of sight, she wore the Danville curl, boys,
She wore the Danville curl.

And she wore a hat on the side of her head like the high born folks all do,
The very next train came down the line, I bid the gal adieu, boys,
I bid the gal adieu.

Yes I did.

You know she took me to her parlour, she cooled me with her fan
And she whispered low in her mammys ear I love the gambling man, ma
I love the gambling man

She said, now daughter dearest daughter how can you treat me so
To leave your own dear mother and with the gambler go, girl
With the gambler go

And I wouldnt marry no farmer, cos hes always in the rain
I would rather marry a gambling man with his great big watch and chain, ma,
His great big watch and chain

I wont marry no miller, cos hes always in the dirt
I would rather marry a gambling man with his great big fancy shirt, ma,
His lovely silky shirt.

She took me to her boudoir, she did all that she could do,
The very next train come down the line, I bid the gal adieu, boys,
I bid the gal adieu.

You know that Im a roving gambler and I've gambled all around
And whenever I see a deck of cards, well I lay my money down, boys,
I lay my money down

And I have gambled down in Texas, Ive gambled out in Spain
But Im a going on down to New Orleans, to gamble my last game, boys,
To gamble my last game---Lyrics submitted by Andy McCullough.
