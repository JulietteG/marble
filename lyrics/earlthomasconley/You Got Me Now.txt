I know you know what it's like
to feel like no one cares
to reach your arms out in the night 
and find there's no one there
the night's too long 
and life's too short
to ever live alone
love has finally come to stay 
and those days are gone

You've got me now
You've got me now
and I'll be here to keep u warm
from now on
lay your head down
rest your heart all night
it's alright
you've got me now

I thought I'd been in love so true
that it would never end
girl I know you've been there too
you don't have to go back again
cuz ill be here close by your side
as you lay down at night
and when the world is on your shoulders
I will share your load

You've got me now
You've got me now
and I'll be here to keep you warm
from now on
lay your head down
rest your heart all night
it's alright


you've got me now
you've got me now
oh it's alright
cuz you've got me now---Lyrics submitted by Melinda Baird.
