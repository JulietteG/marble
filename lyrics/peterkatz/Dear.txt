Tell me your name I will write it on my hand
Hold it there as long as I can
And as it fades it will fold into my skin
Then I hold you always within

Oh my dear by the light of the moon
I don't feel so afraid of you
I can say all the words I've wanted to
Dear by the light of the moon

I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
or you stood there with nothing to say
I had to tell you, get it off my chest
I guess it's up to you what I prospect  (live he sometimes sings:what happens next)

Oh my dear by the light of the moon
I don't feel so afraid of you
I can say all the words I've wanted to
Dear by the light of the moon

Usually I'm just too nervous
Trembling knees, fingers blue
you would be my only purpose
I wouldn't ask the same of you
I wouldn't ask the same of you

Oooh my dear by the light of the moon
I don't feel so afraid of you
I can say all the words I've wanted to
Dear by the light of the moon

Tell me your name I will write it on my hand.---Lyrics submitted by Alette Boran.
