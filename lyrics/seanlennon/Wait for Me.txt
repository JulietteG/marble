Please dont ask me why
True as a sky
Everyone is born to die
So take your time
But dont take mine
Lose yourself but dont lose your mind

Somewhere out there in between
The moon and the sea
Ill be waiting for you, my dear,
So wait for me

You cant regreat what you forget
If only you could forget it
But it takes time and plenty of wine
The weight of the world there in your eyes
Nothing could ever come to you unless you try, try, try
You find yourself in trouble if you cannot tell a lie
Its easy as pie

Somewhere out there inbetween
The moon and the sea
Ill be waiting for you, my dear,
Just wait and see

Somewhere out there inbetween
The moon and the sea
Ill be waiting for you, my dear,
So wait for me.---Lyrics submitted by L..
