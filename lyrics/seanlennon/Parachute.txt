If I had to die tonight
Id rather be with you
Cut the parachute before the time
Baby dont you cry
You had to bring me down
Youve had some fun before we hit the ground
Love is like an airplane
We jumped in then we pray
The lucky ones remain
In the clouds for days
Life is just a stage
Lets put on the best show
And let everyone know
As if I had to die tonight
Id rather be with you
Cut the parachute before the time
Baby dont you cry
You had to bring me down
Youve had some fun before we hit the ground
Love is like hurricane
You know its on the way
You think you can be brave
Underneath the waves 
Life is just a dream
Which of us is dreaming
Who will wake up screaming
As if I had to die tonight
Id rather be with you
Cut the parachute before the time
Baby dont you cry
You had to bring me down
Youve had some fun before we hit the ground
As if I had to die tonight
Id rather be with you
Cut the parachute before the time
Baby dont you cry
You had to bring me down
Youve had some fun before we hit the ground
As if I had to die tonight
Id rather it was you
Cut the parachute before the time
Baby dont you cry
You had to bring me down
Youve had some fun before we hit the ground---Lyrics submitted by Brooke.
