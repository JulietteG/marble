We got bombs and we got guns 
We got every thing you could want under the sun
We got plesher we got pain
We got people who think that there the same
Were the fallin in the world 
We got bullets in the law
Were the kiss of love that heals it all
It so pretty down here 
It might move you to this

Cause i am an earthman
And i was born to live out of hell
The poets and the pornstars 
The lovers and the tides, oh
And i never met a mad man 
Who didnt have a cause
And i never met a pervert 
Who didnt have a broken heart 
And i am 
An earthman

I am an earthman 
I was born 
To live out of hell
The poets and the pornstars the 
Lovers and the tides, oh
And i never met a mad man 
Who didnt have a cause 
And i never met a pervert 
Who didnt have a broken heart
And i am, and i am, and i am,
And i am and i am and i am 
The poets and the porn stars the lovers and the tides ohh,
And i am and i am
The poets and the porn stars the lovers and the tides ohh,
And i am and i am
The poets and the porn stars the lovers and the tides ohh,
An earth man---Lyrics submitted by danielle.
