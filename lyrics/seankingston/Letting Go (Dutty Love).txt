Ay' Yo Sean, You Mr. Kingston

Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love

Don't be scared girl, Call on me,
Cause me I'm a watcher from my eyes I'm a lover, you see,
And the Way you are Wind and the way you are Grind,
Said no matter how much I feel rushed, Yeah like that Red won't stop (Yo)
But baby girl will you be mine,
Let Go, show your skin because you're one of a kind,
And I'm alive, girl I must be in love,
Cause the way you are grindin' off my car top,

Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love

What If you would Just come Right out of these Clothes?
You can Finally feel the Wind when it blows,
Don't be Scared to be Free to Let go, Show it off,
Feel like Letting Go,
Oh Oh Oh Oh

I'm here and and You might not like,
Cos you need Sean King in your life, (Call)
King I'm a man and a man can't change,
And if I come over there's a girl lock up with em' limbs, (Yo)
I feel like Letting Go,
If you never know, Baby now you know,
Cause youre One of a kind, and you Dress so fine,
Like my Diamond Chain, you Shine so Bright, Oh,

Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love
I'm feeling like you Letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty Love Love

What If you would Just come Right out of these Clothes?
You can Finally feel the Wind when it blows,
Don't be Scared to be Free to Let go, Show it off,
Feel like Letting Go,
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ay' Yo Sean, You Mr. Kingston,
You say You have it, Louie it and then some,
Look how you grinding on all your ice
You pretty and You nice,
You Done Want Nicki as your wife,
But You say, Ill be up Where you Stay,
I Aint Like them Other Bitches that Will be Actin' loosely,
Know you gettin' hyper, I know you Wanna get up In it,
But I just wanna think about it for another minute,
I think I like your style Ya'll,
Why Ya'll,
Why don't we Let Go,
Ay Yo, 
And I aint gotta tell 'em,
And I aint gotta sell 'em,
It's YSL, 
Teddy, I aint gotta spell it,
And yes, I killa kill 'em,
I guess I am the Villain,
I park on the curb, I'm the owner of the building (the building),
Ya Deaf?,
Boy Me Soon Left,
Come get this playboy bunny like Hugh Heph,
Sigh, Rastafari,
Dutty Dutty D-D-D Dutty,

What If you would Just come Right out of these Clothes?
You can Finally feel the Wind when it blows,
Don't be Scared to be Free to Let go, Show it off,

Feel like Letting Go
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Feel like Letting Go
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Feel like Letting Go (Lighter)
Oh Oh Oh Oh---Lyrics submitted by jennifer.
