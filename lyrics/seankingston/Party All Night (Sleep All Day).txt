We like to sleep all day and party all night!
This is how we like to live our life!
Hands up!
Oh, oh, lets go!
Its an illusion, yeah!
Aint no time for seclusion, yeah!
Come on and put your body in here,
Until you cant stand it,
Just rock it, rock it, oh!
So much confusion, yeah!
Cause everybody is losing it!
Its feeling like the best of all nights
With the flashing lights, we rock it, oh, oh, oh!
And we dont let our worries inside,
Until it gets bright outside,
Were breaking all the rules that we know!
Were out of control!
We rock it, we roll!
And nothing gonna ever stop the body you know!

We like to sleep all day and party all night!
This is how we like to live our life!
Ive got a feeling that everything is gonna be all right,
So come on, come on!
We like to sleep all day and party all night!
This is how we like to live our lives!
Ive got a feeling that everything is gonna be all right,
So come on, come on!

Were going like the rebels in the cars,
And were breaking the laws,
And we rock it, rock it oh, oh!
No, no! No light until the day comes, no!
We gonna ...
Cause we rock it!
And we dont let our worries inside,
Until it gets bright outside,
We break all the rules that we know!
Were out of control!
We rock it, we roll!
And nothing gonna ever stop the body you know!

We like to sleep all day and party all night!
This is how we like to live our life!

We gonna rock until the night is done,
We aint gonna stop until we see the sun,
And we will never ever
No need for solutions,
Were starting up a revolution!
