steady, are you ready?

[Sean Kingston:]
going through a dark place, dark time
and i couldnt even see the light
had my back up against the world
i was feeling like do or die
but what dont kill me make me stronger
i know its gon be alright
so we celebrating tonight
yo we celebrating love tonight

the time is now
gotta make it count
so before we die
lets go all out

up, up, up, up
take me to my car

all of the prayers

cause we young and free

the time is now

heres the king

[T.I.:]
ok, them suckers tried to bury me
jesus had to carry me
middle finger to the ripper
nigga aint no scaring me
you cant be
you dont understand who i am
(im who i am)
its trouble man, 100 grand in my pan
we gon drop these hard times
flip to 7-8 blocks
masseraties, ferraris that money yall payback
president stop me, imagine if i say that
still shining on
gon make them haters put their shades on
when tragedy strikes, i strike back
they told me to roll over and die
who does that?

guess this is me ballin in the afterlife
lets get it

back to life, back to reality
back to life, back to reality

we gotta live it up
up, up, up, up
take me to my car
car, car, car, car
dj turn it up
up, up, up, up
bring me back to life
back to life

now we gotta live it up
up, up, up, up
you know we dont give a what
what, what, what, what

bring me back to life
back to life
back to life---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
