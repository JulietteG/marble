This the one that the DJ play
All the sexy gyal dem wah shake (x2)

[Verse 1]
She walked right over to me
And her eyes dem went right through me
She said you're somebody I should know
And all the things that she was saying
Had my actions delaying
Before I knew it, we're on the floor

Oh you're slipping me your number, oh it makes me start to wonder
What I, What I should do
Your intentions are so clear so keep your body right here
Don't you move, cus I feel it too

Chorus:
You're dancing on me like you're my girlfriend
You tell me u wanna be my girlfriend
But just for tonight, and I won't regret it
And even if we break up, no matter what, tonight you're my girlfriend

Dj play the song and dedicate to me and my new girlfriend
Dj play the song and dedicate to me and my new...

[Verse 2]
No we're touching like we're dating
I could see that you ain't playing
I could tell you know what you're looking for
And I'm a mess so I gotta say it
Oooh, I wanna take it
And I won't make you wait anymore

And you put your hands up under so I don't have to wonder
What you, what you came here for
Cus the way you put it on me girl, I won't leave you lonely girl,
She say, I want that and more

Chorus:
You're dancing on me like you're my girlfriend
You tell me u wanna be my girlfriend
But just for tonight, and I won't regret it
And even if we break up, no matter what, tonight you're my girlfriend

DJ play the song and dedicate to me and my new girlfriend
DJ play the song and dedicate to me and my new...

[Break]
Tonight I'm not gonna let you be alone
Baby come on, baby come on,
Since you my girlfriend I want to take you home
Baby come on, baby come on

Chorus:
You're dancing on me like you're my girlfriend
You tell me u wanna be my girlfriend
But just for tonight, and I won't regret it
And even if we break up, no matter what, tonight you're my girlfriend

DJ play the song and dedicate to me and my new girlfriend
DJ play the song and dedicate to me and my new... (x2)

One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
