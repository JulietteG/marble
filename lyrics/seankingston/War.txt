I'm at War 

Chorus
I'm at war
Fighting for the one that I love and the one that I truly need
I'm at war
Shawty I take a bullet for you girl
cause you mean the world to me
I'm at war

Sean Kingston
Me love you girl, you loving me
So don't fight together cause it was meant to be
Me feel like, I'm in the army
Cause to be with you, that's where my heart wanna be

It's like I'm about to die just to get with you
Feel like you're putting me through World War II
Got my soldier suit and my Timberland boots
Girl I'm down for whatever cause my love is true
So I tell her I'm at war with the love of my life
Sweat from my brows running down to my eyes
Everything you are's what I need in my life my life my life

Chorus
I'm at war
Fighting for the one that I love and the one that I truly need
I'm at war
Shawty I take a bullet for you girl
cause you mean the world to me
I'm at war

At war, at war, at war, at war, at war.
I'm at war
(repeat)

Lil Wayne
Salute to all the veterans
And girl your love's like a nuclear weapon
I'm a five star purple hearter purple sparker camouflage
Follow my every command and order
You can just call me Captain Carter
So let the missiles rain on your parade
Cause my love is a soldier
and my heart is a grenade, kabloom
I'll bomb any platoon, just call me World War II

Chorus
I'm at war
Fighting for the one that I love and the one that I truly need
I'm at war
Shawty I take a bullet for you girl
Cause you mean the world to me
I'm at war

Sean Kingston
Your mother said, don't talk to me
But it went through those ears girl, as I can see
So make me know whats your fantasies

Cause baby girl I think that stands to me
I'm on the front line and Im risking my life
I'll make a sacrifice just to have you by my side
You're the one I love, you're the one I trust
I'll hurt someone that come between us

So I tell her I'm at war with the love of my life
Sweat from my brows running down to my eyes
Everything you are is what I need in my life my life my life

Chorus
I'm at war
Fighting for the one that I love and the one that I truly need
I'm at war
Shawty I take a bullet for you girl
cause you mean the world to me
I'm at war---Lyrics submitted by nataly.
