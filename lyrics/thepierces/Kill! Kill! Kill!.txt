What were you doing in my dream last night
Hunnie?
Well I thought I locked that door up tight,
Baby.
Well it's a mystery to me
How you keep on slippin'
In my mind
And it's downright dirty that this 'ol wound
Won't heal with time

Well you could wash my bain
You could tear out my heart
But I would never forget you
(never)
You could change my name
I could make a new start
But I would never forget you
(never)

And it's kill kill.. killin' me
It's Kill Kill Kill Kill Killin' me
That I'm still in love with you

Just when I think, I've got you in safe keeping
Thats when your memory, it comes round creepin'
Well it's an ache I can't shake
It's creeped down deep down to my core
But babe I can't fake it, I can't take this heartbreak
Anymore.

Well you could wash my bain
You could tear out my heart
But I would never forget you
(never)
You could change my name
I could make a new start
But I would never forget you
(never)

And it's Kill Kill.. Killin' me
It's Kill Kill. Killin' me
That I'm still in love with you

(it's killin. Me)

I asked you please to leave my heart
But you refused to go
I can't take this pain much longer
You insist on teaching me what I already know
Absence made this heart grow fonder

Ahh

[meow]
Well you could wash my bain
You could tear out my heart
But I would never forget you
(never)
You could change my name
I could make a new start
But I would never forget you
(never)

And it's Kill Kill Killin' me
It's Kill Kill Killin' me
That I'm still in love with you.---Lyrics submitted by Damari.
