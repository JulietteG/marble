If it makes you love me more
To put one foot out the door
Step outside

And if you feel wild & free
When you run away from me
Run away

Cuz I can hear it in your voice
In a sweet & fever rush
When you look at me & say
That you love me in there & then

Blood on my hands & my body
Blood that washes clean like water
Love that cuts so deep
It heals me

I wanna love you more
If you would open up the door
And step outside

Blood on my hands & my body
Blood that washes clean like water
Love that cuts so deep

Blood on your hands & your body
Blood that washes clean like water
Love that cuts so deep
It heals me

It heals me
It heals me

If it makes you love me more---Lyrics submitted by Gnat.
