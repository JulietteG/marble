Perfect little spouses
In perfect little houses
Its family fun time
Lets commit a hatecrime

...If I cant be loved,
Then I'll be hated

I'm disconnected
I'm uninspired
I'm burning in water
I'm drowning in fire

I'm trapped inside my mind
Beneath these piles of stinking life
You use this abuse to keep me conquered
You're so absurdly common

Vacant faces
Brainless strangers

Sputtering, stuttering insect language
I'm the creature you created
Everyday I grow jaded
Calloused and exaspered

If I'll never be loved
Then I'll be hated

I'm the one of the freaks, the faggots, the geeks, the savages, rouges, rebels, dissident devils, artists, martyrs, infidels...

Do we sit still
Under attack

Or do we start pushing back?

Never back up
Never back down

And Fight
Rise, Rebel, Resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist
Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist

I'm human pollution
I covet retribution
I'm just a big mistake
A defect you can subjugate

Your ridicule is just typical antics
Spineless, mindless, tragic, fanatic

Puritan, bigot, lunatic, hypocrite

To save my soul from disaster
Self destruction could be the answer

If I'll never be loved
Then I'll be hated

I'm the one of the freaks, the faggots, the geeks, the savages, rouges, rebels, dissident devils, artists, martyrs, infidels...

Do we sit still
Under attack

Or do we start pushing back?

Never back up
Never back down

And Fight
Rise, Rebel, Resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist
Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist

Masochistic
So sadistic
All they see is another statistic

Maybe I'm a misfit, maybe I'm different
It will never be an average existence

Masochistic
So sadistic
All they see is another statistic

If I cant be loved
Then I'll be hated

Its family fun time
Lets commit a hatecrime

WAR WAR

Rise, Rebel, Resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist
Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist

We are the freaks, the faggots, the geeks, the savages, rouges, rebels, dissident devils, artists, martyrs, infidels...

Do we sit still
Under attack

Or do we start pushing back?

Never back up
Never back down
And Fight

WAR WAR---
