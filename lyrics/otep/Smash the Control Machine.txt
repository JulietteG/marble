(With the perfect hair
And the perfect wife
And the perfect kids
And the perfect life
I will finally be somebody...)

(Let's play born-again American, resistance is the game!)

Two pigs wearing suits
Brought the news
That I'm wanted by the bank

They say the rent is due
Caesar's onto you
So you better remember your place

Then they outsourced my job
And gave a raise to my boss

Bailed out the banks
But billed me for the loss

They say we must submit
And be one with the Machine

Because the Kingdom of Fear
Needs compliance to succeed

So waterboard the kids for fun
It's all the rage

And play born-again American
Resistance is the game

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

(The revolution will be monetized
And streamed live via renegade WiFi)

The clinic said I'm sick
Toxic..... and impure

But there isn't any cure
For the poor or uninsured

So we live our digital lives
On multiple screens

And we forget that
The blood of the workers
Grease the machines

In the Psalm of the Fiends
Love ...... discriminates

While the fat cats feed the rats
Their daily dose of cake

So waterboard the kids for fun
It's all the rage

And play born-again American
Resistance is the game

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Haters, betrayers, liars, and thieves

(America)

She sold her soul
For designer clothes

For the perfect lips
And the perfect nose

The winner in the end
Always owns the most

Reality tv told her so!

(Mammonites)

Money changer!
Greedy bankers!

This is the Peoples House!

My minister has a sinister plan
To save my soul with a credit card scam

Exploitation is contagious
For the selfish & self-inflated

Start a war, use the poor,
Watch our profits soar & soar

We've become a nation of wolves
Ruled by sheep

Owned by swine
Overfed & put to sleep

And while the media's elite
Decrees what to think

I am wide awake
On the edge
And on the brink

So when Atlas shrugs
And The Fountainhead bleeds
And when Walstreet Apostles
Preach a gospel of greed

I'll renounce the fame of this gluttonous age
And be a Born-again American
Resistance is to blame!

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Haters, betrayers, liars, and theives

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
A nation of wolves - ruled by sheep!

Exploitation is contagious
Exploitation is contagious
Exploitation is contagious
Exploitation............---
