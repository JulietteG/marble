If you do this
If you do this you'll never have a chance to try again.
If you do this you'll never have a chance to try.

It's the same sound
Same sting.
The same collapse
Of every thing.

It's the same slice,
Same blade,
The same lie,
Same ol' vein

My weight
My face
My height
My race
I'm a mistake.

My weight
My face
My height
My race
I'm such a disgrace.

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Like cracks in the glass
And faded photographs

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Let them come near when
Imperfections will keep you unique

Nothing left to lose, just try again
Nothing left to lose, just try again

Its the same doubt,
The same dream
It's the same sabotage
'cos I'm the enemy

It's the same night
Same day
It's the same parasite,
Feeding on the betrayed.

My weight
My face
My height
My race
I'm a mistake

My weight
My face
My height
My race
I'm such a disgrace

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Like cracks in the glass
And faded photographs

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
A work in progress
Perfection is killing me

A disguise of self-deception
Hides my secrets perfectly
I'm rejecting my reflection
'cos I hate the way it judges me

Don't you do it
You're not even you yet
Don't you do it
You're not even you yet

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
Like cracks in the glass
And flame full of grass

You're perfectly flawed
You're perfectly incomplete
A work in progress
Perfection is killing me...---Lyrics submitted by Jerwin.
