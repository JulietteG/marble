Unlearn all of the things you taught
Woke up now I can't keep standing still
Gotta run, fill my lungs with the love I feel
I feel, I I

Ooh, power
I feel the power

Take a deep breath, I'm jumping in
This is where you end and I begin
See the world through my kaleidoscope
I am the one I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for

I got the power
Ooh, power
I feel the power
Ooh, power

Sometime it feels like
Life is flashing right by
Sometimes it feels like
Life is flashing right by

I feel the power
Ooh, power
I feel the power
Ooh, power---
