I breathe, I hear 
But I dont believe it
My heart, it beats 
But inside Im freezing
My hands shake
Theyve lost all their feeling
Nowhere to take
You say that youre leaving
And theres no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Chorus:
Where do I go when Im so alone?
Where do I turn when you are so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears Ive cried, Ill survive 
Im alive

Im stripped, Im bare
Im left here with nothing
I hold the wheel
And know where Im going
Your face, I see, in every reflection
No time, no space
Ive lost all direction
And theres no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Chorus

Im gonna get there someway
Through all the tears that you bring
And any road I can take
Just to get me some place
Where all the stars on my heart 
And all the lies in the dark
Disappear in my head 

Lights so bright, tonight
Gonna drive them away

Chorus

Im Alive---Lyrics submitted by Shane.
