The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty sky

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands 
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was then at my command, my love.

And the first time ever I layed with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth

At last, at last, at last
Till the end of time
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face, your face...
Your face.......---Lyrics submitted by Dennis.
