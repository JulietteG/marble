I cant wait for the day to end
So I can finally see your face again
We'll find a way if this wish comes true tonight

Even though I 
never met you 
i still miss you
i can feel you in my dreams
and i hope that
when you wake up
just maybe you'll remember me

And now I believe that this is fate
'Cause baby we belong together
I know everything is gonna be ok
Just as long as we have eachother
Through the sunshine and through the rain
I know that it'l last forever
Just last night I stayed up late
And I wrote you a love letter

Tell me am I insane
I set your letter on the window pane
I thought of you as I let it fly away, and away

Even though I 
never met you 
i still miss you
i can see you in my dreams
and i hope that
when you read this
just maybe you'll remember me

And now I believe that this is fate
'Cause baby we belong together
I know everything is gonna be ok
Just as long as we have eachother
Through the sunshine and through the rain
I know that it'll last forever
Just last night I stayed up late
And I wrote you a love letter

Wrote you a love letter 
I know that we'll always be together 
Together, together, together

Eventhough I 
never met you 
I still miss you 
I can see you in my dreams 
And I hope that 
When you read this 
Just maybe you'll remember me

And now I believe that this is fate 
'Cause baby we belong together 
I know everything is gonna be OK 
Just as long as we have each other 
Through the sunshine and through the rain 
I know that it'll last forever 
Just last night I stayed up late 
And I wrote you a love letter 

Wrote you a love letter 
I know that we'll always be together 
We'll be together, together, 
We'll always be 

'Cause I wrote you a love letter---Lyrics submitted by Claire.
