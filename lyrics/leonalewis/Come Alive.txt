I don't mind if we friends for century 
I don't mind the rain
I don't mind if you hear lying next to me
I don't mind the pain

So put it on me 
Put it on me
Put it on me
I want your love
Put it on me

Come alive 
I See you when I come alive
I See you when I come alive
I revive
I see you when I come alive
I see you when I come alive

Fire runs through my veins at the speed of light
Fire through my veins 
Oh
Thousand suns lead  the way to a nenise night  
Oh woah  woah oh
I embrace the pain
I want your love 

Come alive 
I See you when I come alive
I See you when I come alive
I revive
I see you when I come alive
I see you when I come alive oh woahalive

I see you I come alive
Heyyyy
Put it on me 
Put it on me 
I want you love

Come alive 
I See you when I come alive
I See you when I come alive
I revive
I see you when I come alive
I see you when I come alive

I see you I come alive
Heyyyy
I don't mind if we friends for century 
I don't mind the rain---Lyrics submitted by Dannietoe Page.
