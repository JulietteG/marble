I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can't put out all these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can get out of this place
If you can't take the heat
Fire

I tripped and I stumbled
Watched my world crumble
Sometimes you eat dirt
You live and you learn

The lamb and the lions
The tigers and titans
Afraid to get hurt
But now I'm making them purr

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can't put out all these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can get out of this place
If you can't take the heat
Fire

Was drowning in quicksand
Nobody grabbed my hand
Thought it'd bury me
Instead, I'm set free

Moving onto the bigger things
I began to spread my wings
No longer in chains
I'm dancing over these flame

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can't put out all these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can get out of this place
If you can't take the heat
Fire

This may not be, not be perfect
But I'm happy and I've earned it
Every tear shed will be worth it
Step by step, ain't looking back
Have no regrets

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can't put out all these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
You can get out of this place
If you can't take the heat
Fire---
