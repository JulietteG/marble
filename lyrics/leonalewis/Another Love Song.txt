How'd you break through my resistance?
Or the barriers I built
My head refused to listen
But my heart knows how I feel
Tried to tell myself it's useless
Let the butterflies just flutter by
But your hold on me, it's worthless
Never thought that I'd...

Never thought I'd write another love song
Never thought I'd say these words to you
Never thought I'd write another love song
But I can't keep on fighting with you
I love you (I, I love you)
I love you (I, I love you)
I love you (I, I love you)
I do, I love you

Didn't take "no" for answer
Why'd you let me torture you?
When I made you keep your hands off
Stick around and follow the rules
Gladiator with a sweetness
Holding heaven in your arms
Tried to scare you, but you're fearless
Won the battle for my heart

Never thought I'd write another love song
Never thought I'd say these words to you
Never thought I'd write another love song
But I can't keep on fighting with you
I love you (I, I love you)
I love you (I, I love you)
I love you (I, I love you)
I do, I love you

I love you
I love you, you
I, I love you
I, I love you
Never thought about...
(I, I love you)

Never thought I'd write another love song
Never thought I'd say these words to you
Never thought I'd write another love song
But I can't keep on fighting with you
I love you (I, I love you)
I love you (I, I love you)
I love you (I, I love you)
I do, I love you---
