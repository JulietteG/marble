    someone once told me
    that you have to choose
    what you win or lose
    you cant have everything
    dont you take chances
    you might feel the pain
    dont you love in vain
    cause love wont set you free
    i could stand by the side
    and watch this life pass me by
    so unhappy but safe as could be

    CHORUS
    so what if it hurts me
    so what if i break down
    so what if this world just throws me off the edge
    my feet run out of ground
    i gotta find my place
    i wanna hear my sound
    dont care about other pain infront of me
    cause im just tryna be happy, yea
    just wanna be happy, yea

    holding on tightly
    just cant let it go
    just tryna play my roll
    slowly diasappear, oooh
    well all these tears
    they feel like theyre the same
    just different faces, different names
    get me outta here
    well i can stand by the side
    and watch this life pass me by
    pass me by

    CHORUS
    so what if it hurts me
    so what if i break down
    so what if this world just throws me off the edge
    my feet run out of ground
    i gotta find my place
    i wanna hear my sound
    dont care about other pain infront of me
    cause im just tryna be happy
    just wanna be happy
    oooh

    so any turns that i cant see
    ill count a stranger on this road
    but dont say victim
    dont say anythng

    CHORUS
    so what if it hurts me
    so what if i break down
    so what if this world just throws me off the edge
    my feet run out of ground
    i gotta find my place
    i wanna hear my sound
    dont care about all the pain infront of me
    cause im just tryna be happy
    just wanna be happy---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
