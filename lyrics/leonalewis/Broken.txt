You can take away all my love,what do I need you for?
You can take away all these words, there's no meaning anymore.
You can take away everything leave me lying on the floor, all those sorrys, we can't go back to the start.
You can't fix me, I'm torn apart.

I wanna run away from love,this time I have had enough.
Everytime I feel your touch, I'm broken.
Shattered all the pieces of parts.
Never thought I'd fall so hard.
I'm putting back together my heart, It's broken. 

You can take these photographs and watch them fade away.

You can throw away all these letters,i don't care about what they say.
All those sorrys, there's a million reasons why you can't mend me, don't even try.

I wanna run away from love, this time I have had enough.
Everytime I feel your touch, I'm broken.
Shattered all the pieces of parts.
Never thought I'd fall so hard.
I'm putting back together my heart, It's broken. 

I know it's gonna take some time,to finally realize.
I got nothing left inside, nothing to hide, Im broken, broken, broken 

I wanna run away from love,this time I have had enough.
Everytime I feel your touch, I'm broken.
Shattered all the pieces of parts.
Never thought I'd fall so hard.
I'm putting back together my heart, It's broken. 

Save me

Save me

I'm broken---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
