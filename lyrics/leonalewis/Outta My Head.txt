I keep taking
Taking you back
But I dont know why I do
You keep breaking
Breaking me down
So I'll find somebody new
Alright

I dont want to feel I'm there For you, for life
And now your begging me to see you tonight

Its funny how easy you can mess me up 
Now look how easy I get you

Outta me head, outta my head
Say goodbye
Somebody's gonna get you
Outta my head, outta my head
And tonight
I'm doing what I want to
You made the biggest mistake
And now I'm going to get you way
Outta my head, outta my head
Say goodbye
Somebody's gonna get you 

I kept taking
Taking the blame
And its soring me up inside
So defeated, losing my self
But you'll never make me cry again
Remember you and I didnt want things to end
And now your tasting all the pain I was in. 

Its funny how easy you can mess me up 
Now look how easy I get you

Outta me head, outta my head
Say goodbye
Somebody's gonna get you
Outta my head, outta my head
And tonight
I'm doing what I want to
You made the biggest mistake
And now I'm going to get you way
Outta my head, outta my head
Say goodbye
Somebody's gonna get you 

Oh
Outta my face and thoughts forever
And maybe I can sleep and breath much better
And finally I am seeing everything clearer
So watch me now
Oh
Just watch me now

Outta me head, outta my head
Say goodbye(goodbye)
Somebody's gonna get you
Outta my head, outta my head
And tonight
I'm doing what I want to
You made the biggest mistake
And now I'm going to get you way
Outta my head, outta my head
Say goodbye
Somebody's gonna get you---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
