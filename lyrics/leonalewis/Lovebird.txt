I would lay down next to you
 Stay in bed all afternoon
 We were birds of a feather
 We were always together

And I never will forget
 All the little things you said
 And that beautiful summer
 Used to call me a love bird

But the time went on, the wind has blown, and I have grown
 And I started a feeling
 That wings had been broken

And I can't believe
 That I would never want to be set free
 But I just can't stay
 So your lovebirds flyin' away

Your lovebird's flyin' away
 Cus my heart's been stuck in a cage
 Gotta sing my song, so pretty
 Dum, dum, diddy
 And I miss you everyday
 But there's nothing left to say
 Gotta sing my song, so pretty
 Dum, dum, diddy

I want the world at my feet
 Even if it's bittersweet
 Wanna stand on my own and
 Put my heart in my own hands

Cause I begun to see
 That you and me are different breeds
 So I gotta believe in
 Gotta get back to breathing

And I can't believe
 That I would never want to be set free
 But I just can't stay
 So your love bird's flyin' away

Your lovebird's flyin' away
 Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
 Gotta sing my song, so pretty
 Dum, dum, diddy
 And I miss you everyday
 But there's nothing left to say
 Gotta sing my song, so pretty
 Dum, dum, diddy

And you'll always be a part of me
 You made me who I am
 But I gotta say, I'm not afraid
 To test my wingspan.

Cause they say if you love something
 Let it go, let it go, let it go
 Open up the gate

Cause lovebird's flyin' away
 Your lovebird's flyin' away
 Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
 Gotta sing my song, so pretty
 Dum, dum, diddy
 And I miss you everyday
 But there's nothing left to say
 Gotta sing my song, so pretty
 Dum, dum, diddy---Lyrics submitted by ieyanna hood.
