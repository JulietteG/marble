Having my baby,
What a lovely way of saying how much you love me,
Having my baby,
What a lovely way of saying what youre thinking of me

I can see it, your face glowing,
I can see it in your eyes m happy you know it

That your,
Having my baby
Youre the woman I love, & Ilove what its doing to you,
Having my baby,
Youre a woman in love and I love whats going through you,

The need inside you, I see it showing,
Oh the seed iside you,
Baby do you feel it growing,
Are you happy you know it,

That youre having my baby,
(Im a woman in love and I love what its doing to me),
Having my baby,
(Im a woman in love and I love what its going through me,

Didnt have to keep it, wouldnt put you through it,
You could of swept it from your live,
But you wouldnt do it, no you wouldnt do it,

And youre having my baby,
(Im a woman in love, and I love what its doing to me),
Having my baby,
(Im a woman in love and I love what its going through me),
Hving my baby (having my baby)
What a lovely way of saying how much you love me,
Having my baby,
(Im a woman in love and I love what its going through me),
Havig my baby...............---Lyrics submitted by eduyn.
