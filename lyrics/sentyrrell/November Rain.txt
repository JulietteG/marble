When I look into your eyes I can see a love restrained But darlin' when I hold you, don't you know I feel the same? yeah Nothin' lasts forever and we both know hearts can change And it's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain.

We've been through this such a long long timeJust tryin' to kill the pain, ooh yeahBut lovers always come and lovers always goAn' no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walking away

And if we take the time to lay it on the lineI could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine, all mineSo if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrainOr I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain

 Do you need some time on your own?Do you need some time all alone?Everybody needs some time on their ownDon't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heartWhen even friends seem out to harm youBut if you could heal the broken heartWouldn't time be out to charm you?

Sometimes I need some time on my ownSometimes I need some time all aloneEverybody needs some time on their ownDon't you know you need some time all alone

And when your fears subside and shadows still remain, oh yeahI know that you can love me when there's no one left to blameSo never mind the darkness we still can find a wayNothin' lasts forever even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody?Don't ya think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebodyYou're not the only one, you're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?Don't ya think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebodyYou're not the only one, you're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?Don't ya think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebodyYou're not the only one, you're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?Don't ya think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebody---Lyrics submitted by Brianna.
