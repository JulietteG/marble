Sunlight coming through the haze 
No gaps in the blind 
To let it inside 
The bed is unmade 
Some music still plays 

TV, yeah it's always on 
The flicker of the screen 
A movie actress screams 
I'm basking in the shit flowing out of it 

I'm stoned in the mall again 
Terminally bored 
Shuffling round the stores 
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing 

X-box is a god to me 
A finger on the switch 
My mother is a bitch 
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me 

Don't try engaging me 
The vaguest of shrugs 
The prescription drugs 
You'll never find 
A person inside 

My face is mogadon 
Curiosity 
Has given up on me 
I'm tuning out desires 
The pills are on the rise 

How can I be sure I'm here? 
The pills that I've been taking confuse me 
I need to know that someone sees that 
There's nothing left I simply am not here 

I'm through with pornography 
The acting is lame 
The action is tame 
Explicitly dull 
arousal annulled 

Your mouth should be boarded up 
Talking all day 
With nothing to say 
Your shallow proclamations 
All misinformation 

My friend says he wants to die 
He's in a band 
They sound like Pearl Jam 
The clothes are all black 
The music is crap 

In school I don't concentrate 
And sex is kinda fun 
But just another one 
Of all the empty ways 
Of using up a day 

How can I be sure I'm here? 
The pills that I've been taking confuse me 
I need to know that someone sees that 
There's nothing left I simply am not here 

Bipolar disorder 
Can't deal with the boredom 

You don't try to be liked 
You don't mind 
You feel no sun 
You steal a gun 
To kill time 

You're somewhere, you're nowhere 
You don't care 
You catch the breeze 
You still the leaves 
So now where?---Lyrics submitted by Aris.
