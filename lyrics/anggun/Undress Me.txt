When I can't see right in your eyes
When I'm surrounded in the craziness of time
When you're understanding, is trying hard to stand still
When I wear layers of my pride, you should

Undress me, undress me
Unlock this chain and set me free
Remind me to be myself
Undress me, undress me
Unleash my heart and make me see
When I become someone else

Whenever I'm trapped in this tide
When I forgotten that there is you and I
When your persuasion is fighting in a blindfold
when I wear my bad moods to my mouth, you should

Undress me, undress me
Unlock this chain and set me free
Remind me to be myself, myself
Undress me, undress me
Unleash my heart and make me see
When I become someone else

Like a rose without its thorn
Like a bird without a song
Like the fire without the flame
If there's a painless love, we wouldn't be the same

Undress me, undress me
Unlock this chain and set me free
Remind me to be myself, my self
Undress me, undress me
Unleash my heart and make me see
When I become someone else

Undress me, undress me
Unlock this chain and set me free
Remind me to be myself, myself
Undress me, undress me
Unleash my heart and make me see---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
