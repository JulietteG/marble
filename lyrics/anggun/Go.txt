Go away broken heart there's no more space for your anger, no longer
go away endless tears i've no patience for your sadness, i could careless
go away far from here take all your belongings
run as fast as you can, you won't see me crying

go away loneliness please stop yelling my name out loud, you're not allowed
go away wasted dreams you're never welcomed in my head, my mind's set
go away far from here can't stand you beside me
run as fast as you can and don't look back at me

After all those times, breathing for him
After all those lies, coming from him
After all those nights, unbelieving
After all those why's, why didn't i see
he's not meant for me

go away desperation now's the time to leave me alone, on my own
go away all regrets i never want to see you again, it's your end
go away far from here and back to where you come from
run as fast as you can away from my home

After all those times, breathing for him
After all those lies, coming from him
After all those nights, unbelieving
After all those why's, why did i fall
why couldn't i know ?
why didn't i see ?
why o why did i love him ?

after all those times, now i feel better
after all those lies, i've no more anger
after all those nights, i've stopped to wonder
after all those why's, i've learnt to let you go
i have let him go---Lyrics submitted by Martahan.
