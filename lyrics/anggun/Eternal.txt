It was such a cold night in november
That followed by a much colder morning
I feel the shivers each time I remember
But in my heart something will keep burning and beating

Youre eternal cause I believe
Youre in the air that I breathe
And eternal though eyes cant see
I feel youre right here with me

One soul goes and comes in this life circle
A story that goes around with no end
Made by love and flesh were only mortals
But somehow something will always remain again

Youre eternal cause I believe
Youre in the air that I breathe
Its eternal though eyes cant see
I feel youre love upon me

Cause eternal youll always be
Youre in the air that I breathe
Though I cant see but within me
Youll always live eternally

And you live eternally
And you live eternally
Youll always live eternally

Though I cant see but within me
Youll always live eternally ---Lyrics submitted by Erich Cornelis.
