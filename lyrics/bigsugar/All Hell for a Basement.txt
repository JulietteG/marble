I am a workin' man
But I ain't worked for a while
Like some old tin can
From the bottom of the pile

I have lost my way
But I hear a tale
About a heaven in Alberta
Where they've got all hell for a basement

My words are like a rope
That's wrapped around my throat
Wash my mouth with soap
For words unfit to quote

I have lost my way
But I hear a tale
About a heaven in Alberta
Where they've got all hell for a basement

I have lost my way
But I hear a tale
About a heaven in Alberta
Where they've got all hell for a basement

And now I'm free to go
But time cannot remove
The only life I know
Now only time will prove
Yes only time will prove

I have lost my way
But I hear a tale
About a heaven in Alberta
Where they've got all hell for a basement

Yeah I lost my way
But I hear a tale
About a heaven in Alberta
Where they've got all hell for a basement---Lyrics submitted by Vicki.
