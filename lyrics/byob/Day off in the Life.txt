[tell me whaddya learn in summer school?] 4 times
oh such a happy happy holi-ass day
parents barbecue and the kids go play
with the flags up and the sky so high
always on the fourth day of a-july

and with a lot of fireworks when it gets dark
with a lot of drunk folks in Rock Creek Park
burgers and hot dogs, if you so please
oh such joy festivi-ass-ties

parades are everywhere that you try and go
and they're on TV so I missed my favorite show
but it's all cool and it's all OK
'cuz it's a most symbolic-ass day

but when i start to think
I think about what it means
and just what it is 
just ain't what it seems
to celebrate freedom from oppressive rule
but freedom from what? for what? and for whom?

my folks were still getting' those chains and those whips
on July Fourth Day one-seven-seven-six
so what does it mean to me?
just a day off from school, baby

Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor
opportunities over on these shores
you can still see her off in the distance
tellin' some folks to come to this land

freedom is what she's supposed to symbolize
and a facelift which was commercialized
and exploited so some got paid
now whatcha call that, the American Way?

well my folks came centuries before
but in chains is how they reached these shores
to be exploited and to be enslaved
upon which was built the American Way

95 North to New York I ain't smilin'
people where I'm from ain't seen no Ellis Island
so what's the Statue of Liber-ass-ty?
just a big green bitch to me
