Don't leave me lonely, don't lose my number,
my heart is bleeding, like storm and thunder.
I'm not over you, I'm not over you.

2.strophe:
Dont cross the river, if there's a fire,
can you be sure girl, there's not desire.
I'm not over you, I'm not over you.

bridge:
Was it a dream, was it real,
Was it a joke a fantasy.

refrain:
Don't think about me, when you break my heart,
Don't think about me, if you break apart.
Don't think about me, if you holy sad,
Don't think about me, I'll understand.
Don't think about me, when you try to go.
Don't think about me, and the time will show.
Don't think about me, after all these years.
Don't think about me, I'm done my tears.
Don't think about me.

3.strophe:
It's not the way girl, the story is ending,
it's not the words good, youre pretending.
I'm not over you, I'm not over you.

4.strophe:
Don't send me rainbows, I need emotions,
looks like a heartache, in deep devotion.
I'm not over you, I'm not over you.

bridge:
Was it a dream, was it real,
Was it a joke a fantasy.

refrain:
Don't think about me, when you break my heart,
Don't think about me, if you break apart.
Don't think about me, if you holy sad,
Don't think about me, I'll understand.
Don't think about me, when you try to go.
Don't think about me, and the time will show.
Don't think about me, after all these years.
Don't think about me, I'm done my tears.

Don't think about me, if you break apart.
Don't think about me, if you holy sad,
Don't think about me, I'll understand.
Don't think about me, when you try to go.
Don't think about me, and the time will show.
Don't think about me, after all these years.
Don't think about me, I'm done my tears.
Don't think about me.
Don't think about me. ---
