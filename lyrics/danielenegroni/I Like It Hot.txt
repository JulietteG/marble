I like your shaking, baby I like it cool
I like your body, lady Play it cruel
I like your loving, baby I like your style
Be my baby, baby All for this night

I like your flirting, baby Day and Night
I like your smiling, baby Side by side
I like your kissing, baby I like your move
Be my baby, baby Share my groove

Come on, baby, baby
Let my show you all what I dream

If you like it hot, girl
If you like it slowly
If you wanted good times,
Come stay with me

If you like it easy
If you like it dangerous
You will have a good time
Come play with me

I'd like to kiss your body From head to toe
Oh, how I miss you, lady I miss you so
I like your body talking Like your frame
Be my baby, baby Again, again

I like your sexy walking In the night
I like the situation Talking wild
I like your deep vibration You're killing me
You're like a real sensation I feel free

Come on, baby, baby
Let my show you all what I have

If you like it hot, girl
If you like it slowly
If you wanted good times,
Come stay with me

If you like it easy
If you like it dangerous
You will have a good time
Come play with me

(If you like it hot, girl
If you like it hot, girl, yeah
If you like it hot
Yo, if you like it hot, girl
Baby, come and play with me)

If you like it hot, girl
If you like it slowly
If you wanted good times,
Come stay with me
(Yeah, you can stay with me, come on)

If you like it easy
If you like it dangerous
You will have a good time
Come play with me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
