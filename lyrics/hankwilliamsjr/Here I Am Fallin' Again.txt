Here I am falling again
In places Ive already been
I sure didnt plan it 
And I dont understand it
But here I am falling again

Here I am lying again
Making up places that Ive never been
I thought I was through with these heartbreaking blues
But here I am lying again
Why dont a man ever take
Time to think what is at stake
Is it the danger or the pleasurable stranger
But those are the chances hell take
Id hate to come face to face
With her and her at the same place
Cause it will be hell
If I have to tell her 
Someone has taken her place

I had a beautiful wife
She found it all out one night
And the pleasurable stranger, Lord I didnt change her
And I lost it all this time
So here I am crying again
And calling for sympathy from my old friends
He once loved her and she once loved him
And here I am crying again---Lyrics submitted by Brandi.
