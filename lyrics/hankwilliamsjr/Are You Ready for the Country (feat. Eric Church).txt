Slipping and a-sliding, playing dominoes
Leftin' and a-rightin' ain't a crime, you know
Well, I gotta tell the story before it's time to go

Are you ready for the country?
Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for the country?
Ain't I a sight to see?
Are you ready for the country?
Better get ready for me

Talkin' to the preacher, said God is on your side
A-talkin' to the pushers; they both are sellin' at highs
Well, I gotta tell the story; I don't know the reason why

Are you ready for the country?
Are you ready for me?
You better get ready for the country
Ain't I a sight to see?
Are you ready for the country?
Are you ready for me?

My name is Bocephus
And my name's the Chief

Are you ready for the country?
Are you ready to go? (Yeah, are you ready to, ready to go?)
Are you ready for the country?
Get ready to go (You better get ready to show)
Are you ready for the country?
Get ready for me (Hey, Hank, are you ready for me? Whoo!)

(Are you ready for the country?)
Are you ready for the country? Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me? (Are you ready for the country?)
Are you ready for the country?
Are you ready for the country?

(Are you ready for the country?)
Are you ready for the country? Are you ready for, ready for country?
(Are you ready for the country?)
(Are you ready for the country?)
Are you ready, are you, are you? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the country?
Are you ready for me?
Better get ready for me---
