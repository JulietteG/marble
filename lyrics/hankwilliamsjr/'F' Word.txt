Well Ive been hangin out with my rebel son, Kid Rock
And I dont really like this stuff they call hip hop
But, hes sure been good to me
And Im still trying to make him see
In country music, you just cant say the f word

My son, Shelton, says hes been a havin a hard time
Yeah, he does great shows, but he just gotta speak his own mind
Well, I wonder where that came from?
I guess hes a real son of a gun
Take the old mans advice, be nice and lose the f word

No, no in country music you just cant say the f word
Oh, weve come a long way, but its best if that ones not heard
Oh, weve had some hells and damns
But we dont say bitch, we say Why, yes mam!
Cause in country music, you just dont use the f word

Todays hot new country, it sounds pretty good to me
But, its time for basics, our roots and some reality
You gotta scrape me off of the ceilin
When Mrs. Hawkins says it with feelin
But in country music, you just cant say the f word

No, no in country music you just dont use the f word
Oh, weve come a long way, but its best if that ones not heard
Oh, weve had some hells and damns
But wed never say that wed say Why yes mam!
Cause in country music, you just dont use the f word

Some of these guys say it 500 times
But in country music you dont use it one damn time
Cause in country music, we dont say the f word ---
