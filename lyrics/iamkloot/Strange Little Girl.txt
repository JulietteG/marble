Strange little girl,
Strange little girl, 
From out of which world have you come?

She says pay me no heed, 
This is my creed,
I just take what I need and I'm gone.

Strange little girl,
Wherever you're from I am from, 
Strange little girl,
Wherever you've gone I have gone
Gone

Pay me some mind,
Pay me some mind,
Just take what I find and be gone.

Strange little girl,
Wherever you're from I am from, 
Strange little girl,
Wherever you've gone I have gone
Gone

Strange little girl,
Strange little girl,
From out of which world have you come?---Lyrics submitted by Beka.
