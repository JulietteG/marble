Hell for leather, lathered, drunk, you're soused,
You're pissed, you're sunk,
The juke box now is drunk, just along the way.....
I had a call on saturday to say I'd thrown
My friends away, reversed the charges on 'em all,
I made a lot of calls.

Is there a storm coming or are we just another shower,
Is this a storm warning,
Has someone just cut the power,
Is there a storm coming or are we just another shower,
Is there a storm coming, coming, coming.

I would have kept you free from harm rang the bells or
Raised alarms,
I would have kept them all at bay,
Except I thought I heard you say,
You're the leper boy you can't come in,
The moneky god is now you're king, you're out,
You're in, you're out,
You're in, you're out,

Is there a storm coming or are we just another shower,
Is this a storm warning,
Has someone just cut the power,
Is there a storm coming or are we just another shower,---Lyrics submitted by maryam asadi.
