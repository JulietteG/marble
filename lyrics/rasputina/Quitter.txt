I have worked out every small detail
In this plan i hav made
This thing which cannot fail. 
I dare myself to do this one thing. 
You can have my car 
Go and take everything. 

All that's good is gone. 
Its gone
I have tried too long. 

I don't think Ill miss my mom & dad, 
The class I cut, 
All the friends I never had., 
These things I won't miss, 
Won't miss me. 

My house, 
My block, 
The baby bird I set free. 
The dance that I was never asked to, 
The teachers 
that thought they knew me. 
They'll all remember what I did. 
They'll ask "Whose fault was it?" 
"Oh she was just a kid." 

I'll be glad to go, you see. 
You don't even know me. 
Not at all.

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!)
Oh we are as one with the acorns, my son.
No trunk, no branch, no tree.
You scratch at my skirts and that's what we go find,
I rock you into sleep.

I'm queen of the hilltop,
you're prince number one.
I see the devil, alive in your eyes.
I beg you now don't stop, my baby, my son.
Don't look at nobody but me.

Oh, we are as one with the acorns, my son,
that's where we ought to be.
