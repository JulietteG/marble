On and on looking out my window,
You were gone.
I turn around, oh I felt so loney,
I couldn't go on.

Hey, hey, don't you stay away.
Hey, hey, I've got something to say.

Live for the dream,
Oh that's what it's all about.
Follow the dream,
you know we can work it out.

I don't believe in a world without your love in,
Can't you see
It's got to be you're in my thoughts each moment,
Ever set me free.

Live for the dream,
Oh that's what it's all about.
If you follow the dream,
You know we can work it out.

You're all I ever wanted, all I need,
You know you really mean the world to me,
So much hate if you let me go,
Giving you these words so that you know.

Live for the dream,
Oh that's what it's all about.
If you follow the dream...

Live for the dream...
You gotta follow the dream...

You know you've got to
Live, live for the dream.
Live, live for the dream.
Live, live for the dream.
Live, live for the dream.

Hey, hey, live for the dream.
Hey, hey, live for the dream.

Live, live for the dream.
Live, live for the dream.
Live, live for the dream.
Live, live for the dream.---Lyrics submitted by PacMani.
