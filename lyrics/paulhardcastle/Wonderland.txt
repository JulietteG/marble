I'm in wonderland with you and it feels so nice
You made all my dreams come true, feels like paradise.

I'm in wonderland.

I'm in wonderland with you and it feels so nice
You made all my dreams come true, feels like paradise.

I'm in wonderland.

I'm in wonderland.

I'm in wonderland with you and it feels so nice
You made all my dreams come true, feels like paradise.

I'm in wonderland.

I'm in wonderland with you and it feels so nice
You made all my dreams come true.---Lyrics submitted by Hector Hugo Rivera.
