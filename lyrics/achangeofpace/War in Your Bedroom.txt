It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate

The back is dropping off with the heartbeats
Sweat from me
I watch your nails scraping down the back
Of my neck
I've got a burning in my chest, it's calling
For your thighs
Oh, this is me and you, you and me
For the first time

I've been waiting, you've been dreaming
Of everything I'm talking about

It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate

It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate

I've got a picture perfect memory
Under covers
I'll say exactly what you wanna hear
I'll make you scream
There's not a drop of your innocence
When you shiver
Don't go, love, stay all night
Now you're mine

I've been waiting, you've been dreaming
Of everything I'm talking about

It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate

It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate

Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
It's you and me, it's you to me
Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
It's you and me, it's you to me
Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
It's you and me, it's you to me

It's a war in your bedroom
It's a war in your bedroom

It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate

It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darlin'
I've got no time to hesitate---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
