i won't buy a word you sold me
i'm going places you never dreamed about
so tired of stupid stories
i'll write a song the world can sing aloud

we'll break the mold they gave us
we're going places they never dreamed about
jump in and join the chorus
we're writing songs the world can shout out loud

lend me your voice 
sing it
oh ohoh
louder i can't hear it 
ohohoh X2

i'm looking back on all those long days
when i was just a kid without a care
you ask what could i have to say
i reply your listening to it here

flashbacks a force of habit
when we were just some kids without a care
the living room we used to practice 
the songs that your listening to right here

lend me your voice
sing it
ohohoh
louder i can't hear it
ohohoh X2---Lyrics submitted by jenna.
