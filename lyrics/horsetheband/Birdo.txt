Eggs
Bird

The geek with no beak
He's so weak he cannot speak
The geek with no beak
He's so weak he cannot speak

Vestigial wings
And dwarven legs
A semper fi cranium
That's got automatic eggs

His gaping maw
Is geared to spew
He just might be a she
So birdette will do

Go eat your eggs
Force fed, force fed
Go eat your eggs
Out of his mouth
Straight at your head

With purple pants
They start to tear
I reach out with all my might to
Poke out an eye
I poke out an eye
I poke out an eye

My seven year old smile
Vanishing
Eggs
Why eggs?
It's breaking my heart
It's hurting my nose
It's turning my skin green
Why did you have to be so mean?

In my dreams I despise you
More than you'll ever know
Even when I speak your name
It makes me fucking choke

Bird
Bird

Throw it back
Throw it back
Throw it back
Throw it back

Throw it back
Throw it back
Throw it back
Throw it back---Lyrics submitted by Markn Cj Lefler.
