I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I cant deny, I really miss him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you dont know what you got til its gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
Im saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasnt my everything till we were nothing
And its taking me a lot to say
But now that hes gone, my heart is missing something
So its time I push my pride away

Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
Cause you are, you are
You are my everything

I know youre not far but I still cant handle all the distance
Youre travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
Cause its too much to bare
Without you and I know sorry aint the cure
So if I cross your mind just know Im yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

He wasnt my everything till we were nothing
And its taking me a lot to say
But now that hes gone, my heart is missing something
So its time I push my pride away

Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
Cause you are, you are
You are my everything ---
