You don't need little money
Honey you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your loving
To get the blood rushing through my veins
I wanna say we're going steady
Like it's 1954, no, it doesn't have to be forever
Just as long as I'm the name on your

Tattooed Heart....(tattooed heart)

You don't need to worry about making me crazy
Cause I'm way past that
And so just call me, if you want me
Cause you got me, and I'll show you how much I want to be
On your Tattooed Heart

Tattooed Heart, tattooed heart

Just as long as I'm the name on your Tattooed Heart

Help me if you're joking my baby
And lay me your name
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darling let me trace the lines on your Tattooed Heart

Just as long as I'm the name on your Tattooed Heart---Lyrics submitted by bridget guzman.
