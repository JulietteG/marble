Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama boy its overkill
Dont get mad at me cuz youve been replaced, know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe itd be different
If you spoke up wouldve listened
But now Im with somebody else
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your pain, wondering 
Where this thing could go, but

You will never know
What we could have been
If you wouldve shown
Your way back then
Boy you gotta (yep, yep)
Boy you shoulda (yep, yep)
Cuz you didnt know, so
Now youll never know
Youll never know

Now its probably hard for you to hear
But theres nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands
Boy, but you dont understand
Is a girl like me dont have no time to waste around

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe itd be different
If you spoke up wouldve listened
But now Im with somebody else
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your pain, wondering 
Where this thing could go, but

You will never know
What we could have been
If you wouldve shown (If you wouldve shown)
Your way back then
Boy you gotta (yep, yep)
Boy you shoulda (yep, yep)
Cuz you didnt know, so
Now youll never know
Youll never know

Youll never know 
Boy you shouldve told me, told me
Youll never know
Boy you shouldve let me know
Youll never know
Boy you couldve been there for me
But now youll never know
Youll never know

Its not my fault
Youre a little bit too late
Youre the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times, but
None of that will change my mind boy
You had a chance youll never get back (get back)

You will never know
What we could have been
If you wouldve shown (If you wouldve shown)
Your way back then (way back then baby)
Boy you gotta (yep, yep)
Boy you shoulda (yep, yep)
Cuz you didnt know, so
Now youll never know
Oh baby

Youll never know
Boy you couldve told me told me
Youll never know
Boy you couldve let me know
Youll never know
Boy you couldve been there for me

Boy youll never know
Youll never know---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
