I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you
Not just on Christmas

Wanna show you in so many ways
365 days
I'll give you all my presents, boy, I'm for you
Not just on Christmas

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice
I'm by your side

I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you
Not just on Christmas

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice
I'm by your side---
