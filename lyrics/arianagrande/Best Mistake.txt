(feat. Big Sean)

As soon as we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe Im the sinner, and not a saint
Gotta stop pretending what we aint
Why we pointing fingers anyway? Were all the same

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like were blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know Ill be savin my love for you, for you

Cause youre the best mistake Ive ever made
But we hold on, hold on
Theres no pot of god at the rainbow, sweet Jesus
But were holding on, hold on

I guess times wasting, tick tocking lip locking
How do we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock them
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold on, hold love, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes its hard to realize Im the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much cuase shes an older you
I wish you were happy I guess thats the one thing I should be providing
Aint no number twos we both ones and ones the oddest
Couple only human except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends its hard to say youre never going back
If Im not the one then Im the best mistake you ever had

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like were blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know Ill be savin my love for you, for you

Cause youre the best mistake Ive ever made
But we hold on, hold on
Theres no pot of god at the rainbow, sweet Jesus
But were holding on, hold on

Youre, youre, youre
(Best mistake you ever had, best mistake you ever had)
I be savin my love for you, for you
Youre, youre, youre
(Best mistake you ever had, best mistake you ever had)
I be savin my love for you, for you---
