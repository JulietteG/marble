Midnight shadows
When finding love is a battle
But daylight, is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

Baby don't you know
All them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby don't you know
That all them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
We decided

We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

Babe we're in slow motion
Cant seem to get where we're going
But the high times are golden
Cause they all lead to better days

We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

Baby don't you know
All them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
