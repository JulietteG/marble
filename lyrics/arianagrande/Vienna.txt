Slow down, you crazy child.
You're so ambitious for a juvenile,
But then you feel so smart.
Then tell me why are you still so afraid?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out.
You got so much to do and only so many hours in a day.

But you know that when the truth is told,
That you can get what you want, or you can just get old.
You're gonna kick out before you even get halfway through.
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you're doing fine.
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time.
Although it's so romantic on the borderlines tonight, tonight.
Too bad, but it's a life you lead.
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need.
Though you can see when you're wrong,
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're right.
You got your passion, you got your pride,
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine that they'll all come true.
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone out the hook and disappear for a while.
It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two.
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

You know that when the truth is told,
That you can get what you want, or you can just get old.
You're gonna kick out before you even get halfway through.
Why don't you realize Vienna waits for you?
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
