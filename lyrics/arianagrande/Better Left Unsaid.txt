I told you once get out my life
I don't need ya, ill be alright
But some things are better left unsaid

So tell the truth, and hit me hard
My broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said....

Ohhhhh
I'm gonna say please, make sure that they kiss me
Ohhhhh
Tonight there gonna lose some rings
Don't play me just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me
Ohhhhh
I'll never say please, don't play me just kiss me

You tell a lie, plan tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said...

Ohhhhh
I'm gonna say please, make sure that they kiss me
Ohhhhh
Tonight there gonna lose some rings
Don't play me just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me
Ohhhhh
I'll never say please, don't play me just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me
Ohhhhh
Tonight I'll say please, don't play me just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up

You tell a lie, plan tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons that some things are better left unsaid---
