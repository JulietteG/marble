I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard, it's not hard,
It's not hard, it's not hard it's not hard
And I could sing about cupid and a shooting arrow
In the end, you found out that my heart was better
Real hard, it's not hard
It's so hard, so hard, real hard, it's that hard

But I rather make a song they can play on the radio
That it makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I rather make a song they can play on the radio
Makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

I could write a song by my new piano

And how it although it face my way
If I got my piano, then I'm gon be okay
