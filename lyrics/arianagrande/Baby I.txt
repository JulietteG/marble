Baby I got love for thee so deep inside of me I dont know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words cant even touch whats in my heart

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words dont ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I cant explain what Im feeling
And I say baby baby (ohohoh), baby 

(Baby I) Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) Ooh baby, baby I
All Im tryna say is youre my everything baby
But every time I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
(baby, baby ohohoh)

Baby Im so down for you no matter what you
(Real talk) Ill be around
See baby I been feelin you
Before I knew what feelings were about

When I try to explain it I be sounding little crazy
The words dont ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I cant explain what (Im feeling)
And I say baby baby (ohohoh) , baby 

(Baby I) Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) Ooh baby, baby I
All Im tryna say is youre my everything (baby)
But every time I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
(baby, baby ohohoh)

Straight up you got me all in
How could I not be I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If its even possible
I love you more
Than word love can say it (say it)
Its better not explaining that why I keep saying
Baby I

Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)
Ooh baby, baby I
All I'm tryna say is you my everything baby 
But every time I try to say it 
Words they only complicate it 
(baby, baby ohohoh, baby I)

Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)
Ooh baby, baby I
All I'm tryna say is you my everything baby
But every time I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
But every time I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
But every time I try to say it
Words they only complicate it 
Baby baby ohohoh, baby baby---Lyrics submitted by Ana Luiza.
