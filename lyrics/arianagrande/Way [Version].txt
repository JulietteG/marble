(feat. Mac Miller)

What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top.

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Say, Im thinking bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
[One version:] I aint a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)
[Another version:] I aint a player (I just play her, I just play her)

You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I cant stay away

If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, Ill never leave you
And I aint going nowhere 'cause youre a keeper

So dont you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it hey
You got my heart, dont know how you did it hey
And I dont care who sees it babe
I dont wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it)
The way you love me

Oh, it's so crazy you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it aint a question (q-question)
'Cause boy I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, youll find it all in me
Stay by your side, Ill never leave you
And I aint going nowhere 'cause youre a keeper

So dont you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, dont know how you did it
And I dont care who sees it babe
I dont wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it)
The way I love you

Uh, I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
Youre a princess to the public, but a freak when its time
Said your bed be feeling lonely,
So youre sleeping in mine.
Come here, watch a movie with me,
American Beauty or Bruce Almighty that's groovy,
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you,
Im not gonna get bored of
But baby youre an adventure
[One version:] So please let me come explore you
[Another version:] So let me come and explore you

So dont you worry, baby you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, dont know how you did it
And I dont care who sees it babe
I dont wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
Uh, I love the way (I love it)

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
Uh, I love the way (I love it)
The way I love you

The way I love you
The way I love you, you, you, yeah oh oh hey

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it
The way I love you.---Lyrics submitted by Arianna waters.
