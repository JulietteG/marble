Baby don't ya know you got all of my (all of my)
Baby don't ya know you got all of my (all of my)

Hold up, wait, before you go just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby won't ya loosen up just a little
See what you don't understand
Is loving in love wasn't part of my plans
Started with a crush
Can I call you my man
Thought that I'd never fall in love
Never fall in love again

Cause you give me chills everytime we chill I spend all of my days
Doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' ya
Nothin' but lovin' ya baby
(boy you got all my time)
Lovin' ya, Lovin' ya
Lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(Boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' ya, lovin' ya
Lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(boy you got all my, all my)

Hold up, wait, shut up and kiss me baby
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go
So what you don't understand is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush
Can I call you my man?
Thought that I'd never fall in love
Never fall in love again

Cause you give me chills everytime we chill
I spend all of my days
Doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' ya,
Nothin' but lovin' ya baby (boy you got all my time)
Lovin' ya, lovin' ya
Lovin' it, lovin' it baby (boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' ya, lovin' ya
Lovin' it, lovin' it baby
(boy you got all my, all my)

Saver my trust
Don't mess this up
(You got me fallin' in love, you got me fallin' love, you got me fallin' so hard)
boy you change the way I breathe
when you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you, that boy, you're all I need
Oh baby

Nothin' but lovin' ya,
Nothin' but lovin ya baby
(boy you got all my time)
Lovin' ya, lovin' ya
Lovin' it, lovin' it baby (boy you got all my, all my)
Love and affection
All my attention
You don't gotta question
If I'm really
Lovin' ya, lovin' ya
Lovin' it, lovin' it baby

Baby don't ya know you got all of my (all of my)
Baby don't ya know you got all of my (all of my) ---
