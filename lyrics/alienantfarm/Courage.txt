you should try not to be so courageous

Contrary to the matter 
Who you are, you are not 
Come with me, I'll show you Saturn 
Planets don't quite align 

You should try not to be so courageous 
You should try not to be so courageous 

I never said you were a mistake at all 
You got it all wrong, you're misunderstanding 
I never said you were a mistake at all 
You got it all wrong, you're misunderstanding 

Traveled far, for this lover 
Who she was she was not 
But honestly it don't matter 
Aliens ain't Farmers 

You should try not to be so courageous 
You should try not to be so courageous 

I never said you were a mistake at all 
You got it all wrong, you're misunderstanding 
I never said you were a mistake at all 
You got it all wrong, you're misunderstanding 

i never said you were, i never said you were
you've got i all wrong, you've got it all wrong
i never said you were, i never said you were
you've got i all wrong, you've got it all wrong

You should try not to be so courageous 
remind me
These dismal moods have become contagious 
remind me

you should try not to be so courageous
you should try not to be so  courageous

I never said you were a mistake at all 
You got it all wrong, you're misunderstanding 
I never said you were a mistake at all 
You got it all wrong, you're misunderstanding 

i never said you were, i never said you were
you've got i all wrong, you've got it all wrong
i never said you were, i never said you were
you've got i all wrong, you've got it all wrong---Lyrics submitted by scott.
