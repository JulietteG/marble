On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
They were sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And a sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert,  you can't remember your name
Cause there ain't nobody for to give you no pain
La,  la

After two days,  in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days,   in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And a story it told about a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert,  you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La,  La

After nine days,  I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the sea, lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert,  you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La,  la
