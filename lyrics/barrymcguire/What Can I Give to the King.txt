CHORUS:
What can I give to the King
Give to the One who has everything
What can I give, what gift can I bring
What can I give to the King;
What can I give to the King?

VERSE 1
Give Him a heart that is opened up wide,
Give Him a life thats got nothing to hide;
Give Him a love that is tender and true
And, Hell give it all back to you,
Yes, Hell give it all back to you.

(CHORUS)

VERSE 2
Give Him all glory, His people on Earth
Give Him all praises this day of His birth
Give Him all honor in all that we do,
As Hes given His life to you,
As Hes given His life to you.---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
