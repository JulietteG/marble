When I think of all the things that words can never say,
Of all the love and all the joy I'd love to bring your way,
How can you know?
Love, love, love, love, love!

I shall proclaim His righteousness to all who hear my voice
And when the King has come we'll know it's time to shout and rejoice!
Then we shall know
Love, love, love, love, love!

Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

I'd like to share with you the things of love I've learned this day,
And if you sing His song He'll lead you for He is the Way!
Then you will know
Love, love, love, love, love!

Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
