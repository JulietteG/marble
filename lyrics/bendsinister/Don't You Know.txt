Don't you know, I've got a secret for you.
But if I tell you what it is you have to promise me you won't tell a soul.
Which just between you and I.
'Cause girl if it gets dark, I have no doubt that things are gonna get a little crazy around here.
When I don't wonder on our minds

Well can't you see, what you do to me?
Oh, can't you tell that you've got me under your spell.
May I confide, 'cause I just can't hide.
I wanna stop pretending that I'm ain't in love with you.

Don't you know, it's been too long.
That I've been cold there's ice and I'm not nice as I really am, that I really should have been to you.
I play the fool when I thought I was acting cool.

Well can't you see, what you do to me?
Oh, can't you tell that you've got me under your spell.
May I confide, 'cause I just can't hide.
I wanna stop pretending that I'm ain't in love with you.

I wanna stop pretending that I'm ain't in love with you.

*Guitar Solo*

Well can't you see, what you do to me?
Oh, can't you tell that you've got me under your spell.
May I confide, 'cause I just can't hide.
I wanna stop pretending that I'm ain't in love with you.

I wanna stop pretending that I'm ain't in love with you.

I wanna stop pretending that I'm ain't in love with you.---Lyrics submitted by Karen Kanemaru.
