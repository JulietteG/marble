Another sleepless night
She's looking up and crying out
He's just a little child
Can you stop his hurting now
It's so quiet 
But she hears in the silence
His arms are holding you
His love will see you through 
When you smile laugh but you're fakin' 
Cause you don't know how you're gonna make it
You feel so much pain 
And you can't see your way
You're not alone
You're not alone
She's Tryna' plan ahead 
Unsure about the time left
Can't let these moments pass
Instead she'll treasure what she has
And when it's quiet 
But she hears in the silence 
His arms are holding you 
His love will see ou through 
When you smile and you laugh but you're  fakin'
Cause you don't know how you're gonna make it
You feel so much pain 
And you can't see you're way
You're not alone 
You're not alone
Alone 
His arms are holding you 
His love will see you through 
When you try not to cry but to take it 
All the Stress, and the hurt and heartache
You may feel pain
But not as great as his name 
You're not alone 
No you're not alone---Lyrics submitted by Paula Robinson.
