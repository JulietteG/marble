Turn down the lights
Baby come close
I wanna talk to you
Oh Lover come here
In the heat of the heat
Passion can burn just as brightly
As the fireside
Or hot candle wax
Or the summer sunshine on your back

I had my eyes wide open from the start
I knew you'd be the only lover here in my heart
But something told me do what you feel
It's got to be real
I know that I was gonna love you, baby
But I never thought that it would be so rich
Love was deep as any ocean
And it just turns on and on

[Chorus:]
Baby, I'm on fire (fire)
Burning for you
I'm on fire (fire)
Ye-earning for you
Deep inside your fire
Where flames turn blue
I'm burning hot for you baby

Ah, soft music plays
And angels don't lie
And if love is truly blind
Then lover be kind
In my dreams I have dared to take you where no one else has gone
To bed and firesides and concerts by the sea
To a place where rivers rush inside of you and me
Oh wee baby just you and me, yes

I had my eyes wide open right from the start
I know you'd be the only lover here in my heart
But something told me do what you feel
This love is real
And I knew that I was gonna love you, baby, baby, baby
But I never thought that it could be
I never thought that love could be so rich
Deep as any ocean, and it just turns on and on

[Chorus]

You got me burning, yearning
And I'm on fire by desire
You got me burning up
Don't you stop
I'm burning in your flame, say my name

I'm burning up hot
Baby I don't wanna stop
Give me every single drop
Give me all you got.
[2x]

[Chorus]
