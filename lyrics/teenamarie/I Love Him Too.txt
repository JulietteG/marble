[Tee:]
Aw naw, I don't believe this
There's a new girl in town
Is your name De De O'Neal?

[De De:]
Yeah, that's me.
They call me Cognac

[Tee:]
You know you've got a lot of nerve comin' up in here in my party

[De De:]
Oh, no disrespect Miss Teena
Evidently, you've got something to say to me
So say it, girl
Bring it!

What makes you think:
That I'm peace enough to stand by
And let you take my man from me
And what makes you so sure that he's in love with you?
Cause anytime he wants to, get love
He's making love to me
You feelin' me?

[Tee:]
You're just a young girl
With stars in your eyes
I don't think you even understand it, De De
Or that you realize
I give him all my precious time
And maybe I've been a bit too blind
But for last 7 years or so, you see
He's been making love to me
Do you understand me?

I love him too
Just as much:if not maybe more than you do
Don't be no fool

[De De:]
I love him too
And if you think I'm going to give him up

[Tee/De De:] Then you're a fool

[De De:] You better think about the consequences

[Tee:] You better think about the mind and common senses

[De De:] You better think about the things that I can bare

[Tee:] You better think about my child that's on the way

[De De:] You better think about the lovin' game, I'm not here to play

[Tee:] You better think of right now you're in my domain

[Tee/De De:] You better think

[Tee:] You better think and stop believing in all the trust cause

[Tee/De De:] he's been making love to us

[Tee:] What a revelation

[De De:] And I love him too

[Tee/De De:] Just as much

[Tee:] If not maybe more than you do

[De De:] Don't be no fool

[Tee:] I love him too

[Tee/De De:] And if you think I'm going to give him up

[Tee:]
You've lost a screw
Don't be no fool

[Tee:]
Listen, you'd better think again, girl
You'd better think again
Cause I love my baby, love my baby

[De De:]
You'd better think again, sister girl
You'd better think again
Cause I love that man---Lyrics submitted by Darlene.
