Once I was alone
Far away from home
Living in a world I didn't know
Caught up in a dream
I was lost it seemed
'Till he took my hand and said "let's go"...

To a land, where I learned to be strong
To a place, where I learned the right from wrong
The contentment in your world is hard to find
Try to realise it all lies in your mind

It doesn't really matter where you go
'Cause happiness is something in your soul
Other grass is never really green
It's only 'cause you haven't really seen
All your life you're living in a dream

Left me on my own
Far away from home
I have life and I have love in dreams
So if you lose your way
Hung on what to say
Try to live your life just for today

If you give, then your strength with forth you keep
As your soul, then my friends so shall yea reap
If contentment in your world is hard to find
Try to realise it all is in your mind [repeat twice]

It doesn't really matter where you go
'Cause happiness is something in your soul
Other grass is never really green
It's only 'cause you haven't really seen

It doesn't really matter where you go
'Cause happiness is something in your soul
Other grass is never really green
It's only 'cause you haven't really seen
Only 'cause you haven't really seen [repeat]
Happiness is something in your soul
Doesn't really matter where you go (no, no)
Doesn't really matter where you go
Happiness is something in your soul (soul)

Doesn't really matter where you go
Happiness is something in your soul (soul)
Soul, soul, soul, soul
Oh

Try to realise it all is in your mind [repeat twice]
Happiness is something in your soul 
Doesn't really matter where you go---Lyrics submitted by Clare Temple.
