I'm lost in the light
I pray for the night
to take me, to take me to
After so many words
Still nothing's heard
Don't know what we should do
So if someone could see me now
let them see you

It was my greatest thrill
when we just stood still
You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill
Even counting sheep
don't help me sleep
I just toss and turn right there beside you
So if someone could help me now
they'd help you too

They'd help you to see you through
All the hard things we've all gotta do
Cause this life is long and so you wouldn't be wrong
Being free leaving me on my own

And I held my own
Still I rattled your bones
I said some awful things and I take them back
If we would try again
and just remember when
Before we were lovers I swear we were friends
Si if someone could see me now
let them see you

Let them see you, see you through
All the hard things we've all gotta do
Cause this life is long
so you wouldn't be wrong
Being free leaving me on my own---Lyrics submitted by Al My.
