Yo, Lemme take you back to 2003,
Before I ever got signed, before the bullshit,
Yo,

Im sick of being 19 going on 20,
living at my mums house rent free and still finding my pockets empty,
Sick of not being the type of guy who drives a Bentley,
Who says more is enough when he's already got plenty,
Im broke as a joke,
Cant even afford to buy myself a box of cigarettes so I can have one smoke,
Fuck it, Im so poor I cant even afford proper shaving foam and have to make
do with water and soap,
Im walking a tight rope, 
Keep on Spending money like its not an object when it is,
Cos when I got I aint a tight bloke,
Feel Like one of these days I might choke,
Im loosing sight of hope, 
Heading backwards on the tracks of the right road,
Like global warming its already started happening, 
Slowly but surley my hearts already started blackening,
Im taking desperate measures to prevent something snappin in my head,
Make me not care if im alive or dead,
So the search goes on for something fireproof to line my pockets with,
Stop money burning holes in em when im profiting,
That only happens when im blotting shit, 
And lately I aint got shit to blot so iv had to start shottin shit,
Shit I dont even wanna shot, shit iv even started shottin shit i aint even got,
Takin money of mans in advance for gear thats hot before iv even stole it
from the shop,
I cant get no peace, cos the streets dont sleep,
Cos theres too many police, on every fucking corner, on every street,
All they wanna do is cause me grief, Believe

CHORUS
Dont know what the hell im doing,
All this time that iv been wasting,
Like im waiting for something to happen,
But nothing seems to change,
With no money in my pocket,
All I got to show,
For myself, for myself,
Is the little that I own.

Momma said there would be days like these,
But jeese Louise,
Its been like this for fucking weeks,
Months even, going on years,
This is like extreme survival with Ray Mears,
Cept the jungle that im living in is one made out of concrete,
Life size game of Monopoly and im broke on Bond street,
Dice is still roling but its time to say ?bunwheat?,
Cos me and money just aint singing from the same song sheet,
Im the bankrupt dog who wants to be the race car,
Like someone caught on camera steelin tryna play the race card,
Im fucking desperate, Im pullin the straws,
The streets have almost got me by the grips of its claws,
And just past the mist I can see the mist of its jaws,
Ready to devour me whole asoon as I hit the floor,
From the height that im fallin from,
The full blown conclusion is im gunna hit rock bottom,
Unless I find some cash real quick.

Dont know what the hell im doing,
All this time that iv been wasting,
Like im waiting for something to happen,
But nothing seems to change,
With no money in my pocket,
All I got to show,
For myself, for myself,
Is the little that I own.

The only time I get paid is a giro cheque,
The only time I spend money is when I pay off debts,
Got one pair of clothes, I got one pair of creps,
I got a mobile phone but I never got credit,
Its the same old story the same old shit,
Aint got a love life cos I could never love a bitch,
Cant afford a real woman cos I aint rich,
And at the end of the day blud, I aint shit,
But thats the way it goes, When your young, gifted and broke,
Aint got a penny in your pocket, let alone a note,
All the talent in the world, but no direction to go,
Aint got no motivation, Aint got nothin to show,
Nothin to show for yourself and its affecting your health, 
Reality checks essential when your dreamin of wealth,
Cos cost of livin in the city dont pay for themself,
An neither does minimum wage so fuck stackin them shelfs!  

Dont know what the hell im doing,
All this time that iv been wasting,
Like im waiting for something to happen,
But nothing seems to change,
With no money in my pocket,
All I got to show,
For myself, for myself,
Is the little that I own.---Lyrics submitted by matthev.
