One day youll learn
When you get hurt,
By then it will be too late for ya,

Be too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns, dont you know?

verse 1 :
Hes just a kid of the estate
We call him little Jake
Today he tried to buy weed with his little mate
Up in the bits, but hes just a kid
So he was open to manipulation
He had to undergo initiation
And when some older boys saw the situation
They took the piss, now look at this
A little yoot beating up his only friend
The only one that werent pretend
And even gave me the money for the peng
From mice to men, and then to rats
But only a snake behaves like that
but the gang dont care who falls through the gaps
They just happy they could fall for the trap

Chorus:
Playing with fire, it doesnt burn
First time, your hand,
Walk through the pain
Playing with fire, its too extreme
Oh-oh-oh
Scare tin, skin now
Hell on its way
Playing with fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Go playing with fire
One day youll learn
When yo get burned
By then itll be too late for ya
Too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns
Dont you know
Playing with fire

verse 2:
Hes just a kid, but he feels like a man today
He joined a gang today
Been at a house party, you ran away
Doing illegal shit, but hes just a kid
Still hes in luck today
He got a fuck today
Yeah he bust his very first nut today
In some stupid bitch
Todays moving quick
So quick, if you wear the wrong shoes
Youll slip,
Better keep up with the tempo, with a click
Cause what they on is messed up rough
And now that hes rolling with these vexed up thugs
Whats next up bruv
Cause hes gonna it his only mission
To better his position, in this little gang its a competition
To a little man with a disposition
Holier than thou he was born a Christian
What he worships now is the night they listen
Wise men will tell you with age comes wisdom
And you cant be saved by religion unless you have faith
So it makes no difference the yoots who are raised in the system
You dont have age on your side
Or any positive role models in their lives that provide insight
So he aint gonna listen
As for Jake, hes already made his decision
And now hes just another poster boy
For David Camerons Broken Britain

chorus:
Playing with fire, it doesnt burn
First time, your hand,
Walk through the pain
Playing with fire, its too extreme
Oh-oh-oh
Scare tin, skin now
Hell on its way
Playing with fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Go laying with fire
One day youll learn
When yo get burned
By then itll be too late for ya
Too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns
Dont you know
Playing with fire---Lyrics submitted by Rhyanna John.
