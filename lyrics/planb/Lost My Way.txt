Lost my way,
Fell down a hole,
No-ones gonna come,
And save my soul,
Lost my way,
No going back,
I'm stuck right here, and that is that!
Lost my way,
Fell down a hole,
No-ones gonna come,
And save my soul,
Lost my way,
No going back,
I'm stuck right here, and that is that!

Look around this manor and all you will see,
Its ill manor people with there manors in there ill
It's the manor person you've ever met in your manor
Or whatever your likely to meet in any manor cos this manors deep

You judge them on the life that they live
But then its not all as black and white as it seems,
There all some way enslaved in there circumstances.

Shape the way the behave on there battle on the street
That's why these kids ain't got no hope,
Walking round there estates thinking this is it,
They ain't ever getting out and it's no joke
Probably is the best of live there ever gonna get.

They don't believe they can succeed
Or the opportunities you send back there really exist
Cos they've been told from every day from the minute
they were born by there fucked up parents that they ain't shit.

Mum and dad never made anything of them selves
Na, so why the hell are they gonna?
Schools a waste of time, there only gonna fail

There older brother went jail, why ain't they gonna?
I mean the hang with thugs, they sell drugs
Ain't afraid to put a couple slugs in you if you say something
They ain't all that way but you don't care either way

To you There all just the same a bunch of thugs,
You used rap everyday,
Looking for the devils pain
The young souls dad went to jail
Listen when you here them say

Lost my way,
Fell down a hole,
No-ones gonna come,
And save my soul,
Lost my way,
No going back,
I'm stuck right here, and that is that!

God said let there be light created Adam and Eve
Then he gave them eyes and told them both to both belive
Something they'd actually physically see
And then the devil came along and planted a seed

And down started growing from the ground like trees
Right up to the sky so profoundly seen
To be the only thing in this life that wasn't a dream
Made from stone still and iron beams
The council blocks to defining mean

And bullied the sky so that everybody can see
Some birds are caged and will never be free
And gradually people began to change there beliefs
Until god was nothing more than just a fictional being

The worship and money merged all colours and creed
Into one true religion that was driven by greed
Corporate machines trying to sell you shit you don't need
On television and the ad breaks in between

Until people only cared about material things
Not lives with other fellow human beings
And I'm guilty of it to or so it seems

Lost my way,
Fell down a hole,
No-ones gonna come,
And save my soul,
Lost my way,
No going back,
I'm stuck right here and that is that!

If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
And if that happens then you've lost your way
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
And if that happens then you've lost your way

If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything

If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything
