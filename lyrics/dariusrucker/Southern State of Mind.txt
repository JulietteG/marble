I was up in New York City
Just the other week
You should have seen the waitress' face
When I ordered sweet tea
She said, we don't have that here
And I apologized
I said, please forgive me
I'm in a Southern State of Mind

And those girls out in California
They don't understand
They don't like it when I hold the door
Or when I say, yes ma'am
They act like I've done something wrong
And they give me the evil eye
I say, honey, I'm sorry
I'm in a Southern State of Mind

I could be anywhere, in my heart I'm always there
Where they drink sweet team and they raise you to be polite
No changin' who I am
That's the way I've always been
No matter what state I'm in
I'm in a Southern State of Mind

I'm always walkin' around tellin' everybody hi
Just wavin' at the strangers in the cars passin' by
Some people may look at me and say
That boy just ain't right
Hey ya'll, I ain't crazy
I'm in a Southern State of Mind

I could be anywhere, in my heart I'm always there
Where you know everybody
If you don't, than you're still polite
No changin' who I am
That's the way I've always been
No matter what state I'm in
I'm in a Southern State of Mind

You see it in  the clothes I wear
You can hear it when I talk
Ball cap, boots and jeans
And a little Southern drawl
I could be up in Ohio
Or back home in Caroline
No matter what state I'm in 
I'm in a Southern State of mind

Don't matter what state I'm in
I'm in a Southern State of Mind

Yeahhhh....

Alright....

Southern State of Mind
Come on, Come on
Ohhh....---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
