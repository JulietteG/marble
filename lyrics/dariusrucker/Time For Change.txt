I heard some kids telling me
How they've lost all the faith, in the way
They've been talking world peace
And the wars in the streets

The lines on their faces so deep, yeah
A revolution, or reach out
And touch the day
We're overdue, child

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

I feel the the future
In the hands of our youth
No more lies
Old, tired fools tell our future
With tarot cards, and lie of crime 
The lines on their faces so deep, yeah
A revolution, or reach out
And touch the day
We're overdue, child

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

I'll change
I'll change
Not tomorrow, but today

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change---
