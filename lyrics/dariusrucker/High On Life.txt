It's been five days since I shaved, I swear
My hair's gettin' long but I don't care
Lawn chair sitting, ain't going nowhere
A big old smile on my face
Pointin' out pictures in a cloudy sky
Craving me a piece of that pecan pie
Might lay in the grass and kill some time
Looking like I'm in a daze
But it ain't no purple haze

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life

Gettin' buzzed by this bumble bee flying around
My day in the sun is my night on the town
Just me waking up is me getting down
Spinning like a tilt-a-whirl
Sitting on top of the world

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life

I ain't saying that stuff is bad
But it's so low compared to the highs I have
Counting my blessings, kicking back
Sipping on sweet tea in a glass
And watching my baby laugh
Don't get much better than that

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life

I'm finally believing what I'm seeing
That's why
I'm high on life
Oh, high on life---
