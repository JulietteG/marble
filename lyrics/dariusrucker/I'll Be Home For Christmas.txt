I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back, I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Oh please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Oh Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
