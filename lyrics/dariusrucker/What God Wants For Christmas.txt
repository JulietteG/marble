Old man playing Santa Claus
Blue in a town with old Jack Frost
Now he's handing out candy canes and smiles for free
People scoring with their lists
Rushing around to buy those gifts that will
End up wrapped up underneath the tree
I'm sitting at this red light looking at a manger scene
Watching snowflakes kiss that baby
And it makes me think

I wonder what God wants for Christmas
Something that you can't find in a store
Maybe peace on Earth, no more empty seats in church
Might be what's on His wishlist
I wonder what God wants for Christmas

What do you give someone
Who give His only Son
What if we believe in Him
Like He belives in us

I wonder what God wants for Christmas
What might put a smile on His face
Every bubble with no dust, the devil given up
Might be what's on His wishlist

I wonder what God wants for Christmas
What kind of gift from you and me
More sister, more brother, more lovin' one another
Yean I wonder, I wonder what God wants
By now we oughta know what God wants for Christmas---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
