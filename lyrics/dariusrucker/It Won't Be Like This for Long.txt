He didn't have to wake up, he'd been up all night
Lying there in bed and listening to his newborn baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee, he splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says it's gonna be okay

It won't be like this for long
One day we'll look back laughing at the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by, so baby just hold on
It won't be like this for long

Four years later 'bout 4:30, she's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at pre-school she's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him, he says, "What can I do?"
She says, "Now don't you worry, this'll only last a week or two"

It won't be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off and she won't even know you're gone
This phase is gonna fly by if you can just hold on
It won't be like this for long

Someday soon she'll be a teenager and at times he'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the aisle and raise her veil
But right now she's up and crying and the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her goodnight and she says her prayers

He lays down there beside her till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart 'cause he already knows

It won't be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is gonna be all grown up and gone
And this phase is gonna fly by, so he's trying to hold on
'Cause it won't be like this for long
It won't be like this for long---
