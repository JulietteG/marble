November (of) '43
On a boat comin'  cross the sea
He left a boy, came back a man
She started running when she saw his face
It'd been 655 days
Since she held his hand
He got down on one knee
and he pulled out that ring
That he bought in Aberdeen
And when it hit that New York sky

[Chorus:]
It shined just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
Her eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never gonna fade
It's gonna shine!

For the next 55 years
Through the laughter and the tears
My grandma always wore that band
through atom bombs and a baby boom
Dr. King and a man on the moon
No, it never left her hand
On the day she passed away
My mama put it on a chain
Now and then on special days
Mom would hang it on her neck

[Repeat Chorus]
And it would shine just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
Her eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never gonna fade
It's gonna shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine, oh

Mama said one of these days
I'd know why she gave me that ring
Sittin' here I know she was right
Oh, it's not the biggest stone you've ever seen
But girl I can promise you one thing
That for he rest of your life.

It's gonna shine just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
your eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never, never, never gonna fade
It's gonna shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Like a beacon calling me home
It's gonna shine
Oh yeah, shine, shine, shine
