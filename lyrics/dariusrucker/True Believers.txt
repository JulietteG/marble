Church bells ringing on our wedding day
Climbed in that limo and rode away
Guess you will always hear people say,
Man, they're never gonna make it.

We settled in and we settled down
In this quiet little seaside town
You are the rock I built my world around
And life will never break it

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
and We are two, True Believers

It wasn't easy getting here today
sometimes we stumbled on lost highways
But every roadblock was a chance to say;
take my hand I'm here beside you.

We worked that day through the toughest part
Now every day is another chance to start
Look around and see where we are
It's where we were trying to get to

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
and We are two, True Believers

We are one before our God in Heaven
We are one when the going gets rough
We are one now and forever
We are one name, one life, one faith

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
and We are two, True Believers
We are two, True Believers---Lyrics submitted by john albert doe.
