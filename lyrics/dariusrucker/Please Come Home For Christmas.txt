Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me Christmas greetings once again

Choirs will be singin' "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Oh Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
Then I'll be happy, happy once again

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
This is Christmas, yes Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Oh Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
Then I'll be happy, happy once again

Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain
And I'll be happy Christmas once again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
