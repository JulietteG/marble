Baby, all these city lights
Are losing their shine
I need a little bit a get outta here
A little slow unwind
A little salt air and a sand bar
A lawn chair and a guitar
Singing sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
All night long
All night

I wanna get high
On some low country
Where the sun meets the water
And the nights get hotter
Sounds right on the money
Let's let that tide take us for a ride
Girl, wherever it wants to
I wanna get high
On some low country with you

Down there where the warm wind blows
Through the cypress trees
You take your worries like the pennies in your pocket
And you, you throw 'em in the sea
Get a sweet buzz from your long kiss
Better than any rum hitting my lips
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-la
All night long
All night

I wanna get high
On some low country
Where the sun meets the water
And the nights get hotter
Sounds right on the money
Let's let that tide take us for a ride
Girl, wherever it wants to
I wanna get high
On some low country with you

Ain't it funny how life can be crazy
Come on, let's get gone
'Cause the days are getting long and the nights are getting hazy
Come on, let's hold on

I wanna get high
On some low country
Where the sun meets the water
And the nights get hotter
Sounds right on the money
Let's let that tide take us for a ride
Girl, wherever it wants to
I wanna get high
On some low country with you

Low country with you, oh, yeah
Low country with you
My low country with you---
