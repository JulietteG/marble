I ain't ever been accused of recusing myself from a Friday night
Don't need no excuse to go out and cut loose beneath the neon light
Ain't got to twist my arm to get me off the farm
Just give me the word, I bet I beat you to the bar

I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people
If you're down with painting the town, I'll be around all night
You know I'm always good for a good time

I'm a pretty good guy in my nine to five, always walking the line
I'll lend a helping hand to a stranger or a friend if they need mine
You can count on me buddy, I'm free
If you've got a bead on a party in need

I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people
If you're down with painting the town, I'll be around all night
You know I'm always good for a good time

When it comes to a good time, you know what they say
It's never too early, it's never too late---
