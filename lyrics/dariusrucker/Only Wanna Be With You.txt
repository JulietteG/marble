You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me
When I look at other girls

Sometimes youre crazy
And you wonder why
Im such a baby
'Cause the dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You got nothing left to say
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way
I wont dance, you wont sing
I just wanna love you
But you wanna wear my ring

Chorus:
Well theres nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me a fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I cant help it if Im lucky

I only wanna be with you
Aint Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

(Solo)

Yeah Im tangled up and blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me a fool
I only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder
If it'll ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends

Sometimes youre crazy
And you wonder why
Im such a baby yeah
The dolphins make me cry

Well theres nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me a fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah Im tangled up and blue
I only wanna be with you

I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you---
