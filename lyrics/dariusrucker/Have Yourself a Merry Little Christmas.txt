Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
They gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Through the years we all will be together and
If the fates allow, oh
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
Oh and have yourself a merry little Christmas now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
