You didn't see me walkin' in
You were lookin' in the mirror and
You looked perfect
Hadn't put on your makeup yet
You were sayin', how your hair's a mess
But you looked perfect

No, you don't see what I see when I look at you girl
You don't know how beautiful you are
You're never ready and you need more time
You say your jeans never fit you right
But your eyes and your shy little smile and your own kinda style
It's so perfect, perfect

I hear you singin' to the radio
Sometimes you miss a couple high notes
But it sounds perfect
And when we go out and
Everywhere's too crowded
And we just end up drivin' around
It's, oh baby, it's still perfect
Just perfect

No, you don't see what I see when I look at you girl
You don't know how beautiful you are
You're never ready and you need more time
You say your jeans never fit you right
But your eyes and your shy little smile and your own kinda style
It's so perfect, perfect

Your touch and your kiss and your skin and your lips
And your name
All the little imperfections you wish you could change
Every little everything is perfect

No, you don't see what I see when I look at you girl
You don't know how beautiful you are
You're never ready and you need more time
You say your jeans never fit you right
But your eyes and your shy little smile and your own kinda style
It's so perfect, perfect---
