Under shelter of sins and secrets, wait in silence...
(Wait in silence)

Four strangers, they approach...
(Not a word, not a sound)

The faces in the hill come alive.

They won't take, "No!"

They won't take, "No!"

They won't take, "No!"

Give it to them!
Give it to them!

They won't take, "No!"
They won't take, "No!"
They won't take, "No!"

So we give it to them.

(Give it to them!)

Let your bad blood spill!

The wind moans in the trees, when I lay down on your bed and your face is of an angel.
Give my blade your wings.
Find their hearts, black as the devil's eyes.

(As the devil's eyes)

Smile back!

Go like the wind.
(Like the wind in her hair)
With your spear at their hearts.

Go like the wind.
(Like the wind in her hair)
With your spear at their hearts. (this is perfect)

This is perfect...

This is perfect...

(Perfect!)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
