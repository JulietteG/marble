All my friends are fucked and that's okay.
We wouldn't want it any other way.
Blinded youth guide blinded hands.
It was over for us before it began.

You don't know a thing about us.

But keep thinking you do.
Not a goddamn thing to prove,
cause we're losers and we're lost.
Selling our souls at a worthless cost.

Wore out eyes and wore out thoughts.
Black shows, black shirt, black heart.
Wore out eyes and wore out thoughts.
Black shows, black shirt, black heart.
Wore out eyes and wore out thoughts.
Black shows, black shirt, black heart.
Black shows, black shirt, black heart.

Just be afraid of the dark.

We rest to clear our heads.
No rest for the weary men.
Feet don't fail me now.
The best has yet to come.
We are the lonely ones.
Sleep don't fail me now.
[x2]

Feet don't fail me now.

There's more of us than you.
Now tell me who's gonna lose.
There's more of us than you.
Now tell me who's gonna lose.

We've told you once, we've told you a thousand times.
We're not going away. We refuse to die.

We're not going away. We refuse to die.
We're not going away. We refuse to die.
We're not going away. We refuse to die.
We're not going away. We refuse to die.

All my friends are fucked and it's fine.
Fuck. ---Lyrics submitted by Jamie Gilfillen.
