My hands lift to clear my face
A light shines in this empty place
I hear feet like whispers move
A cold floor in a forgotten room.
My God why am I here?
Is this really how I spent my year?
A man controlling everything he sees
Just a boy chasing his dream.

Please stay, please stay.
I can't kid, there's another place to play.
Please stay, please stay.
But I'll be back around some day.

As my sweat and the crowd does fade
A panic hits me and I start to shake
What the fuck am I still doing here?
I close my eyes to drown out fear
Open up to see that face,
The one that gave this heart its place
Gave death a break for a while
The one face that could make me smile

Please stay, please stay.
I can't my love, I have to go away.
Please stay, please stay.
But I'll be back for you some day.

Please stay, please stay.

War on the stage and in my heart
I feel my body rip apart
I'll just take it day by day
Let me hear those words you say.

Please stay, please stay.
Please stay, please stay.
Please stay, please stay.
Please stay, please stay.

Forever remain, forever the same,
You will be with me always
Forever remain, forever the same,
You will be with me always
Forever remain, forever the same,
You will be with me always
You will be with me always
You will be with me always

Always
Always
Always
Always

(Please stay) ---Lyrics submitted by Emalee Rose.
