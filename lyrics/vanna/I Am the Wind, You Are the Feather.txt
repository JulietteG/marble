This is an open ended sky, with open eyes too tired to look away.
Say you'll stand forever by my side, and forever we'll be standing here.

The dead still walk. (Walk the streets)
This means war. (On everyone)
You can't hear them. (Lying to us)
You can't see. (Their fingers crossed)

The dead still walk. (Walk the streets)
This means war. (On everyone)
You can't hear them. (Lying to us)
You can't see. (Their fingers crossed)

Let's keep our thoughts on guard this time.
We'll keep on moving on, just don't let them get too close.

Let's keep our thoughts on guard this time.
We'll keep on moving on, just don't let them get too close.

In the land where the dead still walk. (walk the streets)
This means war. (On everyone)
You can't hear them. (Lying to us)
You can't see. (Their fingers crossed)

This is a test!
We know our own strength!
We'll take the east!
(And march on)

Make our way, burning all our bridges.
State by state, we march on.

Make our way, burning all our bridges.
State by state, we march on.

And we march on,  leaving trails of hope behind us.
With our hands to the sky, the wind will be our guide.

At times like these, to be the last one standing.
Hope is all we have left.
Hope is all we have left.

At times like these, to be the last one standing.
Hope is all, hope is all we have left.

(To be the last one standing)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
