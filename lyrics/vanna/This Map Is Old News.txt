I don't love what I've done.
All these months of wear, I don't know where I was.

And now, at this anchor like an altar, I tie, and tie, and tie.

(I tie and tie)

If this never ends at least I'll stay alive.
(Know when to cut my losses)

If this never ends at least I'll stay alive.
(Learn to forgive myself)

Now press west, cover your footsteps.
Climb your hill like a mountain.

Now press west, cover your footsteps.
Climb your hill like a mountain.

You are not a wall on which I lean.
(I'm not the man you thought I was)
Is there more to this than what I see?
(I'm not the man you thought I was)

You are not a wall on which I lean.
(I'm not the man you thought I was)
Is there more to this than what I see?
(I'm not the man you thought I was)

(I've been wandering)
And for this, I ache.

I should have told you...
(I loved you back)

(I've been wondering)

(This wasn't a dream)

Set adrift, ill advised, ill equipped.

Sleep safe, thinking well.
We can only hope he makes it.
We can only hope!

(We can only hope he makes it somewhere)

And if this never ends at least I'll stay alive.
(Know when to cut my losses)

If this never ends at least I'll stay alive.
(Learn to forgive myself)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
