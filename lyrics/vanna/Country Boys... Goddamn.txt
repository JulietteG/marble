You sing just like uncaged birds, 'till the trees are ablaze.
The scribe licks his pen.
Come fly with me, rewrite our end.
(Still alive)
(Still alive)
(Still alive)

This is peace!
They will never send for us.
(They will never send for us)

These walls have taught us not to speak.
These walls have taught us not to speak.
These walls have taught us not to speak, not to feel, not to see.

Sing me to sleep, like this is home.
Sing for me, while we're alone.
(Please stay, I need you here my bird)

Dear god, call an ambulance.
(Dear god)
Dear god, call an ambulance.
(Dear god)

You sing just like uncaged birds.
(Uncaged birds!)

Still alive!
Still alive!

(Still alive)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
