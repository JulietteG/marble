They said you aint got a prayer, a chance in you-know-where, 
But I just didnt care, when I looked in your eyes. 
You were a long-shot from the start, an easy way to break my heart, 
But as perfect as you are you gotta risk it all sometimes. 

(Chorus) 

I believe in the underdog, 
Who chases dreams and breaks down walls, 
The shy kid who gets the prom queen, 
Whos never been the star of anything. 
And those two lovers hitched at city hall, 
Theyve got each other, so theyve got it all, 
Call me a dreamer, say Im a little naive, 
Oh, but I believe in the underdog. 

We bought a 4-room fixer up, on the side of town where times are tough, 
Short on cash, but long on love, yeah, we sure showed it. 
Then you gave me our little man, so small he fit inside my hands, 
Two months early, two pounds, the tallest kid in third grade now. 

Yeah, I believe in the underdog, 
Who chases dreams and breaks down walls, 
The shy kid who gets the prom queen, 
Whos never been the star of anything. 
And those two lovers hitched at city hall, 
Theyve got each other, so theyve got it all, 
Call me a dreamer, say Im a little naive, 
Oh, but I believe in the underdog. 

The banks still breathin down our necks, 
Were still living check to check, 
Girl, we dig deeper everyday, 
We still hit our knees and pray 
We pray, we pray 

(Chorus)

I believe in the underdog, 
Who chases dreams and breaks down walls, 
A guy like me could get the prom queen, 
Ive never been the star of anything. 
We were two lovers hitched at city hall, 
We still got each other, so we got it all, 
Call me a dreamer, say Im a little naive, 
Yeah you can call me a dreamer, say Im a little naive, 
Oh, but I believe in the underdog. 
Oh, in the underdog. 
I believe 
Yeah, in the underdog 
I believe 
Oh, in the underdog.---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Townley.
