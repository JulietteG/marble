Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never know what makes a man
with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away Yeah~

Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more it's gonna bring it to my knees

Gravity Ahh~ stay the hell away from me

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more it's gonna bring it to my knees

Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never know what makes a man
with all the love that his heart can stand Yeah~

I wanna be where the light is

Gravity won't you stay the hell away from me---
