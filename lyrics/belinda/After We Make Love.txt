I see the sun still shining
On the skin that I love to touch
I see the moon still lighting
Up your eyes after we make love

I see the sun still shining
On the skin that I love to touch
I see the moon still lighting
Up your eyes after we make love
Make love, make love-ve-ve-ve
Drop it now

I could love your for days, months, and years
I can hold you until my arms give out
I can show you that Im here to stay
If you can promise me that your lovin wont go away

I see the sun still shining
On the skin that I love to touch
I see the moon still lighting
Up your eyes after we make love

I see the sun still shining
On the skin that I love to touch
I see the moon still lighting
Up your eyes after we make love
Make love, make love-ve-ve-ve...drop it now

[Vein]
If theres a way to show you how
How much I love you then baby where do I sign? Yeah
Theres no more rules in this game we play
So theres no excuse on how I could lose you

When I love you now, dont stop me
When you feel arroused just watch me
Let me show you why Im cocky girl

When I love you now, dont stop me
When you feel arroused just watch me
Let me show you why Im cocky girl

Yeah...I see the sun still shining
On the skin that I love to touch
I see the moon still lighting
Up your eyes after we make love

I see the sun still shining
On the skin that I love to touch
I see the moon still lighting
Up your eyes after we make love
Make love, make love-ve-ve-ve.---Lyrics submitted by Joo Pedro.
