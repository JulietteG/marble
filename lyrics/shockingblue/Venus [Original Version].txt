A goddess on a mountain top
Was burning like a silver flame,
The summit of beauty and love,
And Venus was her name.

She's got it,
Yeah, baby, she's got it.
Well, I'm your Venus,
I'm your fire at your desire.
Well, I'm your Venus,
I'm your fire at your desire.

Her weapon were her crystal eyes
Making ev'ry man mad;
Black as a dark night she was,
Got what no one else had.
Wow!

She's got it,
Yeah, baby, she's got it.
Well, I'm your Venus,
I'm your fire at your desire.
Well, I'm your Venus,
I'm your fire at your desire.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

She's got it,
Yeah, baby, she's got it.
Well, I'm your Venus,
I'm your fire at your desire.
Well, I'm your Venus,
I'm your fire at your desire.---Lyrics submitted by Wade Manning.
