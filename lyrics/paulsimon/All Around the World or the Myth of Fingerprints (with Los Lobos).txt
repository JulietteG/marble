Over the mountain
Down in the valley
Lives a former talk-show host
Everybody knows his name
He says, Theres no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
Ive seen them all and, man,
Theyre all the same

Well, the sun gets weary
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the black pit town
Somebody says, Whats a better thing to do?
Well, its not just me
And its not just you
This is all around the world

Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere
Theres a former army post
Abandoned now just like the war
And theres no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
Thats what that old army post was for

Well, the sun gets bloody
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the black pit town
Somebody says, Whats a better thing to do?
Well, its not just me
And its not just you
This is all around the world

Over the mountain
Down in the valley
Lives a former talk-show host
And far and wide his name was known
He said, Theres no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
Thats why we must learn to live alone

Oo oo oo, live on
Live on
Live on
All around the world
All around the world---
