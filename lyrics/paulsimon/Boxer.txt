I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my existence
For a pocket full of mumbled such unpromises
All eyes have jest, still a man he hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest mmm....

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station running scared
Laying low and seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
Built in foreign places only they would know
La la lie, la la la la la la la la la la lie.....

Asking only workman's wages
I've come looking for a job 
But I get no offers
Just the come on front me whores on second avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there ah la la la la la la la

Now the years are rolling by me
Kay o'rah can you believe
Now the years are rolling by me
I am older than I once was and younger than I'll be that's not unusual

No it isn't strange after changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes, we are more or less the same
 La la lie, la la la la la la la....

Now I'm laying up my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winter's are unbleeding me
Leading me to going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains mmm...

La la lie, la la la la la la lie......---Lyrics submitted by michael.
