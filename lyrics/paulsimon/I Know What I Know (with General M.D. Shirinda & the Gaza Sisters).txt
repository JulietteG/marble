She looked me over
And I guess she thought
I was all right
All right in a sort of a limited way
For an off-night
She said, Dont I know you
From the cinematographers party?
I said, Who am I
To blow against the wind?

I know what I know
Ill sing what I said
We come and we go
Thats a thing that I keep
In the back of my head

I know what I know
Ill sing what I said
We come and we go
Thats a thing that I keep
In the back of my head

She said, Theres something about you
That really reminds me of money,
She is the kind of girl
Who could say things that
Werent that funny
I said, What does that mean
I really remind you of money?
She said, Who am I
To blow against the wind?

I know what I know
Ill sing what I said
We come and we go
Thats a thing that I keep
In the back of my head

She moved so easily
All I could think of was sunlight
I said, Arent you the woman
Who was recently given a Fulbright?
She said, Dont I know you
From the cinematographers party?
I said, Who am I
To blow against the wind?

I know what I know
Ill sing what I said
We come and we go
Thats a thing that I keep
In the back of my head

I know what I know
Ill sing what I said
We come and we go
Thats a thing that I keep
In the back of my head

I know what I know
I know what I know---
