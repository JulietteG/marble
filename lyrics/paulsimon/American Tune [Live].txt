Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused.
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused.
Ah, but I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm just weary to my bones.
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant, so far away from home, so far away from home.

And, I don't know a soul who's not been battered,
I don't have a friend who feels at ease.
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered, or driven to it's knees.
Ah, but it's alright, it's alright, for we've lived so well, so long.
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on, I wonder what's gone wrong?
I can't help but wonder, what's gone wrong.

And I dreamed I was dying.
I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly, and looking back down at me, smiled me assuredly.
And I dreamed I was flying.
And, high up above, my eyes could clearly see, the Statue of Liberty, sailing away to sea.
And I dreamed I was flying...

Oh, they come on the ship they called Mayflower,
We come on the ship that sailed the Moon.
We come in the Age's most uncertain hours, and sing an American Tune.
Whoa, oh, oh, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you can be forever blessed.
Still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day, and I'm trying to get some rest.
That's all I'm trying, to get some rest.---Lyrics submitted by Rosie.
