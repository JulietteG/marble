I just wanna run hide it away.
Run because they're chasing me down.
I just wanna run throw it away.
Run before they're finding me out.
I just wanna run.

I just wanna run.
I'm out here all alone.
I try to call your house,
can't reach you on the phone.
I'll gather up the nerve.
I'm packing up my bag,
It's more than you deserve 
don't treat me like a drag.
I'm feeling like i keep on talking i'm repeating.
Myself, my words lost all meaning.
I keep talking i repeat myself.

I just wanna run hide it away.
Run because they're chasing me down.
I just wanna run throw it away.
Run before they're finding me out.
I just wanna run.(run,run,run)
I just wanna run.(run,run,run)

Like a game of chess,
I predict your move.
I think i know you better,
better than you do.
I'm sick of feeling cheap.
Cheated and abused.
I'm sick of losing sleep,
thinking about you.
I'm feeling like i keep talking, i'm repeating.
Myself, my words lost all meaning.
I keep talking i repeat myself.

I just wanna run hide it away.
Run because they're chasing me down.
I just wanna run throw it away.
Run before they're finding me out.
I just wanna run.(run,run,run)
I just wanna run.(run,run,run)
Throw it away!

I just wanna run hide it away.
Run because they're chasing me down.
I just wanna run throw it away.
Run before they're finding me out.(out)
I just wanna run(I just wanna run)

I just wanna run hide it away.
Run because they're chasing me down.
I just wanna run throw it away.
Run before they're finding me out.
I just wanna run.I just wanna run.
(won't find me out,won't find me out)
I just wanna run.---Lyrics submitted by jasmine.
