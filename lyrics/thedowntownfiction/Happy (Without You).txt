Well I don't need you
Hanging round and throwng roses at my feet
Yeah I think that I can see through
All the ways you make me feel so incomplete

I'm always on my own
Can never be alone
But now I'm feeling good
Just like I new I should
Moving on and on and on and on

I don't mean to cut you down
Because I'm happy now
Happy now without you
I don't mean to cut you down
Because I'm happy now
Happy now without you

When I was younger
I needed someone to rely entirely
Now I'm a little older
And I'm finding out that love's no guarantee

I'll never be afraid
to leave my house again
Without your guiding hand to pull me through the sand
Holding on and on and on

I don't mean to cut you down
Because I'm happy now
Happy now without you
I don't mean to cut you down
Because I'm happy now
Happy now without you

And words don't make it right
If I'm not coming back tonight
Cause I'm happy now without you in my life
I'm doing fine
Happy now without you

I don't mean to put you down
Because I'm happy now

I don't mean to cut you down
Because I'm happy now
Happy now without you
I don't mean to cut you down
Because I'm happy now
Happy now without you

And words don't make it right
If I'm not coming back tonight
Cause I'm happy now without you in my life
I'm doing fine
Happy now without you---Lyrics submitted by SarahFioramonti.
