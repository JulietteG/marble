(Do what do what 
do what do what
Do what lovers do 

Do what do what 
do what do do 
Do what lovers do
Yeahhh!)

Do what lovers do
right from the start
say what lovers say
we'll never part
i'm so glad I've found you
I can't think of anything but you

Silent lovers sight
and hold me tight
no one /// could know
when love is right
I'm so glad I've found you
I can't think of anything but you

I walk around with pride
with a dream in my eyes
you told me today
Love is here to stay
if it's not a lie
I promise you'll be mine
until the end of time

Do what lovers do
don't break my heart
say what lovers say
we'll never part
I'm so glad I've found you
I can't think of anything but you

[instrumental part]

I walk around with pride
(with a dream in my eyes)
you told me today
(love is here to stay)
if it's not a lie
I promise you'll be mine
until the end of time

don't break my heart
say what lovers say
we'll never part
I'm so glad I've found you
I can't think of anything but you---Lyrics submitted by Svetlana.
