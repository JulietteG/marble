Turn to the table,
And tip down the frame.
Sit for a minute,
And breathe until your heart regains strength. 
She loves you, she said,
And she lives for your kiss.
Still for a moment,
She was living for his. 

And if you fall I will catch you...

The only thing more fragile then my confidence,
Where my words in these remarks.
This song's a sorry attempt to forget your face, 
And to ease this broken heart

Rise to the occasion,
Make sure your faces fit.
And dress in silhouettes, 
For  now it's (just enough to make it just).

The only thing more fragile then my confidence,
Were my words in these remarks.
This song's a sorry attempt to forget your face, 
And to ease this broken heart. 

And if you fall I will catch you...
And if you fall I will catch you...
And if you fall I will catch you...
And if you fall I will catch you...
I will catch you (I will catch you)
I will catch you (I will catch you)
I will catch you (I will catch you)
I will catch you (I will catch you)---
