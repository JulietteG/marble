Cough this silence away
and save it for a better day,
one with firesides and catalyzed love.
Breathe this breath of me.
One momentary coalition.
It's a chance for love in all the right ways.

CHORUS:
And, tired, these hearts, they fall.
So simple now.
So simple now.(x2)

Break this vase with me,
shattered glass and splitting heartaches.
This bloody mess washed down with tears and
we'll toss this up to fate.
We'll roll the dice and pick a number.
One more chance for love in all the right ways.

(CHORUS)

Don't break my fall,
for I'd rather crash 
than to sleep without you here.
This lonely bed
will lie cold and empty.
Just rest with me tonight.
Just rest with me tonight.
(There's nothing I'm too tired for.)---Lyrics submitted by Paula.
