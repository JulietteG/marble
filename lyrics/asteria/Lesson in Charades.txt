Don't bite your lip to hold back your smile
Just think of this as bending the rules
You're walking a thin line between me and what's right
This thread seems worn and fraid
Don't hide your face and cower behind
A wall made up of secrets and lies

You can put it all on me
But if this is what's been wrong
Then why is your hand in mine

CHORUS:

One moment at a time
With nothing but your eyes
You make me scream
Stop and let me breath
Regretting our first kiss
Taste the poison on your lips
Bloody and sweet
Stop and let me breath

This room's too cold to hold back your tears 
Your heart's too weak to wear on your sleeve
If I'd allow my self to feel the things i know i should
(allow my self)
(things i know)
Then i might not be standing here
(here)

My mind is busy trying to sort through your words
(My mind is busy trying to sort through your words)
Or lack there of the one's I want to hear
(Or left there all the one's I want to hear)
I rip my heart up piece by piece 
(Rip my heart)
To show you how i feel
(Show you how)
If I thought that you'd even care
(That you'd even care)

CHORUS:

One moment at a time
With nothing but your eyes
You make me scream
Stop and let me breath
Regretting our first kiss
Taste the poison on your lips
Bloody and sweet
Stop and let me breath

(Oh god this poison's spreading)
(Can't feel) the ground beneath my feet
(My hands wont stop shaking)
(My legs) are crippled from defeat
(My visions getting blurry)
(My heart's) breaking as we speak
Won't you listen to me
to me
to me
(growl)

CHORUS:

One moment at a time
With nothing but your eyes
You make me scream
Stop and let me breath
Regretting our first kiss
Taste the poison on your lips
Bloody and sweet
Stop and let me breathe---Lyrics submitted by Anton.
