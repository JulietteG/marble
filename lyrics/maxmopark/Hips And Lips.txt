Tell me all, and Ill try to piece it together
Ive got a photo-fit mind, but Im a first rate forgetter
Your face will fall, but lets try to keep it together
The blade withdraws before the knot starts to sever

The way you stick out your lips,
And keep your hands on the hips
And Im supposed to know
And Im supposed to know
The way you stick out your lips,
And keep your hands on the hips
And Im supposed to know what that means
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be

I punched the fence last night
Another act which you thought pathetic
Despite this love, I cant forgive when you say forget it

Your face will fall, but lets try to keep it together
The blade withdraws before the knot starts to sever

The way you stick out your lips,
And keep your hands on the hips
And Im supposed to know
And Im supposed to know
The way you stick out your lips,
And keep your hands on the hips
And Im supposed to know what that means
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be

Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be

Your face will fall, but lets try to keep it together
The blade withdraws before the knot starts to sever

The way you stick out your lips,
And keep your hands on the hips
And Im supposed to know what that means
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be
Youre a puzzle to me, and you always will be---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
