i am who i am
and i will do all that i can
so don't take me for granted no no
This is all i ever wanted

you and i were meant to be together
and you and i were meant to stay forever
and i love you love you
in each and every way
every single day

(day and night) daylight (moonlight)
please be there when i rise
when i open my eyes
you were mine
day and night
oo please be there when i rise 
when i open my eyes you were mine

the sun rise in the east
the sun set in the west oh yeah
for lunar every quarter
the moon brings in the water
and life begins soon after eh yeah yeah

you and i were meant to be together (be together)
and you and i were meant to stay forever (stay forever)
and i love you (love you) love you (love you)
in each and every way
every single day

(day and night) daylight (moonlight)
please be there when i rise
when i open my eyes
you were mine
day and night
oo please be there when i rise 
when i open my eyes you were mine

(day and night) daylight (moonlight)
please be there when i rise
when i open my eyes
you were mine
day and night
oo please be there when i rise 
when i open my eyes you were mine

(day and night) daylight (moonlight)
please be there when i rise
when i open my eyes
you were mine
day and night
oo please be there when i rise 
when i open my eyes you were mine---Lyrics submitted by shinkon ami.
