I think it's time you take another look around
if you're gonna bring a knife into a gunfight bragging
how you're sick of hearing every single human being
seeing as they're watching but can't see past what they're seeing
You can keep em at bat but put that knife away
Always with the wild card you're gonna wanna play
cuz you're my implosionatic
My implosion addict
That a boy
Don't rock the boat
That a boy
Let it implode
I think it's time you take another couple days off
Gotta make a conversation such a face off
I'm betting debt is threatening to make it worse
Try to hide you're dreaming up an epitaphic verse
You can keep em at bay but put your pills away
Always with the wild card you always wanna play
So much for dying before you're 30 or 27 like Jan and Jim
Get on it
Where's your iconic all too ironic romantic tragedy recorded quadraphonic?---
