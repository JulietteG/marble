These bandages cover more than scrapes
Cuts and bruises from regrets and mistakes
I've been hopin' you're mopin' around the street again
I've been trippin' from sippin' the drippin' dirty water tap
I've been pokin' a voodoo doll that you do not know I made
These bandages are anonymity
I've been shakin' from makin' an awful decision
I've been runnin' and runnin', feels like my head is spinnin' round
And round, around, around, around, around, around

Bandages hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down, hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages

I've been hopin' you're mopin' around the street again
I've been trippin' from sippin' the drippin' dirty water tap
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know made
For you, of you, let's see what needles do
I've been shakin' from makin' an awful decision
I've been thinkin' I'm drinkin' too many drinks all by myself
I've been runnin' and runnin', feels like my head is spinning round
And round, around, around, around, around, around

Bandages hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down  hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Bandages, bandages, bandages

Don't worry now, don't worry now
Don't worry 'cause it's all under control
Don't worry now, don't worry now
Don't worry 'cause it's all under control
Don't worry now, don't worry now
Don't worry 'cause it's all under control
Don't worry now, don't worry now
Don't worry 'cause it's all under control
Don't worry now, don't worry now
Don't worry 'cause it will all turn around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around 

Bandages hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Bandages hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down hold my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Bandages, bandages, have advantages too---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca.
