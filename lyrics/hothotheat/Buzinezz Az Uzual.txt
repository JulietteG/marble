Hid his car in the back
Payed a kid to watch his glass don't crack
See him greeted by his made up name in the stairwell of his favorite parkade
He prays for my blind eye
He was lost
He was found with a boy in a pillbox hat on the wrong side of town for a man who wears a suit like that
He prays for my blind eye
I pray for his new bride
Transatlantic transactions under covers covering up an attraction
Blood on a pillow with a pregnant wife and kids
He prays that nobody knows nobody cares
He prays that nobody sees nobody stares
Don't let the kids find you out
Father figure of the new millennium: "Life's too short for me to just live one
Money's money kid - that's fact
Who are they to say what I put back?"
He prays for my blind eye
I pray for his new bride
He prays for my blind eye
I pray for his new wife
We pray for nothing ---
