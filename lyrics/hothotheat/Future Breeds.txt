I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore

Across a bridge, the ablett strip
There lives a man with atlas grip
Windows covered, single matress
On friday nights it feeds his address

Well across a bridge on ablett.St
There lives this girl she used to be
Still half-naked, she falls in traffic
You dumbass kid, here's your dumbass life back

I won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again
No i won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again

I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore

Some they fear, just your name
For me i wish it was the same
Im still waiting for somebody to fix
This damage to my body

Some may fear the future breeds
These drug & sales planting seeds
I just need this cheque to clear
So i can check right out of.. Hear me

I won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again
No i won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again

This merry-go-round
Has spun itself into the ground
They threw me that
An inch in this life is still far as hell

But they bred you better
They bred you better
They bred you better than me
They bred you better
They bred you better
They bred you better than me

I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore
I wont say anything
I wont say anymore

They bred you better
They bred you better
They bred you better than me

They bred you better
They bred you better
They bred you better than me---
