The cry of adventure, like inspiring songs. Whaleing over the rooftops, the whole night long. Saw a shooting star, like a diamond in the sky. Must be someones soul passen bye. These are the dreams, where we choose the one we'll profit from. These are the days, where you become what you've become. These are the days where a star is told, a truth unfolds. Darkness settles in. OH-MY

CHORUS-
Shine your light, down on me. Lift me up, so I can see. Shine your light, when your gone. Give me the strength, to carry on, carry on. Dont wanna be hero's, just an everyday thing. Trying to do the job, and do it the best you can. Now its like lookin out, for all times. Out on the limbs, over the lines. Never wanna stick around, til the vary last dance. Sometimes you stumble, and take a hard fall. Just hold your chin up, awefully high. Shine your light down on me, lift me up so I can see.  Shine your light, when your gone. Give me the strength to carry on, carry on.

Thought I saw him walking by the side of the road. Is he trying to find his way home. Hes here but not here, hes gone but not gone. I just hope you know if i get lost.
Shine your light, down on me. Lift me up, so I can see.  Shine your light, when your gone. Give me the strength, to carry on, carry on. Shine your light, down on me. Lift me up, so I can see. Shine your light, when your gone. Give me the strength, to carry on, carry on.---Lyrics submitted by -.
