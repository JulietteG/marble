Sean, I swear the best one yet came from Tupelo, Mississippi.
I'll tell ye now that grown men cry, and Irish girls are pretty.
Sean, I swear the best one yet came from Tupelo, Mississippi.

Ah, Hi ya, hi ya, hi ya (etc.)
Though fear and hurt and care
can lead me to despair,
I saw why I'm here,
The mornin' you appeared. 

Sean, I sat a while on clouds
to ask God if he's livin', (yeah)
I should have spent some time on knees
in thanks for what he's given.

Give it to me, give it to me now.....
hi ya, hi ya, hi ya, hi ya, hi ya (etc.), 
From parents smart and strong, 
to both of us passed on,
from kings is where we've come, 
through daughters and through sons,
through daughters and through sons.

Sean, I swear the best one yet came from Tupelo, Mississippi.
I'll tell ye now that grown men cry, and Irish girls are pretty...---Lyrics submitted by Lavinia.
