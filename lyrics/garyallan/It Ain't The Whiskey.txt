I stood there in the middle of the church of the broken people.
Watchin' to the walking wounded tell their stories.
My turn came I told em' my name I said this ain't my first time.
And then a man started talking how the devil and the bottle was ruining my life.
With last night on my breath I stood up and said...

(Chorus)
It ain't the whiskey. It ain't the cigarettes. It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget, and it ain't the hard times. It ain't the all nights.
No it ain't that easy, cause' it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me...

So what do you got for this empty spot inside of me.
The deep dark hole where love used to be.
Before she ripped it out and ran into the arms of someone else.
Y'all sit in this room and you talk like ya' got some kind of remedy.
Well I hear what your telling me, I got all the proof I need...

(Chorus)
It ain't the whiskey. It ain't the cigarettes. It ain't the stuff I smoke.
It's all these things I can't forget, and it ain't the hard times. It ain't the all nights.
No it ain't that easy, cause' it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me...

I done all I could to drown this hurt inside, but I can't wash you off of my mind...

(Chorus)
It ain't the whiskey. It ain't the cigarettes. It ain't the stuff I smoke,
It's all these things I can't forget, and it ain't the whiskey. It ain't the cigarettes.
It ain't the stuff I smoke, It's all these things I can't forget, and it ain't the hard times.
It ain't the all nights. It ain't that easy, cause' it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me---
