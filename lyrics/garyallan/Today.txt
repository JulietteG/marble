today he told her that he loved her 
put a ring around her finger
and promised her forever
together

today
she smiled for all the pictures
and he was right there with her
makin'all the memories
without me

and it hurts to say this
out loud
looks like shes really gone
now

today 
is the happiest day of her life
i should be happy for her
today

so tell me why are these tears 
in my eyes
i know i should be happy for her
but i've lost everything
wanted
today

today
i thought about the moment
i could have said i loved her
and i promised her forever
together

today
today it really hit me
that she don't really miss me
shes found a new beginning
and im wishing
i had one more chance

today
is the happiest day of her life
i should be happy for her
today 

so tell me why are these tears in
my eyes
i know i shuld be happy for her
but i've lost everything
i've lost everything i've ever
wanted
today

today
is the happiest day of her 
life
i should be happy for her
but i've lost everything
i've lost everything i've lost ever wanted


today
he told her that he loved 
her
put a ring around her finger---Lyrics submitted by jamey.
