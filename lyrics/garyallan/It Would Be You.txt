It's hard describing a heartache, oh cause it's a one of a kind thing
A serious injury and a whole lot of endless pain
If it was a storm, I'd compare it to a hurricane oh it's even got a name

If it was a drink, it would be a strong one
If it was a sad song, it would be a long one
If it was a color, it would be deep deep blue
But if we're talking 'bout a heartache, it would be you

If there was a full moon, it would be a total eclipse
If it was a tidal wave, it would sink a thousand ships
If it was a blizard, it would be a record breaking cold
If it was a lie, it would be the biggest story you've ever told

If it was a drink, it would be a strong one
If it sad song, it would be a long one
If it was a color, it would be deep deep blue
But if we're talking 'bout a heartache, it would be you

If it was a color, it would be deep deep blue
But if we're talking 'bout a heartache, it would be you---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
