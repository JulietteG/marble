Yeah (yeah) Hey Ambassador,
Ya boy Lecrae
With Trip Lee
We don't want you checking for us,
We want you checking for our God
Check for our God (let's get it)

The Ambassador:
People want to know about a sole devout God who got us rolling out a carpet for him
Make way for the King, Lord Jesus, the ruler, Lion of Judah
Who'd take a dulas and make him a friend
They wanna know if and when did you begin if you're Him
Who's mad infinite, then you would be the Infinite's son
This would mean that you're God, this would mean you're in charge
Cause only he was involved in what precedes Genesis 1

Why'd you come to the Earth when you're not, part of the Earth
And you got ultimate worth and you plopped into a mess
Why die for a people who got a passion for evil
Why let them lash you and beat you when you supplied them their breath
I think the Saviour was saying right,
When you say that the Creator is the only way that you straight up perceive Genesis 1
We know the Father and Holy Spirit both did it but John 1
Said along with the Father and Spirit, it was the Son

He came to the Earth with no stops, entered the Earth with no pops
Lived on the Earth with no props, He's written the story
He died for a block, cause He's a God that is not
Gonna be clowned or be mocked, trust me He's getting that glory
So now we're kicking the truth, in the booth
We like to spit cause it's few people who through the Spirit really wanna get with y'all
Who forsake money and places that's sunny and stages with honeys
Just to rep the living God you should be checking for

Hook:
Hey I be repping for Him, I drop the message for Him
I only wanna give you things that get you checking for Him
I want you checking for my God (hey)
Checking for my God (hey)
Checking for my God (hey)
I want you checking for my God (Come on)
I could rap about my gear
Rap about what I could steer
But I'd rather rap about the God that died to get you near
I want you checking for my God (hey)
Checking my God (hey)
Checking for my God (hey)
I want you checking for my God

Trip Lee:
People wanna know about my God and His forgiveness
Cats is holding at Him hoping I can get a witness
Cats is off their rockers, They knock us, we not tripping
When man's demanding answers, bro we find them in the Scriptures
(Listen up) I know they told you that God ain't really s'pose to
Punish anybody cause He loves them in their clothes bro
But He knows, even if you hate Him, He would hold ya
I think it's time we seen Him better like a close up

He does love us man but it seems we broke up
Sin brings a gap and it has to get closed up (For real)
He can't just let us off the hook man he shows us
His forgiveness is tied to Him who died and rose up (Christ)
His love is so great, He gave the Son to save us
A free gift offered if you come and trust the One who changed us
We ambassadors who rep Him so you get to know Him
Here bro I know this'll get you open and checking for Him

Hook:
Hey I be repping for Him, I drop the message for Him
I only wanna give you things that get you checking for Him
I want you checking for my God (hey)
Checking for my God (hey)
Checking for my God (hey)
I want you checking for my God (Come on)
I could rap about my gear
Rap about what I could steer
But I'd rather rap about the God that died to get you near
I want you checking my God (hey)
Checking my God (hey)
Checking for my God (hey)
I want you checking for my God

Lecrae:
People want to know about our God and His mercy
Like don't He see us hurting and how messed up the Earth be?
I know that people in church be like "Praise Him, He's so worthy"
But how can He condemn folks who ain't heard Him in the first place
I'm sure that many people feel like they deserve life
But it's death that we deserving cause we've all rejected Christ
The world's full of murder, got ya lies, got ya hate
It's a wonder God ain't take the world and crush it into flakes

Man it's mercy God's showing when a man's in a cell
Doing 25 to life but he'll never go to hell
Cause he gave his life to Jesus when we know that he deserved
To spend forever distant from the God who made the Earth man
Mercy's when a person don't get what they should
Like I should've got death but instead I got it good
So if you thinking God's wrong cause He's perfect and He's just
Just remember that we all should be crushed
You checking for Him?

Hook:

The Ambassador:
Crazy,
We don't want you checking for us
We want you checking for Him
The one that made you
And the one that can save you
Jesus, Jesus the Christ
From East to West
Up top to the dirty
Check for our God ---Lyrics submitted by dlawise.
