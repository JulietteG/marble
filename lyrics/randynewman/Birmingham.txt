Got a wife, got a family,
earn my livin' with my ear.
We roll in a steel mill,
Downtown Birmin'ham.

My daddy was a barber,
the most unsightly man.
He was born in Tuscaloosa.
He died right here in Birmin'ham.

Birmin'ham, Birmin'ham,
The greatest city in Alabam'!
You can travel cross' this entire land,
there ain't no place like Birmin'ham.

Wife's named Mary but she's called Marie,
We live in a three room house with a pepper tree.
I work all day in the factory, 
and that's all right with me.

Got a big black dog, and his name is Dan
live in my back yard in Birmin'ham.
's the meanest dog in Alabam'!
Get 'em, Dan!

Birmin'ham, Birmin'ham,
The greatest city in Alabam'!
You can travel cross' this entire land,
there ain't no place like Birmin'ham.---Lyrics submitted by Sid Lehr.
