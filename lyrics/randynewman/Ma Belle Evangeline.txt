Look how she lights up the sky,
ma belle evangeline,


So far above me yet I,
Know her heart belongs to only me.


Je t'adore,
Je t'aime, 
Evangeline,


You're my queen of the night,
So still, 
So bright. 


That someone as beautiful as she,
Could love someone like me.


Love always finds away,
It's true.


And I love you Evangeline.
(ohh yeah)



(Instrument break)



(ooh)
Love is beautiful,
Love is wonderful.


Love is everything,
Do you agree?
Mauis' oui


Look how she lights up the sky,
(ahhh)
I love you 
Evangeline.---Lyrics submitted by gabby.
