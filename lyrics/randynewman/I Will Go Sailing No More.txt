Out among the stars I sail
Way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sail
Dream had ended too soon

 Now I know exactly who I am,
 And what I'm here for.
 And I will go sailing no more.

All the things I thought I'd be,
All the brave things I'd done.
Vanished like a snowflake,
With the rising of the sun.
Never more to sail my ship,
Where no man has gone before
And I will go sailing no more

But no, it can't be true!
I could fly if I wanted to!
Like a bird in the sky, 
If I believed I can fly,
Why I'd fly!

Clearly, I will go sailing no more...---Lyrics submitted by Matthew Brandt.
