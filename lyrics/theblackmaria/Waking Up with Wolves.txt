Close your eyes, and pretend I'm by your side
Can you feel me love?
Can you see me love?

You wake up alone
It's still forty days until I come home
Does it get easier love?
It seems like it never does...
Is that why you lie?
And tell me you're alright?

Close your eyes, and pretend I'm by your side
Can you feel me tonight?
Can you see me tonight?
I know you're not alright
But this is all you tonight
It hurts but can you feel me love?
Can you see me love?

Are you alright?
I'm starving for answers
I need to know exactly where you are, wherever you are

It's cold tonight
These sheets feel like winter
Are you with someone else tonight?
Is your body his instead of mine?
So I lie, and tell you I'm alright...

Close your eyes and pretend I'm by your side my love
Can you feel me tonight?
Can you see me tonight?
I know you're not alright
But this is all we're yellin tonight
It hurts but can you fee me love?
Can you see me love?

Why are you waking up with the wolves?!!
Why are you waking up with the wolves?!!
Why are you waking up with the wolves?!!
Why are you waking up with the wolves?!!

I know you're not alone
I heard someones voice on the telephone
I can't stay out here for one more night
I'm coming home
You were my home

Close your eyes, and pretend I'm yours once again tonight
Can you feel me love?
Can you see me love?
Even though your not alright
For once more,
Let me be yours tonight
Please forgive me love,
Will you see me love?

This is too much to take in for one night.---Lyrics submitted by Steeg.
