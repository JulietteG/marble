The Dance Floor Silly
They Ladies Gon Fill Me
The Fellas In The Back And They Twissen Up a Phillie
Get Silly[*8]
The Dance Floor Silly

The Fellas In The Back And They Twissen Up a Phillie

My Chain Too Silly
My Wrist Too Silly
The Girls Throw Me Dish Cus My Rims Big Billin
My Ride Too Silly
I Ride Too Silly
We For Fantastic Cus I Gotta Dielly
Cus Now I'm Worth A Million
Forget A Rubber Band Cus You Cant Put A RubberBand Around A Billian
I Be Wilden On A Island SomeWhere Just Like Gillian
Drillen Who Like A Who Like Dentist At The Den Like Villerann
Like Ba Ba Ba Im the man Girlfriend
Im The Reason Why You Wanna Lose Your Man Girlfriend
Im Calm Like Da Sea 
Im Blown Like The Wind
And Now Dat im Straight Im Bout To Act a Fool Again
GET SILLY[*8]
The Dance Floor Silly
The Ladies Gon Feel Me
The Fellas In The Back And They Twissen Up A Phillie [*2]
