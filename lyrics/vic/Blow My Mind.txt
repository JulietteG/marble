He dont love you (X3), Girl
He dont love you girl
He dont know you (X3), Girl
Nawl. . . He dont know you firl

[verse]
Yo boyfriend is not a man he's a boyfriend
Jus someone taking the place of a real man
I'm 24 and I can take you where u never been 
And we aint gotta leave the state to see where I've been. . .
Just close yo eye's, close yo eye's, close yo eye's 
And free yo mind, free yo mind, free yo mind
And open wide, open wide, open wide
And now I'm finna come inside
Now just when you thought 'hear go the same routine'
I got a bowl of strawberrys and some whipped cream
And made a trail from yo stomach to yo clit ring
The strawberrys for u, gurl I'mma lick the cream

[Chorus]
Blow My Mind (x2)
But before you do
Girl come in my room
And lay on the bed
And free yo mind 
I aint thinkin' of me girl it's all obout u
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
[verse]
I know you wonder how I got a nice physique
Wen all I eat is sweets
I like that p***y meat
Aint nothing like a bowl of p***y wen dat p***y clean
Only a lame would starve a women when she got a need
Thats why yo girl, got a girl, got a girlfriend
Cuz she be makin the p***y meow while you eurlin'
Watch out boyz, lmaes dis for real men
Who live women women, I love women women
I love the way her body wiggle wen I lick that clit
Victorious in the clitorous my name is dick
You otha niggas or notourious for using dick
When I make her cum three times without using the dick
Where you get it from
I get it from my momma
She told me how to please 'em cuz my momma was a doctor
And if you wanna please 'em I suggest that you should follow
Unless you like it quit in yo bed cuz mine hollar

[Chorous
Blow My Mind (x2)
But before you do
Girl come in my room
And lay on the bed
And free yo mind
I aint thinkin of me girl its all about u
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y
Girl gimme dat (x3) p***y

[Verse]
Enough forplay I know yo body weak
Head to the left, like you gon go to sleep
But I aint trippin' girl dats how I want you to be
All wet all tired and thinking 'bout the D

And beat the p**y like yea girl who's dis
She bite her lips like oh boy you da shit
