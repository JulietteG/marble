Im a Beast 

            Im a beast 
            watcha noe, 
            watcha noe, watcha noe bout V.I.C. (x2)
            Im a beast 
            Im a animal                      = Chorus 
            beast 
            Im a animal 
            beast 
             Im a animal (x2)

They be calling my label
asking where they find me
because theres nothing comparing 
theres nothing thats like me
in addition to claims 
a record decline me
gota helk in my artist
here to adjust decline it
Im a beast
who they running to
who you running to 
it dont matter where you running i will find you
you better hope you recencell me from itunes
cause when i drop yall cool 
im hot yall cool
new anthem new beast i rule
no hula no class just straight school 
and i cant skip lunch cause they food
yall cant win cause i cant loose
like fifty i create more jirule
im killing this game so blind as
its so clear to its my time

       (Chorus)

Fyi room by V.I.C. come dominate 
the game so dont come trying,
this here beat of the chain
im feeling another part of reality 
hit when i represent the V.I.C.
straight from the cp im feeling
like im in Iraq i see allot of blood spilling
im killing niggas one by one and im filling
like father like son yah
my daddy was a king 
so im a king
dont act dont play
man you know what that means
i dacrow i am debow
now im here im king 
im running things now
im stealing like daddy
what you gona do bout it
im goin for the steals my do i got it

     (Chourus)

V.I.C. is hard (x3)
V.I.C. is hard as hell
V.I.C. is hard (x3)
V.I.C. is hard as hell

    (Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Lord Avanton.
