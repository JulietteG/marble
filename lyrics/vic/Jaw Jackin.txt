You and yer boy jaw jackin' 
Actin like you wanna buck
Yo mug all mean like I really give a fuck
You talkin like you want it but i gotcha
If you see me I'ma get it at ya
Right after I have shot ya
(repeat once)
---------------

I know you heard about me
And even nigga if you heard about button beat
Note to the game: Now I'm in the big leagues
I live west but my money on crip T
Price tag on yer head 'cause I'm filthy
So watch what you say, you don't wanna get 50
'Cause I might be a little bit tighty
But you don't see the counters eating cereal with ivy
Grind me, angry, get real. Put a bullet in yer head call it homey ville
No hands, no feet to kill. lil' jack it up (up) and they take chill
Only guns pop here, but they don't kill
I know who did it, but I'll never tell

..more to come!---Lyrics submitted by Simian.
