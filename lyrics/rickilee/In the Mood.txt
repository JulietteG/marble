Come on get up
That's right
Let's get it on
Can you feel the love tonight
Cos when the stars align
Shining so bright
Oh! This is what feels like 

Cos I'm all dressed up
Can't fight this feeling
I can't get enough
Don't need a reason
Making love tonight
Palms to the sky
Cos I'm in the mood tonight

Hey! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
In the mood tonight
Hey! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
In the mood tonight

So hit the lights
It's time
Enjoy the ride
I'mma rock your world to-nigh-i-ight
Come on let's roll the dice
Just take a chance
Cos tonight it's do or die

Cos I'm all dressed up
Can't fight this feeling
I can't get enough
Don't need a reason
Making love tonight
Palms to the sky
Cos I'm in the mood tonight

Hey! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
In the mood tonight
Hey! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
In the mood tonight

It's in the air tonight
I've got that feeling alright
I'm in the mood
Come on let's celebrate
We're making love tonight
Having the time of my life
Sieze the moment
Don't let it sip away

Cos I'm all dressed up
Can't fight this feeling
I can't get enough
Don't need a reason
Making love tonight
Palms to the sky
Cos I'm in the mood tonight

Oh! Tonight
In the mood tonight

I'm in the mood tonight
In the mood tonight
Oh! I'm in the mood tonight
Come on let's go
In the mood tonight
I'm in the mood tonight
In the mood tonight---
