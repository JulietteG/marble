Can you hear it in the distance, calling out to you
Can you see it in your shadow, the truth you always knew

So get up and get out, they cant hold you down
A fire cant be tamed,
Cause youre here, time is now, all the fear and doubt
Is going up in flames

Tonight Im gonna touch the sky and nothings gonna stop me now
Temperature is on the rise, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down
Cant touch me (ah) Im on fire, cant slow me down
Were gonna light it up tonight, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down

So afraid of your reflection, youre hiding from the truth
Always see imperfection staring back at you

Its OK you can say what you wanna say
Cause I already know
Bout the hurt and the pain, its about to change
Its going up in smoke

Tonight Im gonna touch the sky and nothings gonna stop me now
Temperature is on the rise, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down
Cant touch me (ah) Im on fire, cant slow me down
Were gonna light it up tonight, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down

Cant touch me (ah) Im on fire, cant slow me down
Were gonna light it up tonight, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down

Tonight Im gonna touch the sky and nothings gonna stop me now
Temperature is on the rise, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down
Cant touch me (ah) Im on fire, cant slow me down
Were gonna light it up tonight, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down

Cant touch me (ah) Im on fire, cant slow me down
Were gonna light it up tonight, Im gonna burn it down, burn it down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
