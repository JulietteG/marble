I'm wide awake,
But I'm still dreaming about you.
If forever was today,
I would never let it slip away.
If too good to be true,
Is really two to two be true.
Then i guess we'll have to lie,
So let's lie here all night.

Hello Mr. Moon so bright
(hello Mr. Moon so bright)
Guide my paper plane tonight
(guide my paper plane tonight)
Take me to where ever land
(take me to where ever land)
So we can crash in true romance
(so we can crash in true romance)

We're walking on a dream tonight,
So raise your hands up to the sky.
Are you with me,
Are you with me.
Let's go and never turn around
Lets love and never broken round
Are you with me,
Are you with me.

Making love in slow motion,
Can we keep it on replay.
Every once in a while,
Life gives us a fairy tale

We're walking on a dream tonight,
So raise your hands up to the sky.
Are you with me,
Are you with me.
Let's go and never turn around
Lets love and never broken round
Are you with me,
Are you with me.

Hello Mr. Moon so bright
(hello Mr. Moon so bright)
Guide my paper plane tonight
(guide my paper plane tonight)
Take me to where ever land
(take me to where ever land)
So we can crash in true romance
(so we can crash in true romance)

We're walking on a dream tonight,
So raise your hands up to the sky.
Are you with me,
Are you with me.
Let's go and never turn around
Lets love and never broken round
Are you with me,
Are you with me.

Together, together, together,
We'll make it last forever and ever and ever.
Happy ever after together, together
Make it last forever and ever and ever
Together, together, together,
We'll make it last forever and ever and ever.
Happy ever after together, together
Make it last forever and ever and ever---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
