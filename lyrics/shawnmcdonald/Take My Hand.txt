Take my hand to the promise land
and on you I want to stand
cause I cannot do it on my own.
You're what I need
and I need to be right by your side
cause I cannot hide
Lord, I know that I need you.

na na na na na na na na na, I need you.
na na na na na na na na na.

Without you I'm so alone.
I am weak, but you are strong.
You pick me up when I'm falling down.
And I'm crying out to you inside of my heart.
I need you, Lord, oh so, for the part.
I want you to have my life, Jesus.

Take my hand to the promise land
and on you I want to stand
cause I cannot do it on my own.
You're what I need 
and I need to be right by your side
cause I cannot hide
Lord, I know that I need you.
(I need you.)

na na na na na na na na na, I need you. 
(I need you.)
na na na na na na na na na, I need you.

I fall to my knees and I'm begging you: 
please, oh Lord, won't you change me and make me new from the inside out.
I want to shout out your name.
(I need you)

Take my hand to the promise land
and on you I want to stand
cause I cannot do it on my own.
(I need you)
You're what I need 
and I need to be right by your side
cause I cannot hide
Lord, I know that I need you.
(I need you.)

na na na na na na na na na, I need you.
(I need you.)
na na na na na na na na na, I need you.

(I need you.)
(IIII neeeeeeeeed youuuuu.)
(I need you.)
(IIII neeeeeeeeed youuuuu.)
(I need you.)


Take my hand to the promise land

You're what I need 
and I need to be right by your side
cause I cannot hide
Lord, I know that I need you.
(I need you.)
