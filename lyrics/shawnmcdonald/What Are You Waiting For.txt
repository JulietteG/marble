You have always been a run away 
Always looking for a place that's safe 
Cause you were disappointed with the world 
The hand you were dealt 
And I get it why you feel that way 
Cause it doesn't ever seem to change 
But have you ever really tried to trust something outside yourself 

What are you waiting for? 
Your Standing at an open door 
This is your life, you never live twice 
Step through to the other side 
Cause there's so much more 
What are you waiting for? 

You don't have to be afraid 
To believe in something unexplained 
Cause this is where the road begins and where the healing starts 
Open up your eyes my friend 
This is where the searching ends 
You don't have to keep the wounds the walls around your heart 

Go ahead and say goodbye 
Go ahead start tonight 
Come over come over to the other side---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
