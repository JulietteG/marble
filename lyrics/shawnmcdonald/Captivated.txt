When I look into the mountains, I see your face
When I look into the night sky, it sparkles your name

The wind in the clouds and the blue in the sky
The sun and the moon, and the stars so high
Thats what draws me to you..

I am, I'm captivated by You
and all that You do
I am, I'm captivated 

When I wake unto the morning, it gives me your sights
When I look across the ocean, it echos your might

The sand on the shore and the waves in the sea
The air in my lungs and the way you made me
Thats what draws me to you..

(chorus)

The wind in the clouds and the blue in the skies
The sun and the moon, and the stars so high
The sand on the shore and the waves in the sea
The air in my lungs and the way you made me
The blood in my viens and my heart you invade
The plants how they grow and the trees in the shade
The way that I feel and love in my soul
I thank you my God for letting me, letting me know---Lyrics submitted by Roy.
