I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin's not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

Lust I haven't craved
A sainted boy im not
I'll take it to my grave
A side cursed on rot

I ride this ropes alone
Beneath the sulfur sky
Everywhere I roam
Life is one big lie

When the fireball goes down
Out by LA waste
I come into town
But only for a day

If starving in bed means
A pray for you to understand
The man cure is sleek
But lust holds my hand

I stumbled and I cry
I pounce with no revenge
At least I never lied
Or took the truth to rail---Lyrics submitted by Jonny.
