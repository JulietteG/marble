Save me
The skin that's stretched across your bones
The scent that lacks the innocence I know
Cold front coming, like blisters through your pores
Breathing, you'll trust me darling
I'm the sword inside your stone

The rest of your life
May rest in my eyes
Let me show you what it's like
[x2]

Meet me at the skylines
wait for you to go
I'll wait for you to go
Meet me at the skylines
wait for you to go
wait for you

Save me
The skin that's stretched across your bones
The scent that lacks the innocence I know
Cold front coming, like blisters through your pores
Breathing, you'll trust me darling
I'm the sword inside your stone

The rest of your life
May rest in my eyes
Let me show you what it's like
[x2]

Meet me at the skylines
wait for you to go
I'll wait for you to go
Meet me at the skylines
wait for you to go
wait for you

Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you
Meet me at the skylines
Meet me, meet me
Meet me at the skylines
Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you

I don't think you know
What these words mean
I don't think you know
What we could be
But I will wait forever
'cause I think you're the one
[x2]

I don't think you know---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
