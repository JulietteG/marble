ou dropped the glass but before it breaks
I will show you the steps I take
I won't give you a chance to prove
Cause you'll fake it
I won't say what you want me to say

Just so you know I told you so
You call me crazy
Why can't you see it's you not me?
I'll show you crazy

Don't fight the past you could never change
I see through you and what you say
I won't give you a chance to lose
Cause you'll fake it
I won't say what you want me to say

Just so you know I told you so
You call me crazy
Why can't you see it's you not me?
I'll show you crazy
I won't say what you want me to say

I will not live my life in the face of a lie
and I will not.....
I won't say what you want me to say
Just so you know I told you so
You call me crazy
Why can't you see it's you not me?
I'll show you crazy---
