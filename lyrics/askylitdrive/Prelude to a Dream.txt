I felt alive
Take me from the city.
Stand up this is a fucking ovation.
Stand up! Stand up!
All together we scream

I thought this was all a part of the plan
In the end we walk out (walk out)
Walk with me
Talk with me
I'll take you away from this place
As legends go we are at the end
Here's a column of my own so let's begin (begin)
Walk with me
Talk with me
This place we cannot erase

Forget what they said
You will love me the same way
Let's break the cycle

What you thought I despised sent me frantically spinning into the sky
Like we're facing off with our nightmares
The hero will never die

Never going the same way
Can't collide with what doesn't need a heartbeat

And I will make you believe that this look was mistook
With what doesn't need....
All together we scream

I thought this was all a part of the plan
In the end we walk out (walk out)
Walk with me
Talk with me
I'll take you away from this place
As legends go we are at the end
Here's a column of my own so let's begin (begin)
Walk with me
Talk with me
This place we cannot erase

The city only breathes through you
And all the cracks that you've fallen through

As legends go we are at the end
Here's a column of my own so let's begin (let's begin)
I thought this was all a part of the plan
In the end we walk out (walk out)
Walk with me
Talk with me
This place we cannot erase---Lyrics submitted by alexis.
