Won't you scream my name?
For the first time,
For the last time.

As I lay down my life before you...

The hiding place where I sought out your eyes,
Screaming outwards to shoot me back in time.
You sent me out in the right field,
Spilled my words and disguise.
We're starting a rise.
Now it's so true, I can't go on without you by my side.
Every night we die.

Hold my breath just to see your ghost.
I hold it in my hand for you.

Won't you scream my name?
For the first time,
For the last time.

...And I regret the moments I gave you.

Searching for my plans to devour you,
I finally found out the truth.
You sent me out in the right field,
Spilled my words and disguise.
We're starting a rise.
Now it's so true, I can't go on without you by my side.
Every night we die.

Let go of the wires.---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
