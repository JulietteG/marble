Been counting stars that seem to never die
An endless re-creation of this cell in my mind
I had a vision of you
I've been dreaming in blue
Whoa! I can't save you
Whoa! I've been dreaming in blue again
I can hear your voice
I will find you there

So take me from this dream
This nightmare I've been trapped in
I've been walking on a wire in my own prison
I had a vision of you
I've been dreaming in blue
Whoa! I can't save you
Whoa! I've been dreaming in blue again
I can hear your voice
I will find you there

I've been dreaming in blue
Been trapped in my own prison
Whoa! I can't save you
Whoa! I've been dreaming in blue again
I can hear your voice
I will find you there

I've been dreaming in blue---
