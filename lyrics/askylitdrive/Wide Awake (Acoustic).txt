There's a noose around my neck I...
I cannot breathe
I cannot seem to find my way back from this
This fight might be my last try
I'm losing sleep
I'm living in white lies
Like fire by my side
I'm wide awake now
Lift me up
Take me away
I'm not afraid now
Don't give up
Take me away

I'm trapped inside with no light
I cannot see
The pressure pulled me under
I'm an anchor at the bottom
I think I'm losing my mind
Looking for what I can't find
I'm living in white lies
Like fire by my side
I'm wide awake now
Lift me up
Take me away
I'm not afraid now
Don't give up
Take me away

The weak and the brave
The sinners the saints
Remember that we are all the same
We dig our own graves
Take me away
I'm tired of chasing days
Too proud to face the pain
In the end we all find our way
We dig our graves
Take me away
I'm wide awake now
Lift me up
Take me away
I'm not afraid now
Don't give up
Take me away---
