Every hour of my life, I will give you
Every minute of my day
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Pull you out from the rock that you're under
Every second that it takes
(Until the pendulum breaks)

I want you to see
I won't let you fade
There has to be another way

Take a breath, stay with me
Help is on its way
Hold on to me, don't leave me

Every hour of my life, I will give you
Every minute of my day
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Pull you out from the rock that you're under
Every second that it takes
(Until the pendulum breaks)

Keep your eyes on me
You can't leave this way
Please stay with me, don't turn away
This is not your time, you can die another day
Hold on to me, don't leave me

Every hour of my life, I will give you
Every minute of my day
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Pull you out from the rock that you're under
Every second that it takes
(Until the pendulum breaks)
(I'll do whatever it takes)
(Until the pendulum breaks)
(Until the pendulum breaks)

Every hour of my life, I will give you
Every minute of my day
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Pull you out from the rock that you're under
Every second that it takes
(Until the pendulum breaks)

Every hour of my life, I will give you
Every minute of my day
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Pull you out from the rock that you're under
Every second that it takes
(Until the pendulum breaks)

Every hour of my life, I will give you
Every minute of my day
(I'll do whatever it takes)
Pull you out from the rock that you're under
Every second that it takes
(Until the pendulum breaks)
(Until the pendulum breaks) ---
