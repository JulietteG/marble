I've been around
I've crossed all the lines
I only hope there comes a day you will realize
You're just a joke
Never listen to what I say
I've got a question, where would you be without me?
Don't be pretentious
I am the truth
I only hope there comes a day you will see
You lost everything when you lost me

Lights out, don't make a sound
All of your photographs are on the ground
No one can stop me now
Tonight I'm leaving you
You're just a fool
I've heard all your lies
How unfortunate it took so long to realize
You're full of shit if you think that I am letting this go
And when all is said and done you'll be the one alone

Don't be pretentious
I am the truth
I only hope there comes a day you will see
You lost everything when you lost me
Lights out, don't make a sound
All of your photographs are on the ground
No one can stop me now
Tonight I'm leaving you

I'm not letting this go
No time for turning back now
You are all alone
I'm not letting this go
And when all is said and done you'll be the one alone
Lights out, don't make a sound
All of your photographs are on the ground
No one can stop me now
Tonight I'm leaving you---
