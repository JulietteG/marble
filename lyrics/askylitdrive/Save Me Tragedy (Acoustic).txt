I hear you
I fell in love with the fame and greed
I fell before but not quite this deep
Somebody save me from the terror I've become
And when my conscience is clear I will not bite my tongue
It's only a minute more

I hear you screaming, "put down the gun!"
These days I'm better off another casualty
I know you're thinking this blade's the one
But this is not your time to leave
I hear you screaming
You fell in love with a tragedy
Yeah, you're just like me
So come on come on come on
This bullet is a curse
What is your fate now worth?
I know it seems like forever
It's only a minute more

I hear you screaming, "put down the gun!"
These days I'm better off another casualty
I know you're thinking this blade's the one
But this is not your time to leave
I hear you screaming
Don't lose faith, faith in me
Save me from tragedy
It's only a minute more

I hear you screaming, "put down the gun!"
These days I'm better off another casualty
I know you're thinking this blade's the one
But this is not your time to leave
I hear you screaming
Don't lose faith in me
I know just what you're thinking
But I won't let you leave
Save me, tragedy
I know I won't be better off another casualty
I hear you scream---
