I would like to inform you that I have lost to my worst enemies
Try to live frozen in time
Eva! Eva!
Break all of my will to survive
Eva! Eva!
It seems to me that you have something to prove

It's your time to own up to the false foundation under my arm
Pictures bring clarity to what it's meant to be

Going that last mile
Now that isn't your smile

You mustn't open your mind to what you believe
Please tell me that this is for real
Won't you shine your light on me?
Don't say that you want me
Please tell me that this is for real
I just might say someday
I could be better off in your mind

Hey baby, do you see me cause I'm staring at you
Hey baby, I want you I want you
Hey baby, do you see me cause I'm staring at you
Hey baby, I want you I want you alive
Come sit next to me
Can you see into my mind?

Going that last mile
Now that isn't your smile

You mustn't open your mind to what you believe
Please tell me that this is for real
Won't you shine your light on me?
Don't say that you want me
Please tell me that this is for real
I just might say someday
I could be better off in your mind

Smile forward
I've been trapped in the fiction of a fraud
It isn't over until I get what I deserve
It's what I deserve

You mustn't open your mind to what you believe
Please tell me that this is for real
Won't you shine your light on me?
Don't say that you want me
Please tell me that this is for real
I just might say someday
I could be better off in your mind---Lyrics submitted by jordan.
