Run, for your life now
Dont you see your princess is gone?
Pull your vengeance aside
Lets make it rain blood tonight

Collide your sword with mine, Ill send your soul
To the hell where it came from
By this I know youll never set your eyes
On a quest you cant survive
Its no surprise your head hangs from my hands
Your mouth cant sin or lie

Cut through the limbs
Stab through the enemies eyes
Any last man will die
[x2]

She, watching the sky burn oh how it burns
Run for the skylines, run for the skylines darling
Follow the light of the moon just to stay alive

Forgive me
For tomorrow
If Im late
Ive died before I wake

Cut through the limbs
Stab through the enemies eyes
Any last man will die
[x2]

Whats left for you
You, you wanted life
I showed you life
Conserve protect your life
Conserve your life
Conserve protect your life
Conserve your life

Your life is my well being
And if it lay in shadows then so be it
But let it be known that this soldier will not rest a day
Until he lays in the glamour and the grace of his pride
I will not rest one day until my victim's blood is shed
Up and down the shorelines
Up and down the shorelines

For gods sake please
Dont you forget me
I will wait for you
[x2]

Race the sun
Pray for nothing warm---Lyrics submitted by Colby.
