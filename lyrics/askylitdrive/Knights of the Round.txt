Breathe
Just breathe
What are you waiting for?

Incisions forced; blood runs
We're forced to believe it
Don't you see it?
You're being overthrown by ...

We are the knights
Your nightmare arrives
I don't think you know I don't think you know
What has come for you
Follow the lights
They're burning so bright
I don't think you know I don't think you know
What has come for you

Breathe
Just breathe
Won't you walk through the door

Focus on all your instincts
It brings you deeper to the meaning of what we've become
Show your heart of stone

We are the knights
Your nightmare arrives
I don't think you know I don't think you know
What has come for you
Follow the lights
They're burning so bright
I don't think you know I don't think you know
What has come for you

We subside
Lost in your eyes
You burn so bright---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
