Final forewarning has gone through the door
I have seen this before
Etch it in my spine; now you think "he's mine" ... for all time
Overproduce me .. hoping for a dramatic change
Map out your great escape

What's the connection?
The slightest deception between you and me
Man and machine
Disassemble me ... breathing at your knees
Your machine

Cut me open; you'll find what you've been looking for
Helpless in motion; arise to serve me once more

Relaxed movement brings too much pain to be seen
Overproduce me .. hoping for a dramatic change
Map out your great escape

What's the connection?
The slightest deception between you and me
Man and machine
Disassemble me ... breathing at your knees
Your machine

Override command confirmed ... Manual control returned
Your machine---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
