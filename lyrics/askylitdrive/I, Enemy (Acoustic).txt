Like an ember I fall
Live to burn and fade away
You don't have to be strong
Just take my hand
Fade away
It's not too late to change
You can't blame yourself for letting go
I've seen your heart burn for way too long

I see fear in your eye
This isn't goodbye
Fade away
Are you even alive?
Is this how you die?
Fade away
It's not too late to change

You can't blame yourself for letting go
I've seen your heart burn for way too long

Fear is not the end
Fear is the enemy
The enemy in me

You can't blame yourself for letting go
I've seen your heart burn for way too long---
