Get out!
Since when did you become a distant dream?
You take the best of me
I'm sick of the taste
So jaded and misplaced
They say you made a monster out of me
You take the best of me
I'm sick of this place
So fucked up and deranged

Crash! Down!
When it all comes falling down
Crash! Down!
Crash down now
You take the best of me
So when do you feel like coming clean?
You're cracking underneath
You can't find your place
You faded with no trace
It seems I'm just a pill to fix your pain
You're cracking underneath
It's all laid to waste
So strung out on hate

Crash! Down!
When it all comes falling down
Crash! Down!
Crash down now
Am I the one that you remember when it all comes falling down?
Crash! Down!
Crash down now
The world is sick
You put the poison in it
Infected
Infect us all
Get out!

Apathetic whisper when you hit the ground
What will you remember?
Crashing down
Crash! Down!
When it all comes falling down
Crash! Down!
Crash down now
Am I the one that you remember when it all comes falling down?
Crash! Down!
Crash down now---
