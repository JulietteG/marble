Na to ri ?? I wan drag you??

Oo oo oo oo oo oo

One bus dey come now (woo woo woo woo woo)
It pass from the side (woo woo woo woo woo)
?? Fela Kuti in public?? (woo woo woo woo woo)
One man inside the bus (woo woo woo woo woo)
Him start to yap (ya ya ya ya ya)
Him say "Look those people" (ye ye ye ye ye)
Them be ye-ye people (ya ya ya ya ya)
Them be amugbo people (ye ye ye ye ye)

One man come stand (ya ya ya ya ya)
Him say "Don't call them like that" (ye ye ye ye ye)
Them be my people (ya ya ya ya ya)

Before you know commotion don start 
Big trouble, big argument
Big fight, big everything
Commotion de go, commotion de come
Fight de start, fight de stop
Trouble de turn round and round
Before conductor come vex, conductor come vex now (ya ya ya ya ya)
Him can hear everything (ye ye ye ye ye)

Ooroo wooroo for them back (ya ya ya ya ya)

Him say "bring me the Fela people"
Make am lock am, charge am forgot
Before I shut (their) big mouth for am
Then I hand am to mosquito
That is how this country be, that is how this country be.
That is why everything dey scatter scatter, that is why everything dey scatter scatter X2
No wonder re re de ro

No wonder re re de ro (no wonder re re de ro)
No wonder ??? spread (?) the road (no wonder re re de ro)
No wonder ??? de stop suddenly (no wonder re re de ro)
No wonder money no de flow (no wonder re re de ro)
No wonder people no get job (no wonder re re de ro)
