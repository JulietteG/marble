If this is an emergency 
we shot down in the dark 
we did it just to pay the fee
now there's nothing to die for 
and all the kids from miles around 
a foose in paradise 
I know about the siren sound 
so the scene is an eye sore 
are coming back in our way 
chaos gave me strength enough to face another day 
all I think about if I was just to run away 
is would I come back to love you girl 

Chorus:
I don't really care 'cause I'm burning some bridges 
we don't need no water let em burn to the ground 
some might fear, some of them are superstitious
but my ear is to the ground 
and I walk the streets down down down down 
down down down down, 
down down down down 
down down down down, oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm just a man who's walking 
they stand around and keep talking 
they try to clip my wings 
but wisdom cures so many things, sing it again 
I'm just a man who's walking 
they stand around and keep talking 
they try to clip my wings 
but wisdom cure so many things
for love, love, oh love, yeah 
love love 

Chorus:
I don't really care 'cause I'm burnin some bridges 
we don't need no water let em burn to the ground 
some might fear, some of them are superstitious
but my ear is to the ground 
and I walk the streets down down down down 
down down down down, yeah
down down down down yeah
down down down down, 

Now ain't it funny how life goes on 
first you ride high then you might lay low 
don't get high on your own supply 
someone say first before a phone calls pride 
this is my message to the world 
I wanna reach every girl and boy 
not tryin to say if it's right or wrong 
its just a love song 
I don't wanna change the world 
(I don't wanna change the world) 
I only want to stop pretending 
Its just a love song
nothing left to do but let it burn 
I only hope we're all ascending (high)

[2x Chorus:]

I only wanna stop pretending

This is my message to the world 
just trying to reach every boy and girl 
not tryin to say if it's right or wrong 
this is just a love song---Lyrics submitted by kC.
