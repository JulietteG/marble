You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that

I'll tell you you're right when you want, I
And if only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight, to me

When you're on the outside baby and you can't get in
I will show you, you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you can't get back again
I will find you, darling and I will bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think id leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that

I'll tell you you're right when you want, I
And if only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there by your side, baby

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight, to me (to me)
Oh when you're low
I'll be there by your side, baby---
