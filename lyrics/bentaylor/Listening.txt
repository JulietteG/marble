Another number for another year,
Another blessing disguised by fear,
How come everything good seems so hard to hear when Im listening?

And now Im trying to find myself,
All I need is a little help.
But everybody else is busy helping themselves,
And not listening.
Oh, listening.

I get the feeling like I cant go on here.
How much longer?
How much longer?
Oh, believing that I dont belong here.
How much longer?
Tell me.

I walk so far but I cant get near.
So much talking the point disappears.
So its only whats missin that comes through clear.
Ive been listening.

I want so much that I aim too high.
I test the water and feed the fire. 
So its no ones wonder my mouth gets dry.
Ive been listening.
Oh listening.

Still, I get the feeling like I cant go on here.
How much longer?
How much longer?
Oh, believing that I dont belong here.
How much longer?
Tell me.

I was looking for a way to bow out gracefully.
But, when I try to catch some understanding,
Everyone wants to race with me.

I get the feeling like I cant go on here.
How much longer?
How much longer?
Oh, believing that I dont belong here.
How much longer?
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?---Lyrics submitted by Krista Akers.
