it's the ime of the season where love runs high in this time give it to me easy and let me try with pleasured hands 

take you in the sun to promise land show everyone it's the time for the season of loving 

what's your name who's your daddy is rich like me has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

tell it to me slowly tell you what i really want to know it's the time for the season of loving 

what's your name who's your daddy is he rich like me has he taken any time to show you what you need to live 

tell it to me slowly tell you what i really want to know it's the time for the season of loving---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
