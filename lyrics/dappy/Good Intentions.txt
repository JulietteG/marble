I seen a lot of things in life that words can't explain...
See we ain't any different, but we're just ain't the same,
They never listen when you tell 'em, tell 'em,
All they understand is venom, venom,
Even though they use you when you let 'em, let 'em.
Well if that's the case,
Then I'm the one to blame...

'Cause there's a man overboard...
And the tide's gonna drag him down.
If there's a man in the clouds,
Well tell me where the hell is he now?
Why is the silence so loud?
Have I thrown it all away?
Lemme know, lemme know,
Tell me,

Tell me is that just happens to a good intention,
Tension,
Woah,
Look what happened to my good intention,
Tension,
Woah,
Why won't anybody answer my question?!
Why is the silence so loud,
I think I thrown it all the way,
I don't know, I don't know,
But lemme know,
Hear me out before you label me as the bad one

I'm walking through the desert,
But I'm drowning inside...
No river runs deeper,
Than the tear from my eye.
You only went and made me bitter, bitter,
I wish I wasn't such a giver, giver,
I apologize to my liver, liver.
'Cause if that's the case,
Then you're the one to blame.

Cause there's a man overboard... ('cause there's a man overboard!)
And the tide's gonna drag him down. (hey!)
If there's a man in the clouds, (oh-oh!)
Well tell me where the hell is he now? (yeah.)
Why is the silence so loud? (tell me why is it so loud.)
Have I thrown it all away? (yeah!) 
Lemme know, lemme know,
Tell me,

Tell me is that just happens to a good intention,
Tension,
Woah,
Look what happened to my good intention,
Tension,
Woah,
Why won't anybody answer my question?!
Why is the silence so loud,
I think I thrown it all the way,
I don't know, I don't know,
But lemme know,
Hear me out before you label me as the bad one,

Am I wrong to think the world's got it in for me,
And am I right to say I'm longing for some sympathy.
See I feel a sound, but I can't hear it.
That's my heart getting played like a symphony,
Yo, you know you turned me insane,
Why you staring at the window,
When I'm the one with the pain?
You know you set me off the rails,
And you'll be the one to blame,
If you ever hear,
I jumped in front of the train,
We're both f**cked in the brain!

 'Cause there's a man overboard...
And the tide's gonna drag him down.
If there's a man in the clouds,
Well tell me where the hell is he now?
Why is the silence so loud?
Have I thrown it all away?
Lemme know, lemme know,
Tell me,

Is that just happens to a good intention,
Tension,
Woah,
Look what happened to my good intention,
Tension,
Woah,
Why won't anybody answer my question?!
Why is the silence so loud,
I think I thrown it all the way,
I don't know, I don't know,
But lemme know,
Hear me out before you label me as the bad one...---Lyrics submitted by John.
