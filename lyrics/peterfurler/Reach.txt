Verse 1:
Ohh Ohh.
You Hold the weight of the world
Still I don't slip through your hands.
Your love is bigger
Than just an ocean built by man.
I fall again and again
But you whisper your still mine.
You feel the pain of the world
But you never push mine aside.

Chorus:
And you reach for me
With a love that quiets all my fears.
And you reach for me
Like a father wipes away the tears.
So many people in this world
But I hear you calling out my name.
You reach for me
Now i'm never gonna be the same.
Ohh Ohh.

Verse 2:
You know all of my fears
There's nothing your eyes can't see.
When I tried to give up
Lord you never gave up on me.
I give you all of my hopes and dreams
I lay them down.
Of all the places i've looked
You're the one truth I have found.

Chorus:
And you reach for me
With a love that quites all my fears.
And you reach for me
Like a father wipes away the tears.
So many people in this world
But I hear you calling out my name.
You reach for me
Now i'm never gonna be the same.
Ohh Ohh.

Bridge: 
You hold the weight of the world.
Still I don't slip through your hands.
You put the stars in the sky.
You know every grain of sand.

Chorus:
But you reach for me
With a love that quites all my fears.
And you reach for me
Like a father wipes away the tears.
So many people in this world
But I hear you calling out my name.
You reach for me
Now i'm never gonna be the same.
Ohh Ohh.

You reach for me.
For me.---Lyrics submitted by Lizzie.
