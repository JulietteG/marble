I take a look at men around
Shake my head and wonder how
Women of the world can tolerate such hateful fools
Undercover SKA, we'd like you to know we're not that way
We follow all the television Golden Rules

We're super nice guys
We're super friendly
We're super nice guys
We're super friendly

We'll buy dinner and the wine
Talk about love all the time
We'd never hurt a soul unless you told us to
Unlike all those other guys
We're sensitive, we often cry
We'll never think of ourselves, only you, just you

We're super nice guys
We're super friendly
We're super nice guys
We're super friendly

We care...

We care...

We care...

We'll be strong, or we'll be weak
We'll become the men you seek
Say the word and we'll repress our base instincts
Be we men, or be we boys
All that counts is a woman's joy
We'll never tell her the truth, until she thinks...

We're super nice guys
We're super friendly
We're super nice guys
We're super friendly

We're sensitive men
Extremely helpful
We're SUPER! NICE! GUYS!
Super friendly---Lyrics submitted by William.
