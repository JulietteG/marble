I'm sick of second chances
Cigarettes turn to ashes
I'm standing under street signs
To know the places I've been my whole life

I watch the hours pass us
Another one burns to ashes
I'm waiting for your phone call
To come and save me so you can break my fall

I will stand outside, wait for you to come find me
I will keep on my light by my bed till you get home
And I won't sleep tonight till you get home
I won't sleep tonight till you get home

My bed light's burning brighter
Worn out like a boxing fighter
You've got me fighting pillows
My eyes just won't close till you're at my side

The hours slip to morning
And I see the sun coming up
I'm turning off the TV.
I'm watching faster than you gave up on me

I will stand outside, wait for you to come find me
I will keep on my light by my bed till you get home
And I won't sleep tonight till you get home
I won't sleep tonight till you get home

I got your letters that you sent to me
And it feels like summer but your far away from me
When I need you here
I will stand outside, wait for you to come find me
I will keep on my light by my bed till you get home
And I wont' sleep till you get home
I won't sleep tonight till you get home
