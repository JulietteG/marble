You are my shepherd, I have no needs 
You lead me by peaceful streams 
And You refresh my life 

You hold my hand and You guide my steps 
I could walk through the valley of death 
And I wont be afraid 



Because You are in control 
You are in control 
You are in control 
You are in control 


You cause everything to work together 
You truly have a sovereign plan 
And You know who I am 
And You made who I am 
And You love who I am---Lyrics submitted by mike.
