Love is for all, for all, for all, for all
I spend a lot of time looking for a better day
Changing looking like its many years away
Slowly, slowly getting closer as my hope takes over for all
La-la-la-la

Im pushing to the limit through the pouring rain
I see my parents work hard through the tears and pain
I guess we all do the same, let your dreams lead the way for all
La-la, yeah
I wear my heart on the sleeve and Im not the only one
(Im not the only one)
I always get back on my feet and Im not the only one
(Im not the only one)
I learn to cherish every moment now, Im not the only one
(Im not the only one)
As long as were together, youll never feel alone, at all

Chorus:
Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for yall, this is for all

Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for yall, this is for all

Sometimes I sit back, relax and enjoy the feeling
If Im living, oh Im barely living, oh Im still breathing,
Today is something different, I woke up on the good trip
But the next part of my life where I could flip the world I live in
And now the sun is shining in my face
The doors are all well opened, will never close again
I do it for the love and let my dreams lead teh way for all
La-da

I wear my heart on the sleeve and Im not the only one
(Im not the only one)
I always get back on my feet and Im not the only one
(Im not the only one)
I learn to cherish every moment now, Im not the only one
(Im not the only one)
As long as were together, youll never feel alone, at all

Chorus:
Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for yall, this is for all

Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for yall, this is for all

Dancing till we up to the top, you get up
Were strong enough that nothing will stop, now get up
Dont ever let your energy drop, get up
and everybody throw your hands up

Dancing till we up to the top, you get up
Were strong enough that nothing will stop, now get up
Dont ever let your energy dro, get up
and everybody throw your hands up

Chorus:
Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for yall, this is for all

Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for yall, this is for all---
