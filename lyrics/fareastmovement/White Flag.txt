Cherry cherry boom boom
Yeah yeah up all night feeling like aking
Living in a nightmare looking for a dream
I wanna live so free free free
Not doing just me me me
Sometimes you you sometimes me me
Trying to stay off that TMZ
You you you are my queen
Lay down that draw bridge for your king

Ill give it all
Maybe to this nothing, nothing for me to give it all
Ohh wooh yeah yeah

Even living in a castle we makeball
Like living in a house with glass for walls
So baby you and I will see that we can live together forever
And I will lose it all
Meet me on the battlefield camoflague
And maybe you and I can be together forever

Ill give it all
Maybe to this nothing, nothing for me to give it all
Ohh wooh yeah yeah

You love is so cold you girl got me freezing
Dam it cant wait till the change of seasons
To make you heart melt like resses peices
Always on the left trying to make it right
