The upon trees on lights 
We celebrate- in like a , like a in period of nights,
Check the Andes on cad-I it rains on time, 
What we fave in on the ratty paper La times, 

Thus it looks the way that, we dont blast, 
Tag-in with something which is over phast,
Tomorrow is for the Homs I was go so fast

Yah, Dip it to the fog I Charade ignore 
Freak the roll above I can pick the soft wow 
Question on the staff find the lady on bow 
He is little arcwa on a Christmas card

We can play late like twelve days of mix mix 
Last many gifts go head pick the distrait 
Go play to make Dirty Bass on the misses 
Roof top a five make that sound

Repine to the pull of warm-i 
Keep dance in feel it from your heart 
Keep smash in doesnt matter who you are 
Represent the west coast hands to the stars
