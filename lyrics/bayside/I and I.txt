I've got a stage and a mic
Which I use to say things you won't like
But I spent years thinking I was alone
Now I know, now I know, that I'm not, that I'm not
And I'm sharing that comfort with those
Who think that hope is lost

Oh and I'm so proud of where I am
I'm learning where to stand or to tread lightly

So hold back
Steadfast you've gotta breathe
And be content, just count to ten
Like all the experts say and if
The drugs don't seem to work
Then they've got a padded room for you
To get your just deserve

If I could chose my own name
I'd chose something that's bold and fits
Like anger, aggression, or cunningly brash
By the skin of my teeth but with timing and class

Oh woe is me (Oh woe is me)
Oh woe were us (Oh woe were us)
But not anymore we stand up for ourselves
We're like captains at war, we'll get followed to hell

Oh and I'm so proud of where I am
I'm learning where to stand or to tread lightly

So hold back
steadfast you gotta breathe
And be content, just count to ten
Like all the experts say and if
The drugs don't seem to work
Then they've got a padded room for you
To get your just deserve

I and I, we're taking control of our lives
I and I, we're taking control of our lives
I and I, we're taking control of our lives
Everything's alright
I and I, we're taking control of our lives
I and I, we're taking control of our lives
I and I, we're taking control of our lives
Everything's alright

So hold back
Steadfast you've gotta breathe
And be content, just count to ten
Like all the experts say and if
The drugs don't seem to work
Then they've got a padded room for you
To get your just deserve---Lyrics submitted by Steven Kay.
