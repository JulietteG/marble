Last call, lights on
pull your faces off the bar
Go to church cause you need a good cleansing
of body mind and soul

I never thought it possible
I think I fell in love with someone worse than me
and I love you to death
I don't think I like you anymore

The healing power of alcohol
only works on scrapes and nicks
and not on girls in seedy bars
who drown themselves in it

They say that scent is the strongest sense
it's tied to memory,
but the stench of this place is almost as bad as the memory tied to it
and I tried to forget that sickening stench
with everything I've got
but you can't trust a heart that was cold from the start
you'll waste your time on it

The healing power of alcohol
only works on scrapes and nicks
and not on girls in seedy bars
who drown themselves in it

You can play all day
and tell yourself that everything's alright
The truth is that your heart collapsed
two years ago tonight

You should thank your lucky stars
for all the times you've been ashamed
You'll learn more from the harder times
than the times that you've been vein
The lesson learned is priceless gain
if you can take a spin
You threw away your friends
as if drinks are all the friends you need

The healing power of alcohol
only works on scrapes and nicks
and not on girls in seedy bars
who drown themselves in it

You can play all day
and tell your friends that everythings alright
the truth is that your heart collapsed
two years ago tonight

(The truth us that your heart collapsed
two years ago tonight)---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
