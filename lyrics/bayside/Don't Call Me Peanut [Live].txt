Drink up beautiful
I spiked your cup with angst
and a heart attack
cause I've got so much trapped
It's all because of you
So I figured you might like some back

And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights
She'll recite her excuses
put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time

Can't live my life
Knowing you'll be in his arms
each time I blink my eyes
I know what goes on behind my back every night
afraid I'll never leave
afraid I'll never know what's good for me

And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time

And now you say that
You say you love me
While I may have your heart
He has your body
And now you swear that
your being honest
But your not honest
You never could be

And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
