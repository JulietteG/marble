pound my knuckles hard against the floor,
 my head against the wall,
 but i did this to myself. 
assume its just not worth getting back up, 
so i'll blame it on bad luck,
 and i'll shake responsibility yeah.

 i spent some time in a bad place at eighteen, 
wishing i could see something through clear eyes. 
do you ever wake up to realize
 that your life is meaningless? 
does it give you strength, 
or lead you to your grave at a young age?


 pound my knuckles hard against the floor,
 my head against the wall,
 but i did this to myself.
 assume it's just not worth getting back up, 
so i'll blame it on bad luck, 
and i'll shake responsibility yeah.


 it seems that when i ran away from my past,
 that all my dignity,
 my faith, 
my pride got left back.
 and now i think that it's time that i realized
that self pitty is meaningless. 
though i'm ten feet deep,
 i'll claw my way back out from in my grave. 


pound my knuckles hard against the floor,
 my head against the wall. 
but i did this to myself. 
assume it's just not worth getting back up,
 so i'll blame it on bad luck, 
and i'll shake responsibility and say a hard life did this to me.

 but now, i realize i'd give anything i have
 to walk a day in my old shoes, 
wondering what my first smoke would be like,
 my first fuck, 
my next fuck up,
 the next band that would change my life,
 and they changed my life.


 pound my knuckles hard against the floor,
 my head against the wall, 
but i did this to myself.
 assume it's just not worth getting back up, 
so i'll blame it on bad luck,
 and i'll shake responsibility, 
and say a hard life did this to me.---Lyrics submitted by brad.
