where will i be 
when theres pain as far as eyes can see
stand in line for days and nights
for making up lost  time
and this is how it feels 

 [chorus]
so now i cut these loveless wrists
my head sure hurts today
ill take another 20 pills 
and try to make my troubles go away
so now i cut these loveless wrists 
my hean sure hurts today 
ill take another 20 pills 
and try to make my troubles go away,away

i once felt strong
it wouldnt last for long
i wrap my hands around my neck
kill myself again 
cut my arms with the biggest knife i can stand

why waste time 
lifting my head keep it down 
and save face instead
why waste time 
lifting my head 
save face instead

i once felt strong
it wouldnt last for long 
wrap my hands round my neck
kill myself again 
cut my arms 
with the biggest knife that i can stand
more than i can stand---Lyrics submitted by georgia.
