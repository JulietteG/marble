I've always played the fool around here
I'm starting to worry that
I rush through life forgetting to breathe
We all need some time to adapt

No one understands
No one understands what It's like

I had the hopes of silver and gold
I thought they could change for the best
My mom always said I was named for a destiny
But I never thought I was blessed

No one understands
No one understands what It's like

I've got your gear right here
Is that what you wanna hear
I played the fool to many times
And I've been catching up for all my life

And It seems, It gets harder to believe 
Its gets harder but be honest
If the sun don't shine tommorow
We'll survive

I turned this up as loud as It goes
It ain't to much for the pain
It's up to me In the heart of my sleep
that hasn't quite been the same

No one understands
No one understands what It's like

I've got your gear right here
Is that what you wanna hear
I played the fool to many times
I've been catching up for all my life

And It seems It gets harder to believe
It gets harder but be honest
If the sun don't shine tommorow 
We'll survive

I'm in a field of land mines
The crew to help huddle
but I don't think about that

It's hard to find hell
when every one 
Is counting on me
but I got burns already

I've got your gear right here
Is that what you wanna hear
I played to fool to many times
I've been catching up for all my life

And It seems It gets harder to believe
It gets harder but be honest
If the sun don't shine tommorow
If the sun don't shine tommorow
If the sun don't shine tommorow
Than we'll survive---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
