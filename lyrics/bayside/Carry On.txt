Don't confuse neediness for love
Because obsession never lasts and you're insane by a landslide
Never cared for you much until death do us part
You'll always be distressed

Carry on, with the guise of a sheep in a storm
You're a wolf and you're losing the ground that you're on
But hey hey, I've got things to say
I've lost control of life
I don't know how many times I've tried
To undo the knot you've tied
My face is red, and people change
I've changed for good this time

And I've followed you around
I've seen you all over town
I've got a laundry list telling me why
It follows to prove I was right

Carry on, with the guise of a sheep in a storm
You're a wolf and you're losing the ground that you're on
But hey hey, I've got things to say
I've lost control of life
I don't know how many times I've tried
To undo the knot you've tied
My face is red, and people change
I've changed for good this time

I just can't handle this, I'm just so scared of it
A challenge fit for a man when I'm just a kid
I'm all torn at the seams, just like you said I'd be
If this is love, then I don't want a part of it
I just can't handle this, I'm just so scared of it
A challenge fit for a man when I'm just a kid
I'm all torn at the seams, just like you said I'd be
If this is love, then I don't want a part of it

But hey hey, I've got things to say
I've lost control of life
I don't know how many times I've tried
To undo the knot you've tied
My face is red, and people change
I've changed for good this time

Carry on (carry on)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Hey hey, carry on (carry on)
Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
