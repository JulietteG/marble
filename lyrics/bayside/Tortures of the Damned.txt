I hate myself
more than i've ever let on
I'm burnt out at 22
I lived too fast
and i loved too much
and i'll die too young
but i chose this cup that i drank from
knew what i was getting into
but i couldn't let out what i had to keep in
i'm ashamed of myself
and the unspeakable sins
that i've committed and....

[Chorus]
I've made mistakes,
but I'll find my way.
There's no explanation for,
the things I've failed at before.
They can't hold my hand.
It just hurts to be a man,
Through the tortures of the damned. 
of the damned!


If I only had an axe,
I'd sever the ties I've made with the world.
Maybe I can be a stranger,
in a strange place.
If I start now, maybe I can be saved.
If I only had a mask,
I'd cover these bleeding eyes.
They're bloodshot now but they'll be black by dawn.
If I wake up now,
I can be pure again.

[Chorus] 

Look at me now, I'm on the tracks with my back towards the last train leaving town. [x4]
