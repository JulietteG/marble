Chorus:
Dont lie to me if you dont love me
Dont lead me on if you dont care
Tell me have you seen your old love
Let me know its only fair

(instrumental break)

Your old love hes back in town now
By chance you saw him on the street
Is that the reason youre so cold dear
Dont lead me on dont lie to me

(chorus)

(turn around)

You act so strange when were together
Your thoughts are miles away from me
Sometimes at night i hear you cryin
Your heart is full of misery

(chorus)

(turn around)
