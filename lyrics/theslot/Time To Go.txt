Knew this all along:No more confusion
Today is the day to decide what to do.
What they always say it's always the same
They act like it's nothing:You won't follow thru

When they cover and hide away
Sell us a fallacy
High time to open up our eyes

(It's time to go)
Oh,Oh,Oh:You know it's time that you go
(Cause I said so)
Oh,Oh,Oh:Don't care where - Hit the road
(Some other Road)
Here was once your playground
Now it's no more
(Your world explodes)
Oh,Oh,Oh:No excuses ,Just go

Such a tale to tell,There was a boy that
Once could make all of your
dreams just come true
Then the tale had turned 
cause he never learned that
What you really wanted was a different hue

Like Alice in Wonderland,
This blue pill in my hand
Now I've decided to swallow

(It's time to go)
Oh,Oh,Oh:You know it's time that you go
(Cause I said so)
Oh,Oh,Oh:Don't care where - Hit the road
(Some other Road)
Here was once your playground
Now it's no more
(Your world explodes)
Oh,Oh,Oh:No excuses ,Just go

Imprisoned inside they find me
(It's a bad place to be)
Wounds that are cruel reminders
(Scars that you cannot see)
We once could have been something
(Break away to get free)
But now all that we'll have is nothing

(It's time to go)
Oh,Oh,Oh:You know it's time that you go
(Cause I said so)
Oh,Oh,Oh:Don't care where - Hit the road
(Some other Road)
Here was once your playground
Now it's no more
(Your world explodes)
Oh,Oh,Oh:No excuses ,Just go

Oh,Oh,Oh
Oh,Oh,Oh
Oh,Oh,Oh
Oh,Oh,Oh:No excuses ,Just go---Lyrics submitted by william gundlac.
