Trust is a thing, a thing of the past
I knew this relationship wouldn't last
You never ever seem to keep your word to me

Your love is good, but your timing is bad
The most irresponsible man I ever had
You've left me hanging for the very last time tonight

Why you wanna mess it why you wann mess it
Why you wanna mess it all up
Why you wanna mess it why you wann mess it
Why you wanna mess it all up

You've got some stuff that I don't understand
Who can I depend on if it ain't my man
I've heard you say, give me one more change again

Why you wanna mess it why you wann mess it
Why you wanna mess it all up
Why you wanna mess it why you wann mess it
Why you wanna mess it all up

I tried to but I need a change in my life
But you aint ready, and you aint steady
Now you want a good time

Why you wanna mess it why you wann mess it
Why you wanna mess it all up
Why you wanna mess it why you wann mess it
Why you wanna mess it all up---Lyrics submitted by Jeannette.
