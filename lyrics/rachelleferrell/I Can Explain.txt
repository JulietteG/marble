I come to you with a heavy heart
Don't know quite where to start
Cept that, no one has ever loved me like you do
Like you do

You treat me, like you just don't care
But we both know, darling, that's not fair
No one has ever loved me, not like you do

I can explain
Why I caused you pain
Let me tell all, I made you cry
Oh you hurt me baby
Like no one else before you

No one has ever loved me like you do
Like you do

You wanted me all to yourself
But I just found out, you've got somebody else
But no one, has ever loved me
Not like you do

I can explain
Why I caused you pain
Let me tell you all, how I made you cry

You hurt me baby
like no one else before you
No, one has ever loved me like you do
No, one has ever loved me like you do---Lyrics submitted by Jeannette.
