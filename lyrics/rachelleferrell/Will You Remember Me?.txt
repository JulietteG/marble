If you see a pretty lady walking down the street
Will you remember, me?
When a woman comes up to you, lookin' good, talkin' bout what you gon' do 
Will you remember me?

Will you be tempted to compromise what we have
or will you want to make it last
Will you be tempted to jeopordize our relationship
Will you remember this
Will you remember, remember, remember me?

Will you remember, remember, remember, remember me, yeah

Don't you know that I love you boy
And ain't nothin in this world I wouldn't do for you
I understand, lookin' at other women is part of being a man

I'm not trying to cramp your style
I ain't tryna cramp your style
I just need to know, who's in control, you or your desires

If you see a situation coming up that's gonna bring us down
Will you remember me
When a feeling comes over you, feelin good thinkin bout what you gonna do
Will you remember me?
Will you remember the forever we share together
Do you remember when you said that to me baby
Can you look at me in my eyes when a time gone by can you remember ther
Ah remember, remember, remember, remember me

Will you remember, remember, oh remember me
Baby
Don't you know that I love you boy
And ain't nothin in this world I wouldn't do for you
I understand, lookin' at other women is part of being a man

I'm not trying to cramp your style
I ain't tryna cramp your style
I just need to know, who's in control, you or your desires---Lyrics submitted by Jeannette.
