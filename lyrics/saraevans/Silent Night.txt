Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glorious strains from Heaven afar
Heavenly Hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born,
Christ the Savior is born---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
