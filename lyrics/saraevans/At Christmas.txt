Its my favorite time of year
Doorbells ringing, everybodys here
Barely any room in the dining room tonight
Pecan pie better warm it up
Bubbles flowing, Better fill your cup
Love and laughter up to the rafters, alright
No place that id rather be
Than with my friends and family cause

Chorus:
All the lights are so much brighter
Being with the ones you love by the fire
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas
Snow is falling
My heart is singing
Heres a toast to the joy its bringing
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas

You can feel it everywhere you go
The whole towns wrapped up in a bow
Its the best kinda livin when everybodys giving a smile
No place that id rather be
Than with my friends and family cause

Chorus:
All the lights are so much brighter
Being with the ones you love by the fire
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christmas
Snow is falling
My heart is singing
Heres a toast to the joy its bringing
Nothing is better
Than all of us together at Christma---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
