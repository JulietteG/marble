I never pictured us, ever fighting this much
Thought we were figured out, but it's so messy now
Your words they cut so deep, and I think that you should leave
I'll have to live without, what I can't live without
It already hurts, so before it gets worst just

Put my heart down, put my heart down
Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away
Just like it was a loaded gun
Put my heart down, put my heart down
Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away
This kind of love is dangerous

So pack up all your things, just leave some air to breathe
A million toxic tears, fallin' like rain 'round here
This is the final hour, the end of our story tonight
And I don't wanna fight

Put my heart down, put my heart down
Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away
Just like it was a loaded gun
Put my heart down, put my heart down
Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away
This kind of love is dangerous

It already hurts, so before it gets worse
I know it ain't easy, but if you really loved me

Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away

Put my heart down, put my heart down
Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away
Just like it was a loaded gun
Put my heart down, put my heart down
Put my heart down, put my heart down
And walk away
This kind of love is dangerous---
