She was in the backyard - they say it was a little past nine 
When her prince pulled up - a white pickup truck 
Her folks shoulda seen it comin' - it was only just a matter of time 
Plenty old enough - and you can't stop love 
She stuck a note on the screen door - "sorry but I got to go" 
That was all she wrote - her mama's heart was broke 
That was all she wrote - so the story goes 

Now her daddy's in the kitchen - starin' out the window 
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains 
How could 18 years just up and walk away 
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman 
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye 
She left the suds in the bucket 
And the clothes hangin' out on the line 
Now don't you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn 
Nothin' quite like this has happened here before 
Well he must have been a looker - smooth talkin' son of a gun 
For such a grounded girl - to just up and run 
Course you can't fence time - and you can't stop love 

Now all the biddy's in the beauty shop gossip goin' non-stop 
Sippin' on pink lemonade 
How could 18 years just up and walk away 
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman 
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye 
She left the suds in the bucket 
And the clothes hangin' out on the line 

She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window 
And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight 
How could 18 years just up and walk away 
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman 
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye 
She left the suds in the bucket 
And the clothes hangin' out on the line ---
