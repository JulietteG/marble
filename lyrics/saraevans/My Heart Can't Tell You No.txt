I don't want you to come around here no more, I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is, or how much it hurts me
Cause when you say it's over with her, I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm going to wake up missing you
Wake up missing you

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to call me up no more saying you need me
Your crazy if you think just half your love could ever please me
But still I want to hold you, touch you, when you look at me that way
There's only one solution that I know of
You've got to stay away from me
Stay away from me

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to come around here no more, I beg you for mercy
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture I mean it's a living hell
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture I mean it's a living hell
Living hell
(When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture I mean it's a living hell)---Lyrics submitted by trista.
