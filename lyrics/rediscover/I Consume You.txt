I am in side your head. Now im inside your mouth. I will use you. Now im in side your head,and you try to get me out but I consume you. Have a drink, It will help if its to loud to think. I know you want to look at me. It will help if you can move your feet. But I consume you. (Guitar plays).Middle it sais (Ill consume you three times and finishes). I locked up the door and so now your breaking in.Well if you think ill take an it, Im not taking it,Im not taking it.(Beat goes on).I am in side your head now im in side your mouth. I will use you. Now im in side your head and you try to spit me out but I consume you. (Guitar plays).Middle it sais (Ill consume you three times and finishes).I locked up the door and so now your breaking in.Well if you think ill take an it, Im not taking it,Im not taking it..I locked up the door and so now your breaking in.Well if you think ill take an it, Im not taking it,Im not taking it, Your just faking it. (Guitar solo).You cant come in ,you got to go home. You cant come in, Now leave me alone. You cant come in you got to go home. You can come in so leave me alone. So I locked up the door and now your breaking in. Well if you think im taking not it your just faking it. So I locked up the door and so now your breaking in. Well im not taking it. I'm just faking---Lyrics submitted by jose.
