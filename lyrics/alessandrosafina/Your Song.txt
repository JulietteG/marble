My gift is my song and this ones for you
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite simple but now its done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now youre in the world

I sat on the roof, and I kicked off the moss
Well some of these verses, well they've,
Theyve got me quite cross
But the suns been kind while I wrote the song
It's for people like you that, keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green
Or theyre blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite simple but now it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now youre in the world
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now youre in the world---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
