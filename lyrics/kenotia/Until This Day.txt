When you know, you know. I know with you I'm going to go somewhere I've never been.
But it's where I want to be, I breathe easy for the first time.

I never got much out of this life,
Never saw myself in someone's eyes until this day.
Never had the things I really wanted,
Never had the things that people flaunted
Until this day with you.

I cant explain just how changed how I see myself now, its amazing.
I never want this feeling to leave me. Please don't ever leave me.

I never got much out of this life,

Never saw myself in someone's eyes until this day.
Never had the things I really wanted,
Never had the things that people flaunted
Until this day with you

I never saw this coming on And now that its here i wont let go
this could save me

I never got much out of this life,
Never saw myself in someone's eyes until this day.
Never had the things I really wanted,
Never had the things that people flaunted
Until this day with you---Lyrics submitted by ezrah.
