Christmas is here again
Stand up and cheer again
Lets leave our heartaches and sorrows behind

All that I want is to be here beside you
All that I need is right here in my arms
All that I want is to know that you love me
And this will be my finest Christmas time

Holly and mistletoe, small faces all aglow
Stockings for Santa to fill with his toys
Bright shiny Christmas trees, small people on their knees
Tell Santa they have been good girls and boys

All that I want is to be here beside you
All that I need is right here in my arms
All that I want is to know that you love me
And this will be my finest Christmas time

Grown-ups in paper hats, turkey and brandy snaps
Chestnuts to roast in the coals on the fire
The joy of giving things, the blessings Christmas brings
Just to be near you is all I desire

All that I want is to be here beside you
All that I need is right here in my arms
All that I want is to know that you love me
And this will be my finest Christmas time

All that I want is to be here beside you
All that I need is right here in my arms
All that I want is to know that you love me
And this will be my finest Christmas time---Lyrics submitted by Gayle Bryan.
