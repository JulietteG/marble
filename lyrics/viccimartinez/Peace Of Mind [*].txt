I came to say hello to leave you feeling better
But I left without goodbye, and this time I cried
You tried letting go but I'm better to hold on to
You're gonna find somebody else
And thats better than I'm gone

But I'm not sorry
And I do appreciate, baby
What you've shown me because I'm better after all
Sometimes we need to learn and its gonna be better when we fall
And I know you and I are gonna find some peace of mind
Find some peace of mind, babe
Yeah

Now I wish to you the best 
Seems I feel you even more now
And I know we're gonna grow if you don't take this love for granted
Cause you gave your hear to me
You're more than I would ever ask
And its time for new beginnings to learn from the past

But I'm not sorry, babe
And I do appreciate, yeah yeah
What you've shown me, oh yeah, cause I'm better after all
Sometimes we need to learn and its gonna be better when we fall
And I know you and I are gonna find some peace of mind
Find some peace of mind, babe
Oh, oh

And then a storm cloud erupts and leaves me feeling empty
Bring you sunny day to me
My heart needs love to be free
I love to hear your voice as long as you bring me comfort
Bring your sunny day to me and let my heart be free
Alright

We'll find some peace of mind
Oh we're gonna find it, baby
Find some peace of mind, yeah
Find some peace of mind, yeah---
