I, too, simg America.
i am the darker brother
they send me to eat in the kitchen 
when company comes,
But i laugh, eat well, and grow strong 
tomorrow, ill be at the table 
when company comes.
nobody'll dare 
Say to me, 
"eat in the kitchen,"
then.
besides, 
they'll see how beautiful we are 
and be ashamed--
I,too,am 
American.---Lyrics submitted by keyanna.
