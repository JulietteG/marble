Theres a song that I love
That you once played for me
It had all the right chords
And a sweet melody
It was back when we started
When there was mystery
Now theyve all been erased
On my music machine

And its all because of you
I got a list of songs I cant listen to
And its all because were through
I got a list of songs I cant listen to

And do you still sing along
When youre all be yourself?
Or do you switch to the next one
Sick for somebody else?
And when you call dont forget
How the song kept us warm
You would dance on my bed
I would lay in your arms

And its all because of you
I got a list of songs I cant listen to
And its all because were through
I got a list of songs I cant listen to

And I wish the music didnt play forever
Cause Im feeling like a broken record
And I wish the music didnt play forever
Cause Im feeling like a broken record

And its all because of you
I got a list of songs I cant listen to
And its all because were through
I got a list of songs I cant listen to---
