I'm some kind of monster
Since I lost her

There's a trap door hidden in my heart.
I fell into a lover's hell,
Deeper than I thought
I keep crawling back to that motel.
I don't recognize
Who I am tonight

[Chorus:]
I'm some kind of monster
Since I lost her
Now I'm raging wild,
And starting fires
I burn this whole thing down
I'm some kind of monster
How bad do I want her
I don't sleep at night
I terrorize
There's blackness in my eyes
I'm some kind of monster
I'm some kind of monster

Everybody wanted her as a friend for fun
The time we took,
The nights we shook
I should've been in love.
Now her face is carved into my head
She's a dime for life
In such distress

[Chorus]

I used to whisper in her ear
Now I'm screaming out in fear
Secrets keep me sinister,
But I've tell her every time.
So why can't she understand
The creature I've become.

There's a trapdoor hidden in my heart
I fell into a lover's hell,
Deeper than I thought

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by haley fusaro.
