Started in the morning
 My head was getting hazy
 Couldn't keep my feet on the ground
 She was makin' love to the
 Mirror in the bathroom
 Didn't hear me talkin' out loud
 Bubblegum, lipstick
 Baby's got me nervous
 Something's got a hold of my feet
 You just wanna go
 Where your problems won't follow
 Baby that's ok with me

Set fire with just a little spark
 That's how it goes when you're
 Moving in the dark
 Set fire with just a little spark
 That's how it goes when you're
 Moving in the dark

Got no money still
 Ain't that cool?
 I'm the little punker
 Who's kissing you
 Forget what you heard
 About modern love
 She's still in the mirror
 Honey, fixin' her mug and I'm like
 [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsty.com/neon-trees-moving-in-the-dark-lyrics.html ]
 Set fire with just a little spark
 That's how it goes when you're
 Moving in the dark
 Live fast, it's a feeling not an art
 Just how it goes when you're
 Moving in the dark

Kids kiss, statuesque out in the street
 I don't really wanna be a part of your scene
 Messed up, all the same, kids in my city
 It's less about what you say
 And more looking pretty and I'm like

Set fire with just a little spark
 That's how it goes when you're
 Moving in the dark
 Live fast, it's a feeling not an art
 Just how it goes when you're
 Moving in the dark

Started in the morning
 My head was getting hazy
 Couldn't keep my feet on the ground
 She was makin' love to the
 Mirror in the bathroom
 Didn't hear me talkin' out loud
 Bubblegum, lipstick
 Baby's got me nervous
 Something's got a hold of my feet
 (Set fire with just a little spark
 That's how it goes when you're moving in the dark)
 You just wanna go
 Where your problems won't follow
 Baby that's ok with me---Lyrics submitted by kayla milewski.
