Yo, check this out
This Ice-T
UABB, Upon A Burning Body Bitch
(That's UABBB)
Fuck that, anyway we up in this motherfucker
Security fucking with me, telling me to stop standing on the god damn couches
Now motherfucker, you could get hurt

Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?

Drunk in the club, liquor in my cup
You can see that I don't give a fuck (Turn down for what?)
Get out my face motherfucker, unless you wanna see what's up
(Turn down for what?)

Bartender just hit me with a double
Drink tequila so you know we're in trouble
Showing up to every party tipsy
Living life like a stunna can you blame me?
Now that's my kind of party
So light 'em up, up, up
Cause tonight we just don't give a fuck

You know we're always up to noon
This is rockstar shit motherfucker, you wish you could
You know we're always up to noon
Fire up that loud, another round of shots

Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?

You can find me chilling at the bottom of a cold drink
Blasting Pantera, drinking OE
Sipping on that cold cut whiskey
You're fucking right, we're fucking crazy
Now that's my kind of party
So light 'em up cause tonight we just don't give a fuck

Swear to god, this security guard looks at me one more time
I'm punching him in the face
Yo cuz, why you bumping all up into me nigga
You drunker than me, what's happenin'?
Yo bitch, you ain't ditch your bottles bitch
Are you fucking crazy?
Put the bottle down, this Upon a Burning Body
Bitch, you trying to get crunk?

Turn down for what?

Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?
This is rockstar shit motherfucker, you wish you could
Turn down for what?
Yo check this out
Turn down for what?

Turn down for what?
Check this out, this Upon a Burning Body, bitch---
