Come on over here, 
let me have a try,
so I can have your near, 
just another night.
Whisper in your ear,
show that there is time,
before you disappear, 
for us to say goodnight.

Waking from a sleep,
every word I say,
just to make you see,
that every single day,
I will want to be,
if it is ok,
stuck inside a dream,
while your are awake.

'Cause you know I already miss you,
I already miss you much more than you know.
The days turn to nights and I find myself singing a song.
When I am not with you my heart stops, 
and I end up losing control.
Deep is the breath and with your whisper I do belong

If you're on your own,
if you're on the path,
and you're all alone,
call me for a kiss.
If you don't really know,
no one ever will.
It's juste the way it goes,
and just the way it is.

Still I want you to,
consider again,
with all that we've been through
I have been your friend.
Don't you know that you
don't have to pretend
in doing wath you do 
Im yours until the end.

'Cause you know I already miss you,
I already miss you much more than you know.
I hope you remember the days we have hade until now.
We won't be together until the day that you decide to come home.
Still I am sure that our stars will align anyhow.

'Cause you know I already miss you,
I already miss you much more than you know.
The days turn to nights and I find myself singing a song.
When I am not with you my heart stops, 
and I end up losing control.
Deep is the breath and with your whisper I do belong.---Lyrics submitted by Gabriel Favreau.
