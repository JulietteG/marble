Could have been the whiskey
   might have been the gin
   could have been the three or four
   six packs I don't know
   but look at the shape i'm in
   my head feels like a football
   and I think i'm gonna die

   was'nt that a party

   Someone took a grape-fruit
   wore it like a hat
   I saw someone under my kitchen table
   talkin to my old tom cat
   they was talkin bout some hockey
   the cat was talkin back
   along about then everything went black

   Was'nt that a party

   Maybe just a memory
   playin tricks on me
   but I think I saw my buddy
   cuttin down my neighbors tree

   (chorus)

   Curly Joe and Tommy
   well they went a little far
   they were sittin in the back seat
   blowin on the siren
   in someones police car
   so you say you run
   it was all in fun
   little bitty track meet
   down on main street
   was just to see if the cops could run
   they run as if to see you
   in an alcaholic pace
   I sure could use those pearly gates
   to recover from the party

   (chorus)

   (chorus)

   was'nt that a party
   was'nt that a party
   was'nt that a party
   was'nt that a party
   was'nt that a party

   uum what a party---Lyrics submitted by John D. Smeby.
