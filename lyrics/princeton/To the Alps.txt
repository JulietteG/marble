A straight course to the alps
A lot of love that I'm livin' without 
A straight course to the alps
A lot of love that I'm livin' without
If I go I'm livin' without
If I go I'm livin' without your love
If I go I'm livin' without
If I go I'm livin' without your life
(x2)

And in this weather, whatcha waitin' for?
And there's no reasons just to feel it more
(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Cohen.
