Sometimes I get my head in a dilly,
feeling so lost, ticking you off now boy
you know me well said, I'm that kind of
feeling that kinds of soft, that kind of silly.

But when I'm doubt I open my mouth
 and words come out, words come out like.

Baby there's a shark in the water, theres
something underneath my bed oh, please
believe I said. Baby there a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon, better be soon

High in the sky the song that Im singing
a sweet little lie a cry wolf cry. Rather have you lie
that's why I'm bringing some tricks up my sleeve 
for noticing me 

Oh yeah,

I wouldnt  cause you any harm, 
I just want you in my arms
I cant, I cant help myself

Baby there's a shark in the water, theres
something underneath my bed oh, please
believe I said. Baby there a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon, better be soon.

Better be soon.

Right is right, rules are rules this more like
April fools, Im just winding you up, oh

Jack be nimble, jack be quick. Please
Dont make to much of it, it ain't that 
Serious oh ohh ohhhh


Baby there's a shark in the water, theres
something underneath my bed oh, please
believe I said. Baby there a shark in the water (x3)
I caught them barking at the moon, I caught them barking at the moon, 
better be soon.---Lyrics submitted by Ania.
