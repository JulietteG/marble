Are you not the slightest bit confused?
Just the truth
The speed at which we move blends so well, 
It's too soon

Seperate yourself from what compells 
You to relinquish all
Push your weight on to me and die away
Stay away from me, stay away from me
Unless your gonna see, unless your gonna see me out

No I can't dance, lets a slower sound
To a song that's far less obvious
You're using me, do it slowly
Make it last until I have to go

Trust me when I say just a few more weeks,
Don't move
Resist temptation or do you see fair just juice

Seperate yourself from what compells 
You to relinquish all
Push your weight on to me and die away 
Stay away from me, stay away from me
Unless you gonna see, unless your gonna see me out

No I can't dance, lets a slower sound
To a song that's far less obvious 
If you're using me, do it slowly
Make it last until I have to go (x3)

Stay away from, stay away from, stay away from me 
Stay away from, stay away from, stay away from me
Stay away from, stay away from, stay away from me---Lyrics submitted by Hayley.
