No need to raise a hand. Ill sit 
as long as I can stand 
A pose is all I need to plan-- a pose 
is all I need 

If less is more, then pour to break. Ill wait 
to sleep and sleep to wake 
A move is all you need to make-- a move 
is all you need 

And it cant hurt, swallowing just a little pride 
No wishes well your eyes-- 
they are bone dry 
You know Id never spare a seed to grow 
knowing what a weed would start to show 
I never leave well enough alone 

Fresh paint to brace a smile-- a smile 
is hardly worth your while. It's simply not 
a welcome child-- it's simply not (oh well) 

Keep a grin to pin on whom youd like 
(Oh, splendor red as sin 
and wedding-white) 
Sorry only comes when folly goes 
and makes a habit out of 
leaving on the light 

Once more, to pry the mouth. A glass is all 
you ask about  
Ive half a mind to stain the walls 
and half a tongue to drink it down---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
