Best to post a guard upon the yard you take as yours 
I know the art, the drill, the door, and how 
to make a welcome sore 
It's sure to spill, and still it's warm 
from every hand that draped its form 

Laid a claim on a cold frontier 
and aren't you one to scoff and sneer 
I'll be a stone and a path to clear 
for every craft that gathers here 

Now, you see, I've built this garden, 
fallen 'long the way 
overgrown and poorly guarded 
Darling-- finish what you started 

May I suggest a jester clown 
to pick you up when ups are down 
I'll be the first to drag him 'round 
(He lives with me across the town) 

Charmed their way from out the cold 
to run their hands along the fold 
and I have seen the shadows roll 
across they eyes of every soul 
and linger 
long enough to pull 
a liar from his hiding hole 

No shame in scratching where 
we've picked them to the bone 
Four legs have made an easy chair, 
but two will see you home. If you 
were sorry when we made them share 
what wouldn't go around, 
it didn't show, though you were always 
loathe to give it sound 

And now you see, I've built this garden, 
fallen 'long the way 
overgrown and poorly guarded 
Darling, finish what you started---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
