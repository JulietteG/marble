Did you labor to pay for the lace 
you wore? 
One day, they will stop and stare no more 
So careful, a guard for a gaping door 
Where no fable will scrape its way to shore 

Do you know what they'll say 
when we're older-- 
when it's colder and harder 
to prove? 
No lover will ever come over 
to cradle your shoulder 
You and me both, we know the truth 

You're allowed to say 
what's on your mind 
Clever hands, they're not 
the feral kind, 
meant to run their courses 
in the yard-- they will never learn 
to play inside 

God forbid it has an end, or worse-- 
a rocky, rough descent 
faster than the getting in, and less 
forgiving 
going 
down 
familiar paths that you forgot 
(Your legs were shorter 
than you thought) 

You know what they'll say 
when we're older-- 
when it's colder and harder 
to prove? 
No lover will ever come over 
to cradle your shoulder 
You and me both, we know the truth---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
