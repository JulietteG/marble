You know Im almost sure I saw them creep up through the floor 
with their hands around a waist that had graced my doors 
but it was you and me and nothing more 

A better fare for the plate and to sate your bones 
Sure to share, sure to share but you can make it known 
theyve all but swallowed everything they own 

Youre here to claim a parting gift 
a waste to leave with what you started with 
Theres little that a weight will shift 
in anything your arms can lift 

Cut your teeth and youre a flag born waving 
Dare to speak, but Im a breath worth saving 

If theres a plan, then it's lost on me 
and they took a hand that they meant to keep 
What a pair and proud theyll be, 
to hold riches far as eyes, eyes can see 
Riches far as eyes can see 

Gave the gods quite a scare, and now theyll spare no stone 
til they cast off the glare from your waking throne 
and leave a shadow fallen where it shone 

An old friend came to call, and now we bear his grin 
And its never going to fall-- you see, hes always been 
so patient waiting for the lights to dim---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
