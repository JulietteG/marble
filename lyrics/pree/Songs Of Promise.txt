I've songs of promise for your tongue and ropes 
and ladders to the sun and heaven knows 
they'll come undone 

One day we'll drop our mourning clothes and build 
our fortunes on the snow and fashion 
statues made of gold 

It doesn't follow, the news I heard 
You kept them staring anywhere but down 
Am I the only thing that 
calls you, calls you? 
You've got'em swinging from every word 
you've thrown upon a ladder, high and proud 
Is that the only thing that calls you, calls you, calls you, calls 
you, calls you, calls you, calls you, calls you? 

We plot our courses from a grave and pick 
the flowers where we lay and heaven 
knows they're out of place 

We're only left to stop and stare 
at faces old and faces new 
It must be something in the air 
that makes them look the way they do 

We'll watch them limp into a run 
Let's you and i have all the fun 
We'll drive them out before we're done, we're done, we're done, we're 
done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done 

Oh, I've seen their shape before 
It's fitting that they take a quiet form 
I'm not the only thing that calls you, calls you 
And nothing draws the blood-- no, draws the blood 
so like a half-closed door, 
and it's the only thing that calls you, calls you, calls you, calls 
you, calls you, calls you, calls you, calls you---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
