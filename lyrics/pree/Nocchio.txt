We will see, if they are 
who they say they are 
Aim, aim to please, if they are 
who they say they are 
Hands meet the knees, if you can't 
speak to save your heart 
from believing we've labored to keep it so 
dark and still, unassuming, 
a sleight of the eyes 
laying into a knot in a pine 
growing colder the moment 
I pulled it aside, 
well arranged in a fold they'll never find 

It rang as clear as day, but they'll never see the house in the light 
Sure as not they came, happy craning for the house in the light 

What you hold, I'm afraid 
it will tether you down 
don't you know, we can swim 
where the others have drowned? 
Better spoken what struggles to not 
make a sound 
are you broken in places 
you've yet to have found? 

Well, she put forth a scream and a like-minded child 
as he took to the corners and kept 
busy cracking his lips in the shape of a smile, 
quiet watching whenever they slept 

It rang as clear as day, but they'll never see the house in the light 
Sure as not they came, happy craning for the house in the light 

Come to knots, and I've caught 
every word they've been saying 
Clever pots, they let on 
that our gardens were failing 
and strung from the boards 
where no welcome is waiting 
Only worth what I've wrought, and it's all 
for the taking 

And I've searched for a song that you can't 
sing alone, steady-traveling moth (for a flame), 
meant to carry the weight of our faltering bones 
Heaven knows if we'd greet it, if it came. 

It's harder still to place 
anything that's only seen in the passing, 
and you'll never taste sweet 
letters for a chain, hanging quiet 
deaf and dumb to the asking, 
a name for a face 
I used to call it mine 
but as of late, 
it's up and gone too many times, 
gone too many times 
strangled on a vine, fit for leaving bare 
but they'll never mind, 
they'll never mind---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
