My cell phone screen is cracked
Vodka bottles in my bath
I kiss better when I'm drunk
Sex is best when you're not in love
Though we've only met
I want to wake up in your bed
Scars are beautiful to me
A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds

On with the show the world is our set
I'll play Montague, you'll be Capulet
There's no tragedy tonight we are alive

Fall into these arms
And spend the night na na na na
With a stranger like me
Fall into these arms
And spend the night na na na na
With a stranger like me

Let's steal a police car
Like the rock stars we are
We can drive around
With the head lights off when the sun goes does
No one needs to know
How far that we go
We'll share a cigarette
And we'll blow smoke rings 'til we have a halo

On with the show we so persevere
I'll be your Lancelot Guinevere
There's no turning back tonight we feel alive

Fall into these arms
And spend the night na na na na
With a stranger like me
Fall into these arms
And spend the night na na na na
With a stranger like me
(In my arms)---Lyrics submitted by Diana Lopez.
