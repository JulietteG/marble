Should I believe in the world momma 
Should I give up and hide or should I stay and fight 
Should I believe in the rules momma 
Tell me if I should run or learn to shoot a gun 
I don't know what to believe momma 
Yeah I'm down on my knees I'm begging please 
It's getting harder to see momma 
Give me something to believe believe believe in 

Tonight you're perfect 
I wanna fall in love with stars in your eyes 
Tonight you're perfect 
I wanna fall in love but only for the night 
Only for the night 
I feel perfect too! 

You won't believe what I've seen momma 
There's a fire inside there's a storm on the rise 
It's in the air that we breathe momma 
Can I speak out my mind in these changing times? 
Give me a reason to be momma 
Cause I'm down on my knees I'm begging please 
Help me back on my feet momma 
Cause I need someone to believe believe believe in 

Tonight you're perfect 
I wanna fall in love with stars in your eyes 
Tonight you're perfect 
I wanna fall in love but only for the night 
Only for the night 
I feel perfect too!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
