(Showtek & Justin Prime feat. Matthew Koma)

You and I have lost our minds
I dont even know which thoughts are mine
Youre projected by a fear inside
But I can see the light

Say when youre ready to escape
Ill be your shelter from the rain
Ill pull you under me and we can make the ground shake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake

Show us what you got when the motherfu2q!ng beat drops

Make the, make the ground shake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake

You and I are honesty
A sedated type-A intensity
When its me against you
And its you against me
Its so hard to breathe

Say when youre ready to escape
Ill be your shelter from the rain
Ill pull you under me and we can make the ground shake
Like an earthquake

Say when youre ready to escape
Ill be your shelter from the rain
Ill pull you under me and we can make the ground shake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake

Show us what you got when the motherfu2q!ng beat drops

Make the, make the ground shake
Like an earthquake
Like an earthquake---
