Never thought it would be me,
living in a shattered dream.
How could this be,the end for me?

What I wouldn't give to have,
a life to live,a day to plan.
Instead I'll be forever seventeen.

Could of lived out every dream.
I could of been most,anything.


                 *Chorus*

Someone wake me up.I
haven't lived yet. I'm only
seventeen. God did you
forget,I'm just a baby. And
I don't wanna be.Forever
seventeen. Oh,no.

I'll never have a bed to make,
a test to take,a Summer day.
I'll always be forever seventeen.

Could of had a family,if things
had worked out differently.
Instead I'll be,forever seventeen.

Could of had just one more day.
A chance to learn from my mistakes.
Oh.


                   *Chorus*

Can someone wake me up.
I haven't lived yet. I'm only
seventeen. God did you
forget,I'm just a baby. And
I don't wanna be. Oh,no.
Forever seventeen.

In a matter of a moment,
life fell before my eyes.
Now I'm looking at the meaning
of,the miracle of life.

Where were we going without
even knowing the answer deep
inside.

Forever seventeen.

So don't give up,you haven't 
lived yet. Your only seventeen.
And God did not forget,your
just a baby.---Lyrics submitted by Sukey.
