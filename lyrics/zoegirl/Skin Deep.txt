sometimes i feel lost
in a sea of insecurity, that rages inside of me
so terribly caught
and the waves of self-rejection make me question my ability.

but there's a fire that always burns
and there's a voice inside, and all it wants is to be heard.

*chorus
'cause beyond skin deep, there's so much more to see
my hopes my dreams, designed with destiny
i was fashioned with passion, a burning desire 
to know the one who made me more, He made me more than skin deep.
cause i am more, i am more, than skin deep 
so much more

it's so hard to change
when we are captive to ourselves; always thirsty for something else
but free or enslaved; we are sons, we are daughters. 
called out by the Father's name

so take the fire and let it burn
unleash the voice inside cause everyone needs to be heard.

*chorus #2
beyond skin deep, there's so much more to see
our hopes our dreams, designed with destiny
we were fashioned with passion, a burning desire
to know the one who made us more, He made us more than skin deep
cause we are more, we are more, than skin deep
so much more

we are more than the future
we are more than the past
we were made to bring glory
give us souls that will last
we are than our bodies
we are more than the grave
we were bought by His blood
and from ourselves we've been saved

*chorus #2

we are more than the future
we are more than the past
we were made to bring glory
give us souls that will last.---Lyrics submitted by Meghan.
