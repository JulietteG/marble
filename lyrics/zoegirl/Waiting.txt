Ooh...

You've come this far by yourself
Faced the world on your own
No one heard your cries for help
You thought you were all alone
I've got a different story to tell you
'Cause I've been there before
I know you feel so much
But there is so much more

You could wait
But there may not be tomorrow
Can you take
A minute just to listen and to let it go

This is the time
This is the place
This is the love
That was given to us by grace
Don't turn away
Today is the day
Open up your heart
His love is waiting, waiting

(Forever waiting)

Now, I know that you have so many questions
Deep down you're wondering
But when you're driven by doubt
You question everything
And I know that you've been so disappointed
But you are not here alone
So let me show you that you don't have to be on your own, anymore

(No)

You could wait
But there may not tomorrow
Can you take
A minute just to listen gotta let it go

This is the time
This is the place
This is the love
That was given to us by grace
Don't turn away
Today is the day
Open up your heart
His love is waiting, waiting
(repeat twice)

(He's waiting He's waiting)
He's reaching out to you with open arms
(So patienly waiting)
So open up your mind
And open up you heart
(He's Waiting, He's waiting)
All it takes is just a spark
(Oh yeah)
You know he'll bring a way
A brand new day

He's waiting

This is the time
This is the place
This is the love
That was given to us by grace
Dont turn away
Today is the day
Open up your heart
His love is waiting, waiting

Waiting He's waiting
So patiently waiting [repeat]

He is love
He is love---
