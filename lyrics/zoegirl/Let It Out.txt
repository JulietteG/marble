come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out

this life we lead is never boring
new things come with every morning
everyday is a second chance
the start of a divine romance
take a breath and jump right in

*chorus
let it out, tell the world what you're about
let 'em hear your screams, your shouts (out loud)
dont hold back, dont let down
it's all or nothing now

something's changing deep inside me
i'm letting go of all i'm hiding
i'm in over my head, but i'm not afraid 
to dive in deep and make some waves

*chorus, 2x

no type of inquisition (no type of inquisition)
could ever make me change (could make me change my position)
i've told you before, tell me to be quiet and ill shout some more.

*chorus 2x---Lyrics submitted by Meghan.
