Labrinth come in
Labrinth come in
(Yeah)
Labrinth come in

Ladies and gentlemen
This is something they call
A ground breaker [...breaker, breaker, breaker]
So let me first apologise
To the shirts and the ties
For your make up [...make up, make up, make up]
Cause I'll make you ugly
As soon as it drops
We're on a rampage
Bottles popping off
Before you know it
There's rubble and dust
'Cause we'll be fucking it up
Somebody say... (you better run)

Yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

Say yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

'Cause we throw bombs on it
Throw bombs on it
Just smash something
Yeah, mosh for me
(Hey) Yeah

We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go we go

Ladies and gentlemen
What you're about to witness
Is no illusion
And now
We got the bass banging
From here to buckingham palace
They're all moving
Hey Simon
We're fucking them up
Turning 'em psycho
Everybody rock
Let's bring the house down
To rubble and dust
'Cause we'll be fucking it up

Somebody say... (you better run)

Yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

Say yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

'Cause we throw bombs on it (yeah)
Throw bombs on it (yeah)
Just smash something
Yeah, mosh for me (aha)

Yeah (let's go)

We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go we go

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

'Cause we throw bombs on it
Throw bombs on it
Just smash something
Yes, mosh for me
Hey yes

We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go we go

Ey yo Labrinth
This one's feeling feeling
Like a straight ten on the Richter scale
You know?

Yeah

Fire, fire! We about to set this place on fire
Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends
One nighters make them (aahh) c'minor
If I want christian or kurt geiger
I just phone up their designer
Doing all nighters no days off
Grey hairs and a little bit of weight loss
I predict (riots)
I predict (chaos)
I predict (people)
I predict (AAHHH)
Disturbing London got the whole city panicking I'll be
Nostradamus this my ni ni ni ni (Labrinth)

Yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

Say yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

'Cause we throw bombs on it (yeah)
Throw bombs on it (yeah)
Just smash something
Yeah, mosh for me

(Hey) Yeah

We can make an earthquake up in here
So here we go we go
