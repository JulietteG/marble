Put my money where my mouth is
And laid my cards
I'mma go out fighting
And leave my scars
I don't know about tomorrow
But I know I've got heart
Put my feet right on the margin
And I just might hit the bottom
Throw my hands out on the breeze
And let it be

Let it be
Let it be
Let it

Baby, this is Russian roulette
And it ain't my gun
Hallelujah, I ain't dead yet
And I'm still going strong, oh oh oh
I don't know about tomorrow
But I'm falling down
They say losers are forgotten
And I just might hit the bottom
But we all gotta take the lead
And let it be

Let it be
Let it be
Just let it be
Let it be
Just let it be

It's all been said and done
Oh, I've done and said it all
Walking home
I think it's time to catch that train
I don't know where it starts
And I don't know where it ends
I guess that's the name of the game
Oh oh oh

Got to let it go, yeah
I've got to let it go, yeah
Ooh, let it be
Oh no, oh no, let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be

Come on now, come on now
When you're holding on to your last breath
When you're looking for a way out
Ooh, let it be
Let it be!
Let it be!
Let it be!
Just let it be!---
