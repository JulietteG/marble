One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

I love Tokyo
I've never been
See I'm looking for somewhere that my journey could begin
And now maybe Cairo
Guten Tag Berlin
But I know cause I ain't leaving Paris without a French kiss
We're on a trip around the world
Let's make it wonderful

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

Hey Ibiza
Give me the groove
I'ma party till I black out
And wake up in Cancun
If I sleep in Seattle
Plan the next move
I'll be having a ball over in Ayia Napa too
Now we're on a trip around the world
Let's make it wonderful

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go

New York City, London Town
There's a moment somewhere out there
You'll never know, what's waiting outside your window

I'm taking off
I'm taking off
Lifting me up

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
