She is standing on the banks of the levee
She knows it won't keep her dry
I don't worry she's so heavy
Bring on down the whole damn sky

Helpless helpless 
Fire in the sea
Come and stay
Down here with me

Your mama's standing on the banks of the river
Staring out over the other side
Her feet start to dancing when she sees your brother
She's gonna waltz across the whole damn sky

How lonely lonely
Can someone be?
Come and lay
Down here with me

Rain won't come
Then it won't ever go
The river is a rock
And the river rolls, the river rolls

We are rowing in a boat on the river
Sometimes it feels like a long goodbye
I won't worry she's a swimmer
I don't care about the other side

Holy holy
Fire in the sea
Silver dawn you here with me
Silver dawn you here with me---Lyrics submitted by Steve Ralston.
