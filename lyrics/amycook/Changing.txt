We are flying past the redwoods
Down the 101 with the golden sun
Past the ocean and the embers
Will you remember me in the California weeds?

If it's time for changing I don't mind
Honey everything's changing all the time

Can I walk you home it's a cool night?
But do you want to go somewhere I can't follow?
Through the spring fears and decembers
Will you remember me when my gold turns to green?

If it's time for changing I don't mind
Honey everything's changing all the time

Let's go fly across the ocean
We'll go on a run with the silver sun
I been bent but I'll never break
It's too hard to fake, then we will stay the same

If it's time for changing I don't mind
Honey everything's changing all the time

If it's time for changing that's just fine
Honey everything's changing all the time

All the time
All the time
All the time---Lyrics submitted by Steve Ralston.
