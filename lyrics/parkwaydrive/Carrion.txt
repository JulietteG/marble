Carrion
In a moment Im lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out

Dead eyes speak in volumes
But our lips refuse to move
Could this ever be the last time
The final time that we see this through?
Give me the strength to return
Return the breath youve stolen
Give me the means to reset
Reset!
Her heart Ive broken again
Reflection built upon sorrow
Were walking the darkest roads within chest carved with regret

In a moment Im lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out

Oh!
From the inside out
The inside out

Weve been running blind
Now were falling through the cracks
Were left running 
We are running blind
Now were falling 
Falling through the cracks
Back to the world of the dead
Her shining eyes
Her shining eyes mark our return 
Back to the world of the dead

In a moment Im lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away 
Tear me apart from the inside out

My love I left
My heart I left
With a promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
