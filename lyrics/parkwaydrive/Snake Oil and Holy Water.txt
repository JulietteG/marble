You want a piece of my mind, there is no peace to find
This is all of your doubt repaid in kind
I am alone in crowded rooms, I am a ghost in forgotten tombs
Widow maker, youre no company to keep

Cause you can fool some people, sometimes
But you cant fool the world for the rest of your life
You can fool some people, sometimes
But you cant fool the world

Nobody notices, nobody cares
The curtain falls to no one, no where
Nobody notices, nobody cares
As the curtain falls

Soulless, spineless
Cut from the beggars cloth
You fill your skull with their shit til it runs from your mouth
Heartless, carcass
Ive seen more life in dead mens eyes, 
Ive heard more truths alone with the night

And Id rather believe in nothing than believe in a fucking lie
Id sooner fail one thousand times than regret I never tried

Cause you can fool some people, sometimes
But you cant fool the world for the rest of your life
You can fool some people, sometimes
But you cant fool the world

You cant fool us all
You howl at the world, but speak a dead language
Youre selling your soul, but no one is buying
You pray to your gods of fashion and industry
Heads in the clouds, but you live on your fucking knees

Nobody notices, nobody cares
The curtain falls to no one, no where
Nobody notices, nobody cares
As the curtain fucking falls

Soulless, spineless
Cut from the beggars cloth
You fill your skull with their shit til it runs from 
your mouth
Heartless, carcass
Ive seen more life in dead mens eyes, 
Ive heard more truths alone with the night

No peace to find---Lyrics submitted by Tanya.
