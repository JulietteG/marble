This soul was born for battle
My heart was built for war
These eyes see through the lies
Filled with disgust
Strip back the utopian rhetoric
And you'll find a sickness at the core
A septic carcass rotting out
Filled with disgust
We are the dead
Empty lives, empty heads
Guilty is as guilty fucking does
Filled with disgust
All we have to believe are the lies that they feed us
All we have to choose is the right to obey
Pray this time will be our mark on history
When the shadow games and agendas
Are wiped the fuck away
There is no such thing as different shades of truth
It'a black or white, do or die
Filled with disgust
You tie your noose with your lies but the world keeps turning
"Swing low" we cry but the world keeps turning
Turning without you
It keeps turning without you
'Cause all we have to believe
are the lies that they feed us
Born for battle
All we have to choose is the right to obey
Built for war
This was born for battle
My heart was built for war
Swing motherfuckers
End it
Built for war
Built for fucking war---Lyrics submitted by Tanya.
