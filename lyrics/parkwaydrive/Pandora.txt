The day lights gone
The empty streets echo our past 
and the days that once were so beautiful
so beautiful
Before now
Before us
So, save yourself

Cause all dreams are gone
And all hope has faded
And as the sunlight fails I watch this world 
slip away
And we smiled as we betrayed ourselves
And a clear sky is only a distant memory
Our worst intentions carried away on the evening breathe
Everything we lived for draws our final thought around our necks

Your faces lies still
I cant see your breath and its freezing, my blood until the end
Your faces lies still
I cant see your breath and its freezing, my blood until the end

One more time 
one more line

What is this hell
Reminisce to the beginning of everything
But The irony alone would kill me
Ten thousand hearts set to silence for the choice of one
End it all with the touch of a switch and, I can see our lives burn before my eyes

Cause all dreams are gone
And all hope has faded
And as sunlight fails I watch this world 
slip away
Your face lies still
I cant see your breath and its freezing, my blood until the end
Your face lies still
I cant see your breath and its freezing, my blood until the end

Ten thousand hearts set to silence for the choice of one
End it all with the touch of a switch and I can see our lives 
burn

I can see our lives
I can see our lives burn
I can see our lives
I can see our lives burn

Your face lies still
I cant see your breath and its freezing my blood until the end
As we just let it slip away---Lyrics submitted by Zac.
