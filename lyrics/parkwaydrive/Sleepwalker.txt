Oh
Consumed!
Do I feel the rage?
Growing inside me, A fear I cant contain.
At war with an enemy, Who does not rest, Who will never relent.
This city, These lifeless catacombs Our tombs they have become.
Buried alive and burned, Never to return.(To return)
Straight to the masses,Trapped between by vicious minds?
I let them tear, Tear away everything inside.

Slip away; from humanity, [Phantom] my identity, Sacrifice my integrity.

Yeah!!!
Just bodies through the teeth of the [combine]x2
Yeah!

At war, With an enemy, Who does not rest, who will never relent.
At war, With an enemy, Who does not rest who will never
Sleep walk our lives away, In search of shallow graves.
Sleep walk our live away.
Lost souls!

[Lost!]

Just bodies through the teeth of the [combine]x3
Just bodies through the teeth.

Oh!!!

Consumed I feel the rage,
Growing inside me,
I will not contain,
And I have got to question every truth I know.

[Not one more scab!]

In the name of progress,
In the name of blind ambition.

[Not one more scar!]

In the name of progress,
In the name of blind ambition.

How the fuck am I supposed to feel,
When everything I know,
Has broken at my feet?---Lyrics submitted by CHRISTIAN.
