Make it rain
To rinse me out
In the cold, I die
In the spring, I sprout

My fire is wild
My rage is deep
One black eye
Busted teeth

Feel my fury!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
You really light me up!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Feel my fury!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
You really light me up!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh

Feel my pulse
My heart beats
So I hold it back
But the cancer's deep

Feel my fury!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
You really light me up
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Feel my fury!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
You really light me up!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh

And when you lied before
You broke our tie before
And then I tapped into a feeling that I could not ignore

And when you lied before
You broke our tie before
And then I tapped into a feeling that I could not ignore

Feel my fury!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
You really light me up!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Feel my fury!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh
You really light me up!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh

Fury, oh fury don't you misguide me
I need my wits to set me free
Oh fury, oh fury don't you misguide me
I need my wits to set me free---Lyrics submitted by jfurg.
