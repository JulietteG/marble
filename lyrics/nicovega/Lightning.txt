Oh, what have you done? 
My body changes in your presence 
Like some electric charge 
Unbound in static on the pavement. 
I've been wasted by tasmanian devils that tore right through me. 
I've been dead like a dried up desert of thorns, that dig into me. When your body is next to mine like it has been before 
Our pheromones fight it out and no one is keeping score. 

Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 
Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 

Oh, what will it take? For me to have you, where I want you. 
Like so, on a bed of faith and we will manage like we have to. 
I've been lost in a backwood forrest of failures and plastic money. I've been awake in a dream-like state of a coma until you show me. 

Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 
Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 

Uh-oh uh-oh
Uh-oh uh-oh
Oooooh
Uh-oh uh-oh
Baby
Uh-oh uh-oh
Oooooh
Uh-oh uh-oh
Baby
Uh-oh uh-oh
Oooooh
Uh-oh uh-oh
Baby

Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 
Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 

Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking. 
Kiss me baby like you mean it. 
Electri-fy me like lightnin' lightnin' striking.---Lyrics submitted by Mojati Catywomp.
