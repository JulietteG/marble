I'm on the other side of things
You know I'm on the other side of things 
And I can't be laughing when you look at me 
Cause your operating out of jealousy

(Chorus)

Well I'm not gonna hear anything you say
I'll listen but I won't let it in my way
..up above 
I'm looking at the heavy ground
I can feel it, but it wont let it drag me down 
Overtime you can kill me 
But I'll resurrect so...NANANANANANA 
You're never gonna thrill me 
But you can kiss my ass so NANANANANA 
Woeoooh You're bringing me down 
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! 
Woeooh you're bringing me down 
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! 

(End Chorus)

Gravity is a parallel on words 
And overtime it will slowly start to hurt 
Ya even though it dont feel like anything 
It aint somthing you can fix with a diamond ring 

(Chorus)

I'm not gonna hear anything you say 
I'll listen but I wont let it in my way 
Up above I'm looking at the heavy grounds 
 I can feel it but it wont let it drag me down 

(End Chorus) 

Don't prostitute yourself 
You're selling yourself out 
You're a better man than that
...and time will show you

Woeoooh You're bringing me down 
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! 
Woeoooh you're bringing me down 
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! 
Woeoooh You're bringing me down 
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! 
Woeoooh you're bringing me down 
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!---Lyrics submitted by skullz.
