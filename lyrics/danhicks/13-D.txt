I count two and two, and my answer's five, what's the matter there?
If my head's in love, and I can't count right, well, I don't care.
For The Little That I'm With Her, and I'm with her all the time, my little concubine,
She's in love, and she does a lotta livin' and she's awful fine

You can look from the bottom, and work on up, you'll see what I'm talking of.
She's a very boss mover when she moves her stuff, you know why I'm in love.
It's a question of keeping the guys from her, but I know she ain't got eyes.
Her eyes are only meant for me, and that she can't disguise.
Her eyes are mostly meant for me, would I be tellin' you lies?

What is it when when she says when all the guys around her, all she wants is me.
She's a Pork Chop Dinner with a Big Baked Potato and a Side of Peas.
She's Up, She's Loose, She's Awful Slack, She's Ball In The Jack.
She's Right On, She's Ridin' That Comet, She's As Hip As That.

No Wonder That I Can't Count Right, My Head's Too Filled With Love.
I'll Probably Be Late for Work Tomorrow, She Sure is Lookin' Tough.
Even the Girls are Clockin' Her, But I Know She Ain't Got Eyes.
Her Eyes are only meant for me, and that she can't disguise.
Her Eyes are mostly meant for me, would I be tellin' you lies?

She Rides Up In Her Red Wagon';
She's A Stone's Throw From My Place;
She Slides Up To My Door.
All The Neighbors Are Watchin';
They've Been There for Days
To Catch a Glimpse or More.
To Catch A Glimpse Or More Before They See Me Close The Door.
I Won't Be Lovin' Her With No Door Open, That's For Sure.

I could-a be a-gamblin' and I couldn't give a damn, and I roll the dice.
(Seven Come Eleven!)
Start Countin' My Points from my head's on somethin' that is awful nice
A little one on one is the only combination that agrees with me.
There ain't a guy that wouldn't like to be in my shoes,
There ain't a guy that wouldn't wanna be in my shoes,
There ain't a guy that wouldn't wanna be in my shoes,
But I Wear A 13-D!

And With Those Shoes, I'm On The Floor, My Dancin' Partner's Alone,
The Way She's Lookin' Don't Matter To Me, But the Band is Raisin' The Song.
She's Motivin' Herself On Love, She's Cookin' with Her Eyes.
But Her Eyes are only meant for me, and that she can't disguise.
Her Eyes are mostly meant for me, would I be tellin' you lies?

She's Got Me Tellin' The Truth,
But I Don't Mind At All.
It Comes On Naturally.
You Better Make Love,
You Better Believe Me,
It's Been Such A Ball,
She's Quite A Site To See.
She's Quite A Site to See,
But She's Seen Mostly With Me.
She's Seen Mostly With Me,
But That's The Way That Things Should Be.---Lyrics submitted by Mike.
