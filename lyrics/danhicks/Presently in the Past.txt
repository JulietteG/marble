Presently In The Past                                          
By Dan Hicks & the Hot Licks featuring  Naomi Ruth Eisenberg

If I should ever yearn
Its just to once return
To a love, that I had, many years before. 

But now in deep concern
I, find it hard to learn
(spoken) To except, things that arent, ...(sing)  anymore.

CHORUS

One year, two years, three years, four
Why cant I forget what, went before?
       Five years six years, seven years, eight.
Change my love, to deepest hate.

For now in deep concern,
I find it hard to learn
(spoken)  To except,things that arent  (sing)  anymore.

MmmmmmMmmmmmMmmMmmMmmMmm
MmmmmmMmmmmmMmmMmmMmmMmm
MmmmmmMmmmmmMmmMmmMmmMmm
MmmmmmMmmMmmMmmMmm
