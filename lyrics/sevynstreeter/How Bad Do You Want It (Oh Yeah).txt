Oh yeah...

World goes round
Life I chose
What comes next
I never really know
A million miles
Left to go
The guns go pow
But I'm ready for the war

Cause I'll never run away
From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention
To whoever tell me no
I'll take your crown
Take your town
Better stay ready
Better stay ready
If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin round
Oh yeah
Did you give your everything
You better give your everything
Cause if you want to ride with me
Oh yeah
Make me come alive baby
Oh yeah
So if you want to ride with me
Oh yeah
So if you want to ride with me

Show me
How bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you want it

Coming for it all
Going for the gold
Hot behind the wheel
I'll never lose control
Sun go down
Night unfold
Run free and wild
Do anything I want

Better show me now
Before your time run out
Better show me
Before your time run out---
