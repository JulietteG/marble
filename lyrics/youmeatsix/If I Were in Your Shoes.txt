There's something you don't know.
I've walked you off to keep you on you're toes.
There's something you did know.
I've grown some bones, so I can walk you off.

Tonight, tonight.
And everything alright tonight, tonight

If I were in your shoes, I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you.
If I were in your room, using just my eyes I would tell you.
And I would tell you.

There's something you didn't know, you've got your teeth in me and it hurts.
And I'm a lie away from saying what I really think.
This is the bottom of the bottle saying swim or sink.
And you don't even need me now.

Tonight, tonight.
And everything's alright tonight, tonight.

If I were in your shoes, I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you.
If I were in your room, using just my eyes, using just my eyes.
And I would tell you.

{Guitar solo}

(Aaaaaah)
If I were in your shoes, I'd run a thousand miles just to tell you.
If I were in your room, using just my eyes I would tell you.
If I were in your shoes, in your shoes, in your....

And I'm a lie away from saying what I really think.
This is the bottom of the bottle saying swim or sink.
And you don't even need me now.---Lyrics submitted by Tanisha.
