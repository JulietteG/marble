I guess now's a good time to tell the truth.
The pedigree I carry will swallow you.
But I am not what you are, I'm flawless in every way.
Birds eye view, and I'm watchin' you.

Sad, sad sight before the sore, sore eyes and a headache for the weakness of minds.
You've got the boys, the boys all tongue tied. But I know you're wasting their time.
Go.
Go.

You can be the ghost in my hall.
You can be the smile I don't want.
I will be the fly on your wall.
(Whoooaaaah)
You will be the distance in between.
You can be everything I need.
You will be the girl I don't call.

And oh, just imagine what I thought when I opened up that door.
It was a million thing to one.
And oh, just imagine what they'll think when they see me lead you North.
How they'll be losing sleep.
You're wrong.
Wrong.

You can be the ghost in my hall.
You can be the smile I don't want.
I will be the fly on your wall.
(Whoooaaaah)
You will be the distance in between.
You can be everything I need.
You will be the girl I don't call.

It's so wrong. (So wrong.)
It's so wrong.

You can be the ghost in my hall.
You can be the smile I don't want.
I will be the fly on your....

You can be the ghost in my hall.
You can be the smile I don't want.
I will be the fly on your wall.
(Whoooaaaah)
You will be the distance in between.
You can be everything I need.
You will be the girl I don't call.

Jealous minds think alike, but you're a damn damn tie wasting all my time.
You are in love.
Jealous minds think alike, but you're a dent in time wasting all my time.
You are in love.

(I didn't know if he sang: 'but you're a dent in time' or 'but you're a damn damn tie'.....So just pick one of those :P)---Lyrics submitted by Tanisha.
