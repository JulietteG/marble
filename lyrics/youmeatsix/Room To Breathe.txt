I feel a little lost in this world
I try a little noise and choke
I've honestly never felt this alone
Oh, I just need someone

I need a little room to breathe
You're making this harder for me
When all I need is to be set free
I need a little time to think
And if you ever really loved me
Then all I need is a little room to breathe

I've been through and seen a lot
Left at the bottom and the top
We're on borrowed time, but time isn't enough
I'm just trying to be the best man I can be
When I fall down, it's just me and the ground
I am no king, I have no throne

I need a little room to breathe
You're making this harder for me
When all I need is to be set free
I need a little time to think
And if you ever really loved me
Then all I need is a little room to breathe
Room to breathe
Ooohh ooohh 

I need a little room to breathe
You're making this harder for me
When all I need is to be set free
I need a little time to think
And if you ever really loved me
Then all I need is a little room to breathe---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
