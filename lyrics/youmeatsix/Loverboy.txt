Hell had you by the throat 
you never got to heaven 
but you got real close
your past has you
in the choke hold

but you deserve it,
from what I've been told 
call my bluff
say what you want
i'm looking down at you
from the top

i beg for attention
in small doses 
leave the scene
smelling of dead roses 

Loverboy
you played us up like toys
don't you feel bad,
don't you feel bad
filled with repent 

this is your night
with arms wide open
i'm the option 
you shouldn't have chosen 

scared of the dark 
the doors wide open 
this is the night
you'll regret in the morning

Loverboy
you played us up like toys
don't you feel bad
don't you feel bad 
filled with repent 

if given the choice 
would you do it again?
of course i would
of course i should
well i'm your friend 
friends with benefits 

*instrumental break*

Loverboy
you played us up like toys
don't you feel bad 
don't you feel bad
filled with repent 

if given the choice 
would you do it again?
of course i would
of course i should
well i'm your friend 
friends with benefits---Lyrics submitted by stacey.
