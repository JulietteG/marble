Let's forget what was said and give pain a rain check
Like before, when we stood tall over our callous sins
See, all of your demons became my demons
On your front line I fought
But we're oceans away, our glory days, went up, went up in flames

And I, don't remember a thing
And I, won't remember a thing

We're getting close to an end now
That was never in doubt
We used to talk for hours but you don't hear my voice now

Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend
Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend

Ain't it a shame that, we let life change us
We broke our promises
Cut to the chase , don't keep me waiting
On why these good times fled

And I, don't remember a thing.
And I, won't remember a thing.

We're getting close to an end now
That was never in doubt
We used to talk for hours
You don't hear my voice now

Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend
Can we forgive and forget
If only for the weekend---
