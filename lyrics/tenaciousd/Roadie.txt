Well it's 3 pm time to lug the gear got to get it on the stage,
My muscles flex my fuckin' sweat will save the day,
When I check the mic I fucka check the mic,
I fucka checka checka 1,2,3 I plug it in and make it sound as good as can b
Cause the rockers rock, but the roadies roll, 
Gotta take the mic cause I take control,
 gotta get that shit up on that fuckin' stage,
Cause a roadie knows what the roadie knows, 
And the roadie knows that he wears black clothes,
And he hides off in the shadows off the stage, 
Because the roadie, looks a thousand miles with his eyes,
And when the crowd roars, brings a teardrop to the roadies eyes,
Tears of pride,  because he brought you the show, 
But you will never know, he's changing the strings,
While hiding in the wings, no matter how hard, THE SHOW MUST GO ON,
Then a beautiful girl come to me she says hey can I sucka your dick,
I say yays, I am in love, 
Then she quickly say I sucked your dick now give me that backstage pass,
I do not want you roadie, I want KG's chode,
Im standing at the threshold of your dreams, 
Without me thered be no sound from those amps, 
Without me there'd be no lights on this stage,
But you don't applaud for me,
No, I am the roadie, lonesome warrior searching for a soul,
I am the roadie, I make the rock GO!!!
Roadie, Roadie, Roadie!!!!!!!---Lyrics submitted by brandon s.
