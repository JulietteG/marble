This is a song called "The History of Tenacious D",
And it's not just a list of bullshit we've done in the past,
It's a chronicling of our rise;
TO POWER!

We ride with kings on mighty steeds,
Across the Devil's Plain!
We've walked with Jesus and his cross,
He did not die in vain;
NO!

We've run with wolves, we climbed K2,
Even stopped a moving train.
We've traveled through space and time my friends,
To rock this house again!
ROCK!

We ride and we ride and we'll never subside,
We'll ride 'til the planets collide!
And if you say that we do not ride;
I'll tan your fucking hide!
RIDE!

Kyle's fingers be silver,
Jack's voice then be gold;
But lest you think we're vain.
We know you're all robots, and we don't care!
TENACIOUS D;
WE REIGN!

We rei-eign!
Supreme, Oh God!

Burrito Supreme!
And a Chicken Supreme!
And a Cutlass Supreme!

Supre-ee-eme, Yeah!
Go now Kyle, 1 2 3!
Supre-ee-eme!
Go now Kyle, 1 2 3!
Supre-ee-eme!
Go now Kyle, 1 2 3!

Burrito Supreme!
And a Chicken Supreme!
And a Cutlass Supreme!---Lyrics submitted by John.
