This is the greatest and best song in the world Tribute
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitch hikin' down a long and a lonesome road
All of a sudden there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your souls
Well me and kyle
We looked at eachother and we each said ok
And we played the first thing that came to our heads 
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world
Look in o my eyes and it's easy to see
That 1 and 1 make 2 
2 and 1 make 3 it was destiny
Once every hundred thousand years or so 
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow
Needless to say the beast was stunned 
Whip-crack went his whippy tail
And the beast was done
And he asked us (snort) be you angels
And we said nay we are but men
Rock
Ah ah ahhhh oohhh woah woahhh
This is not the greatest song in the world no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world no no
This is a tribute ohh
To the greatest song in the world all right 
It was the greatest song in the world all right
Yes it was the best.....
It was the greatest song in the world all right
............
And the peculiar thing is this my friendsthe song we sang on that fateful night, it didn't actually sound anything like this song
This is just a tribute
You gotta believe me
And I wish you were there
It's just a matter of oppinion---Lyrics submitted by Sydne.
