Last week, Kyle quit the band,
Now were back together, uh.
Misunderstanding, didnt understand.
It doesnt matter, now were back together again.
A-la la la la la.
Couldnt split up Kato and Nash. [thats true]
Couldnt split up Tango and Cash.
Thats also true!
This is our song of exultant joy because
We only came to kick some ass.
Rock the fuckin house and kick some ass.
What we gonna do with all the cash?
Smoke hash, and then we thrash.
Well throw a big ol bash yall.
And everyone is invited to the bash.
And everyone youre all invited to the bash!
Cmon Kyle, one time cmon!
