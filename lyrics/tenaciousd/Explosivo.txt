climb upon my faithful steed 
then we gonna ride, gonna smoke some weed
climb upon my big ass steed
and ride ride ride

whats the name of the song? Explosivo!
dont know what its about but its good to go
whats the name of my girlfriend i dont know
but she's built like the shit and shes good to go
go she's good to go she's good to go

we r fueled by satan 
yes we're schooled by satan
schooled by satan!
written those tasty rifts just as fast as we can
fueled by satan

we were the inventors of the cosmic astral code
we've come to blow u away we've come to blow your nose
we've come to fuckin blow
weve come to blow the show
WE'VE COME TO FUCKIN BLOW!
you know you know
heeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

whats the name of the song? Explosivo!
dont know what its about but its good to go
blahblalo... (crazy voices)
i am not one of you
i come from a distant time
i am know as the angel crusher
these picks that i give you were molded in satans cauldron
take these picks they're souvenirs
(crazy rip of the guitar)

Explosivo.---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
