This is the greatest and best song in the world,
Tribute
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon in the middle of the road
And he said
"Play the best song in the world or I'll eat your souls"
Well, me and Kyle, we looked at each other
And we each said, "Okay"
And we played the first thing that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the Sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow
Needless to say, the beast was stunned
Whip-crack went his whippet tail
And the beast was done
He asked us, "Be you angels?"
And we said, "Nay, we are but men"
Rock
This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no, no
This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest song in the world
All right, it was the greatest song in the world,
All right, it was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world
Allllllright!
Ti Tuga digga tu Gi Friba fligugibu Uh Fligugigbu Uh Di Ei Friba Du Gi Fligu fligugigugi Flilibili Ah
Oh Mama Lucifer
And the peculiar thing is this my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound
Anything like this song
This is just a tribute, you gotta believe me
And I wish you were there, just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck, good God, God lovin'
So surprised to find you can't stop it
All right, all right---Lyrics submitted by Akos.
