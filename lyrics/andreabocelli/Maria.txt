The most beautiful sound I ever heard:
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria..
All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria...

Maria!
I've just met a girl named Maria,
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same to me.
Maria!
I've just kissed a girl named Maria,
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be!
Maria!
Say it loud and there's music playing,
Say it soft and it's almost like praying.

Maria,
I'll never stop saying Maria!
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria...

Maria!
Say it loud and there's music playing,
Say it soft and it's almost like praying.

Maria,
I'll never stop saying Maria!
The most beautiful sound I ever heard.
Maria.---
