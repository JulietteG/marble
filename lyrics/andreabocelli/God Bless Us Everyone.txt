Come together one and all
In the giving spirit
Gifts abound here great and small
Joyously we feel it

Blessings sent us from above
Guide us on our way
We raise our voice as we rejoice
Bow our head and pray

A miracle has just begun
God bless us everyone

To the voices no one hears
We have come to find you
With your laughter and your tears
Goodness, hope and virtue

Father, mother, daughter, son
Each a treasure be
One candle's light dispels the night
Now our eyes can see

Burning brighter than the sun
God bless us everyone
A miracle has just begun
God bless us everyone

Come together one and all
In the giving spirit
Gifts abound here great and small
Joyously we feel it

Father, mother, daughter, son
Each a treasure be
One candle's light dispels the night
Now our eyes can see

Burning brighter than the sun
God bless us everyone
A miracle has just begun
God bless us everyone---
