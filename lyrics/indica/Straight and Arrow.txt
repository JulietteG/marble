Roads getting narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
little boys little boys little boys who became what they feared

Who would have thought that the ones who spoke of trust would come to betray us?
Who would have sought love from those who prayed for peace while sewing hatreds seed?
Who would have fought for a land where blood flows till it clots each river?
Who would have sons knowing all the orphans they would soon deliver? 

Kneel beside me, in this field of memory
Dont become those you fear; dont kill what youve been

When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
little boys little boys little boys who became what they feared

You should have known that the snakes were figments of (your) imagination 
You should have shown that the roads and gallows were your own creation

Sleep beside me, theres no time to worry
The sound that you fear it comes from your ear  

When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
little boys little boys little boys theres a choice
When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
little boys and their toys; little boys you became what you fear

Weep beside me, in this sea of memory
Dont you see what I see youre the men that you fear

When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Whats the point
When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
little boys little boys theres a choice theres a choice
When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
little boys little boys little boys dont become what you fear
