Used to have dreams to be someone
Never tried enough to be proud
just tossed them all around
And like a toy I played my way through life

I spent my days just living free
Tomorrow is just another day
You were always around
I never knew you helped me change my way...

Ah, if I knew what I know now
That once we turned our back on love
No looking back, no repeat
I wish I could go back, change 180

My love was your love, baby that's all we had
And it still holds a part of me deep down inside
You let me go, we closed that door
Ending every page of our story
Inside my pockets the memory remains
Every time I lay my finger on it I see your face
From that moment on I had found in myself
The last little piece of a dream

Whether I came all this way to be closer to something new
Or I stay going just to keep myself this far away from you

Ah, if only I knew back then and I could hold you again
nobody knows what the future holds
I wish I could go back, make it alright

Don't get me wrong I won't pretend that I'm strong
But I know I got to brush you off and keep moving on
'cause I'd never go and blame it on love
trying to embrace the memory
In my pockets lie everything you said
All the things you taught me runs around in my head
One thing that I...I never want to forget
Is a part of my body and soul

Wondering where you are now
Has life been treating you well?
Are you happier right now?
Do I ever even cross your mind?
Just like those old dreams that you once held so close 
All for you, for me, for us
(No looking back) I realized
that time of our lives is lost forever

My love was your love, baby that's all we had
And it still holds a part of me deep down inside
You let me go, we closed that door
Ending every page of our story
Inside my pockets the memory remains
Every time I lay my finger on it I see your face
From that moment on I had found in myself
The last little piece of a dream

Wondering where you are tonight
Watch the moon, looking over us from the sky---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
