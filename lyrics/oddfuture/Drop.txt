[Intro:] 
I know everyone has their own fucking version of this
but no one did it justice, so... here we go, uh

[Verse1:] 
Tell your bitch to stop compaining 'bout her achey tits,
her body is a temple I dont give a fuck im aethiest, make me stop, make me bitch, 
she mad because I taped this shit  and send the tape to ace and taco hopes to fucking bate to it,
master master pretty bitch bash a black and white bitch mixed like shes mooing chew blaster,
something sota like this shit,
I guess id kinda like my bitch if she wasnt a dyke motorcyclist with tyson lisp,
wolf gang on that drive without a license shit, 
on that take shake and meka necks and fucing slice throught shits,
oh how nice now you wanna say you like this shit because youre bruised up your neck's sliced and I aint icing shit,
show me a rapper my age saying nice as this and ill show you a faggot who say he hate barbara streisand flicks,
huh, me and berman swerving in this jeep,
im a nice guy in person, but a pervert in the sheets,
and im magic with the words murder melin over beats, 
make the competition kiss the fucking curb and then they weep

[Hook:] 
And then they drop, ha-ha, 
drop, bitch, drop, drop, drop (drop bitch)

[Verse 2:] 
Yo, the lambs givesilence and the fans get violent,
droppin live grimey like the hands of odd toddlers,
fucking awesome arsenal of wolves in the pack I travel in,
the battle ram, ramming em', rats get to taddlin',
lynn's swingin' axes at the antonyms of savages,
and praying that it damages, your hobby's what my passion is,
fuck that faggot shit my niggas on the savage shit,
fucking the game and shoving daggers throught the ass of it, 
I said, fuck that faggot shit my niggas on the savage shit,
fucking the game and shoving daggers throught the ass of it, 
moving on the a jessica, planning to make a mess of her after a couple drinks and a session of anal sex with her,
like, hey there intestines my cock is direct next to ya',
we the shit, like what you make, them niggas still aint fresh as us.
