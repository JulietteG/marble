VERSE 1:
I, I just need my one on one time with you.
With no, no interruptions I just want it to be me and you
I need a one on one
I just need a one on one, with you

CHORUS:
I, I just need my one on one time with you.
I might be selfish, but I
I cant just help it. When come down to you

VERSE 2
Im down on knees waiting to hear from you
I have so many questions that I need answers to
Im just going to wait on you
Set right here and wait on you

I, I just need my one on one time with you
(Ooooooh)
I might be selfish, but I
(Ooooooh)
I cant help it. When come down to you
(Ooooooh)

VAMP:
In your presence is where I want to be
There is love there, peace there,
I love my time alone, just you and me

I need a one on one
Just need a one on one
I know its been a long time since you heard from me
But if you give me little time, just a little time
I promise I wont be long (I just need my)
I just need my one on one
I know I walked away (one on one time)
But Im coming back to stay, with you (I just need my)
I coming back to you
To you (one on one time)
I coming back to you
To you (I just need to my)
I left my hand to you
To you (one on one time)

CHORUS:
I, I just need my one on one time with you.
I might be selfish, but I
I cant just help it. When come down to you---
