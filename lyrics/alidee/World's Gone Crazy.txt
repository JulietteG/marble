I recognized you on the 6 o'clock news,
you were runnin' from the law.
i thought about callin' the line for the wanted
but right then your truck stalled. 
They pulled you to the ground 
in front of the whole crowd, 
like some kind of western show.
Then i poured me a drink, and all i could think was, 
i'd rather let you go.

Chorus:
The world's gone crazy, cray-ya-yazy
But it won't change me, no no 
it's a damn sham 
i don't know who to blam
 but it won't change me. 

The other day i was a whislin away, shopping at the grocery store
when a man with a gun under the lunch time sun 
hollered to get down to the floor 
so we did what he said he took the money and fled 
and every one was a running wild.
but me i stood up and i brushed my shirt off 
kept a'shoppin down the cereal aisle.

Chorus:
The world's gone crazy, cray-ya-yazy
But it won't change me, no no 
it's a damn sham 
i don't know who to blam
 but it won't change me. 

Chorus:
The world's gone crazy, cray-ya-yazy
But it won't change me, no no 
it's a damn sham 
i don't know who to blam
 but it won't change me. 

The worlds gone cray-yay-yazy
but it wont change me nooo oohhh
mm hmmm---Lyrics submitted by Britt Denicola.
