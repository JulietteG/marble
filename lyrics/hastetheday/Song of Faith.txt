Letting go of your hand, I walk alone again.
On this path, in this pain
My flesh, burned away
My body, broken
Thought I was strong
I see the perfect day
I won't walk away!
I see the perfect day
I won't walk away!
I gave my faith to the wind today (wind today)
I won't let you make the same mistake (same mistake)
It seems so easy to walk away (walk away)
Remember how it used to be
I'll never (never)
I'll never (never)
I'll never (never)
I'll never make the same mistake
And I'll never

And I'll never make the same mistake
Of letting go of your hand
And I'll never make the same mistake
Of letting go of your hand---Lyrics submitted by Eric.
