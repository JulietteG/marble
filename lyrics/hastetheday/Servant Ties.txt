Its in your eyes.
The look of certainty.
The look of apathy.
Its in your eyes.
Im not so sure that we have nothing to lose.
Should have held this closer.
Staple your note to the back door.
Until then, your gut can tell you this.
Does anyone hear me? Does anyone honestly?
It will fall to pieces.
It will fall to pieces.
Find home, hold strong.
When everything is taken, youre empty.
Well see a purpose.
Just need to stand as one.
Do these thoughts have syllables or am I mumbling?
Do I seem tense when I carry your load?
Or am I, or am I losing it?
Take all, take everything.
Its hard to stop from dropping it all on you.
The heart will hurt when its crushed by the weight of the leaves on the trees.
Well see a purpose.
Well stand as one.
Im not so sure weve lost anything.
But while youre listening.
Im hurting for something better.
Till then, your gut, your gut can tell you this.---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
