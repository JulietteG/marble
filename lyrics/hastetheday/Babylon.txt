Foresee the day of the Lord
The Heavens blacken above them
The day will bring no light
For I will shake the heavens

Raise the flag on the hilltop
For now we march to Babylon
Say a prayer for the fallen
It's time to choose which side you are on

Hear the noise on the mountain
From the furthest horizon

Pick up the pieces as they fall
Our sins wont carry our burdens
So will you leave them behind?
While I've been held behind these walls
Will I be left or forgotten?

They run like the hunted
For now we march to Babylon
In the darkest of days
The mighty failure has gone

Most glorious of all kingdoms
Will fall like a stone
From the Heavens

Pick up the pieces as they fall
Our sins won't carry our burdens
While I've been held behind these walls
Will I be left or forgotten?

Foresee the day of the Lord
The Heavens blacken above them
The day will bring no light
For I will shake the heavens---Lyrics submitted by Brittany Bailey.
