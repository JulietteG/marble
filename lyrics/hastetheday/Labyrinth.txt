When I am fortunately ever so self-destructive
We live inside this labyrinth
Waiting to go home
Labyrinth oh labyrinth
Your most is what we'd not expect from you
And in your tired walls you sing out of tune
Come in

Labyrinth oh labyrinth
Your most is what we'd not expect from you
And in your tired walls you sing out of tune

Come in make your self at home
'Cause you wont be leaving soon
All your friends are dead and gone
And you've got nothing to lose---Lyrics submitted by Brittany Bailey.
