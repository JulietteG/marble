Left to my ambitions, I find myself feeling short of breath
And losing hope again

When will I be free?
When will I feel alive?
I am at my end, and I can't breathe

I can't breathe (everything I do is useless),
I can't do this on my own (I'm fading)
Too many times I've left in silence,
This time I won't give up so soon

Crying out for some relief,
And I keep breaking my own heart
Giving up on my resolve,
I keep trying but I keep failing
This all seems so familiar,
I think we've been here once before,
I'm saying sorry once again,
I'm saying sorry once again

I can't breathe (everything I do is useless)
I can't do this on my own (I'm fading)
Too many times I've left in silence
This time I won't give up so soon---Lyrics submitted by reina.
