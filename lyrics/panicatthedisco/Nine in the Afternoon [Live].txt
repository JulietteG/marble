Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
Looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place, where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place
Where we used to say
Man it feels good to feel this way
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street
Back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
