Climbing out back the door, didnt leave a mark
No one knows its you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no ones ever gonna find Miss Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no ones gonna find out
But were so lucky
Kiss the ring and let em bow down
Looking for the time of your life (gonna find out)

A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown,
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isnt over tonight

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty? Are you nasty?
I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway

Way down til the fire finally dies out
Youve got em wrapped around your finger
Watch em fall down
Theres something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty? Are you nasty?
I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway

Climbing out back the door, didnt leave a mark
No one knows its you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no ones ever gonna find Miss Jackson

I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty? Are you nasty?
I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway---
