Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can you know
Yeah we're feeling so good
Pickng up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
Its just the end of the world

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love 
You could you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where its nine in the afternoon

Beacause its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do 
When its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cuz you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet 
Losing the feeling of feeling unique

Back to the street
Back to the place
Back to the room where it all began
Hey
Back to the room where it all began

Because its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon 
You could cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good 
Just the way that we do
When its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do 
We're feeling so good 
Just the way that we do
When it nine in the afternoon---Lyrics submitted by Carly.
