Back to the street were we began
Feeling as good as lovers can
Yah know
Yah were feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
Looks like the end of history as we know
Its just the end of the world
Back to the street were we began
Feeling as good as love
You could you can
Into a place were thoughts cam bloom
Into a room were its nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could beeeeeeeeeeeee
And we know that it should 
And you know that you'd fell it too
Cause its nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
Were feeling so good 
Just the way that we do
When it nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could cause you can so you do
Were feeling so good 
Back to the street 
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what i mean ?
Back to the place
Were we use to say
Man it feels go to feel this way
Now i know what i mean
Back to the street 
Back to the place
Back to the room were all began
h
Back to the room were all began
Cause its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could Cause you can so you do
Were feeling so good 
Just the way that we do
When its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could Cause you can so you do
Were feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When its nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could Cause you can so you 
Were feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When its nine in the afternoon
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
