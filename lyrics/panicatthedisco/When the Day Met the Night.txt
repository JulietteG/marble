When the moon fell in love with the sun,
all was golden in the sky.
All was golden when the day met the night.

When the sun found the moon, she was drinking tea in a garden.
Under the green umbrella trees in the middle of summer.
When the moon found the sun, he looked like he was barely hanging on.
But her eyes saved his life in the middle of summer.

In the middle of summer all was golden in the sky.
All was golden when the day met the night.
Summer, all was golden in the sky.
All was golden when the day met the night.
Summer. 

So he said would it be all right, if we just sat and talked for a little while. 
If in exchange for your time, I give you this smile.
So she said that's okay, as long you can make a promise not to break my little heart.
Or leave me all alone in the summer.

Well he was just hanging around, then he fell in love.
And he didn't know how, but he couldn't get out.
Just hanging around, and he fell in love.

In the middle of summer, all was golden in the sky.
All was golden when the day met the night. 
Summer, all was golden in the sky.
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer. Summer, Summer. 

When the move fell in love with the sun, all was golden in the sky.
All was golden when the day met the night.

Summer. 
The middle of summer.
The middle of summer.
The middle of summer.---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
