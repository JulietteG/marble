V. She held the world upon a string,
    but she didnt ever hold me.
    Spun the stars on her fingernails,
    but it never made her happy.
    Cause she couldn't ever have me.

She said she'd won the world at a carnival,
but she couldn't ever win me.
Cause she couldnt ever catch me

   I, I know why. Because when i look in her eyes,
   I just see the sky. 
   When i look in her eyes,
   well I, just see the sky

I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if i knew how to lie.
But who could love me I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea.
To see if i can catch a dream.

   The sun was always in her eyes,
   She didnt even see me.
   But that girl had so much love, 
   She'd want to kiss you all the time.
   yea, she'd want to kiss you all the time

She said she'd won the world,
at a carnival.
but i'm sure it didn't ruin her
just made her more interesting.
i'm sure it didn't ruin her
just made her more interesting.

   I, I know why. Because when i look in her eyes,
   I just see the sky. 
   When i look in her eyes, well I,
   just see the sky

I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if i knew how to lie.
But who could love me I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea.
To see if i can catch a dream.---Lyrics submitted by Chelsey.
