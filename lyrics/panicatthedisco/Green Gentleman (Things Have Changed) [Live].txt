Things are shaping up to be pretty odd.
Little deaths in musical beds.
So it seems I'm someone I've never met.

You will only hear these elegant crimes,
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes.
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth.

And Everybody gets there everybody gets there,
And Everybody gets their way (hey! )
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her,
Now I'm the only one to blame.

[Chorus! ]
Things have changed for me.
And that's okay.
I feel the same,
I'm on my way,
And I say,
Things have changed for me,
And that's okay.

I want to go where everyone goes,
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same

I never said I'd leave this city,
I never said I'd leave this town.
A falling out we won't tiptoe about

When Everybody gets there and everybody gets their
And Everybody gets their way

I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her,
Now I'm the only one to blame.

[Chorus! ]
Things have changed for me.
And that's okay.
I feel the same,
I'm on my way.
And I say,
Things have changed for me,
And that's okay.
I feel the same,
And I'll Say.

Oh well things have changed for me
Come on everybody let's dance and sing,
Well I'm singin' it all night long
So come on everybody and join along,
I'm sayin' well everything's changed for me,
Come on everyone let's dance and sing,
Well I'm singin' it all night long
So come on everybody and sing along.

And that's Okay.
I'm On My Way.
And I say.
Things have changed for me.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
