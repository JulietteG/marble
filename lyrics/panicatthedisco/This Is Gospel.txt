This is gospel for the fallen ones 
Locked away in permanent slumber 
Assembling their philosophies 
From pieces of broken memories 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart 

The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues 
Conspire against the odds 
But they havent seen the best of us yet 

If you love me, let me go 
If you love me, let me go 

Cause these words are knives, and often leave scars. 
The fear of falling apart 
And truth be told I never was yours 
The fear, The fear of falling apart 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart 

This is gospel for the vagabonds, 
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards 
Confessing their apostasies 
Led away by imperfect impostors 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart  

Dont try to sleep through the end of the world 
And bury me alive 
cause I wont give up without a fight 

If you love me, let me go 
If you love me, let me go 

Cause these words are knives, and often leave scars. 
The fear of falling apart 
And truth be told I never was yours 
The fear, the fear of falling apart 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
The fear of falling apart 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
The fear, the fear of falling apart 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
The fear of falling apart 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
The fear of falling apart 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
The fear of falling apart 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
The fear of falling apart ---
