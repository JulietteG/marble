In the spring of 1861 a mighty war was waged
On a line called Mason-Dixon is where two armies faced
The young men dressed in blue so deep from northern states they came
The greycoats from the southland The Rebels so were named

For two boys from Kentucky the call of duty came their way
While one had stayed in Ashland farther north the other strayed
Each had left their lovely brides and children at their door
To march away to battle not knowing whats in store

In the battle there at Shiloh many men would fall
Man to man and hand to hand 24,000 in all
Face to face who should meet on the bloody field that day
Two boys from Kentucky, one in blue and one in grey

On the banks of Shilohs bloody creek their guns dropped to the ground
Embraced one another, while the cannon fire rained down
A single ball, it sealed the history of those mens lives
While holding each other, two brothers.died

When the last shot was fired and the smoke had rolled away
They were laid still together in an unmarked mass grave
No one would ever know what happened on the day
That two boys from Kentucky..will never again separate---Lyrics submitted by steve bennett.
