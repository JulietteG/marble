So you broke down
Trying to leave town
I broke down crying on your return
You left me feeling hopeful
I'll never see your face again
You made for a bad lover's liver
You stole all the covers and busted my head
You made me such an ass hole
I wish we'd never met
I'm tired of being bored
I'm through with the headaches
And hiding my hands 
that tremble like earthquakes
Under the table under the daytime sky
Good fucking bye
And when you lose hope
It's hard to cope
Watching the tyranny with sober eyes
At daybreak and sunset
All hours in between are spent murdering time
You made for a bad lover's liver
You sold all the covers and fucked up my head
You made me such an ass hole
I wish we'd never met
I'm tired of being bored
I'm through with the headaches at night
And my hands they tremble like earthquakes
Under the table under the daytime sky
Good fucking bye
Good fucking bye
Good fucking bye---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
