Spent two years of my life in a foreign land
Came home to my young wife as a different man
Saw fifteen sons and fathers lying on the ground
Just one click of my thumb laid their bodies down

Oh, it seems
Nightmares have become our dreams
Life ain't just what it seems
Run by some ancient schemes

And oh, it shows
On the faces of those who know
Blood flows where the money's stowed
Try to get your hands on gold
But hey, why ain't anybody trying to see?

Spent two years of my life in a foreign land
Came home to find my mind still stuck in sand
Did things I never thought that I could do
I had to tell myself I did them all for you

Oh, it seems
Nightmares have become our dreams
Life ain't just what it seems
Still run by ancient schemes

And oh, it shows
On the faces of those who know
Blood flows where the money's stowed
Gotta get your hands on gold
But hey, when is anybody gonna see?---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
