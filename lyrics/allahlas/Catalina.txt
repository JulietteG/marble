Your perfect vision
of the life we had
prompts my conviction
that my love will bring you back
But when I reach out
you seem quite cold
still my impression
lingers deep within your soul
in your soul...

And when you look round
see me standing there
I'm only wondering
if by chance, dear, you still care?
And though I had to
seek somebody new
don't be mistaken
I'm still dreaming about you
about you

Your perfect vision
of the life we had
prompts my conviction
that my love will bring you back
And though I had to
seek somebody new
don't you dare fret girl
I'm still dreaming about you
about you X 4---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
