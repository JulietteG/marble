Out on the water is where you're gonna find me
All alone with my mind, head up for a bounty

I've been living so long all by myself
I can't think of living with anybody else

I'm an oyster pearls locked up in a shell
You better bring that diving bell

But I want you near
I wanna whisper to your ear

Wanna hold your hand
I wanna be your man, alright

Out on the river is where you're gonna find me
All alone with my thoughts, head up for a bounty

I've been living so long in a habitat
With the land's mighty rocky but the river stays flat

Can you show me something to make me part with that? oh no 

But I want you near
I want to whisper to your ear

Wanna hold your hand
Wanna be your man

I'm gonna get you girl
Like I got you wrap you up in paper and bought you

Your the pretty little thing that I gotta have
Cause I want it...---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
