Took a bit of your heart wore it 'round my neck
Take it where I go so I don't forget 
All the things you swore were yours all alone
Found out I can get them on my own

I'm gonna find love anywhere I can 
Gonna get back to the golden sands
I would love to have you by my side
But I ain't gonna wait for the morning tide, oh no

Rode up on a hill with a girl I know
Said now listen, babe, something you should know
I ain't quite the guy you thought I was
She said that's quite alright, love you just because

You're gonna find love anywhere you can
Gonna take me where I never been
I would love to stay on this ride
Cos you ain't gonna change with the morning tide, oh no---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
