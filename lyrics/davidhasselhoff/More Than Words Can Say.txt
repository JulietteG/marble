It's late in china town
The rain is coming down
And I'm all alone again
Back on my own again
I can't just walk away
And I can't make you stay
So I'm all alone again
I'm back on my own again

I long for yesterday
When our love came easy
But now I can't throw it all away
Cause I need you baby
More than words can say

More than words can say
Can't you hear me when I pray
In the pouring rain
Baby I'm missing you
More than words can say
Can't you hear me when I pray
In the pouring rain
Baby I'm missing you

Thoughts of you and me
And how we used to be
Pull like the oceans tide
Hurting me deep inside

I walk untill dawn
To search for what went wrong
I can't just let you go
Baby that much I know

I get to find the way
To your heart forever
Cause we come too far to walk away
I still love you darling
More than words can say

More than words can say
Can't you hear me when I pray
In the pouring rain
Baby I'm missing you
More than words can say
Can't you hear me when I pray
In the pouring rain
Baby I'm missing you---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
