Hey you
So you never really found your way
Stay true
Did you ever make it through today

I know that when I think about a day without it
Everydays the same
You wish that you could find someone
But Im the only one to blame

Cant you see
I beg and plead
Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know youre gonna find your way back to me

No dont
Dont you ever let a piece of me down
Cause time wont
Get back when Im never around

When we live between so many walls
That I can barely breathe
You say that you just want someone
But Im the only one you need

Cant you see
I Beg and plead
Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know youre gonna find your way

If its me
That you dont need
When the lights go out tonight I know
Youre never gonna find your way

Soon when I get you I wont let you go
Oooh if I let you
You can take away all that I thought was wrong
And if you hear me theres not much to say
Theres gotta be a better way

Cant you see
I beg and plead
Cause when your eyes light up the sky tonight
I know youre going to find your way back to me

Cant you see
I beg and plead
Cause when the lights go out tonight
I know youre never gonna find your way

If its me
That you dont need
That when the lights go out tonight
I know youre never gonna find you way
If you pace around the world to me
And when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know youre gonna find your way back to me---Lyrics submitted by cristen.
