I still remember that empty look left on your face
You took the pictures but you left the frames
All we had written, well, it's been erased
Something that I had to do
I cut you deep, you're bleeding through
You're every single shade of blue
When I'm standing right in front of you

I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need
Make me right
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down

The hair you left scattered like wishes that led to your room
I bury my face in your pillow just to smell your perfume
Outside I'm hungry but inside I'm just consumed
Tell me how am I supposed to breathe
When losing you is choking me?

I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need
Make me right
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down

I fucking hate this town
I wanna burn it down
I never felt so cold
And when I burn this town
I hope I burn it down
And leave me on my own

I fucking hate this town
I wanna burn it down
I never felt so cold
I hear your heart beat slowing down

I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
All you need
Make me right
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down---Lyrics submitted by Odessa Kaelin.
