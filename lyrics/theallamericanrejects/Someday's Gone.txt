Da da da da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
What makes you so damn sure
That you're perfect, huh?
I can't explain you
Just like a nightmare
I can't remember
What makes you so damn sure
That you're worth it huh?
You're just a bad trip

I can't come back from since last December
I walk into the room and you steal everyone
I see you walk into the room
And you kill everyone, cause I know

[Chorus]
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
Just let it go

[Verse 2]
How did you figure that I let you cut me down
Right at the knees
I fall like a dead man out of the airplane
How do you figure that I let you drag me around, huh?
You got my number draw me a story tell me a picture I walk into the room and
You've had everyone
And then you walked into the room and so said everybody already knows

[Chorus]
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My somedays gone now
Bye bye just let it go

[Bridge]
Even when I live, a piece of me will
Die win some lose some she won't bare deny
Maybe when I sleep,
I'll feel you in my dreams
Forget about it one day the day
I'm not gonna
See you walk into the room and you f-ck-d everyone
And then you walked into the room well so what everyone already knows

[Chorus]
My someday's gone now
Bye bye
My someday's gone now
Bye bye

My someday's gone now bye bye

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
