If you feel like runnin today
You know I'd understand
You don't but you long

It's easier to get away
When on the other hand
You know I'm not much better without you
I'm like your victim and all that you need is an alibi
It's one thing about you
I don't wanna make you cry

Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl, you can't see
When he's inside you know there's no room for me

If you can take a chance
Find you that better man
A life seize from your quick disease
You're givin' all my lovin away
Tell me to understand
'Cuz you know
I'm not much better without you
I'll press your lips and I taste everyone that you've had tonight
It's one thing about you
I don't wanna taste tonight

Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole me heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know there's no room for me

And I used to think that I was all you would need
Nah nah nah
There you go again
Nah nah nah
Oooh you think that you could just push me around
Nah nah nah
Yeah there you go again
You lift me up and then you throw me back down

Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know there's no room for me

Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole me heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl you can't see
When he's inside you know there's no room for me
And I used to think that I was all you would need

If you feel like running today you know I'd understand---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
