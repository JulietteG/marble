Ive got to breathe
You cant that from me
Cause its all that you left thats mine
You had to leave
And thats all I can see
But you told me your love was blind

There are times
Youre so impossible that I should sign a waiver
And you will find
Someone worth walking on when you ask me to go

Ill leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and there it goes
Ill be outside of your window
Ill pass by but Ill go slow
Ill leave when the wind blows

There was a day
You threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay
But since you wanna play
We can finally say were through

There are times youre so impossible and you ask me to go

Ill leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and there it goes
Ill be outside of your window
Ill pass by but Ill go slow
Ill leave when the wind blows

You can scream theres just echoes
Pass outside of your window
Youll be sad that you let me go
Ill leave but just know

As I lay in solitude
Oh Whats a boy supposed to do
I Shake the very thought of you
Me together, I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late
All I do is wait and wait
Your never coming home to me
Thats the hardest thing to see

I got to breathe
You cant take that from
We can finally say were through

Ill leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and there it goes
Ill be outside of your window
Ill pass by but Ill go slow
Ill leave when the wind blows

You can scream theres just echoes
Pass outside of your window
Youll be sad that you let me go
On every face youll ever know
And everywhere you ever go
Youll feel when the wind blows---Lyrics submitted by cristen.
