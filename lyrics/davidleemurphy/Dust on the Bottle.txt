Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
Made homemade wine like nobody I know
Dropped by one Friday night and said 
Can you help me Creole
Got a little girl waitin' on me and I wanna treat her right

I got what you need son, it's sittin' down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs 
As he turned on the light and said

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

She was sittin in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
She slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
Watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said, 
Now here's something special
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

--- Instrumental ---

You're still with me, and we've made some memories
After all these years there's one thing I've found
Some say good love, well it's like a fine wine
It keeps getting better as the days go by

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

Don't let it fool ya...---Lyrics submitted by Micaela.
