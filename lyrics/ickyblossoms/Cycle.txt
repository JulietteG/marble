I can feel, the cycles in
And if all goes well, i'll do it again

Dance Dance, who am I, close your eyes and hold em tight, the sun is slowly rising.
Sleep sleep through the day, who could careless anyway, I'm feelin up my motives.

I wanna feel it again, too much to feel it again, it swept again and again, i'm ready.
I wanna feel it again, too much to feel it again, it swept again and,

I can feel, the cycles in
And if all goes well, i'll do it again.

(whisper) wake up

Well my holes in my jeans dance around in the street. 
 I don't know what you've been told,
love and dreams are bought and sold, 
love and dreams are bought and sold,
love and dreams are bought and sold,
bought and sold,
bought and sold.

I can feel, (chorus)* I wanna feel you, too much to feel you, I wanna feel it again*
the cycles in
(chorus)* I wanna feel you, too much to feel you, it swept again and again*
dance dance, who am I, sleep sleep *chorus*

And if all goes well, I'll do it again.---Lyrics submitted by Vince P.
