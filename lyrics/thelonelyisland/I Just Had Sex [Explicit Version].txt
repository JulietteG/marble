Sometimes (oh oh) 
something beautiful happens in this world
(Akon and lonely island)
you don't know how to express yourself
so u just gotta sing 

I just had sex and it felt so good
(felt so good )
a woman let me put my penis inside of her (her)
i just had se-ay-ee-ex 
and i'll never go back (never go back)
to the not-havin'-sex ways of the past

Have you ever had sex?
i have, it felt great (yeah)
it felt so good when i did it with my penis (yeah)
a girl let me do it 
it literally just happened
having sex should make a man out the meanest

Never guess where i just came from,i had sex
if i had to describe the feelin'
it was the best 
when i had the sex , man,
my penis felt great
and i called my parents right after i was done 

Oh,hey,didn't see u there 
guess what i just did
had sex , undressed
saw her boobies and the rest
was sure nice of her to let u do that thing
nice of any girl ever (now sing)

i just had sex (ay)
and it felt so good (felt so good)
a woman let me put my penis inside of her (her)
i wanna tell the world

To be honest , I'm surprised she even want me to do that
(doesn't really make sense)
but man , screw it 
(i ain't one to argue with a good thing)
she could be my wife!
that good ?
the best thirty seconds of my life

I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
'cause honestly , i'd have sex with a pile of manure
with that in mind , a soft , nice-smellin' girl's better
plus she let me wear my chain 
and my turtleneck sweaters 

So this one's dedicated to them girls
that let us flop around on top of them (yeah)
if you're near or far
whether short or tall
we wanna thank you all 
for lettin' us fuck you

She kept lookin' at her watch
(doesn't matter, had sex)
but i cried the whole time 
(doesn't matter, had sex)
i think she might've been a racist
(doesn't matter,had sex)
she put a bag on my head 
(still counts!)

I just had sex (ay)
and my dreams came true (dreams came true)
so if u had sex in the last thirty minutes
then you're qualified to sing with me 

I just had se-e-ex 
(everybody sing)
and it felt so good
(we all had sex)
a woman let me put my penis inside of her 

I just had se-ay-ee-ex (i just had sex)
and i'll never go back (never go back )
to the not-havin'-sex ways of the past---Lyrics submitted by Nadine.
