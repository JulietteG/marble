Lock eyes From across the Room
Down my drInk while the rhythms Boom
Take Your hand and skIp the Names
No need here for the silly games
Make our way through the smoke and crowd
The club is the sky and i'm on your cloud

Move in close as the lasers fly
Our bodies touch and the angles cry
Leave this place go back to yours
Our lips first touch outside your doors a whole night what we've got in store
Whisper in my ear that you want some more

And I (Jizzed in my pants)

This really never happens,you can take my word i wont apologize thats just absurd
Mainly your fault, from the way that you dance and

Now I (Jizzed in my pants)

Don't tell your friends or I'll say your a slut 
plus it's your fault,you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive,some woud say thats a plus

NOW I"LL GO HOME AND CHANGE

{second verse}

I need a few a few things from the grocery 
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heart broken not looking for love
Surprised in my eyes when i looked above
The check out counter and i saw her face
My heart stood still so did time and space

Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said i need a friend
She turned to me and thats when she said it 
Look me dead in the face,asked cash or credit

And I (Jizzed in my pants)

It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But were going,to need a clean up on isle 3
And now i posed in,an awkward stance because 

I (Jizzed in my pants)

To be fair you were flirting a lot 
Plus the way you bag cans, got me bothered and hot
Please stop acting like you're not impressed
One more thing, i'm gonna pay by check

{third verse}

last week - I saw a film 
As I recall it, it was a horror film
Walked outside into the rain 
Checked my phone, and saw you rang

I(Jizzed in my pants)

Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away 
Need to make a dash
A song comes on thats, reminds me of you and

I (Jizzed in my pants)

The Next Day, my alarm goes off and 

I (Jizzed In my pants)

Open my window and a breeze rolls in and

I (jizzed in my pants)

When bruce willis was dead at the end of sixth sense

I (Jizzed in my pants)

I just ate a grape and 

I (Jizzed in my pants)

ok seriously you guys can we okey

{fourth verse}

I jizzed right in my pants every time your next to me
And when were holding hands it's like having sex with me
you say i'm premature i just call it ecstasy i wear a rubber 
at all times it's a Necessity 

Cuz I (Jizzed in my pants)

(whispers)

I jizz in my pants 
I jizz in my pants
Yes I jizz in my pants
Yes I jizz in my pants 

YES I JIZZED IN MY PANTS!

(whispsers)
I jizz in my pants
I jizz in my pants---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
