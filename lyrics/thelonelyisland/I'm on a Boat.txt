Awwshit, get your towels ready it's about to go down! 
Everybody in the place hit the fuckin' deck, 
But stay on your motha-fuckin' toes! 
We runnin' this let's go!

Im on a boat, Im on a boat, 
Everybody look at me cause Im sailin on a boat.
Im on a boat, Im on a boat, 
Take a good hard look at the motherfuckin boat

Im on a boat, motherfucker take a look at me
Straight floatin on a boat on the deep blue sea
Bustin five knots, wind whippin out my coat
You cant stop me motherfucker cause Im on a boat

Take a picture trick, Im on a boat bitch, 
We drinking Santana champ cause its so crisp
I got my swim trunks and my flippy floppies
Im flippin burgers, you at kinkos straight up flippin copies

Im ridin on a dolphin, doin flips and shit
This dolphins splashin, getting everybody all wet, 
But this aint sea world, this is as real as it gets
Im on a boat motherfucker and dont you ever forget

Im on a boat and, its goin fast and, 
I got a nautical themed pashmina afghan
Im the king of the world on a boat like Leo, 
If your on the show than your sure not meo

Get the fuck up this boat is real!

Fuck land Im on a boat motherfucker,
Fuck trees I climb buoys motherfucker,
Im on the deck with my boys motherfucker, 
This boat engine make noise motherfucker

Hey ma if you could see me now, 
Arms spread wide on the chopper bow, 
Gonna fly this boat to the moon somehow, 
Im Kevin Gardett, anything is possible!

I never thought Id be on boat, its a big blue watery row
Poseidon, look at me ohh
Never thought Id see the day, with a big boat coming my way
Believe me when I say, I fucked a mermaid

Im on a boat, Im on a boat,
Everybody look at me cause Im sailing on a boat
Im on a boat, Im on a boat,
Take a good hard look at the motherfuckin boat---Lyrics submitted by austin.
