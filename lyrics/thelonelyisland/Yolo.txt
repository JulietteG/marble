(Intro)
Yolo
Yolo
You only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So dont get too crazy, its not worth the risk

(Interlude)
You know that we are still young
So dont be dumb
Dont trust anyone
Cause you only live once

(Verse)
Uh
You only live once, thats the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle
Never go to loud clubs cause its bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they cant hear
And stay the hell away from drugs cause theyre not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
You should never trust a bank, theyve been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
Dont travel by plane and dont travel at all
Built a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go in saunas cause theyre crawling with piranhas
And never take the stairs cause theyre often unsafe
You only live once, dont let it go to waste

(Interlude)
You know that we are still young
So hold on from the fun
Cook your meat til its done
Cause you only live once

(Verse)
Yea, and heres another piece of my advice
Stay away from kids cause their hair is filled with mad lice
Theres no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So dont 1980 force any plugs into sockets.
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it.
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they could choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: KILLING MACHINES
Board your windows up, the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a strait jacket so youre safe from yourself

(Verse)
Aha
Take no chances (no chances)
Start freelancing (right now)
Invest in your future, dont dilute your finances
401kk, make sure its no risk
The get some real-estate (how much?)
4.2%
30 year mortgage
Thats important, thats a great deal
And if you cant afford it, dont forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and youre retired with money in your account
Beast

(Chorus)
Yolo, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo, be carefulo
You oughta look out
also stands for YOLO

(Interlude)
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints of your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth 
So you cant bite your tongue

(Verse)
Only on this Earth for a short time, time
So dont go outside cause you dont want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
and scream YOLO to the sky.

(Outro)
You oughta look out---Lyrics submitted by Callan E.
