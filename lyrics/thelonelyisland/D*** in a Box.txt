Hey girl I got somethin' real important to give you 
So just sit down and listen 
Girl you know we've been together such a long long time  (such a long time) 
And now I'm ready to lay it on the line 
(Wooow)
You know it's Christmas and my heart is open wide 
Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind 
A gift real special, so take off the top 
Take a look inside -- it's my dick in a box 
Not gonna get you a diamond ring 
That sort of gift don't mean anything 
Not gonna get you a fancy car 
Girl ya gotta know you're my shining star 
Not gonna get you a house in the hills 
A girl like you needs somethin' real 
Wanna get you somethin' from the heart 
Somethin' special girl 
It's my dick in a box, my dick in a box babe 
It's my dick in a box, my dick in a box girl 
See I'm wise enough to know when a gift needs givin' (yeah) 
And I got just the one, somethin' to show ya that you are second to none 
To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress 
It's easy to do just follow these steps 
1: Cut a hole in a box 
2: Put your junk in that box 
3: Make her open the box 
And that's the way you do it 
It's my dick in a box... my dick in a box babe 
It's my dick in a box, my dick in a box girl 
Christmas; dick in a box 
Hanukkah; dick in a box 
Kwanzaa; a dick in a box 
Every single holiday a dick in a box 
Over at your parent's house a dick in a box 
Mid day at the grocery store a dick in a box 
Backstage at the CMA's a dick in a box (yeah-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow)---Lyrics submitted by Myranda.
