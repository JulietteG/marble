When i met him on a side walk
he was preaching to a mail box
down on sixteenth avenue

and he told me he was Jesus 
sent form jupitar to free us 
with a bottle of tequilla and one shoe

he raged about repentances
he finished every sentence 
with a promise that the end was close at hand
i didn't even try to understand

(chorus)
he left me wide eyed 
in disbelief in this illusion
i was sometimes drawn by my conclusion
and so i turned and walked away 
and laughed at what he had to say
and casually dismissed him as a fraud
i fogot he was created 
in the image of My God

when i met her in a book store
she was browsing on the first floor
a way open magazine
and she told me in her past life 
she was some plantation slaves wife
she had to figure out what that might mean
she belived the healing powers of her crystals
could bring balance and good purpose to her life
sounds nice

(chorus)
she left me wide eyed 
in disbelief in this illusion 
i was some times
drawn by my conclusion
and so i turned and walked away
and laughed at what she had to say
and casually dismissed her as a fraud
i forgot she was created 
in the image of My God

not  so long ago 
a man from galaliee
fed thousands with his bread 
and his theology
and the truth he spoke 
quickly became the joke of 
educated self inflated pharisees alike me

ah
oh oh ooh
la de daa

(Chorus)
and they were wide eyed 
in disbelief in this illusion
they we're sometimes
drawn by they're conclusions
would i have turned and walked away
and laughed at what he had to say
and casually dismissed him as a fraud
unaware that i was starring 
at the image of My God---Lyrics submitted by abby.
