It's well past midnight and I'm awake with questions that won't wait for daylight
Separating fact from my imaginary fiction on this shelf of my conviction
I need to find a place where You and I come face to face

Thomas needed proof that You had really risen undefeated when he placed his fingers
Where the nails once broke Your skin did his faith finally begin?
I've lied if I've denied the common ground I've shared with Him and I, 

I really want to know You
I want to make each day
a different way that i can show You how

I really want to Love You
You be patient with my doubt
I'm just tryin' to figure out Your will

And i really want to know You still

Nicodemus could not understand how You could truly free us
He struggled with the image of a grown man born again
We might have been good friends
'Cause sometimes i still question, too how easily we come to You, but I

I really want to know You
I want to make each day
A different way that I can show You how

I really want to Love You
You be patient with my doubt
I'm just tryin' to figure out Your will

And i really want to know You still

No more campin' on the porch of undecisions 
No more sleepin' under stars of apathy
And it might be easier to dream 
But dreaming is not for Me and I, 

I really want to know You 
I want to make each day
A different way that i can show You how

I really want to Love You
You be patient with my doubt
I'm just trying to figure out Your will

And i really want to know You still

I want to know You
You really want to know You
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Jakiee Pivaral.
