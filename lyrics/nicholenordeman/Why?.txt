We rode into town the other day, just me and my Daddy.
He said Id finally reached that age, and I could ride next to him,
on a horse that of course was not quite as wide

We heard a crowd of people shouting and 
So we stopped to find out why.
There was that man that my dad said he loved, 
But today there was fear in his eyes

So I said Daddy why are they screaming?
Why are the faces of some of them beaming?
Why is he dressed in that bright purple robe? 
I bet that crown hurts him more than he shows 
Daddy please cant you do something?
He looks as if hes going to cry
You said he is stronger than all of those guys-
Daddy please tell me why, 
why does everyone want him to die?


Later that day the sky grew cloudy and 
Daddy said I should go inside
Somehow he knew things would get stormy, boy was he right.
But I could not keep from wondering if 
There was something that he had to hide

So after he left I had to find out, 
I was not afraid of getting lost
So I followed the crowds to a hill where 
I knew men had been killed
And I heard a voice come from a cross:

And it said : Father why are they screaming?
Why are the faces of some of them beaming?
Why are they casting their lots for my clothes? 
I bet that crown hurts him more than he shows
Father  please cant you do something?
I know that you must hear my cry
I thought I could handle a cross of this size, 
Father remind me why, why does everyone want me to die.
When will I understand why?

My precious Son, I hear them screaming.
Im watching the face of the enemy beaming, 
But soon I will clothe you in robes of my own.
Jesus this hurts me more than you know
But this dark hour I must do nothing. 
Ive heard your unbearable cry
The power in your blood destroys all the lies, 
Soon youll see past their unmerciful eyes.
Look there below see the child trembling by her fathers side. 
Now I can tell you why, she is why you must die.---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
