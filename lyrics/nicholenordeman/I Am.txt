Pencil marks on the wall
Wasnt always this tall

You scattered some monsters from beneath my bed
You watched my team win
You watched my team lose
You watched when my bicycle went down again

When I was weak 
Unable to speak 
Still I would call you by name
And I said

Elbow healer
Superhero 
Come if you can 

And you said I am

Only sixteen 
Life is so mean 
What kind of curfew is at 10pm?

You saw my mistakes 
You watched my heart break
Heard when I swore Id never love again

When I was weak 
Unable to speak 
Still I could call you by name
And I said

Heart healer 
Secret keeper
Be my Best Friend

And you said I am

You saw me wear white
By pale candlelight
I said forever to what lies ahead

Two kids and a dream
With kids who can scream

To much it might seem
When it is 2am

When I am weak 
Unable to speak 
Still I will call you by name

Oh, Shepherd
Savior  
Pasture maker

Hold on to my hand

And you said I am

The winds of change
And circumstances
Blow in and all around us

So we find a foothold thats familiar 
And bless the moments that we feel you nearer

When life had begun 
I was woven and spun

You let the angels dance around the thrown
And who can say when 
Theyll dance again

When I am free 
And finally head home

I will be weak 
Unable to speak 
Still I will call you by name

Creator
Maker
Life Sustainer
Comforter
Healer
My Redeemer
Lord and King
Beginning and the end

I am
Yes, I am
