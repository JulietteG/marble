And girl I hate me for how I hurt you cause that aint no way to love a woman, I used up your heart and all your forgiveness I tore you apart and now your down to where my apologies are just empty words and my tears are just soften water where down on my knees thats just bones on board ya Im where sorry dont matter any more.
There was a time when I was the one that you trusted unconditionally now look at you lookin at me with that blank stare that only believes that my apologies are just empty words and my tears are just softened water where down on my knees thats just bones on board Im where sorry dont matter any more.
Girl I wish I could tell you how sorry I really am cause but I just cant cause I chose to make my apologies just empty words and my tears just softened water where down on my knees thats just bones on board And Im where sorry dont matter, Im where sorry just dont matter, Im where sorry dont matter any more---Lyrics submitted by Shawn.
