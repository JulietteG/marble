Baby, when I look at you
With your hair falling down in your baby blues
Standing there across the room
I get so lost in the way you move 

It makes me reminisce
Back to years ago on a night like this
Teary-eyed, as you took my hand
And I told you I'd be your man 

So many things have come 
So many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same 
Is our love's still going strong 

[Chorus:]
Baby just look at us
All this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist 
Between a Backwoods boy and a fairytale princess

People said it would never work out 
But living dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just livin' our love song

Oh, darlin would you look at me
With my heart beatin fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe
After all these years I still need you this badly

You're dancin in my arms
With a spotlight moon in a sea of stars
Oh, girl, we've come so far
Everything that I want is everything that you are

I just wanna lay you down
Say I love you without a sound
I think you know what I'm talking about
Yeah

Baby just look at us
All this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist 
Between a Backwoods boy and a fairytale princess

People said it would never work out 
But living dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just livin' our love song

Baby just look at us
All this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist 
Between a Backwoods boy and a fairytale princess

People said it would never work out 
But living dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just livin' our love song

It feels good to prove'em wrong
Just livin our love song---Lyrics submitted by samantha.
