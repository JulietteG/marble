I always said I wouldnt stand in the way of your dreams
And what good is the wind blowin in a blue sky to a bird without  wings
In the minute when I said it  I swear it , but things change 
And I cant pretend that I could somehow live without you 
No matter what I said 

I just cant turn around , walk away
Give it up without a fight , love wont let me 
Say goodbye after all this time , love wont let me 

Alot of people looking around tryin to find out where their at 
Sometimes it takes closing your eyes to see what you really have
And we have it and I know it I feel it 
I hate to think that I'm standing in your way
And though I've tried to step aside 
No matter what I do  I just cant 

I just cant turn around , walk away
Give it up without a fight , love wont let me 
Say goodbye after all this time , love wont let me 

I'll do whatever I gotta do 
Just tell me you dont want me too
Turn around walk away 
Give it up without a fight
Say goodbye after all this time
Love wont let me....---Lyrics submitted by Tracy.
