Yeah
Let's go
Half a dozen cars at the parking lot strip mall
Sitting on the hood, yeah getting on their yee haw
Hear 'em out prowlin', growlin' through the straight pipe
Heartbeat thumping, pumping, jumping at the red light

East, west, north, south
City street, rural route
Everybody knows what I'm talking about
Talking about non-stop
Nine o'clock Saturday
Anywhere USA
Anywhere USA

Pretty little teen queen out past her curfew
Painted on blue jeans, powder-puff Subaru
Escobar and Rico, Chevy magnifico
High ride, low ride bouncin' to the beat yo

East, west, north, south
City street, rural route
Everybody knows what I'm talking about
Talking about non-stop
Nine o'clock Saturday
Anywhere USA
Anywhere USA

Debutante, farm boy, city slicker, makin' noise
Twenty-inch spinners on a shiny toy
Boston, Austin, Chattanooga, L.A. - Hey! 
Anywhere USA
Anywhere USA
Man anywhere USA---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
