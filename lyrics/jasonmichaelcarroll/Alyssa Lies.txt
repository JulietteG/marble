My little girl met a new friend just the other day
On the playground at school 
Between the tires and the swings
But she came home with tear filled eyes
And she said to me "Daddy, Alyssa lies"

But I just brushed it off at first
'Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt
Or the things she had seen
I wasn't ready when I said "You can tell me"
And she said...

Chorus:
Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

My little girl laid her head down that night to go to sleep
As I stepped out the room I heard her say a prayer so soft and sweet
God bless my mom and my dad
And my new friend Alyssa
Oh, I know she needs you bad

Chorus:
Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

I had the worst night of sleep in years
As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears
I knew exactly what I had to do
But when we got to school on Monday 
I heard the news

My litle girl asked me why everybody looked so sad
The lump in my throat grew bigger 
With every question that she asked
Until I felt the tears run down my face
And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today

'Cause she doesn't lie in the classroom
She doesn't lie anymore at school
Alyssa lies with Jesus 
Because there's nothin' anyone would do

Tears filled my eyes
When my little girl asked me why
Alyssa lies
Oh daddy, Oh daddy tell me why
Alyssa lies---Lyrics submitted by theresa.
