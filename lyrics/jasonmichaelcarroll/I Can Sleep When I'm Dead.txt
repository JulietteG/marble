Got a little game that i play and i call it tryin to beat the mornin paper home
I ain't very good but i get a lot of practice even won once a month ago
Of course there was a girl involved that wasn't gonna let me rest
Like i've always said, 
I can sleep when I'm dead

If there's somethin goin on within a hundred miles of home
You're gonna hear my V8 sing
As long as i can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby i ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's to fun and i'm too young
And the night ain't over yet
Like i said, 
I can sleep when I'm dead

Ain't no fun if you ain't got money
So i always make it in to work
The trick is to leave at least a half hour to brush my teeth and change my shirt
Keep your closet full of red bull and visine to hide the red
I don't need to rest
I can sleep when I'm dead

If there's somethin goin on within a hundred miles of home
You're gonna hear my V8 sing
As long as i can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and i'm too young
And the night ain't over yet
Like I said, I can sleep when I'm dead

When i get tired, I go to bed
All that i can say is that it hasn't happened yet

If there's somethin goin on within a hundred miles of home
You're gonna hear my V8 sing
As long as i can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young
And the night ain't over yeat
Like I said, Like I said, Like I said

I can sleep when I'm dead---Lyrics submitted by Meme.
