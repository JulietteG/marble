Chorus: 
You always come
You always answer calls
When I call you come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call you come
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.

I don't even have to question if it's real or not,
You're right there all times,
Even when my car brooked down in the parking lot
You were there! 
You didn't start out or hesitate,
You come to my rescue once again
Like that.

Chorus: 
You always answer calls
When I call you come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call you come
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.

Look up in there
It's a beautiful man with a kind heart
And a multiple degree in leaves
We took a ride to the nearest open air,
Didn't have a spare
And now we're here.
Talking about the last bottle'
Of a longest good night.

Chorus: 
You always answer calls
When I call you come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call you come
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You come.

Even when my friends at the party, uh, uh
And everybody's around me
I don't feel, still lonely.
You come to mine
I see your eyes, I see your smile
And I'm alright for a little while longer

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Hello!)

Chorus: 
You always answer calls
When I call you come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call you come
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.
You always answer calls
When I call you come.
You always answer my calls, 
When I call,
You always come.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
