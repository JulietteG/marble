(Bridge x2)
There is power, power
Here in this hour, this hour
We are all together, together
Waiting here as one

(Chorus)
Whoa, hear the sound from heaven!
Whoa, a mighty rushing wind!
Whoa, we're calling for revival!
God let Your fire fall again,
It's burning in my soul!
Burning in my soul

(Verse)
All Your sons and Your daughters 
Dreaming the dreams of their father
Seeing the signs and the wonders, 
The kingdom of God

(Chorus)
Whoa, hear the sound from heaven!
Whoa, a mighty rushing wind!
Whoa, we're calling for revival!
God let Your fire fall again,
It's burning in my soul!
Burning in my soul

I cannot contain it, it's fire inside
I cannot contain it, so let it shine
I cannot contain it, this light of mine 

It's burning in my soul
Hear the sound from heaven!
Whoa, a mighty rushing wind!
Whoa, we're calling for revival!
God let Your fire fall again,
It's burning in my soul!
Burning in my soul

It's burning in my soul!
(start a fire in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)

(Bridge)
There is power, power
Here in this hour, this hour
We are all together, together
Waiting here as one

Waiting here as one
Waiting here as one

Spirit fall
Let Your fire fall
Let Your spirit fall
Were together now
We are not in this place
We are one
We are one

(Verse)
All Your sons and Your daughters 
Dreaming the dreams of their father
Seeing the signs and the wonders, 
The kingdom of God

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
