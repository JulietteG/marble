Here I quiet my soul
You are all that I seek
Still with in me the worries of life
Here my heart is at peace

And I draw near
I draw near to You
Jesus, I do
You draw near
You draw near to me

Here I lay my life down
Cast my cares at Your feet
Jesus,here in this moment with You
I have all that I need

Jesus, You alone are my hiding place
My all in all
My everything

Miracle of miracles
That I can come close to You
That I can come near to You
That I can come near to You
The door is open
You made a way
Thank You, Jesus
Oh, we praise Your name
Oh, the door is open
You made a way
Thank You Jesus
Oh, we bless Your name---
