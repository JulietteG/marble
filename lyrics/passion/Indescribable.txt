Verse 1 
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea 
Creation's revealing Your majesty 
From the colors of Fall to the fragrance of Spring 
Every creature unique in the song that it sings 
All exclaiming 

Chorus 1 
Indescribable, uncontainable 
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name 
You are amazing God 
All powerful, untamable 
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim 
You are amazing God 

Verse 2 
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go 
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow 
Who imagined the sun and gave source to its light 
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night 
None can fathom 

Chorus 2 
Indescribable, uncontainable, 
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name 
You are amazing God 
Incomparable, unchangeable 
You see the depths of my heart, and You love me the same 
You are amazing God---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
