To the king of glory and light
All praises
To the only giver of life
Our maker
The gates are open wide
We worship You

Come see what love has done
Amazing
He bought us with His blood
Our savior
The cross has overcome
We worship You

Shout Hosanna
Jesus, He saves
Shout Hosanna
He rose from the grave
Come and lift him up
Hosanna

Now let the lost be found
Forgiven
Death could not hold Him down
He's risen
So let the saints cry out
We worship You

The same power
That rolled the stone away
The same power
Alive in us today
King Jesus, we call upon your name
No other name

Come and lift him up
Hosanna---
