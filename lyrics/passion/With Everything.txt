Name above names
Lamb that was slain
Beautiful God
The king above kings
God of all things
Beautiful God

And there is no other Name
Like Jesus
Give You all of the praise
Oh Lord Jesus

So let hope rise 
And darkness tremble
In Your holy light 
That every eye will see
Jesus our God 
Great and mighty to be praised

God of all days
Glorious in all of Your ways
Majesty and wonder and grace
In the light of Your Name

So let hope rise 
And darkness tremble
In Your holy light 
That every eye will see
Jesus our God 
Great and mighty to be praised

With everything With everything
We will shout for Your glory
With everything With everything
We will shout forth Your praise

And our hearts they cry
Be glorified
Be lifted high above all names
For You our King
With everything
We will shout forth Your praise!

Oh...OhOhOh
