Son of God, son of man
His life poured out for all
See His hands, see His scars
His love can't be denied

Our God is high
And lifted up

It is the cross, my only plea
The blood He shed delivers me
Our savior's arms
Are open wide
A love so great
The cross of Christ

Every debt, all we owe
He bears it as His own
Brought to life
We are free
To live in Christ alone

See the lamb of God
See the Father's love
All to Jesus we owe
He paid it all

It is the cross---
