You're the Lord Almighty
Your every word is sure
And in Your love unfailing
I'm safe when oceans roar
Yes, Im safe when oceans roar

My anchor forever
My shelter within the storm
You're my Deliverer
You never falter
Yes, Youre the Rock I stand on

Here with-in the struggle
Oh and every crashing wave
You are more than able
And Your hand is strong to save
Yes, I know your hand is strong to save

I hold onto You
And You hold onto me, Jesus
I hold onto You
And You hold onto me, My Jesus
I hold onto You forever
And You hold onto me
Cause Youre my

My anchor, forever
My shelter within the storm
You're my De-liver-er
You never falter
Yes, You're the Rock I stand on, yes
You're the Rock I stand on
You're the Rock I stand on---
