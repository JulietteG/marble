My heart hangs on every word that You speak
I need You, Lord come find me, Holy Sprit breathe
I've been walking through deserts
I need more of Your Presence
I'm weak Savior be my strength

Down in the valley, when waters rise
I'm still believing
Hope is alive
All through the struggle and darkest day
I'll remember the empty grave

Your touch bringing me closer
Your hand healing whats broken
My prayer, Father meet me here
My life for all of Your glory
Your grace let it surround me
Let faith change the atmosphere

Down in the valley, when waters rise
I'm still believing
Hope is alive
All through the struggle and darkest day
I'll remember the empty grave

Hallelujah, death is done
All of heaven's overcome
Jesus, You are alive

Down in the valley, when waters rise
I'm still believing
Hope is alive
All through the struggle and darkest day
I'll remember the empty grave---
