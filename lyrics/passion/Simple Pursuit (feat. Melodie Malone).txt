God take us back, the place we began
The simple pursuit of nothing but You
The innocence of a heart in Your hands
God take us back, oh God, take us back

To an unswerving faith in the power of Your name
A heart beating for Your kingdom to reign
A church that is known for Your presence again
God take us back

Nothing and no one comes close to You
Nothing could ever come close
Nothing and no one; it's You, and You only live
Nothing could ever come close

Keep our hearts real, keep Your grace close
You're bringing us back
You're bringing us home

To an unswerving faith in the power of Your name
A heart beating for Your kingdom to reign
A church that is known for Your presence again
God take us back

Nothing and no one comes close to You
Nothing could ever come close
Nothing and no one; it's You, and You only live
Nothing could ever come close

To an unswerving faith in the power of Your name
A heart beating for Your kingdom to reign
A church that is known for Your presence again
God take us back

Nothing and no one comes close to You
Nothing could ever come close
Nothing and no one; it's You, and You only live
Nothing could ever come close---
