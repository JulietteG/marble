[Verse 1:]
Lord I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You're the one that guides my heart

[Chorus:]
Lord, I need You, oh I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

[Verse 2:]
Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are Lord I am free
Holiness is Christ in me
Yes where You are Lord I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

[Bridge:]
So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus You're my hope and stay
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus You're my hope and stay---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
