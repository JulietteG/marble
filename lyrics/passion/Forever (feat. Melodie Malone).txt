The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse
Upon Him

One final breath He gave
As heaven looked away
The song of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
A war on death was waged
The power of Hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love
Could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected king
Has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

He is alive
He is alive
He has overcome
He has overcome
Death is overcome
Death is overcome

We sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
The lamb has overcome

Hallelujah
He is alive
The veil is torn, our debt is paid
Hallelujah
He is alive---
