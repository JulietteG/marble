I realize the way your eye's decieved me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers hat you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of

Paper Roses, Paper Roses, Oh
How real those roses seem to be, But they're
Only imitation, Like your imitation love for me

I though that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart

Paper Roses, Paper Roses, Oh
How real those roses seem to be, But they're
Only imitation, Like your imitation love for me---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
