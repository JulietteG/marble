[CHORUS]Krizz Kaliko 

I see shadows on the road again wonder if they comin for my soul 
i get trapped up in this mode again and will i ever grow old 
and will i ever grow old 

[Verse one]Tech N9ne 

I member them high nights 
on ex we find sights 
to climb heights 
unheard to men we lined white 
molly up and had a benign flight 
mix it with weed and wet its Cronkite 
that shits beyond height 
sped us up and we be tripin seeing some shit 
its fuckin up the buzz of me and the click 
so we hop up in the whip and flee with the quick 
but a shadow make us swerve and we on the strip 
did you see the shit 
yeah i saw the shit 
did y'all see the shit 
yeah we saw the shit 
all agree that a shadow was crossing the street then immediately vanished we need a hit 

[CHORUS] 

I see shadows on the road again wonder if they comin for my soul 
i get trapped up in this mode again and will i ever grow old 
and will i ever grow old 

[Verse two]Tech N9ne 

is it coming for me because of all the shit i did in the past 
was bad to people 
mad and evil 
if your the A.O.D I'm sad to meet you 
angel of death when i quit doing ex 
because of seeing you every night on the stretch 
so Ive been clean for three... 
years and counting still I'm seeing shadows will they shceme for me 
to fallow them into the pit of dis pare 
punishment for what i did in this lare 
what if evil spirits live in the road 
to take the kindle spirits brother's and souls 
i don't know how the spirit thing goes 
realer livin in my frontal lobe 
will i be living life until I'm old 
or will i be takin by shadows on the road 

[CHORUS] 

I see shadows on the road again wonder if they comin for my soul 
i get trapped up in this mode again and will i ever grow old 
and will i ever grow old---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
