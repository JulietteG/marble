(verse 1) 

hey, it's time to get into some sin 
you been listenin' to gibberish hits in the interum 
them are done, 'cause here me come 
so make you stand up, stand tough 
hands up, damn ya 
if you don't get it get rid off it, trip if you diggin' it* 
i guess i got more than my balls and my word 
i got broads in a herd, chasin' this and all on my nerve 
they the illness, they feel this* 
realness, chill bitch 
i got this bed it's too crowded for you to come get in it 
i spit that tech shiezter off to yall 
it's crazy, even michael jackson said "it's off the wall" 
i brought the sickness, big checks 
live less, midwest 
i be the best, don't forget that nobody can get with this 
so when you see me in the spot, bow down trick 
i eat, drink, sleep, dress, look and sound rich 
so jump up, get funked up 
crunked up, everyone must 
stop with the jealously with me the haters be riveted 

(pre chorus)

yeah, i think they with me mang,

but when we indie's drop all our records we will dub 
having a good time's a stackin' with travis be laid back 
tour' about a hundred and fifty per slap and i made bat

i got ozone, murderdog, double XL and drug accounts 
(so whats all the fuss* about) Killer in and remorse out* 
fuck on ceramia you heard that from the horse's mouth 
it ain't comin' from RBC it ain't comin' from fontana 
it's comin' from strange music's dontana in a clown manner 
i take it from baritone, record this it's on chedda 
honey you in your dreams, you wake up screamin' in falsetta* 
MTV clipped me, birthday bash show 
i got fans like cat castro, that'll boost my cash flow 
MTV completely we sick of it,

To see in my eyes, and my blood and my ligiments* 
you can see that tecca nina don't give a shit
