(Krizz)
As the sun falls, darkness shall come

(Tech N9ne)
How do I describe my pain/ It just rains n it rains at the same time flame/ I am bane, insane in my veins no restrants can change or contain me. I'm dangrous/ When I gave you my light it was wrong, wasn't right, n no love was inside when I need it/ So I run with the night and the songs that I write'll be violent, it wont be defeated/

Its jet black in my brain cuz the hatred you gave me has turn me to twisted/ You don't like this, suck my dick, all the kids with the siccness been waitin for this shit/

I wanna get into the mind of your youngest/ Fill it with fungus and grow it til its humungous/ Psycho alumnis, the tip of the tongue slip, urgin the punk bitch eat shit from your dumb pig!

Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, I consume all the light in the day/
Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away/

I've got this cloud inside thats consumin my mind, all the brown in my eyes are desolving - Into the whites of my eyes, now the night will arise and I'm hype cuz the beast is evolving/ Step in to my dreams lot of bleeding, and semen and green rotted demons/ And they feed their seeds collic greens, full of feces and cheese pieces of human ceribrum, these evening/

(Stay awake) Cuz everything I touch - turns to mold/
(If you want me) And everything I fuck - straight explodes

Are we there yet? Are you scared yet? You got that pussy in your pants, wanna share dat? Let me in I'mma rip it then I'mma tear that/ I'm tryin to eat it, bitch, where the muthafuckin hair at?!

Heat swells, teet tells, everybody eat nails, sleep well/ Held the gun, I come, to attack everyone/ You little crumbs, all are done/ I'mma blacken the sun/

Allah banish it, damage it, can you manage to vanish cuz you like Anakin man it, damn it its no panicin/ when I eat your soul, he's north pole, that mean I'll be more cold, freeze more slow, fourty be-low/

Piss, lava, an' quarvo/ Plus hobinero/ Now chug it! Burn the head to their toes, I will not spare those/ I love it!

This is the result of you! Thinkin I'm queer. Callin me weird. Thinkin I'm devil so you niggas don't cheer. I don't give a fuck whut you think of Tecca Ninna this year!

Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away---Lyrics submitted by Clinton.
