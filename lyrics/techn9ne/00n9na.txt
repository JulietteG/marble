[Intro:]
wake up in the mornin' with my better half
on a boat lift the covers, then i pet her ass
never know when i gotta go, cause my life is impossible
the way i live it, the good things never last
so i live for the minute, just wanna start ta begin it
when i wake up again I'm on stage rockin'
twenty thousand people they yellin' feedin' at my ego
when it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin'

[Verse 1:]
Double O N9na
known for dippin'
from place to place
i gotta decate the mission
gotta get the money, but what do you know
i wake up in a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
hollywood movie with the jackass cats
i close my eyes
i open' em and I'm back at rap
in the studio collabin' killin' whack ass crap
but then in a blink i wake up, and i pack that strap
in the club, cause some other niggas want my head
i don't know to much about' em, but they want my red
i ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killers in blue start me
wake up again, I'm at dj clue party
with diddy and jim jones
jewell and rick ross
cafe trey songs, and drake this is boss
amazin' life's hella crazy livin' like I'm a quatro triple double agent

[Chorus:]
Double O N9na
where I'm about ta go i don't even know
Double O N9na
in a place where almost anything goes
Double O N9na
many roads when I travel this what i chose
Double O N9na
the way I'm livin' I really got to many roads

[Verse 2:]
me i alotta women, but didn't need me
wake up trying ta hide it, but sin seize me
over seas nigga tryin' ta begin freaky
wake up at the awards of MTV-u
then i stash up a tour, wake up in back of ma zou
i get ta mackin' a few
after the yack i take' em to the sack, and i screw
scat then back to the lab i got some rappin' ta do
then i wake up again I'm on stage at pay due
this characteristic is made to slay crews
some try to get at me to battle, but they lose
then I'm waking up with my kids on a paid cruise
they callin' me daddy
wake up at the strip club they callin' me daddy
man I'm goin' hella baddy
amazin' life's hella crazy livin' like I'm a quatro triple double agent

[Chorus:]
Double O N9na
where I'm about ta go i don't even know
Double O N9na
in a place where almost anything goes
Double O N9na
many roads when I travel this what i chose
Double O N9na
the way I'm livin' I really got to many roads

[Verse 3:]
at any rate I'm all over the place
music ain't big enough father, and the mode that i made
got me feelin' moon stricken, but need remain calm
livin' like I'm out of a scene from James Bond
switch it, change it, feel it, strange it
livin' multiple lives, rappin', and gang bangin'
freakin' all over the world, middle west swangin'
always on the move ain't never time for hangin'
slip with my shit, my grip don't fold
pick the fly chicks, and ditch those hoes
kiss from my bitch, my kids get dough
rippin' my scripts, i hits this road
Double O N9na nigga, i loves this grind
doin' alotta good, and mud this time
dippin' all over the planet tellin' the bitches the name is N9ne...
Tech N9ne

[Chorus:]
Double O N9na
where I'm about ta go i don't even know
Double O N9na
in a place where almost anything goes
Double O N9na
many roads when I travel this what i chose
Double O N9na
the way I'm livin' I really got to many roads---Lyrics submitted by gus.
