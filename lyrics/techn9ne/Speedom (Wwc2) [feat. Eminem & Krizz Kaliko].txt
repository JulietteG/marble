I get to busting like I'm a thirty-aught-six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard they got pissed
When I got at the top then made 'em pretty hot
Cause they knowin' that Tecca Ninna's the dirty chop (chopp-er)
Hes handled, Holmes, heres a handful
How in the hell he hoverin', havin' hell and go ham though
I said to Seven, "Richard Havens'll be the man"
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, "what we doin'?," I said to 'im, "let's chop"
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling - you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
Ive got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a given, I heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em out
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton to make 'em be impotent
If and when I'm flippin, niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pick a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than your figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We bleed em, beat 'em, till they be gone, feed 'em

Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)
Speedom!
(I'mma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom!
(I must be the one to bust)
Speedom!
(And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

Sometimes, I feel
Like I'll never slow down
Worldwide Choppers

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstacy pills next to me
In the seats spilled, or did she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in lights
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
This thing I penned up inside when I went up inside
A Finnegan's diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
Thatll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up bein'
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guys wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
Cause when I pick up a pen Im venomous
And Im as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
Youve been yelling dementedness
I invented this, Im the Genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss you
Never consider this a bit of disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll
Be just like a certificate of authenticity
That Im thinkin about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and Im picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like its my job to say
That youre not a real artist, but its my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the..

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict whos having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it---
