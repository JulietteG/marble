If you see me lookin' clean cut
Matchin' from head to toe dippin' with a mean strut
Throwin' and blowin' green stuff hella creamed up with a bling cup
Ain't no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up

If you, see me step off in the clubber with some pros
With about 6 of 'em cut no longer waiting to be chose
And if you hear me tell my homies anything goes 
With these chickens dippin' to Davy's right when the clubber close

If you see me on the grind getting' mine
If you bust in the room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line

If I'm rollin' on dubs, if it's K-Town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them hatas giving me mugs, ladies giving me hugs
It ain't no rocket science it's because

I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
Oh oh I'm a playa
[Repeat 2x]

I'm a playa in every sense of the word ya heard
I'm getting' money from these dummies flip your chick so absurd
I'm a playa and I pop collars
I'm a playa when I don't or when I do drop dollars them rot weilders

She don't want no softy sayin' he do when he don't
She don't want no perpetrating 9 to fiver trying to flaunt
She don't want no punk that can't get it krunk
No she don't that's how it go so my homie Kaliko tell'em what she want

She want a playa not thugs on dubs
We be rollin' them 22's and 3's pop ludes and V's
I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute Kaliko knock boots gots lots to shoot

Im pullin out the latex and given it to who's next
And fool'em pull a brewnet wit unforgettable sex
She's oohin-oohin' sweat and I ain't telling who's wet
And I ain't getting loose yet so who's next 4 group sex

I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
Oh oh I'm a playa
[Repeat 2x]

Listen closely this is something you might not know
Never ever tell ya love where else you get your love
Move in groups no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies throw away your ticket stub

If you sexin' learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water don't put no soap on your wash cloth
That way when you get home no questions you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent

Don't tell a #2 that she's your one and only
Cause if she know it's way easy to go her own way
If you taking chickens to your secret home hey
Always go the back way to confuse'em just take the long way

To all the ladies if you playin' throw ya hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw ya grands up
This is 4-eva baby having clever thangs I'm a playa
Mother fucker and I bet I'll never change


I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
Oh oh I'm a playa
