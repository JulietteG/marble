Ya it's like the ultimate party favor baby ya know
two cups to get her hot and out of her clothes ya know
Caribou lou

It's like
151 rum
Pineapple juice, and Malibu, caribou, get them all numb
Make baby girl come
Out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop till the cops come

Half a bottle of 151
Off of the jug one cup of and Malibu rum
Baby that's what's up
Then you fill the rest of the jug
With pineapple juice, and it's cracking
The only defect is waking up like "what happened?"
I like red light parties and fed right bodies
Who like, bread like dolly and head right totties at night?
Aribou kay
Ou-la
Terrible day
You pay the liquor store teller with no hair-or tupay
Tu shay.
Get the party jumping
Keep the hotties humping
I like them thick and juicy
So don't palatte nothing
Drinking to much lou
You might be karate punching
Or at the back of the club
attending the naughty lunchin
Satin,
Kool-aid get you hella 151
November dog
So run kitty run
We gon' drink it until we dumb Diddy dum
Bum biddy bum
Here Kansas city come so give me some...

151 rum
Pineapple juice, and and Malibu, caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, outta her shell and raise hell
Don't stop till the cops come

I see double
I see triple
Might be trouble
Might see pistols
We ain't trying to hear you hata's sucking on sickles
We living it up in to double it up on sizzles?
One to your maybro
Unto your day go
Why I'm the one to drink it
Under the table
And all the ladies that were doing time
Want you to become a member of my drinking club
You will find Tech N9ne
Trying to tell her truly get nudey
Yes I even do el words
In the fruity bazoodi
Like to drink it and yell slurs at the movie
If I'm heated, I'm off to get a caribou lou to cool me
(created) by tech nizzle and t-wizzle
One high day.
We mixed it up
And then I say we drink caribou-bizzle like I ladie
Originated in Kansas city, Missouri
Since 19-95 baby.


151 rum
Pineapple juice, and Malibu, caribou, get them all numb
Make baby girl come
Out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop till the cops come

Pineapple juice, and Malibu, caribou, get them all numb
Make baby girl come
Out of her shell and raise hell

151 rum
Pineapple juice, and Malibu, caribou, get them all numb
Make baby girl come
Out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop till the cops come

Tar bender I need a drother nink
Release caribou lou and the party is utter kink
Insane mainy
Keep 'em coming then I'll remain zainy
Cause I'd say baby
I'm trying to make you my main gamey?
For the rest of the night
Girl you sexy and tight
Come to mi casa and see these shock reflects and your right
Groupies at 12 o' clock
Man I'm prowl I'll go
Ya I'll recruit 'em
But ain't betten on crap and thats all I know
Yeap in my white tee and Nike's
You might sight me slightly heifin
Might see dry heave
Die we shall not need i-v's
Beside me Siamese
(tech, huh, you not making any sense)
I might make her wanna swa-wing a Prada
But once I get up on 'em I can do my thing I gotta
Hey batta batta batta batta swa-ing a batta
He cannot he cannot he cannot swa-wing a batta

Pineapple juice, and Malibu, caribou, get them all numb

I'd like to give a big shout out to caribou lou
Because I drink it
And they ain't payin' me for it
At least not yet---Lyrics submitted by shelby.
