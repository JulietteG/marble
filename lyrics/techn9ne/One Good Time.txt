Just give me one good time 
Nobody is looking at me anyway 
Nobody is looking at me anyway 
Yo 
Yo 
I know that Im Hardcore 
Know how to start wars 
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight 
Cause toughness is our floor 
Warriors that bond more 
But this one is far tore up on this night 
Some people show it 
And then 
Some people hide it 
But other people 
Do it whenever they get excited 
But me 
I cant even do it 
When the wrongs on mind 
Im saying i been trying to do it for a long long time 
i get jealous when i see people do it 
And its like fluid 
Im thinking 
How can they swallow that 
When I cant even chew it 
I guess 
God seen it fit 
To label me the consouller 
bestowed upon a bro and forever be the shoulder 
My mission is plain to see 
Its freaking insanity 
Im wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why cant it be 
Simple cause on the real 
This one could die 
So Im asking god 
Before I go 

Just give me one good cry 

If I could cry maybe one good time i could wash away all my pain 
And maybe free my mind 
After my shows its a lonely road 
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul 
No bodys looking at me anyway 
Just give me one good time 
No bodys looking at me anyway 

Why I got to be the one to cheer up 
People till they clear up 
When I sneeze I tear up 
And then I go look in a mirror 
So I can see how it looks 
When I really wanna know how it feels 
When Im hella down I try to push 
No matter how hard no water spills 
For real 
My patients is soon to go 
waiting for the balloon to blow 
Im thinking back to when i used to go to funerals 
No matter how close we were 
On the inside it aint wild 
Others be losing it 
Im just wishing I could just break down 
And I been to a lot of them 
And theres not a one 
That went on and got it done 
No moisture that even try even to come 
And this aint no tough thing, because Ive had enough pain 
Tears should be runnin like mustangs 
Man it must rain 
Been trying for years 
But the crying been inside 
N the ninas so serious there aint no lying in his eyes 
Makes me so furious 
When I look n im a genocide 
Please let me break down with the pain i felt when Brian Dennis died 

If I could cry maybe one good time i could wash away all my pain 
And maybe free my mind 
After my shows its a lonely road 
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul 
No bodys looking at me anyway 
Just give me one good time 
No bodys looking at me anyway 

I look at actors crying 
Its as easy as fondue 
But what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you? 
Real life aint no movie homie 
And this aint Jon woe 
But I almost lost it on the ending of Jon q 
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew 
But Im still waiting for that real emotion to come thru 
But then maybe I could get a cry god 
Maybe one too 
Been red for life for the first time ever 
Me want blue 
Give me the blues 
Sometimes I turn on the news 
And I 
Look at all these feuds 
Then I try to make them ooze 
but no cry 
no tear drops from your eyes 
poetry's music oh my 
almost make me tear up when thinkin about my children, no lie 
Maybe Im black hearted 
You thinking damn he shady 
Saying man he crazy 
For the way I abandon me lady 
One day she can repay me 
Yes that woman can betray me 
Then ill probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe 

If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain 
And maybe free my mind 
After my shows its a lonely road 
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul 
No bodys looking at me anyway 
Just give me one good time 
No bodys looking at me anyway---Lyrics submitted by Justice.
