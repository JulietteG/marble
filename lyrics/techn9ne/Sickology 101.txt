Hey, Now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit, Get the fuck out! 
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit, Get the fuck out! 
For those who love raw shit, Welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is Tech N9ne! 

[Tech N9ne]
This the style
I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick
Mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern
Bust up that quick Midwest chatter
And some people hate but it ain't matterin
But the people gather it's flattering
Switching the pitch, Mixing
There's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission for bliss
When I be ripping this shit, Make it exciting
Gotta be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding
If you're gonna be biting, You're igniting the beast

This is melodic melodies
If you got it, Mix it hot as tamales
You singing off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, You need to stop it
Have confidence, Speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it

This is harmony, N9na's taking you through it
Make it buttery, Utterly beautiful, Make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin muthafuckaz in music
That's how we do it

[Chorus]
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, This is sickology
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
From our West Coast instructor, Crooked I

[Crooked I]
My killer Dayton's
They keep me crushing the competition
Coming correct when creating the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier
Got a crooked coppa missing
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant cotenant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty, If I'm thurstay
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language gotta do whatever my verse say

So if you want to learn to rap, This is how (This is how)
Right now I'm putting swag in my style (In my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (And a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes gotta be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, 
This song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Chorus]
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, This is sickology
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
From our East Coast instructor, Chino XL

[Chino XL]
Everybody start locking your windows and doors
Chino might get in
It's like lightning and hounds striking a trifling riflemen
Bullets flying up and I'm numb in the bum, Like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine
He could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdling blood
Don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction
Like when the branch is heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, Industry hate me
Yo, I'd rather hear Hannah Montana
Than half of you rappers on the radio
Startin drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, That's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man with a sick delivery
Like I drive a coroner van

I'm demented, Spitting rhythm's as sick as I can
Grenade gripping, Fitting to detonate Disneyland
I am teaching Sickology
Try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Chorus]
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, This is Sickology
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Yes, I gotta be vicious, This is Sickology

[Outro]
For those who don't know what the fuck's goin on
This is sickology 101
You punk muthafuckaz
Ha, ha, ha
Let's kill these niggaz---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
