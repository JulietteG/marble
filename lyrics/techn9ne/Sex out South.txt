[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kaliko (2X)]
Sex out south-some hit in and out
Screamin n cussin-some bustin it out
Sex out south-some freaks comin out
Sex o s is what it's all about

[Verse 1: Kutt Kalhoun]
I got this bitch named Janae from Olathe
Baby girl was flavor
Bitch is in sexual favors
Told me I could take it
Got a fettish addicted to pain
Wanted me to choke her
While she sat on my dick came
All over the sofa
But this hoe from the o she was cold
Didn't like to swallow it
A pull to the back of the throat
Kept a bitch from vomittin
She begged for a dick in her ass
Baby liked it anal
But my head was too big for her ass
So I used my fingers
Down to Dallas with Rita & Alice
White and Phillipino
One on my dick and one tossin my salad
Off in the casino
Real sex ain't got shit on these vets
Told em they could keep me
Even thought about writin the check
I'm coocoo for a threezy
To all em bitches and hoes that leave your life unexposed
You better peak this out south bitches as pros
If you don't know how it goes
You besta follow your nose
Get on some freak shit
Now follow as the story is told
It's like..

[Chorus x2]
Sex out south-some hit in and out
Screamin n cussin-some bustin it out
Sex out south-some freaks comin out
Sex o s is what it's all about

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I know you heard that I talk allota shit about a bitch
But I'm bout to swerve this time
Talk about a differnt kinda chick
The ones who love the dick constantly in an out
Even like to put it in her mouth
And I'm not talkin bout northbound bitches I'm talkin about those bitches down south
You can find em in the 50's all the way to Grandview
You can get em up in Overland Park and Olathe
Thank you for the paper
Never given a fuck about what your bitch is thinking pety shit is second nature
Throw em in the mix nigga fuck em witha friend
They will be callin you so you can do it again
You ain't gotta spend ain't gotta pretend
Call her up and tell her you needa put it in
And not just white
There's hella beautiful back bitches
Give it from the back
They lovin the dick too
Down north women
They hate the bitch brew
I know you don't like what I'm sayin but it's true
And ya'll be fuckin the bitches like we be fuckin the bitches
We be out for the pussy and we rockin you bitches
Nothing you never could tall a nigga could be stoppin nigga
Cause I ain't had enough of you bitches
Now sex down south
When you put it in her mouth
And you don't need help from hitch
You can find em in a house of six
Pretty damn thing with one and switch
Any other women hatin
Got a nigga waitin for that weak shit you pitch
Play that shit
The down bitch quit it sit down sweat it skited now bitch!

[Chorus x2]
Sex out south-some hit in and out
Screamin n cussin-some bustin it out
Sex out south-some freaks comin out
Sex o s is what it's all about

[Verse 3: Big Krizz Kaliko]
I'm talkin bout chick set center
Where I'm from
St. Theresa's, Bishop Hogan up in her
Hickman Mills, Ruskin; they the ones I be tusslin with
Now I'm a get mine and I'm hopin you get get yours before I THROUGH!
Cause cale be mackin them hoes fast
An if ya lucky ya be getcha a peice of evil ass WOOO!
With the red bombs
Cause them the ones I love out south get my head gone
And they never wanna let me pull it out with the min on
So I'm pullin the rubber out
When I need it I'm takin the southern route
And it was late at night clutch your lady tight
Or me and my niggas out south!
Get it with no dought
Sit it your mouth
If ya with it then baby let me hit it down south!
Still I got too many bitches that I posed to me
And the ladys really lookin like they hoes to me
Like a lova
I got to get some more of her
Oochee koochie the way you do me
You really give it to me when we be under the cover
Felicia-O I'm glad to meet ya
But when you kiss this bitch they go balistic
They troublin for some head get to rockin the bed
Heard a southside screamin SOUTHSIDE!

[Chorus x2]
Sex out south-some hit in and out
Screamin n cussin-some bustin it out
Sex out south-some freaks comin out
Sex o s is what it's all about---Lyrics submitted by latisha mims.
