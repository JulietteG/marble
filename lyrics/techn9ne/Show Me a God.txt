[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
Ey
My momma, my momma, my momma is so tormented
She been through trauma, more drama
The dawn is gone, it's more tinted
On this side it get's out of it
How does a prophet who loved God as his father's slippin' to get the bottomless side of it
How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas like she an athiest
Maybe it's the faith that is makin' this lady as crazy and has made me this skeptic
Next threat is Lupis on top of Epiliptic, Never rested
Psychiatrist forever tested, Reverend blessed it
Brethren, Heaven, Tech is beggin' for effin' X-Mas
Hopin' momma ain't left an exit
It better get better quick, how you let her get sick with bread invested
In the church every sunday
I've been searchin' for one way
Or another, you're gonna have to curse me or burst me with a sunray
To let me know that you're coming or en route
I'm 'bout ninety-nine, but I need a hundred percent proof
 [Hook]
Show me a God
Ahh
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a God
Ahh
And if it is, why ain't He doin' His job
Show me a God
Ahh
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a God, please
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

[Verse 2]
Where was the Passion of Christ
What happened to passin' his life for the masses
Bad, it ain't happenin' twice
'Cause my mother's stacked in a lab and its stagnant at nights
I need your help, and I'm not askin' it nice
All in life it's been paramedics
All my life comin' up all I heard "Is There A Medic?"
A youngin', all I could do is stare at it 
Seizure after seizure, if I was you
Wouldn't ne'er let it be heredit-tary
If Aar get it, I swear that it's scary
Sittin' in a insane asylum
God or God's Ghost, man I aim to find 'em
To take away all of this angel's pain inside, come rain
If Momma go, how come I can't deny them
And she only fifty-four, in a ward watchin' her war
And it's more blood and gore, and she tore, cuz people are so deceivin'
And I'm on the floor, because with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor
Havin' all the soldiers screamin' 
[Hook]
Show me a God
Ahh
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a God
Ahh
And if it is, why ain't He doin' His job
Show me a God
Ahh
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a God, please
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

[Verse 3]
Think about how all the victims of Katrina feelin'
They need a ceilin', they say that Mother Nature, she the villain
Plead a million, the bible, I read a bllion, Still I'm free to see the real
And my feet are grillin', 'cause hellish heat is buildin' up
Think my momma ain't ill enough? It's killin' us
I will erupt if they're pillin' her false, still ain't no healin' her
I been searchin' for answers, but I find nothin' but man stuff
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand bruh
Or whatever it is, I will never forgive
Anybody who take Marty, better get her to live
She's so sick that it don't matter how much cheddar I give
To the thing or the lady, here's a letter to his
Majesty, why ain't you stoppin' these tragedies
My mother's glad to be with you, but her life's been a raggedy one
What's gonna be done in two thousand twelve when hell's gonna be
When the Earth aligned with the sun

[Hook]
Show me a God
Ahh
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a God
Ahh
And if it is, why ain't He doin' His job
Show me a God
Ahh
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a God, please
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

[Outro]
That's why I be lookin' for ghosts
Or somethin' supernatural. The only thing I know Supernatural, is the rapper
Maybe if I saw something like that it'd make me change my life or somethin'
Now let's get into K.O.D....---Lyrics submitted by sheldon.
