(feat. Krizz Kaliko)

[Intro]
The Hole
Click Click
Mmmmmm Uuuurr no I cant do it (can't do it, can't do it)
Fuck this
Click Click
I gotta, I wanna
MMM

[Verse 1]
My pain killer's in my dresser
Right next to my rester
What insane brain would agree to this gesture
Too unjest less stress left with no extra
You's a mess, true depressed steps can infect ya
I'm a product of some shit gone wrong
Even though I speak to many with a hit song tone
Even though I'm famous and I'm givin' chicks long dong
Man I feel like a copper top just a sick stone drone
One flew over the cuckoos nest
And he cashed some buku checks
But he was not mentally stable the crew new tech
As a phenomenon but karma wanna noose dude's necks
Designer of death get to choose who's next
Is it real to you but if you got evil your kind to come and steal a few
Condemn souls 'cause of what the old pain killer do
Keep having these dreams of my taking my nine milli
Who can help me execute this desire to pop a pill or two

[Hook]
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpess and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D.
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killer

[Verse 2]
My pain comes from me being a fuck up
With strange music we really, we lucked up
Cause being a lost soul got my bucks up
Even though my cerebral cortex and spirit needed a touch up
Everybody around me hurtin and shit
Well everybody on tv kickin it reject jerkin and shit
I'll be the one on stage and studios stressed out workin' and spit
This shit to the people and I know that I gotta alot of evil lurkin in quick
Women want me want me
So they flaunt thee monkey
Even doin' sex sometimes, a heap of stress still wants to haunt me
When I grab the yalk she couldn't talk and it was no humpty dumpty
Even though im sick in the head we kick it like a donkey don't we
My apology to anyone labeled a victim
And I'm losin' my mind I just picked up the nine and I gripped 'em
And I put it off in that direction like I was the kiss one
I always think of the day when I'm able to pull back and I click em

[Hook]
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D.
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killers

[Verse 3]
No meds for me
Just left for me
Any light inside my head is just to dead to see
Any kind of way out of this hole can I
Pull this darkness outta this soul
Lotta people really wanna know how it's so
Cause a lot of motherfuckers have been down this globe
And I'm one of them
You can see it on the television, everybody trippin' and it's a ton of em
Straight feelin' that pain go insane
Then bang and it ain't no none of em
Many ways to end these days
When the darkness really wanna shun the sun
Ten million ways to die when you constantly cry and the gun is one

[Hook]
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
(tired of getting my shit like this man, I'm done with this fucking music man)
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killers ---Lyrics submitted by Tedi LaBelle.
