And let me show you what I can do [x3]
Let me show you how fast I can get to your heart

Awh shit here we go again

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
When you met her
She was right so thick
Something better then a wife, no glitch
She won't stop ever, but she might go click
If you leave her you'll see a PSYCHO BITCH
Now she's callin your crib, at nights so sick
Wanna pop up and try ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbitt, Told her to slice yo dick
If you Ever break up with a Psycho bitch

[Verse I: Tech N9ne]
Don't give me that shit
But a nigga don't care, never could it be fair
Then I was up in a middle lover
Came a double dare when
I woke up
I was in a Mutha fuckin nightmare
How you ganna fuck me on Sunday
Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
You buggin, 
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off in your lovin'
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If sleep, don't leave it on, nigga, for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about menace
And now never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel, and selects
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yea
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Don't go thought with it
Be throught with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it.
You thinking you know women and your just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga, 
That in back, 
At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch

[Chorus:]
[Big Krizz Kaliko]
Pleeeease don't bring that Psycho shit to Meeeeee

["Psycho Bitch": II]
I love you now, don't you love me?

[Tech N9ne:]
Don't evea go down low with her
PSYCHO BITCH
But I'll never evea go out with her
PSYCHO BITCH
Everybody betta learn how to see a
PSYCHO BITCH
Never know when yo girl might be a Psycho

That bitch is Psycho II, Pyscho too
Kill em with a milli, put a knife in you
Twice in you
Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches [x2]

["Psycho Bitch":]
And I want you in my life forever... 

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yo
She poppin up at the club
Lookin for you with the rollers and
When push comes to shove
Here you go on the flo' with this hoe again
Psycho bitches never let it go
Trippin's enviable be ready to get up and go, WHY?
Because Tecca Ninna just ended the show
Breakin my Crib
Sniffin my draws
Lookin for white bitch hair on my balls
Trippin with chu
When you out with the family
She get it poppin right there in the mall
Fuck with a bitch is definite
Better watch who you stepping with
Fuck attention deficit
Better watch who the fuck you messin with
Just because I Fucked you that don't mean we getting married hoe
The way you sit around the corner from my house is scary though
Psycho bitch is when it comes to relationships are very slow
Bet chya'll never understand it's over till your buried Low
Oh, No
Don't me up on the myspace flippin out
Trippin with strippers you think I'm digging out
Me sayin that "I'll never be taken by the hands of another man"
Is a bad omen, cause you never know it might just be the hands of a women
PSYCHO BITCH

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne, Liquid Assassin]
[Tech N9ne:]
Stop callin me, never really wanna heart felt shit
You ain't healthy for me and bitch I'm on a health kick
Psycho bitches are self-destructive, weak, and helpless
I'm done with you Bitch, now you can let somebody else spit... 
[Liquid Assassin:]
She's so sick with it, I stick hit it, and dick fit it
Never did I think for a minute to quit, quit it
Chickens on the livin, and trippin to get hit it
Turn around flip and then get you into deep shitted
Pussy was imbedded and get it your indebted
You could make a penny or money the man said it
You can run a bitch by adjusting the antennas
But if she demand it your betta forget it
She's Psycho like Michael
You might go and wake up to knives and rifles
When your eyes closed she's liable
Like I know to move on you like Tae Bo
Even I know this sly hoe like rivals
Been turn you into five-Oh
Either that and your turn your back
And the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
Should have listen to phone call, just stop with them harassing threats
My envision was them draws and me plottin on having sex
Got me trippin, fist in a ball
I know something gon happened next
I'm a KILL THIS CRAZY BITCH AND GIVE HER BACK TO TECH
