Try to break through its like ill never (its like ill never make it)
Or make it better (let me take it)
Cant change the weather (yeah)
and im going back to where ive been
Hope somebody lets me in
I need shelter from myself
If you hear this please send help.

                  CHORUS X2
Cuz its raining in my head
Another storm another day
These little pills will change my mind
Cuz they dont make it go away
(keeps on rainin)
its over X17

Can only see myself is anybody here
(i aint even myself no more)
If you could be myself youd understand me clear
(cant pick myself up off the floor)
And if i died today itd take my pain away
Cuz it flooded (flooded)
and im drownin (drownin)
Well its liberating me

                   CHORUS X2

Lets find a way to run away from life,
Full of pain and strife
What direction im goin i cant tell now,
Mr. 7-20 Nina tell me im Hell bound
The IRS is on my ass for the check i didnt cash and the levy from child support, felt like i fell down.
So im lookin for exctacy pills, tech is the next to be thrilled, seconds from method we ill daily.
My brains cookin, the recipe will beckon, the best of me killed, sections of steppin, i feel crazy.
Hit the club in the night, with a lil bit of drug in my life, i miss your lovin real hyphy, im deliverin.
With my seat out my sight, seperated from my wife in the middle of a crisis in hives shakin and shiverin.
Rollin balls, im mulated im going dumb, now drinkin liquor, im faded and havin fun now.
Loaded gun and im trippin wit everyone around, keep me stuck in the sky, i never wana come down.
(its over X17)---Lyrics submitted by Elissa.
