[Intro]
Man lives in a sun lit world, of what he believes to be, reality.
But, there is unseen by most an underworld that is just as real.
But not, as brightly lit, a DARKSIDE! 

[Chorus]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.
(DARKNESS)
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
Run away.

[Tech N9ne]
I don't really give of fuck what you think of me I had it up to here, yep.
Follow me into another de-mention of insanity's right here, step.
I know your feelin' it I'm lovin' you when I'm kissin' n' fuckin' you in a minute I'm a veer, left.
An by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover and then I finish when your near, death.
I'm sorry, but I mean it cause when I got the tool on bitch I got bulimic.
Up in her like a gynecologist with a penis.
And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish.
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her I really rely on the feelin of the sex an the red of a woman.
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum I think it'll really get me up if I could be suckin your seratonin. 
I'd rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me.
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me n fucked with me.
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco. (backwards)Fuck you if devils are what you worship.
I can paint a dark picture.
You don't want me to start, with cha.
Don't want me commin with the heart, hit cha.
Chew you up and if you really tart, spit cha.
After the brain I put the lemon moraine in.
Blood of a dame is what I drain my fang's in.
Takein the spirit and the body it came in.
Away from the sun and forever you can remain in.

[Chorus x2]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.
(DARKNESS)
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
Run away.

[Dirtball]
When I'm all up on a pallet a pain with blood of my name in vain sun up in it
Imna break it down the walls n try to stop me from poppin my gun up in it
Skits onta me honor me for the time never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin like a
nice guy
Behind the face be the beast of another mutha fucka that be heard the least.
So many here me when I say they can, that I remember everybody that layd me astray. yo fuckem.
Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away. yo fuckm.
I'm to sick that I never checked outa my mental-ward working in sweden
Burin the bodies this song made my memory feedm ghost made me loud and I'm proud I can see them
I don't even wanna talk about it but I do it for the demons and the devils alive
Hopin' that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time
When I make a move when I'm commin through I'm a stay devoted to rhyme [x9]
Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked I'm a be forever de-dine
Picture this my wrist silt pissed off I'm hangin from a meat hook,
Yo I'm bangin on a meat hook it's the twist this chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a
main hook book
I'm tellin everybody I'm not doin so well I'm feelin my noggin to you better watch ya self
Sub-noise when I'm bangin on a tech set best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse
everything

[Chorus x2]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.
(DARKNESS)
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
RUN AWAY!

I'm your worst fear.
I'm your favorite.
I'm your acquired taste.
Will you savor it.
If its blood thirst, will you run from it.
No need cause I'm inside you.
When the sun is spit.
You cannot escape me
I'm your last resort.
When you have an evil, you cannot report.
I'm am the royal sunshine, malicious pain and heartless.
If ever you ever need an alibi, rely on me I am.

[Chorus x2]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.
(DARKNESS)
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
RUN AWAY!
