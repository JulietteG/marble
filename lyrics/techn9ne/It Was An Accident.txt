Verse 1: Tech N9ne
I was chillin wit a bitch/
and i was noticing she was so sadistic/
Wanted the Nina to bite on her nipples and twist it/
Sucking me off until she lost all of her lipstick/
You know how it is when you X-ing on like 7 of em'/
Wit a stick of Sherm and Adderall, nigga had to love em'/
Cause they get you lifted and thinkin you unstoppable/
But what I'm bout to tell you is so fuckin' impossible/
I started giving the bitch my dick/
She loving the way my jimmy be jabbin it/
Wanted me to cut her up, I said never/
She said imagine it with the tip of her butcher knife/
I think i took her life/
This crazy hooker like pain, then i put her right/
Fuckin high, and it's insane how she look at life/
She wish a nigga had fangs and he took a bite/
I'm beating it up wit an aim what the pussy like/
The pussy like to be banged like it took a fight/
Then she asked me to smack her/
Then she asked me to choke her/
So i choked her/ As a nigga got closer to the nut I choked her/
Even harder as i when i rose up out the Chocha/
She wasn't breathing, A horrible evening/
Couldn't get her to breath, I really tried ta/
Did all i could of,

Chorus:

Bridge:
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/(played backwards)
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/(played backwards ) I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/(played backwards)
I don't be finding trouble, It be finding me/(played backwards)
verse 2: (K-dean?)
Shit i was only 16, just showing off/
Never woulda imagined the gun going off/
I was just trying to show these niggaz that i wasn't soft/
Stayed at 52nd street so that's what all these niggaz thought/
Cause they was from hilltop, where niggaz pill pop/
So i'm pulling up to the chill spot/
Wit the steel cocked
still not sure what I was thinking
And back then I wasn't even drinking
So I'm leaving Lincoln High School off Woodland
Headed to the hood to hang out wit all the hoodlums
Couldn't wait to show him what I was packing
Knock on the door, he answered like "Whuuss Crackin"
I said "Shit, just chillin, just me and my bitch"
"By my bitch, I mean that 450 sittin on my hip"
"Wanna see"? He said "yeah let me see"
I pulled it out and gave it a quick squeeze
I didn't know it didn't have no safety
Now this man is hit in his chest and he can't breath
Devil on my shoulder whispering "Leave nigga, Leave"
But i swear...

Chorus:
It was an accident
HA HA HA oooooooooooooooooooooo
It was an accident
HA HA HA oooooooooooooooooooooo
It was an accident
HA HA HA oooooooooooooooooooooo
It was an accident
HA HA HA oooooooooooooooooooooo
It as an accident...
