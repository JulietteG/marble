[1st Verse]
Ain't no way you bout to stop this sickness from the
Deepest darkest part of misery psycho alpha schizo
Get your chick she digging me 

A.B.S.O.L.U.T.E. P.O.W.E.R.
See me clownin', look at all you player haters
frownin'

Raw, God said kill'em all Tech's backs to the wall
Fighting 4 my life and Imma bust back till they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs I'm hollin' 187
If you trippin' with strange

I'm really real with it,

like my homey A.J. say deal with it
Pushin' and pullin', fightin' 4 the mill ticket,

in a minute imma do it like a villain 

Imma get'em in the middle of a Bomb,

put'em on the spot till the funk go pop and

I bet he never have another quam.

Tech nizzle, when I'm thizzled it's who B you
rollin' with
Dave, Trav, Violet Brown and 3DQ

Hootie Hoo 

for those who not knowing that Mizzou thee true,

Imma tell ya like the swedish would say it; 

sug min kuk

[Chorus]
Absolute power
That's the only way to roll
Absolute power
They love us everywhere we go
Absolute power
Tecca nina's bout to blow
Absolute power
Absolute power
[Repeat 2x]

[2nd Verse]
I do hip hop, and I mix it with the hard rock 
Designing this rhyming 4 climbing

Tech N9ne he's unwinding
The shining it's blinding,

greedy so we constantly grinding

I been in the game 16 years making rap tunes,

raising hella havoc up in the classroom 

now in 02 you can watch me 

clownin' diamonds shining watchin' dvd's on
The Hachitachi
It's all Jesus, now I keep the crowds pumpin' they
Jumpin' get back to the tele we rollin' and stickin'
Somethin' racing to the main line absolute power
Is having Halle Berry and Juliet Lewis at the same

time

Oh that's how strange niggas run, listen to the villain
With the gun associated tongue we're close to the

end but not done

the Tech's just began begun

beginning to begin to have fun

The curse, is tryin' to put me in the hearst

but I will not tumble first things first,

took a lot of shit and I can't take more

Fuck Jay Farries and everybody

Down wit'em and fuck JCOR.

[Chorus]
[Repeat 2x]

[3rd Verse]
Thanks to Strange Music I'm comin' and all my

Enemies they runnin' now all my haters bummin'

cause I was summoned, 

we Kansas City players 

and we bout sold game, 

we make it so that Tech N9ne is a household name

How many points you got? I got 50 here's a

question to the censorship committee 

who's the biggest gangs of niggas in the city,

my villains are Gritty, 

Big Scoob, Txx Will, Bakarii, 

rest in peace Short Nitty

Power the evil way is power the people say
Rebel yellin' with felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beats from Berlin Germany throwin' up Mizzizy
So ain't no other city concerning me

I teach it and I speak it very loosely
Stamina gunnin'

got player haters running profusely
Now I got the parents pissed and 
Ready to noose me, cause they know that
Absolute power corrupts, absolutely

[Chorus]
