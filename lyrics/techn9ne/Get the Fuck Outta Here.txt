Get The Fuck Outta Here 
Nina 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 
Popper 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 
Wall 

Ya 
Ima spitter, you other cats be on littler 
Thats probably why u just penny pushing and im bigger 
So you hate on me cuz you like paper and im gritter 
With two biancas up on my arms like john ritter 

( Tech ) 
Oh my goodness , is they talking shit again 
When i been player on the day i become u.s citizen 
Haters keep witishen, ima take a lost but im finishin 
Killer but squirer just like percy miller no limits then 
I aim for digits, 100% of my people came to get it 
He used to be bigger but became a midget 
Taken out of the game, livin lame he lived it 
So he gota hate on the next man , cuz he dont got the money , 
We left him on the bottom, now he the ex tech fan 
Get the fuck outa my face, its you mistake im getting hotter sit and watch me expand 
You take falls i take her and take drawls 
And give you the which stall 
They give me the mate call ( oh baby ) 
You yank tall 
Love is me, but hates yall 
Thats why ima take all, what pops in the great wall 

( Chorus ) 
If fraud is what ur selling

( Popper ) 
I stay in the zone like 28s in a baggie 
A verteran stands here a rookie niggas at his nees 
Grab these shove middle fingers in the sky 
Tell it like it is, when i rap so yall identify 
Start from the ground formulate an interprise 
Get outa here before u get punished and pentalized 
Ive been in fires to stay in this lane hommie 
I swear when i rap, i say it aint a thang phony 
Im icy, im shiny tho i dont got a chain hommie 
Even when inside this booth i keep my thang on me 
And when it rains homie, i dont complain hommie 
Eliminate the copps so i donnt have to strain hommie 
I talks a bunch of shit the haters wanna flamethrow me 
Rapper aint got the balls or got a place they aims on me 
Get the fuck outa here, tell em wall told ya 
Popper a done deal, every one of ur soft soldiers 

( Chorus ) 
If fraud is what ur selling 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 
When they lie u gotta tell em 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 
If you steppin to me wrong 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 
You aint gota go home 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 

Tell em what to do 
Tell em what to do 
Tell em what to do 
Get the fuck outta here

Get the fuck outta here 
Tell em what to do

Tell em what to do 
Get the fuck outta here 

( Wall ) 
I do this for my partner standing out there on the block 
And do this for haters on the sideline at night 
Despite what they saying i just cant seem to stop 
Gettin this guap, i gota alot , parnter im almost to the top 
I gota cop new watch, fresh grill and new cloths 
Im trying to come back candy low, side ways on fours 
I gota that bread, it be the money ova these hoes 
Cuz my friends be turning to foes, and harsh words lead to blows 
They be mad at me cuz im the shit, while they just shit 
And i gota off my ass and get it while they just sit 
They upset cuz im getting bread while they layin in bed 
Even tho i started at the bottom im 100 miles ahead 
They still be talkin dime on me try to slander my name 
Cuz im the main man, but they wanan watch it change 
They hate me cuz they hate but please make no mistake 
They know me but cant stop me cuz im paul wall the great 

( Chorus ) 
If fraud is what ur selling 
Get The Fuck Outta Here

You aint gota go home 
Get The Fuck Outta Here 

Tell em what to do 
Tell em what to do 
Tell em what to do
