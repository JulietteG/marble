[Tech N9ne:]
I now pronounce me and music together from now until the end of time

Always on the road, Doin hella shows
Day to day high and lows, but that's just how it goes
When you grinding, homie ain't no rewinding
Time but the family behind in this business that I'm in
I don't feel anything and it's hard remembering
Places and faces they think I'm what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours ,
Autographs, sound check, radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans,
Keep it rough with the fellas, but I make the ladies want to dance
And still I don't think you understand what's real,
While I'm with you with my wife another chance is killed,
And my kids all three of 'em suffer in the worst ways,
Cause last year I missed all three of they birthdays,
So when you see me with me eyes full of pain,
Give me love cause these are three of the reason why I call the road 'the rain'

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now, (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I'm walking in rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right or is it wrong)

My little girl said

[Aliya Yates:]
Daddy (What's up), me and Reign really miss you,
Not to mention momma always need a tissue,
I saw your picture in the paper and I kissed you,
I heard you won't be home for Halloween, is this true?
(Right after Halloween baby)
Yea I'm used to it,
Why don't you teach me and Reign how to produce music,
So we can travel everywhere that you're traveling,
And be in the family, me and sissy fighting and tattling
I know you miss that, I know you dig that
Do your fans every wonder about where your kids at?
Is Donny really coming to move with us in L.A.?
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday?
I gotta go now, I love you daddy but slow down
There's not enough Techa Nina's to go around
Rainbow's crying she wants to talk to you badly,
(What's up Rainbow, Baby)

[Reign Yates]
I love you daddy!

[Chorus:]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now, (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I'm walking in rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right or is it wrong)

I love my fans
Cause they make it possible for me to provide for the Fam
The fact that my life is in shambles, they could give a damn
When it shakes then they chose it, fakes who hate lose it
They love my pain because it makes for great music
But in the interim this family matter is a tend to one of mine
Leave in January and come back when the winter come like:
Calling my wife when I'm in the rain and then end up getting into a dumb fight
Cause she lonely, you try to console her but you ain't come right
So it's about what and what?
You give them everything they need,
But what they need is your presence indeed,
Life yes has been a strainer
It's like if been a stranger
To my kids and wife
That's the life of an entertainer
More money to gain,
More people to change
Swords deep in the game,
The world's peeping my pain
Out on the road cussing for sure, reaching for fame
Healthy relationship you can't have them when you're living life in 'the rain'.

[Chorus x2:]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now, (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I'm walking in rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right or is it wrong)---Lyrics submitted by Peyton Branham.
