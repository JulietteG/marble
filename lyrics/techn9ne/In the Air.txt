your first lesson given to you by "Mr. Smith" 
K.C. M.O. stand up, young niggaz represent
Ask me what i wanna be when i grow up 
I ain't just gonna blow up ima star i got stryum's Tryin to get it closa
telescopes to cameras rappas wanna use Blammas but
Im gleemin from the planets homie mine is called Kansas City
A cloud in my pocket got a rain on em 
such a star i saw heavens walls an wrote my name on em
So comfortable at the top i hopped on a plane an
clamed Everest, you might as well say the boy's Himalyian
I rent my rooms on the moon Mr. Smith's comin soon 
The angels feedin my cereal with a silver spoon 
My hairline is Craig Smith airlines arrive from 
kansas city through L.A. as long as a fan line
im high as though eight gas prices my votes are
twice as high as Obama's an i ain't gotta ask nice
im high aspects tour bus the light skinned ones
So if your lookin for me bow an look up an try an find the sun 

..................IM IN THE AIR

......................HIGH IN THE AIR

..................IM IN THE AIR 

......................HIGH IN THE AIR

K.C. nesto 
Ya dont me to brag but i froze my piece
an i gettin high then a nose bleed see
dont bring it to my seesion if ya hoe see me
She'll drop dead in the studio like O.D.B.
Ya its the owna an im very coo
Plus this weeds keep me higher than air balloon
Copy-Cat like what im wearin dude 
im so fly i walk around wit a parachute
an even rappas like 2 but im the only human 
with an astronaut suit see your entire verse 
say that your iron squirt when u on issue
in the air like fireworks an suckas still on that
hatin shit ill stuff em in the bag like patato chips
Or bring they ass up like a paper clip 
Tech signed me an see how quick your paper flips

...................IM IN THE AIR

..............................HIGH IN THE AIR 

...................IM IN THE AIR 

..............................HIGH IN THE AIR

I gotta have this one by myself, you know what it is
Why, call me underground when i rock the stars
an even they can't even see me with a pair of bi-noc-ulars
my hip-hoppin gave them ga side swipe to mars
bump thur then extinction hit which left the lime like ajar
you want your scripts to fly not in my solar system 
cuz i dismiss them like they wish to die 
Maga then nature and i rip the why 
civilian ladies love me so bro excuse her while she kiss the sky 
call me masta more exaulted then a priest to paster 
blasphamy had me blast fags fast with maga 
in the air like dancer an dasha high in the 
sky up above mountains up off in alaska
higher than a million heroine hits of fits to last ya
super sulesturial when everyone stuck off in the pasture
the wackaual castya down below who get caught up in my rapture
dont be callin me dog cuz i want you to say it backwards

......................IM IN THE AIR
