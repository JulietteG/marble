[Hook]
What you want want
What you need
What you havin
What will it be

All we need is Hennessey then a sprite,
squeeze it in it, twist a lemon,
this one is the best one in it

[Verse 1]
I don't make this drink by the gallon
I make it by the cup then I'm stylin
Got KMK Slaughta House and Brotha Allan
Im KC Teas we all over the world wildin

[Course]
HENESSEY (Twist some lemon with the)
HENESSEY (Sprite go right with the)
HENESSEY (Make ya night go right with the)
KC TEA (KC TEA!)
HENESSEY (Twist some lemon with the)
HENESSEY (Sprite go right with the)
HENESSEY (Make ya night go right with the)
KC TEA (KC TEA!)

[Verse 2]
I like to drink it in a real big wine glass
At my place full of women lettin time pass
With Hennessey sprite and lemon baby im as
Drunk as skunk but a second one im on ya fine ass
The first variation from the homie Vito
We drank the Hennessey and lemon where ever we go
Then add the sprite and no seven was me-o
Then me and Kali named it enter Las Vegas Casino
Lemon or lime it don't matter to you slumps
Man that sound real good
Taste good too Punk
A double shot till ya cup'll get you crunk
Too much more when you wake up and you thump like
BAAM BAAM AHH DWAAM
This is how you feel the next day because you slammed
The KC Tea gotta take Ea-sy, like E
This is Techa Nina Kansas City Spiked Tea

[Verse 3]
Fill the cup full of ice first
Cuz the Hennessey will melt a little ice and it might irk
Me when im all up on a tight skirt
I need a fully loaded Kansas City Tea for quenchin my thirst
If you aint got no Real lemon just let some of the lime juice spill in them
I know a lot of the Caucasian people don't really do the Hennessey
But the way that I make it I will Hen em
Convert a lot of people every year an
On St. Patties day I shared it with very weird fans
They started fightin and my leg was near rammed
I told em take it easy there's a beverage here man
KC Tea is One Hunit mayne
Check it if its flat sprite then I don't want it mayne
My money mayne is on Hennessey and the image of cream corn
I'm runnin thangs ( I'm runnin Thaaangs)

[Verse 4]
A lot a men never sinned on the Hen
Where ya been boy boy where ya been?
It'll have ya wit her again and again
Even strong enough to do her lesbian friends
If you can't handle her then hand her to me
Cuz im at five of em and I'm bout to hammer the V
Even got it set up for the camera to see
I'm wit her but I'm really picturing Angela Ye
She aint wearin nothing but Pradas on her feet
KC Tea got me really supersonic in the sheets
Hittin harder than sticky icky chronic on the streets
So nice to wake up in the bathroom aint no vomit on the seat
Bartender made it right and I'm sure because it tastes sweet like canddy
Yeah, and Ludacris you can make it with Conjour
And 40 you can make it with Landy but Authentic is the
HENNESSEY (It's about 38 a Fifth)
HENNESSEY (In Canada is like 68)
HENNESSEY (But Wal-Mart got it for 20 BOY Yeah! let's go!)
KC TEAA (KC TEA!)

HENESSEY (Twist some lemon with the)
HENESSEY (Sprite go right with the)
HENESSEY (Make ya night go right with the)
