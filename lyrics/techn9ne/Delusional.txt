(Verse 1)

Yeah... Like this (like this) Ima drink this henn, Ima keep this grin, but
If you look at nina closly I'm tryina contain this beast within. I know some
Of yall already knowin that I got alota cheese to spend but that don't
Change the fact I go insane I gotta heap of sins please begin.

I saw a glimspse in all of this when I was just yay tall and I pictured
Yall and it wall to wall but they all said I was just Delusional but the
People startin callin us and I'm ballin tough but the crawlin rough and I
Never though of stuff with saw enough. what the problem is now I got em
Here tellin all these kids I'm the K.O.D and they pumpin up the volume and
Listenen hard when I give my heart is it Delusional.
When I'm thinkin ima boss in the biz but I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off
In the lid but they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib

Some say that if tell them to hate my people are at the gate ready for
Sealin your fate that is up for debate cause when I make my music aint no
Evil from mister yates callin me
A cult leader I don't really know but ima fosho heater wickedness commin
From mine rove they could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us at the
Bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na they say I lead em to
Evil like I was jimmy jones and feedin the people when I bleed in the
Steeple the reason they seizin me aint no decreasin my ego my powers for
Good I think would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink but that
Would never happen I'm makin it with the rappin but they want me to collapse
And when I could I sink

(Chorus) Nikkiya

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi. Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to
Do wrong hear me!

(Verse 2)

She feel like I'm, gonna make them hate because I was around and kick it and
Make them babys and now that I made it gotta escape them daily and that's
Crazy cause all I'm doin is makin the industry pay me but when I show my
Face feelin everythings great did a show then we ate then I'm outa that
State she said I'm a good provider but daddy of the year man I'm outa that
Race how I compensate for the losses they get often dates that's too
Personal we'll stop the tape

(Chorus) Nikkiya

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi. Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to
Do wrong hear me!

(Verse 3)

They say I'm seein things but everybody know I'm bein things we dem kings
Like it or not we runnin this gotta lotta hype cause I wanna spit and I
Come to grip on the fith you gotta know techs never gonna miss I know I
Might be a little psycie but it's nightly and brightly inside of me makin me
A little frightening rippin it with the right team I bring hella light when
Resighting when it's all said and done I'm sickened and heavened caused this
A damned reverend ALL 6'S AND 7'S

(Chorus) Nikkiya

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi. Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to
Do wrong hear me! ---Lyrics submitted by Highman.
