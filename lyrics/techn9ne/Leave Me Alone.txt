Where i'm at right now, I ain't got no tolerance for somethin stupid, or hatred, or envy. 
If you bringin any one of those, How bout, Leave me alone. 

They pray i'll free fall any day, Well I don't need yall anyway. 
Negativity give me nay ya finna hear me say. 
Just leave me right here with my henny-say my chicks an plenty pay. 
Your boy Tech done blown, an still rep the home, but now I just wanna be left alone. 
They wish death and my flesh and my chromosomes slept my songs, they need a little bit less Patron. 
And they holler the weirdo, when i walk in the spot, 
The zeros pissed cuz they ladies wanna swaller my hero. 
They live in squaller and fear though they daughter come here though, she know I keep plenty Robert De Niro. You punks will never get to see me let a tear go. 
Started hatin the second I busted a mere flow. I just want you to get some gones, not near no. 
Negative energy that is a remedy, hey yo listen here bro: 

(Chorus) 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just let me be 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just leave me alone 

(Verse 2) 
The hood don't play me huh, Treat my strange music like rabies huh 
They be sayin tech nina he crazy huh. 
But you want me on your video 
and cd. 
You elementary rappers are straight remedial, A.D.D. 
I'm in my own world partna, and you don't fit there. 
All your tech hatred has got you soundin like a bitch player. 
And this is to multiple haters and I swear it, ain't about a pass but if the shoe fit wear it nigga. 
Its a size N9ne, wanna step inside mine? 
It'll feel like you died tryin, and you will know that I can't buy time, for you to catch casper its high time. 
You tried crimes against me cause you couldn't follow the guidelines. 
They say respect your elders, you best go tell the lord forgive you cause whats next yo failure. 
Just leave me where its less your hell bruh. 
Invest your mail to somethin that sell cause the Tech don't smell ya, Tech gon tell ya: 

(Chorus) 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just let me be 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just leave me alone 

(Verse 3) 
We be singular, numero uno ichibon. 
They want my doom and my funeral, psycho bitch be gone. 
Losin my lithium quickly this chick done hit me don, and bit me on my finger, tell Trav to get me bond. 
Cause if it happens again, if it happens again, imma psssstst BOY! 
I wish I had no problem with smackin a friend with a gat be snappin a chin. 
But i got chicks that wanna get it in, for sure. 
I'm takin all the crazy ho's outta my lady mode, i'm done with the oldies, nothin but new shit in my radio. 
Leave me solitary cause the way she go is shady though. 
It's later for there he go, no more Tech N9ne let the baby know. 
All of ya need to try clit, and straight deny dick. 
Leave us alone cause you mentally damaged, no try sick. 
I wish I wasn't a star and the gentleman would die quick. 
So next time you trippin, 
i'll flip and hit you in your eye bitch. 

(Chorus) 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just let me be 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just leave me alone---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
