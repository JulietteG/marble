It's a wonder sparks don't fly
When you're close to me
The way we generate electricity
Is this Fate, or is it meant to be
I don't know, baby you tell me

If you could say what I'm thinking you'd know how I feel
If you could say what I'm thinking
You'd say this feeling's for real
If you could speak my mind,
And dream what I'm dreaming of
If you could say what I'm thinking,
You'd say you're falling in love

I could swear we were lovers in another lifetime
Could be we're about to discover what we both know to be so sublime
Is this the future, or history
I don't know, baby you tell me

If you could say what I'm thinking you'd know how I feel
If you could say what I'm thinking you'd say this feeling's for real
If you could speak my mind and dream what I'm dreaming of
If you could say what I'm thinking
You'd say you're falling in love
So say what I'm thinking
Say you think you're falling in love---Lyrics submitted by Dorene Herrick.
