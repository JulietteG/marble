He sees her face 
in the highway signs
in the traffic lights
and she's turning red
In a motel
on a double bed
he swears he feels her lying there
and she whispers in his ear
"you can't run away forever"

But sometimes 
that feels like coming home to me anymore
It feels like coming home to me 
But the further off I get
the more I get obsessed
I could never make it home

She sees his face
in the sweat-stained sheets
in the dirty cups
they keep on piling up
In the back yard
so overgrown
the dandelions
as they peek through the cracks on the patio
She swears she hears the phone
but she only gets a dial tone
So she imagines what she'd say

If you feel like coming home to me sometime
Yeah, if you feel like coming home to me anytime
I'll be waiting at the door
There's nothing to be sorry for
So why can't you come back home?
Don't you feel like coming home to me anymore?
You dont feel like coming home to me?

Well if that's the game you choose
You don't have to play the loser---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
