BEWARE OF DARKNESS.  (Harrison.)

Watch out now,
Take care beware of falling swingers
Dropping all around you,
The pain that often mingles in your fingertips
Beware of darkness.

Watch out now
Take care, beware the thoughts that linger
Winding up inside your head
The hopelessness around you
In the dead of night...
Beware of sadness.

It can hit you, it can hurt you -
Make you sore and what is more,
That is not what you are here for.

Watch out now, take care,
Beware of soft shoe shufflers
Dancing down the sidewalks,
As each unconscious sufferer
Wanders aimlessly,
Beware of MAYA.

Watch out now take care,
Beware of greedy leaders
They'll take you where you should not go,
While Weeping Atlas Cedars
They just want o to grow -
Beware of darkness.---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
