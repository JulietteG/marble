I spent all my money on a big fancy car,
For these bright eyed honeys, yeah you know me
You keep me up till the sun is high,
Until the birds stop calling my name
I'm addicted, I don't know why,
I guess I've always been this way
All these roads still be wrong, but I still drive them.

CHORUS
All you young wild girls, you make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls, you'll be the death of me.
All you young wild girls, no matter what you do.
Yeah, you young wild girls, always come back to you

I get lost under these lights,
I get lost in the words I say
Stop believing in my old lies, 
like 'Everything's going to be OK

I still dream of the simple life
Boy meets girls and makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this, 
that much I know, yes I know
All these roads still be wrong, but I still drive them.

CHORUS x 3, (till fade-out.)---Lyrics submitted by Dominic Berry.
