(feat. Florida Georgia Line)

You're the flops on my feet
The top down on my jeep
You're the watermelon sticky-lip
Kiss on my cheek
You're the kick in the cup
Pretty girl, you know what's up
You a skinny little dip in the creek

You're the shades that hide the rays
You're even sweeter than my sweet nanny's lemonade
Yeah you're hotter than a tiki
Midnight sneaky
Out my back window, girl,
You comin' out to meet me, yeah

Turn it up girl, You're turning me on
I wanna spin you like a record
Here forever long
You know I'm digging what you're doing
Grooving just like you're grooving
Hit that playback
Let's get back to it now.
You and Me we're like a simple song
Yeah so damn easy to sing along,
I don't need a guitar or a band,
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam

You're the sun on my face,
The cold beer in the case
You're the little tan legs swinging off of my gate
You're the moon in my shine,
You're the rap in my rhyme,
You ain't a 7, 8, 9,
Naw, girl you're a dime
You're the shades that hide the rays
You're even cooler than my cooler
When I'm chilling on the lake
Yah you finer than fine,
You put the good in the time,
You're the fireworks flyin' on the fourth of July
So come on!

Turn it up girl, You're turning me on
I wanna spin you like a record
Here forever long
You know I'm digging what you're doing
Grooving just like you're grooving
Hit that playback
Let's get back to it now.
You and Me we're like a simple song
Yeah so damn easy to sing along,
I don't need a guitar or a band,
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam

Don't need no "Sweet Home Alabam'"
I don't want a Jukebox, baby,
I don't need a beat to dance
All I need is You and Me,
You know that baby
You're my little shottie hottie driving me crazy
You're the melody that gets me poppin'
There ain't no stopping when we get to rocking
C'mon

Turn it up girl, You're turning me on
I wanna spin you like a record
Here forever long
You know I'm digging what you're doing
Grooving just like you're grooving
Hit that playback
Let's get back to it now.
You and Me we're like a simple song
Yeah so damn easy to sing along,
I don't need a guitar or a band,
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam

(All I need is you and me,
You know that baby
You're the melody that drives me crazy)

I don't need a guitar or a band
(Aww yeah)
Cause baby you're my Summer Jam---
