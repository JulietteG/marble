Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
Cause there wasnt sh!t to do
We didnt know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
But our neighbor had a pool

We got green grass and two trees
Whoa oh oh oh oh
But it aint like whats on TV
Whoa oh oh oh oh
This is real life in the real world
We aint talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It aint all good baby but its all right
Real life

We got a dive bar
With a real band, they play too loud
And theyre real bad
But were real boys so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, shes real rude
She got real problems but we do too so we tip her anyway

Thats just the way that it is Whoa oh oh oh oh
Thats just the way that we live Whoa oh oh oh oh
This is real life in the real world
We aint talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It aint all good baby but its all right
Real life
Yeah were livin real life

We find real love, get real hurt
Fall real hard, shake off the dirt
Pray to God, lets make a deal
I guess it just got real
We get real low, we get real high
It aint all good baby but its all right
Real life
This aint no fairy tale, its real life---
