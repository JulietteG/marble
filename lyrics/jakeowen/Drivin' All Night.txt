There wasn't nothing as pretty in Panama City as you
That's what I took away from that spring break that year
And there wasn't no shortcut down to LSU
But it wasn't like it was hard talking me into

Drivin' all night, drivin' all night
Drivin' like a bat outta hell
Cheap motel's calling my name
No way I'm stopping this Chevy
Red Bull's keepin' my lead foot heavy
1:00, 1:30, 2:00, 2:30, 3:00 am
Steve Earle out, Tom Petty back in
Bird dog working hard, giving them blue lights away hey
Drivin' all night, drivin' all night, drivin' all night
Just to hold you for a day

You're a rumrunner kiss that I still get drunk on
You're a text, you're a call that falls out of the blue
You're a snapshot in my head and on my phone
And you ain't gotta ask twice, I'm already gone
Girl, I'm gone

Drivin' all night, drivin' all night
Drivin' like a bat outta hell
Cheap motel's calling my name
No way I'm stopping this Chevy
Red Bull's keepin' my lead foot heavy
1, 1:30, 2, 2:30, 3 am
Steve Earle out, Tom Petty back in
Bird dog working hard, giving them blue lights away hey
Drivin' all night, drivin' all night, drivin' all night
Just to hold you for a day

You ain't never too out of the way
All you gotta do is say the word and I'll get to you
I keep rocking and rolling right on through
1:00, 1:30, 2:00, 2:30, 3:00 am
Tom Petty out, Steve Earle back in
Bird dog working hard, giving them blue lights away hey
Drivin' all night, drivin' all night, drivin' all night
Just to hold you for a day

You keep me drivin' all night
Wasn't nothing as pretty in Panama City as you---
