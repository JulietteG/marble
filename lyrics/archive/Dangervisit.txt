So much writing on the walls, can you read it all
Can you see through the haze when the writing's small
Can you read what it means does it make any sense
'Cause it's all dollar bills and pounds and pence
Telling you what to do and what pills to take
When your head's in your hands and your belly aches
Where to go in the world when you need a change
Don't you worry about the bill, that can be arranged

Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question,

Give me things that can calm this depression
Give me things that can calm this depression

Let me know what to do when my money's spent
Let me know how to smell and to pay the rent
Let me know what to do when my hair is gone
Let me know who to kill when the war is on
There's a woman of your dreams and she's all on the phone
Better send her a text when you're on your own

Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question

Give me things that can calm this depression
Give me things that can calm this depression
Give me things that can calm this depression

So much writing on the walls so much writing on the walls so much writing on the walls

(Obey)
Feel, just obey !

Sing along sing along sing along sing it

You know that they can't harm you
You know that they can't hurt you
Don't want their dreams to waste me
Don't want their dreams to save me

High rises
Killing lows---
