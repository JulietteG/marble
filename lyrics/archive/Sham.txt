God dog
Sunday no funday
Holy joke
Go away
No fun
None whatsoever
Ya sister is sinking

I know I believe
I believe
I believe
That it's beautiful

I know I believe
Yeah I think I
Believe that
It's wonderful

I know if I leave
My belief
Then I leave what's incredible

It's gonna take a better man
To get me out of this sham

If it stays like this
You're a failure
If you keep it up
You're a failure

Because we want
What you're supposed to give us
You're a failure

We want what we're supposed to have
You're a failure

No fun whatsoever
No fun whatsoever
No fun

I know I believe
I believe
I believe
That it's beautiful

I know I believe
Yeah I think I
Believe that
It's wonderful

I know if I leave
My belief
Then I leave what's incredible

It's gonna take a better man
To get me out of this sham

I know I believe
I believe
I believe
That it's beautiful

I know I believe
Yeah I think I
Believe that
It's wonderful

I know if I leave
My belief
Then I leave what's incredible

It's gonna take a better man
To get me out of this sham---
