Playing games
Plastic dolls
Killing time with alcohol
I need grass and beer
To make the world a little less weird
To make the world a little more mine
My soul feels guilty
Before my body sins
Always twist then ride like a candle flame
Always twist then ride like a candle flame
Life is hard
Life is short
But it ain't nobody's fault
Life is just a game of a pool
But it can't hurt a fool
No it can't hurt a fool
Oh it can't hurt a fool---
