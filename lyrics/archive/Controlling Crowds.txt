Why are you so scared and creeping around
Taking photographs all over town
Pictures in the dark that live in the light
The world is my playground too and Ill do what I like
Why are you so scared of falling apart
Intimidating me for falling apart
Stay on your knees with your cross and dont tell me you know so
The world is my playground too and I refuse to follow
Fly with me falling through the night
Fly with me falling out of sight, find me hold me in your arms
Cause Im scared of their controlling crowds keep me calm
Cause Im scared of their controlling crowds here they come

Why are we so obscure and creeping around
Hiding from mirrors and screens all over town
Objects disturbing blinding taking the peace in me
The world is my kingdom too and I'll feel what I like in me
Killing my heart I cant face I cant face no more
The world is my playground too I cant feel anymore
Fly with me falling through the night, fly with me falling out of sight
Find me hold me in your arms
Cause Im scared of their controlling crowds keep me calm
Cause Im scared of their controlling crowds here they come
Why are we so cold and breaking apart
Caught up in this storm just breaking apart
Pictures and colours I loved but dont see anymore
The world is my playground too I dont feel anymore
Why are you so adored
Cause Im scared of their controlling crowds here they come---
