Come touch me like Im an ordinary man,
have a look in my eyes,
underneath my skin there is a violence,
it's got a gun in it's hand,

ready to make
ready to make, read'
ready to make sense of anyone, anything
anyone, anything
anyone, anything
anyone, anything
anyone, anything

Black holes living in the side of your face,
razor wire spinning around your
around your
around your
around your
around your
around your
around your (blistering sky)
around your (blistering sky)
around your (blistering sky)

bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
bullets are the beauty and I dont know why
bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
bullets are the beauty and I dont know why

Confine me let me be the lesser of a beautiful man,
without the blood on his hands,
come and make me a martyr come and break my feeling,
with your violence with the gun on my head,

ready to take,
ready to take,
ready to take,
ready to take out anyone, anywhere.
anyone, anywhere
anyone, anywhere
anyone, anywhere
anyone, anywhere

Black holes living in the side of your face,
razor wire spinning around your,
around your
around your
around your
around your
around your
around your (blistering sky)
around your (blistering sky)
around your (blistering sky)

bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky,
bullets are the beauty and I dont know why,
bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky,
bullets are the beauty and I dont know why.
