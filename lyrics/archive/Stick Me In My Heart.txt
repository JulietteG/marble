Feeling you insane how I need it
Feeling all your pain
How I hold it
Crashing through your walls
Like a hammer
Smashing up the floors
Of your thinking
Pull me through the cracks when you're sinking
Pull me how you like
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
God I'm trying
Seeing all your life
When it's dying
Dragging me
It kills when you're fighting
Everything that is
Is love about you

Stick me in my heart so I feel it
Take me with your tears so I feel it
Sharing all your love
Now I feel it

Bring it back to life
I don't feel it
(Stick me in my heart)
So I feel it
(Sharing all your love)
Now I feel it

Hold me in your love
'Cause love
Hold me in your love
'Cause love is everything
Love is everything---
