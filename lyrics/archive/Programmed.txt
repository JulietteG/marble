Flicking and twisting
There's a flash in the sky
Falling and drifting
There's a hole in my eye
I've not been feeling stable
It's too hard to try
I'm here and I'm waiting
To say goodbye

Switching and surfing
The transmission's black
I've lost everything
And I can't get it back
This corrupt programme
Has made me a slave
Now I feel remote

I'm interference on the T.V.
But nothing here's gonna free me
I'm screaming somebody help me

Try to break out and run for the land
Look out for yourself this place is a selfish man
Try to break out and run for the land
Look out for yourself this place is a selfish man

Try to break out
Try to break out
Try to break out
Try to break out
Try to break out
Try to break out
Try to break out
Try to break out

It's so cold
Like interference on a T.V.
It's so cold
Like interference on a T.V.---
