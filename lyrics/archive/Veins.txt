It's easy to be persuaded
It's easy because I'm weak
If it were me I wouldn't make it
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Frequently sedated
Beast in my veins 
If it's free I'm gonna take it
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Now I've got you
Now I've got you here

Goodbye my sad and lonely
Goodbye that love is sick for me
I hold you 
I hold you
Thank God I've finally got you here
Now I hold you
Now I hold you

Nice to be acquainted
It's been easy for a while
Now you don't control it
I control you
I control you 
Now I've got you
Now I've got you here

Goodbye my sad and lonely
Goodbye that love is sick for me
I hold you
I hold you
Goodbye my sad and lonely
Goodbye that love is sick for me
I love you 
I love you
Thank god I've finally got you here

Now I've got you
Now I've got you here---
