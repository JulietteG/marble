You could end everything right here
Finish it off and disappear
Isn't it great to have the choice
Quiet it down and stop the noise
We know those people tell you things
Like what to say and what to think
We know you're not needed for your mind
Just for your money and your kind
We know you're not wanted for your heart
They knew it was black right from the start you could end everything right here---
