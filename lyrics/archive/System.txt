Completely done
Too much now I can't touch you
I'd drain my brain if only I could have you
The system is too much
It breaks me down and makes you suck
Fuck, now I mistrust you
The system makes me hurt you

One times, one times, one times, one

Discretely done
Obviously now I've become suited, diluted
Free from anything
Yes please, I'd love your love
So I can fuck it up
This system is too much
It breaks me down and makes you suck
Fuck, now I am twisted
This system makes me hurt you

One times, one times, one times, one

We cut and slice
It makes us feel so very nice
I'm simply demented
Uneasy and dented
I'd drain my brain if only I could have you
This system is too much
It breaks me down and makes you suck
Now I can't trust you
This system makes me hurt you

One times, one times, one times, one---
