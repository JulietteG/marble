High, sunlight, drown
High, sunlight, goodbye

As I re-submerge
I can barely breathe
Lung capacity
Withering away
Hyperventilate
All disintegrating
Bodies turn to dust
Sudden rush of blood
Snap me out of moods
Swinging in the wind
Round to hurricane breeze
Past damage in the blast
More than physical
Plain to see upon the visual
Feel the impact down
Deep inside a rattled rib cage
Lying shattered there in pieces
Fall away wither and decay
Cannot keep this anxiety at bay
Hellfire spray twisted metal stray
When sparks fly into the naked eye
Fools know not to even try
Think about it fully
Blowing sky high bring a house down
Panic all around
Blind to the fact
Silent ones who plan a hijack
Give with one hand other takes back
One way collision flight path
Aftermath
Come and feel the wrath laid to waste
Steadily with haste
Cutting to the chase
Drifting off the pace
Filling all space and times up
For the meanwhile pressure piles down
Terror reigns

Runaway, loose
Gonna run over you
Infected, injected, completely subdued
Invasive, foreign entity, unwelcome

High, sunlight, drown
High, sunlight, goodbye

Lines, lines data and lines
Confusing nations all data inside
Games shame lies to the masses
Dead souls all rise
On poisonous gasses
Lines, lines la la la la la la
Lines, lines la la la la la la
Lines, lines la la la la la la

Battered and broken hour glass
Last thing you see before the light
Fizzle out smoke billowing broken down
From the inside by scandalous tension
Take hold, gripped by the head
Cold harbouring a grudge
Closer to the edge
Cradling the grave concern
Follow leaders in turn
Flipside opposition
Convey grievance
Half a mind to test immortal patience
Held down while suffocating
Blocking air path
Final exhale
Vital sign fail
Flatline
They would rather do away with our kind
Half expected inside
Rotten infected, fatally flawed and overawed
Biohazardous and contagious
Got animal into animal
Crushed like beasts into cages
Slow deteriorate body
Shutting down
Cease and fade
Cease then fade

Runaway, loose, gonna run over you
Infected, injected, completely subdued
Invasive, foreign entity, unwelcome
Unwelcome, unwelcome

Lines, lines la la la la la la
Lines, lines la la la la la la
Lines, la la la la la

High, sunlight, drown
High, sunlight, goodbye---
