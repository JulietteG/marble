Children they feed teeth clenched tight
Don't let them see, on either side
What they can't hear, won't hurt them no
Keep them well fed, this one's bone dry
Bring me the next, the promising eyes
Diminishing light of your soul

The devil he calls, in the industry halls
The honest disguise, bloated and blue
It's time for a star, the siblings are full
Pretty and clean
Prepare to be spilled
Stay on your knees and please them all---
