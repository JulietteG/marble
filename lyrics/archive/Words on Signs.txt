Close those eyes down
We all fall down
Into the space
Gone with no trace
Feel your heart slow
Where will we go
Into the sunlight
Or the dead of night
Theres nobody here for me now
Theres nobody here for me now
Theres nobody here for me now
So much running scared
Living breathing dead
Theres nobody here for me now
Theres nobody here for me now
Silence fills you through
Time to tell the truth
See the words on signs
It ends with a blink of an eye---
