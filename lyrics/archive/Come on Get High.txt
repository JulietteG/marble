Come on get high
Switch off get high
So we can fall in love again

Too much sick highs
I need to fall in love again

So long we're high
Back in love with everything

My love come on
Bleak heart I long
I long my love
Bleak heart it's gone
I want to feel a part of you

Come on get high
Switch off get high
No more sick highs
So we can fall in love again
My love we're high
Come on get high
Come on
Back in love with everything---
