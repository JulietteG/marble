Gentleness sense my fear
Come closer, closer
Influence evil rising
Come closer, closer
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Penetrate slowing hearts down together
Together
Together
Together

Captivate soul and blood
Hold you still
Interlace
Come closer, closer
Infinite
It's timeless
Come closer, closer

Penetrate slowing hearts down together
Penetrate slowing hearts down together

Stick Me In My Heart

Stick me in my heart

Sacrifice my heart how I want it
Crave the pain you give 'cause I need it
Claw away my skin then I see it
Losing all my mind 'til I find it
You are all that cuts and is biting

You are all the things that enlight me
Take away you're here and I'm nothing
Just and empty hole
I am nothing
Take away my fear
Please do something
Everything that is
Is love about you---
