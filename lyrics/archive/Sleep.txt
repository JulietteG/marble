The enemy is after me again
Afraid of the sea and whats down there
I need to sleep 
Its been a whole week

Cos tears keep falling into my pool
Bright lights driving right into me cold

I need to sleep
Its been a whole week

Cos tears keep falling into my pool
Bright lights driving right into me cold

My bones keep breaking
Tearing me away from the quiet
The silence of my soul, of my soul from the quiet

Night time, gruelling, just time to waste
Heights they kill me, leave scarring on my face

Cos I never, ever, ever fall into sleep?
And Ive never ever ever felt so weak

Cos tears keep falling into my pool
Bright lights driving right into me cold

My bones keep breaking
Tearing me away from the quiet
The silence of my soul, of my soul from the quiet

I wanna fall down (Repeat x 5)---
