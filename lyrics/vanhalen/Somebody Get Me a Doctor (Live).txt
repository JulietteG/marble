You better call me a doctor.
Feelin' no pain.
Overloaded, down the drain.
Somebody get me a doctor.
You better call up the ambulance, I'm deep in shock.
Overloaded, baby, I can hardly walk.
Somebody get me a doctor.
Somebody get me a doctor.
Feelin' over fine.
And I'm speedin' down that line.
Somebody get me a shot.
You better call up a doctor, feelin high
I'm overloaded baby, I say "Bye-bye!"
Somebody get me a doctor.
Somebody get me a doctor.
Somebody get me a doctor.
Somebody get me a shot.---
