Come on, baby
Ow..

Wha-oh-a-wha-oh-wha-oh
Uh!

Oh, if you wanna see other guys
Baby, I could let it slide
You wanna lover, you want a friend
Mama I can be both of them
I got the tools, to satisfy-uh
Just walk away
If I fall shy at all
Uh!

Come on baby, finish what ya started
I'm incomplete, huh!
That ain't no way to treat the broken-hearted
I need some sympathy!

I like to look at the long run
I like to take each step, one by one
Right on time, you will arrive
By keepin' the dream alive

It's alive
And it's kickin'
Inside of me
So come on baby, please

Come on baby finish what ya started
Oh! I'm incomplete uh!
That ain't no way to treat the broken-hearted
Ow! Come on and finish me!
