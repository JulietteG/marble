A little low on cash
but I'm high on luck.

I wanna be your knight in shining pick-up truck

with a Chevy for my summer home.
Let's get the party started.

It's looking like the city towed
my other apartment.

She got a doorbell sign that said:
"bring it or don't ring it."

She's the woman (Go on:)
She's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman

Fate is my pimp
but she was cool.

(I) said If you're doin' business with me, honey
what does that make you?

Some Casablanca gin joint?
You're a nervous wreck.

Your I.Q. plummets fourteen points.
Her thunder thong around your neck.

The song ain't dirty
it's really just the way we sing it. (Sing it:)

She's the woman (Sing it:)
She's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman

She wanted something to regret
tomorrow morning.

This suburban garage-a-trois
was worth exploring.

Yeah dreams come true
but it remains to be seen.

By the time mine usually do
it's no longer me!

She got a doorbell sign:
"you better bring it, or don't ring it."

She's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman---
