Here today gone later today
i've been reading what the bloggers say
how bout a great big slice for me
otherwise or professionally

Beats workin'
startin up in my feet
goes to workin' on the rest of me
live this life of luxury sho-noff
beats workin' for me
kid'll land on his feet if he don't land on his seat!


This beats workin' baby
'cause i'm redhot baby like it or not
don't you know that 
this beats workin' baby
'cause i'm redhot baby like it or not

One empty floor
stands between the stage and the welfare door
heads or tails of the same bread
"coin of the realm" just like the man said

Beats workin'
startin up in my feet
goes to workin' on the rest of me
got a feeling all in my head
try to do it like the good book said
kid'll land on his feet if he dont land on his head!

This beats workin' baby
'cause i'm redhot baby like it or not
don't you know that 
this beats workin' baby
'cause i'm redhot baby like it or not

This beats workin' baby
This beats workin' baby
This beats workin' baby
'cause i'm redhot baby like it or not---Lyrics submitted by mike schaefer.
