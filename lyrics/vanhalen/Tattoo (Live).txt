I got Elvis on my elbow
When I flex Elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
And she hula's when I walk

Speaking cherry red
Screaming electric green
Purple mountains' majesty
You can talk to me
Talk to me babe!

Show me your dragon magic
(Tattoo, tattoo)
So autobiographic

Best believe that needle hurts you
Best to see these true colors than follow one of your false virtues

Tell you a secret to make you think
Why is this crazy stuff we'd never say poetry in ink?
Speaking day-glow red, Explodo opaque
Purple mountain's majesty
Tell me you, I'll show you me

Sexy dragon magic

So very autobiographic
(Tattoo, tattoo)
Got a hold on me
(Tattoo, tattoo)
You put a spell on me-eehh

Baby-yeeaahh

Uncle Danny had a coal tattoo
He fought for the unions - some of us still do
On my shoulder is a number of the Chapter he was in
That number is forever like the struggle here to win

Everybody!

Look at me, look at you!
