At night I walk this stinkin' street 
Past the crazies on my block 
And I see the same old faces 
And I hear that same old talk 
And I'm searching for the latest thing 
A break in this routine 
I'm talkin' some new kicks 
Ones like you ain't never seen 
This is home 
This is Mean Street 
It's our home 
The only one I know 
And we don't worry 'bout tomorrow 
Cause we're sick of these four walls 
Now what'd ya think is nothing 
Might be something after all 
Now you know this ain't no through street 
The end is dead ahead 
The poor folks play for keeps down here 
They're the living dead 
Come on down 
Down to Mean Street 
They're dancing now 
Out on Mean Street 
It's always here and now, my friend 
It ain't once upon a time 
It's all over but the shouting 
I'll come and I'll take what's mine 
We're searching for the latest thing 
A break in this routine 
Talkin' some new kicks 
Ones like you ain't never seen 
This is home 
This is Mean Street 
It's our home 
Only one I know 
(This is home) See, a gun is real easy 
(This is Mean Street) In this desperate part of town 
(This is home) Turns you from hunted into hunter 
(This is Mean Street) Go and hunt somebody down 
(This is home) But hear me now, somebody said "Fair Warning, Lord !" 
(This is Mean Street) Lord, strike that poor boy down---
