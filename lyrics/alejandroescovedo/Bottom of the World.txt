Austins changed, its true  show me what hasnt
Tonight the TVs throwing colors on the wall
As we watch the cities of the world reduced to ashes
From where I sit at the Bottom of the World

There used to be a phone booth down here on every corner
You used to call me up just to say my name
But now all anybody gets is a busy signal
No you cant call home, from the Bottom of the World

She said Hey Newspaper Boy, dont you think its time you delivered
I said say the word, your wish is my command
She ran me over like an 18 wheeler
And dumped my body at the Bottom of the World

You may think you know all there is to know about me
You might think the beast is in the cage
But everything you see is just an illusion
Its about to get real at the Bottom of the World

Hey Little Boy, Little Boy you look a little frightened
Boy these arent the kind of streets for walking alone
So why dont you get yourself on back to Houston
I dont think youre ready for the Bottom of the World
No I dont think youre ready for the Bottom of the World---Lyrics submitted by Bruce Bailey.
