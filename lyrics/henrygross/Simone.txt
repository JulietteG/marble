Simone thought I know
How you've tried not to show
That you'll leave me on my own some day
Here in my heart I can say

Simone we've begun
And darling you're the one
I've been saying up these words to say
all my life, for today

Oh my darlin', come and heal me
'Cause I need to be your loving man
Oh my darling can you feel me
'Said I'm giving you the best I can
Oh darling, take my hand

Simone I believe
in a while you will see
How very fine our love can be
Come build your dreams, next to me

Oh my darling, come and heal me
'Cause I need to be your loving man
Oh my darling can you feel me
'Said I'm giving you the best I can---Lyrics submitted by Raymond Jump.
