Ooh baby, ever feel you're naughty for the fun, baby?
I could take you undercover, on the run baby
The night is young, so can I be your +, be your +1?
Can I be your +1? I could be your +1

I'll be everything if you let me in
Music on my skin if you tell me
All you have to say you've got that triple A
And I'm on my way, if you tell me
Can I be your +1? I could be your +1

Ooh baby, ever feel you're naughty for the fun, baby?
I could take you undercover, on the run baby
The night is young, so can I be your +, be your +1?
Can I be your +1? I could be your +1

Ooh baby, would you play my song?
Show me the ropes, I know you're sinking tonight
I know how far you've come
So can I be your +, your +, be your +1?

One, one, one
Can I be your +1?
I'll be everything, everything, everything if you let me in
Can I be your +1?
Can I be your +1?

Ooh baby, would you play my song?
Can I be your +1?
I could be your +1---
