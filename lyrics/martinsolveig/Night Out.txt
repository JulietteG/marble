Hey baby, what's that sound
I make a few steps and I fall on the ground
It's a long shot but darling I couldn't love you more.
Come on, come on

Hey baby, give it a try
I can find an answer if you wanna know why
I know I'm a nerd but give another play to this song
Come on, come on

How does it sound if we spend the night out? [x2]

Come on, come on
