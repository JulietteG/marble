I'm all alone now, check it out
Me and you should take a vacay
I got a plan now we're going out
See you wanting for another day

Here's the thing I wanna talk about
Listen all you got to hear me out
We get it done we get it done my own way
I just wanna say
Wait
Hey now hey now
I haven't had a good laugh for a day now
Hey now hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
Hey now hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

Let's do this right now
Wait

What's the ...
Take your clothes off
Dance again
In the pillows
Run the dedo
It don't matter
We can play
Sing diamond nana

It's the summer
Got exotic
Catch the rays
Hey, sun is never going down
Ooh we have all day

Maybe you can't wait
Really I don't want this it's way too easy
You can wear it out
What I mean is song's out loud
And this day's amazing
Out here we can make it
I think we should take it ye

Hey now hey now
I haven't had a good laugh for a day now
Hey now hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
Hey now hey now
Up top we're the kings of the playground
Hey now hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

Let's do right now
Wait
We're the kings of the playground
Hey now hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
..
Let's do this right now---
