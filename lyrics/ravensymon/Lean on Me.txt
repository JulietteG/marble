[Girl crying]
[Raven:] girl whats up?
[Girl:] I don't know what to do Raven
[Raven:] oh I hate this is happening to you

I feel for you and I feel your pain
What I cant understand why'd he treat you that way
Your so special and your not alone
And because your my friend you have a shoulder to cry on

You can lean on me (lean on me)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry)
You can lean on me (just lean on me)
Don't you worry about a thing

You know I'm there for you
To help you get through
Cuz no one deserves to feel the things you do
And you got a friend someone you can depend on
And when your all alone no need to worry anymore

You can lean on me (you can lean)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry)
You can lean on me (don't you worry bout a thing)
Don't you worry about a thing

[Girl:] Raven sometimes I just feel so alone
[Raven:] oh I feel you but you know I will always be there for you
[Girl:] yea but sometimes I just don't feel I can take it anymore
[Raven:] you know let me tell you something

You can, you can lean on me
When your feeling down
Believe in me I'll never let you down
Put your trust in me and you'll truly see
You got a friend Raven

You can lean on me (you can lean on me)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you, don't you worry)
You can lean on me (you can lean)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry)
You can lean on me (I will be right here)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry you can lean on me)
You can lean on me (I will be right here)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry you can lean on me)
You can lean on me (you can lean on me)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry)

You can lean on me (lean on me)
Don't you worry about a thing (don't you worry)
You can lean on me
Without a doubt you can always lean on me

You can lean on me
Don't you worry about a thing ---Lyrics submitted by katelyn boyett.
