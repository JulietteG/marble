VERSE 1:
I'm just walking 
girls were talking 
nothing crazy,
(A typical night)

Situation 
we always facing 
haters hating, 
(They must have no life)

I can't stand how 
do they manage 
to find the time to 
(Find my flaws but)

I'm sure there is something 
they could be doing other 
then thinking about me. 

CHORUS 1:
Things will always be like this, 
as long as jelously exsists,
thats not how I choose to be 
I'm cool being simply me...

I got mine and you got yours 
take a little make it more 
only way that you can be is being comfortable 
in your skin.

What you have is not for me
If I got to be I be the true 
life only begins being comfortable 
in your skin.

VERSE 2:
It's still workin' 
you keep pushin' 
im not into the
(whole drama scene)

Something happened 
as we were passin' 
made me stop 
I had to say something, 

Hey there ladies 
is this the way 
we should do each other 
(If its that deep),

Take the energy you use to hate on me it will get you further 

No, thats just not me 
I'll never agree 
with negativity 
you can keep that over there 

CHORUS 1:
Things will always be like this, 
as long as jelously exsists,
thats not how I choose to be 
I'm cool being simply me...

I got mine and you got yours 
take a little make it more 
only way that you can be is being comfortable 
in your skin.

What you have is not for me
If I got to be I be the true 
life only begins being comfortable 
in your skin.

HOOK:
What's this about she wont get off it, 
Staring like she wanna get into it, 
new line same script,
Finaly I had to approach she tells me 
tells me her man is the one I can't get with, 
wait hold it...

SPOKEN:
Is that what this about? Girl please...

CHORUS 2:
Things will always be like this 
long as jealousy exists 
that's not how I choose to be 
I'm cool being simply me,

We dont need to waist the time,
Maybe this is all a sign,
Way I see its good to know, 
Here's the problem let it go..

I got mine and you got yours 
take a little make it more 
only way that you can be is being comfortable 
in your skin 

What you have is not for me
If I got to be I be the true 
life only begins being comfortable in your skin...---Lyrics submitted by Sierra.
