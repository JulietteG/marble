[Verse 1: Raven-Symone]
It's been a while... there was you and I, doin things to have you but it wasn't right said some things you maybe shouldn't of said(yeah)but you saved apart of my life (life)
Was another choice(yeah)what would you chose to let you go(let you go) I can't just get enough (no)always say you don't love

[Chorus:]
I wanna let you go, tell me you need me but you gotta love me or leave me baby why can't I let you see you are the only one for me ohh how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me baaaby leave me ohhh. Oh leave me baaaby leave me ohh

[Verse 2:]
My heart is broken apart because of you baby oh can't think about nobody else and I can't help it but your not ready for me to love you like I do. As many times that you heard me you shouldn't deserve me but your there forever that won a million yeaaaah

[Chorus:]
