And I was alone
On the fifth day since you've gone
This broken glass; this early morn
I rub my eyes in the haze
I'm not sleeping anyway
I watch the sun rise up
In the city where I was born

I could call you now
Wouldn't matter what I'd say
Words just aren't enough
I hear our song; press repeat
I smell your perfume on the sheets
You always said, "Boy, you're not so tough"

And only now can I say,
"No matter how I shake and shape
It's these things that make you a man"
And frozen mind begins to thaw
You think, "My God, my God, my God
Where was it I began?"

"I wish you were," is what I'd say
If you asked me in the light of day
But these nights are like a dream I can't shake
And there's your hair and there's your head
And there's your empty dress on the bed
I wish I could scream myself awake

But I won't go back to what I was
And I know now that you are lost
It's your choices that make you a man
And frozen mind begins to thaw
You think, "My God, my God, my God
Where was it I began?"---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
