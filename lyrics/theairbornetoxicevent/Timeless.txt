As she disappeared alone in the darkness,
I felt her spirit stay in the room.
And I wished that our lives were just endless
Cause it's all too short, and I'm leaving soon.

I want to hold on to all of the people I lost,
I want to keep them with me.
we will never part.

We are, we are,
We are timeless, timeless.
Everything we have, we have,
Everything oh my god.
You are, you are,
The only thing that makes me feel like,
I can live forever, forever.
with you, my love.

I see her, they run through the tall grass
Such thoughtless minds, I wish I was thoughtless too
Well this hole in my heart, that I cannot abide
Just want you to stay with me tonight.

We are, we are
We are timeless, timeless
Everything we have, we have,
Everything oh my god.
You are, you are,
the only thing that makes me feel like,
I can live forever, forever
with you-

Just help me through this moment
After everything I told you
How the weight of their loss is like the weight of the sun.
I see their faces near me,
I hear their voices callin,
It was like their lives were over before they begun.

oh ooohoohohoh oh

We are, we are
We are timeless, timeless
Everything we have, we have
Everything oh my god
You are, you are
The only thing that makes me feel like
I can live forever, forever
with you.

We are, we are
We are timeless, timeless
Everything we have, we have
Everything oh my god
You are, you are
The only thing that makes me feel like
I can live forever, forever
with you, my love

oh ooohoohohoh
With you, my love.---
