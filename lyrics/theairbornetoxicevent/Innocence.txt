I want to disappear
I just sleep all day
These spots on my hands
My skin just like sand
And the air so cold
I shudder and I cant see

The carpet on my feet
The sweat stains on the sheets
With cough syrup and drugs
Bandages and gauze
The razors dull
The water cold against my skin

The radio lull
The static buzzin round like tin
And all these empty plans
The ink stains on my hands
And everyone says
The best words for the gray

Are these weary mourning tomes
Ill probably save mine too
If heavens just a long road home
Tell me its true
Ill go too
Ill go too
Ill go too

Well I lost my innocence today
I could feel her in my bones
My bones my bones my bones
My blood my blood my blood my blood
And I woke up tired scared and sad 
So drained 
I felt so bad
Today, today, today
What you steal, you steal, you steal, you steal
What you say, you say, you say
What you feel, you feel, you feel
Which is nothing but hollow 
Thin as air
Oh I could die I just dont care
Forget happiness Im fine
Ill forget everything in time
I swear I didnt know who you know
Me how I cant let go
And were not gods were just hacks
All the light below the cracks
The scars the sea just breaks
The ugliest scenes the worst mistakes
and everywhere I see her face
such a beautiful child
such an awful waste
And theres no innocence like hers
Just emptiness and nerves

And this light 
From the window of my car 
Shell never see it
Oh my God
I was so surprised 
You blew up in my face 
Lord I lost my nerve  
Oh my God
Oh my God, Oh my God

and I tear, I tear
so hard
and I tear, I tear
so hard

and I beg
and scream I was wrong 
so mercys gone

Oh my love---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
