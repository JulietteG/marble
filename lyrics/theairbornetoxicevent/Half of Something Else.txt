On the night that we met
You told me you wanted
Something more from me
And it was all that I could do

I remember your face, like a child
The way that you blushed
The way that you smiled
And now it's all that I can do

And I wake up feeling new
There's so much more I never knew

So I think of all the years spent alone
It's like you're searching for something
To make you feel whole

Like you're half of something else
Like you're half of something else
Just a fraction of yourself

Don't take it so hard;
We did what we could
There were no easy answers
To be understood

It was all that we could do
We're the only ones who knew
Now all I think about is you

The way that you screamed
The way that you cried
The way that you wipe your eyes
And fall against my side
The way that you told
Told me I was wrong
And the way that you'd sing
When you'd hear a song

And the way that you answered
When you knew I was gone

Now I know that I'm blind
And that you're all I see
And yeah I know it's not clever
But I just want you with me

I'm only half of something else
I'm only half of something else
I'm only half of something else---Lyrics submitted by Jayme.
