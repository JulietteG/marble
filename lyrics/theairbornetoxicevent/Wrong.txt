All my young life
I've been trying to say
Just one thing right
And now, we've come to the day
You're here in my arms
I don't know what to say

I believe I was wrong
Probably most of my life
Or am I just hearing it wrong
I'm just watching the fire light

See, look in your eyes
Am I trying too hard?
Am I doing this right?
So I fall, I fall down to my knees
I'm not easy to soothe
I'm never easy to please

I believe I was wrong
Probably most of my life
Or am I just hearing it wrong
I'm just watching the fire light

I don't care if it's right
Only friends are oppose
We still got tonight
We'll just keep our eyes close

I believe I was wrong
Probably most of my life
Or am I just hearing it wrong
I'm just watching the fire light

I don't care if it's right
Only friends are oppose
We still got tonight
We'll just keep our eyes close---
