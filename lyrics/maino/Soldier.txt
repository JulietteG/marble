I see so many soldiers, falling down.
So I stand on my feet, I wont ever quit, I wont touch the ground
So many soldiers, falling down (falling down, down)
I can hear them calling out for me, but I just cant turn back.
I gotta keep movin on

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My heart is made of stone and my bodys numb
Feelin like Im empty all my feelins gone
The friends I used to have is now the ones thats gone
Circumstances in the street left me all alone
Wasnt feelin much, at times I felt like givin up
Then a voice inside my head told me to live it up, to the limit yes
Live it like its limitless,
Keep on movin like my friends was still here livin this.
Cant believe I went to all my niggas funerals
So I keep on ballin like my dogs would want me too
Never forgotten, boy our liquor glasses in the air
Keep on livin, screamin, One day Ima meet you there!

I see so many soldiers, falling down.
So I stand on my feet, I wont ever quit, I wont touch the ground
So many soldiers, falling down (falling down, down)
I can hear them calling out for me, but I just cant turn back.
I gotta keep movin on

I gotta turn it up on this one Jimmy
Keep on movin, keep on pushin, hopin that the Lord don heard me
I just got a couple questions:
Why my homeboys left so early?
Why you never took me wit em?
Why you left me here to miss em?
Why you let my cousin kill hisself and left me here to feel it?
Lift my spirits, lift my spirits, this all real this not just lyrics
Drink my pain with vodka and pineapple juice in a cup and stir it
Pop a bottle, guess Im ballin
Catch me God I feel Im fallin
I can hear my loved ones callin
Been wide up since 5 in the mornin
Keep on goin, keep on goin, feelin like the Worlds been closin
I stare at the stars and hope that all my friends could see me blowin
This is for my fallin soldiers, I can feel you on my shoulders
Theres a piece of me that died with you, if you ever noticed

[Spoken]
I am who I am
I am who I am
I am who I am
Yeah, I can feel it!

I see so many soldiers, falling down.
So I stand on my feet, I wont ever quit, I wont touch the ground
So many soldiers, falling down (falling down, down)
I can hear them calling out for me, but I just cant turn back.
I gotta keep movin on---Lyrics submitted by Jacob Genett.
