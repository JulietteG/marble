(feat. Trey Songz)

Yeah, they love it when I come through
Rollin' like a thug dude, top down, glidin' in some new
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

They see me in the hood and everywhere I'm good
And they lovin' and respectin' like they should
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

Man know, I keep it own hood
And I will never change, never go Hollywood
Let it be understood that I'll be in the hood
Right where the street is poppin', right on I block I'm good

Now what this niggas thinkin' That I don't really been
Places that I'll be speakin', the ghettos what I am dippin'
My weapons be conceal, I'm livin' how I feel
So fuck the record deal, nigga my record real

Now what you heard about me, the playin' controversy
Now hommie don't you doubt me, I keep 'em killers 'round me
I come from Kings County, these haters wanna tell me
See how these bitches tell me, New York about the crazy

Yeah, they love it when I come through
Rollin' like a thug dude, top down, glidin' in some new
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

They see me in the hood and everywhere I'm good
And they lovin' and respectin' like they should
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

Listen, look, now everybody know me, they get it poppin' for me
You just come around here unless you say you know me
I'm bein' places that, that is know never be
They say they come from out here but we don't ever see

Me and my butchy bitch, we in to see, oh cool
Mami, you good with me, my love is bullet proof
I homies speak the truth, my ties is really strong
Now watch me hop out those gates, put on my jerry on

Now you can tell me that I don't get her respects
I bought the candy truck right, right in the projects
This ain't goin' on as bad, this Halloween at
After the studio baby, that's where I'd be at

Yeah, they love it when I come through
Rollin' like a thug dude, top down, glidin' in some new
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

They see me in the hood and everywhere I'm good
And they lovin' and respectin' like they should
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

They love it when your boy come on
Yeah, they know what I'm about
Ain't nothin' 'bout this hood love
Gotta know about this hood love

They love it when your boy come on
Yeah, they know what I'm about
Ain't nothin' 'bout this hood love
Gotta know about this hood love

Listen, so my niggas this from the hood, they call it home
To my hustlers try to stay open, say your phones
We on the corner, we drinkin' our friends memories
I try to tell 'em I'll never ever be in the streets

I'm still in the street, I'm so hurry now
The black bandanna, my hoodie poured down
I'm so ghetto right, I'm so ghetto fly
I'm so stuck in my ways, I live a ghetto life

Yeah, they love it when I come through
Rollin' like a thug dude, top down, glidin' in some new
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

They see me in the hood and everywhere I'm good
And they lovin' and respectin' like they should
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

Hood love, hood love, hood love
Oh, oh, oh, hood love---Lyrics submitted by kihiem.
