I have done so many foolish things
I've let you down before
But it's all different now
Don't cry - put on that smile again,
'cause I will stand by you
Until the very end
Take a look inside my heart,
and tell me if it isn't love you see

Time is all we need to mend our love
Time is all we need to heal our wounds
Time is all we need
Time for love

Times will change, but I still care for you
The way I always do, they I always did
I had so many sleepless nights
When I was thinking about
How much you mean to me
Take a look inside my heart,
and tell me if it isn't love you see

Time is all we need to mend our love
Time is all we need to heal our wounds
Time is all we need
Time for love---Lyrics submitted by Mattias Ranefalk.
