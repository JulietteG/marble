There's gasoline in your eye
There's fire in mine
I know I'll never gonna like you
But there's always my time
There's a lot of fire
in your eyes there..
I know I can never never show you
But there's always my time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
There's gasoline in your eye
I could have your fire
I know that this is momentary
Imagine it's my time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I can feel I can feel
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
I wish it wasn't
Just the night time
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
