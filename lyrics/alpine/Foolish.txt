Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you do you, do you
Will you, will you, will you, will you
Come on, come on, come on home
Tonight

It's the way that you move into my heart
It's the way that I move out

Yeah, ow
Yeah, ow
You brought too much too much metaphor to the
Relationship, to what I see
To how I kiss, yuck
Yeah, ow
I'm hating what I'm feeling but I'm
So foolishly attracted to you
You

Baby you had me doubt all that I knew
Hey you, can we move on?

Yeah, ow
Yeah, ow
You brought too much too much metaphor to the
Relationship, to what I see
To how I kiss, yuck
Yeah, ow
I'm hating what I'm feeling but I'm
So foolishly attracted to you
You

Foolishly attracted
So foolishly attracted
So foolishly attracted to you---
