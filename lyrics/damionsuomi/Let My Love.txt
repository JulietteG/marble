There's a storm coming in
Faster than you can run
Don't worry, darling
This shelter is strong

Let my love cover you
Let my love cover you
Let my love cover over you

There's a murder of crows
Just outside of the door, oh
Don't worry, darling
This shelter is strong

Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover over you (over you)

There are bugs inside these sheets
So small we cannot see them
Why worry, darling
They won't bother me

Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover over you (over you)

There are ghosts inside the house
I hear them whispering
Why worry, darling
They haven't bothered me

Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover over you (over you)

There's a knock at the back door
Oh, the dog wants to come in
Don't worry, darling
He's been a good friend

Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover over you (over you)

Why worry darling, thinkin'
What will we eat
Why worry darling, thinkin'
What will we dream 

Oh, don't worry 'bout tomorrow
For it worries for itself
Each day's got enough
Trouble of it's own

Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover you (let my love)
Let my love cover over you (over you)---Lyrics submitted by Samreen.
