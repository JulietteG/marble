I see you there like a light in the sky
Don't give up
I'll fight, if you show me a sign
Monkeys and Epos there screaming cos they don't waste time
The city that sleeps not knowing the reason why

And we stop and stare cos we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon, I told a lie

I see you there like a light in the sky
Don't give up
I'll fight, if you show me a sign
Work fills with practice, no contact, no reason to shine
I'll sail all this ocean to search of the reason why

And we stop and stare cos we don't know where we're going
And we break the code and try to hide our feelings
And we stop and stare cos we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon, I told a lie

And all I see is the flashing of lights
I need to feel the heat, don't give up the fight
I see your pain is wrath, you're burning so bright
The castle sleeps, the archers take aim
I feel the fire, do you feel it the same?
All I see is the flashing of lights, tonight

And we stop and stare cos we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon, I told a lie

And we stop and stare cos we don't know where we're going
And we break the code and try to hide our feelings
And we stop and stare cos we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon, I told a lie.---Lyrics submitted by Lewis.
