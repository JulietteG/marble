I got the Blues, deep down in my heart...
I love you baby, please dont let us apart,
Im gonna play the blues,
Play the blues from my heart...

Its out of me, baby cant you see,
Im gonna play the blues baby,
Deep down in my heart, you see..
Im gonna play the blues
Play the blues from my heart. .....

I got the blues, deep down in my heart..
I love you baby, please dont let us apart,
Im gonna play the blues,
Play the blues from my heart...

(Yeah, You Know That!!)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
