If you
If you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything

I swore
I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong
I was wrong

If you
If you could get by trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?---
