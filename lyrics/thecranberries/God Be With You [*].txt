the truth can never hide
even though i tried
they tried to take my pride
but they only took my father from me
they only took my father
even though i'd cried
even though i tried

god be with you ireland
god be with you ireland

sometimes i was afraid
even though i prayed
i thrust my religion down
you took that too somehow
blood upon thy hands
blood upon thy hands

god be with you ireland
god be with you ireland
god be with you ireland
god be with you ireland---Lyrics submitted by amber.
