Everybody raise a glass
Hit me right now
To all of those up in the snow
From all of us down south
'Tis the season for believing
And faith and family
Wish you were here with me

We cleared out a place in the sand
For Dancer and Prancer to land
We saved a boat slip for Santa's sleigh
Christmas in Blue Chair Bay

Everybody raise a glass
Hit me right now
To all of those up in the snow
From all of us down south
'Tis the season for believing
And faith and family
Wish you were here with me

By the sea
A little numb
I'm drinking rum---
