A little country church on a two lane road
A bride and a groom coming out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
'Just Married' written on a blue Chevrolet

Don't that make you want to fall in love?
Don't that look like a picture of us?
A match made in Heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall?

That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love?

Old folks sittin' in a front porch swing
Still holdin' hands like they were sixteen
Fifty good years, they're a lover's dream
Darlin' that could be you and me

Don't that make you want to fall in love?
Don't that look like a picture of us?
A match made in Heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall?

That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love?

Well, now don't that make you want to fall in love?---
