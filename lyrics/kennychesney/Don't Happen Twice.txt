I haven't seen you in forever
Oh, you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I'd remember
How could I forget

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star in that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 a.m I feel in love for the first time in my life
Oh, that's something that just don't happen twice

To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star in that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 a.m I feel in love for the first time in my life
Oh, that's something that just don't happen twice

One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 a.m I fell in love for the first time in my life
Oh, that's something, baby that's something
Oh, that's something that just don't happen twice

Oh, yeah
We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah, we fell in love---
