I move on like a sinner's prayer
Let 'em go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
But I'm better as a memory than as your man

Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
Never stay, but then again I might
Struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure 'til I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out 
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

'Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinnin' then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
One day you're gonna find someone
Right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
Was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment
You'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man

Better as a Memory than as your man.---Lyrics submitted by M P.
