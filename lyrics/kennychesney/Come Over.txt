I turn the tv off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

(Chorus)
I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say were done the way you always do
Its easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends
You know theyre gonna say
Were bad for each other
But we aint good for anyone else

(Repeat Chorus)

We dont have to miss each other, come over
We dont have to fix each other, come over
You dont have to say forever, come over
You dont have to stay forever, come over

(Repeat Chorus)

Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over.---Lyrics submitted by Sierra Mae Kay.
