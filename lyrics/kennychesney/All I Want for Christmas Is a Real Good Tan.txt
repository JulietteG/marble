Oooooooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan? All I want for Christmas is a real good tan.

Ch1. All I want for Christmas is a real good tan. Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand. Rockin to and fro with the rythm of the ocean. Singin 'Silent Night' with the palm trees a blowin. Oooooooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan? All I want for Christmas is a real good tan.

V1. Well if you're thinkin bout gettin me a present this year, let me put a bug in your cute little ear. How bout two tickets to a tropical shore where we don't hafta wear these winter clothes anymore? Instead of turkey we'll have Mahi Mahi grillin and Pina Coloda's in the blender chillin.
(repeat ch1.)

V2. Well, everybody's prayin for a Christmas of white. Come to think about it that'd be alright. As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground, and everyday our skin gets a little more brown. We'll string some lights in a coconut tree. I'll rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me.

Ch2. All I want for Christmas is a real good tan. I can see us married on the beach hand in hand. Rockin to and fro with the rythm of the ocean. Baby won't you say you and me we'll be goin. Oooooooooo I can almost feel my toes in the sand. All I want for Christmas is a real good tan.

Don't worry baby we'll celebrate plenty. I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini. We won't hafta worry bout the holiday rush. It'll be you and me fallin deeper in love. Oooooooooo don't you think it's a pretty good plan? All I want for Christmas is a real good tan.
