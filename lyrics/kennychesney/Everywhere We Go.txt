I keep telling myself
this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time
waiting on dreams
 that just weren't coming true

This old highway
seems to understand
Leading me on somewhere
where no one knows my name

I got the window rolled down
I got the radio up
I'm doing all i can
to get my mind off us

What i need to do
is turn this car around
Drive as fast as i can
till i see the lights of our hometown
and run to her
take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry i am
which shouldn't be so hard
but i drive on and on and on

Eighty seven more miles
gets me in the baton rouge
There's a buddy of mine
said he might find some work that i can do
Maybe head up north
to Knoxville Tennessee
I know my baby sister
has got a couch where i can sleep

Now the suns goin' down
on my broken heart
Lord, i gotta get back
before i go too far

What i need to do
is turn this car around
Drive as fast as i can
till i see the lights of our hometown
and run to her
take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry i am
which shouldn't be so hard
but i drive on 
yes i drive on and on and on

Knowing what i need to do
Girl I'm coming home to you
Knowing what i need to do
Girl I'm coming home to you
Girl I'm coming home to you
Knowing what i need to do---Lyrics submitted by kaylie.
