I could jump on some old highway
Run a thousand miles or more
Unlock some hidden mystery
Behind a distant door
I could sail the seven oceans
'Til I crawl up on some long forgotten shore

But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you
I'm looking for

I could climb a hundred mountains
Leave a hard, old world behind
Wander out across some prairie
Like a man out of his mind
I could walk and stare into the sun
Let it all just burn me deaf and blind

But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you
I'm trying to find

Where does a man go for redemption
Where does he take a broken heart
Shouldn't there be some small exemption
If he does all that it takes
To admit to his mistakes
'Til the truth batters and breaks his world apart

I could ask for my forgiveness
From the heavens high above
Tell myself my prayers
Are gonna somehow be enough
Then lay down in some angel's bed
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming of

But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you
That I love

Where does a man seek his salvation
When does his mind finally go free
Is the pain he feels the only explanation
For believing lies are true
For the stone inside a shoe
The endless ways you keep haunting me

I could find an empty church
Get down on my knees
Tell myself that mercy is a matter of degrees
Then lay down in some angel's arms
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming of

But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you
That I love

Always gonna be you
That I love

That I love---
