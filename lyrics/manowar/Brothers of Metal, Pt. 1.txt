BROTHERS OF METAL
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is the strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of Metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here well remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of Metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for the Metal Metal thats real
Brothers of Metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and Metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
Were all brothers of Metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with Metal and masters we have none
And we will die for Metal, Metal heals my son
Brothers of Metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for Metal Metal thats real
Brothers of Metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to power drink to the sound
Thunder and Metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We are brothers of Metal here in the hall
Brothers of Metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for Metal Metal thats real
Brothers of Metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air---Lyrics submitted by paras.
