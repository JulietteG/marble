Near to the blaze I wander
Through this black night I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords did clash
Fallen by our axes helmets smashed

Glory and fame blood is our name
Souls full of thunder hearts of steel
Killers of men a warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end

One day too I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will scorch the land

Glory and fame blood is our name
Souls full of thunder hearts of steel
Killers of men of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the Gods
Today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

Sons of Odin we four
By the Hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born another shall fall
This day men will die

Glory and fame blood is our name
Souls full of thunder hearts of steel
Killers of men of warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the Gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

Sons of the Gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War!!!

[Onward into the heart of the battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still they fought on

Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies

But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them
The Berserker Rage

Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals

Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day

Hail Gods Of War!---Lyrics submitted by lestart lora.
