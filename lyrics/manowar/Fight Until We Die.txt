When they come I'll be ready
I hear the voices inside
The stars in the Heavens are moving
Soon they will arrive
Thor god of thunder let me die with a sword in my hand

Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again 
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight 'till we win or we'll fight untill we die

Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Tempted to the Earth to none shell remain
Sons of deamons I command you to fly
Ride out from hell into the sky
We'll fight untill we die

When they come I'll be ready
I hear the voices inside
The stars in the Heavens are moving
Soon they will arrive
Thor god of thunder let me die with a sword in my hand

Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again 
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight 'till we win or we'll fight 'till we die

Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Tempted to the Earth to none shell remain
Sons of deamons I command you to fly
Ride out from hell into the sky

Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Tempted to the Earth to none shell remain
Sons of deamons I command you to fly
Ride out from hell into the sky

We'll fight untill, fight untill, fight untill we die
Sons of deamons I command you to fly fight
Sons of deamons I command you to fly fight
Sons of deamons I command you to fly fight
Sons of deamons I command you to fly fight---Lyrics submitted by ManOwaR.
