There's a sound heard across the land it's heard across the sea
You will only hear it if you listen with your heart and one day hope
to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave there lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us and now it's our time to be free

Where the eagle sky i will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend 
Say the words you will be free from the mountains to the sea
We will fight for freedom again

So bring out loud for all the world to hear from the sea to shining sea
Let freedom bring and every man be king and live as one through the years

Where the eagle sky i will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend 
Say the words you will be free from the mountains to the sea
We will fight for freedom again

Now is the time we almost stand together
So raise your hands we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever marching to the battle with this song

Where the eagle sky i will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend 
Say the words you will be free from the mountains to the sea
We will fight for freedom again

Where the eagle sky i will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend 
Say the words you will be free from the mountains to the sea
We will fight for freedom again

Where the eagle sky i will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend 
Say the words you will be free from the mountains to the sea
We will fight for freedom again

[And so on]---Lyrics submitted by Erik.
