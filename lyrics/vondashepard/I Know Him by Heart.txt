there's a secret path i follow 
to a place no one can find
where i meet my perfect someone 
i kept hidden in my mind
where my heart makes my decisions
and my dream becomes a vision
and the love i feel 
makes him real someday
but i know he's out there somewhere
just beyond my reach
though i've never really touched him 
or ever heard him speak
though we've never been together
we've never been apart
no we've never met 
i haven't found him yet
but i know him by heart
am i living an illusion wanting something i can't see
if i compromise i'd be living lies 
pretending love's not meant to be
but i know my heart's worth saving 
and  i know that he'll be waiting
and the love i feel makes him real someday
coz i know he's out there somewhere
just beyond my reach
though i've never really touched him
or ever heard him speak
though we've never been together
we've never been apart
no, we've never met
i haven't found him yet
but i know him by heart.---Lyrics submitted by abigail.
