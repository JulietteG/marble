I woke up to another day
Another day to celebrate
Your beauty and your mystery
Is more than any, I can see

I'm not the man I was before
With You, my life is so much more
Break the chains and open doors, to a world I can't ignore

Lord, let me shine, shine like the moon
A reflection of You in all that I do
Lord, let me be, a light for Your truth
Light of the world, I wanna be used to shine for You

As simple as a passing smile
Or listening a little while
To someone that's convinced that they are in this all alone

But, here's my chance to share the news
To introduce the good that's You
Here You go again, You never cease to blow my mind

Lord, let me shine, shine like the moon
A reflection of You in all that I do
Lord, let me be, a light for Your truth
Light of the world, I wanna be used to shine for You

You're the love that we all need
You lift us up to our feet
You hold the key to eternity
The King of Kings, alive in me

Lord, let me shine, shine like the moon
A reflection of You in all that I do
Lord, let me be, a light for Your truth
Light of the world, I wanna be used to shine for You

Lord, let me shine, shine like the moon
A reflection of You in all that I do
Lord, let me be a light for Your truth
Light of the world, I wanna be used to shine for You

Shine for You
To shine for You
To shine for You---Lyrics submitted by Aubree Price.
