I got a dollar in my pocket
 There ain't a cloud up above

I got a picture in a locket
That says Baby I Love you

Well if you didn't look then boys
Then fellows don't go looking now

Well here she comes a walking
All that Heaven will allow

Say hey there Mr. Bouncer
Now all I want to do is dance

But I swear I left my wallet
Back home in my working pants

So come on Slim slip me in, man
I'll make it up to you somehow

I can't be late I've got a date
With all that Heaven will allow

Rainstorms and dark skies
Well now they don't mean a thing

If you've got a girl that Loves you
And wants to wear your ring

So come on Mr. Trouble 
We'll make it through you somehow

We'll fill this house with all the Love
Ah that Heaven will allow  

BREAK

Rainstorms and dark skies
Well now they don't mean a thing

If you've got a girl that Loves you
And wants to wear your ring

So come on Mr. Trouble
We'll make it through you somehow

We'll fill this house with all the love
Ah that Heaven will allow

Now some may want to die young, man
Young and gloriously

Get it straight now mister
Buddy that ain't me

Cause I've got something on my mind,yeah
That sets me straight and walking proud

And I want all the time
All that Heaven will allow

And I want all the time
All that Heaven will allow---Lyrics submitted by Sergio.
