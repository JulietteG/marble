I screwed up seven summers
In one afternoon gone wrong
It started out like "Amazing Grace"
Ended like a Springsteen song
All she wanted was a little less reckless
All she needed was some settle down
But all she got was a second hand Chevy
With the peddle to the metal headed outta town

God knows the straight and narrow
Don't think much of guys like me
Live like there's no tomorrow
Looks like there's gonna be
I'm gonna see if I can't right a couple wrongs
Before I wake up with another day gone

I missed us singing last Sunday
I showed up a hair too late
Back slider in the back row
With a heavy heart and a head ache
It's just a couple miles from my house, but I don't go a lot
'Cause it's a million miles from the back road to that church parking lot

God knows the straight and narrow
Don't think much of guys like me
Live like there's no tomorrow
Looks like there's gonna be
I'm gonna see if I can't right a couple wrongs
Before I wake up with another day gone

Got a lot of pride to swallow
Got a lot of guilty feel
I know God will forgive me
But who knows if she will

Ohhh
Yea, I'm gonna see if I can't right a couple wrongs
Yea, I'm gonna see if I can't right a couple wrongs
Before I wake up with another day gone

I wanna hear her angel voice
Singin' a Sunday song
Before I wake up with another day gone---
