She was a Sunday girl
with her hair pulled back
and a bottle in her hand
Covered in silver rings,
she liked to tease
but I didnt get her name
All I want is to remember your name
I just need you to get me off again
But all ive got of you
is a photograph in my head
no way to get with you 
my a.m. princess
I just need you to get me off again
I cant get your picture out of my head

Shes such a lovely girl but gasoline is running in her veins
She likes to try it all her 
favorite things are lipstick and cocaine

Come with me, stay with me
I want to be a partner in your sin,
I need to feel you---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
