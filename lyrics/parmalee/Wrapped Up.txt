Lying here, my minds in overdrive
Too far away, from my design
So wont you open up
let me lick your wounds
Shut me down, just use me
I cant get away, Im all wrapped up in you
Im bound and chained,
all wrapped up in you
Its the strangest thing,
how I fell these days
My mind is so full of you,
I cant see through my ways

Now youre here in front of me
I can see your lines
I can feel your breathe
I cant get away, Im all wrapped up in you
Im bound and chained,
all wrapped up in you

	[Ive got to get away,
		Ive got to get out of here]
	[Ive got to get away,
		I think Im breaking]---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
