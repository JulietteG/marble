Throwing It All Away
Im drowning and I cant 
pull myself from this hole Im in
Ive moved and Im changing
but I cant get too far
Why did I begin
I feel myself come unwound
But I cant rest Im broken down

Im throwing it all away,
nothing left to loose
Im cashing it all in,
this is the life I choose
Im throwing it all away
trying to believe
But throwing it all away
is never easy as it seems
Tell me do you remember
when things began to change
Thats when I convinced myself
that everythings in vein
Dont you understand
I had to break these chains

What I said this was
the only thing I wanted
Would you go anywhere for me
But throwing it all away is never as easy as it seems---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
