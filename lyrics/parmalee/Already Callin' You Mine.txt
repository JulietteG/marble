I barely know you
You barely know me
We ain't but two slow dances into this thing
Come on let's sit down
Ill order us a round
I wanna know everything

Girl where's your hometown
Are those your mamas eyes
What are you doing for the rest of your life

Cause I'm already thinkin' bout
You and me getting outta here
And taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry bout holdin' on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa, whoa

I know that there's a chance
I'm thinking to fast, tell me tell me am
I right
Or am I reading this wrong
They'll play the last song, the lights
Will come on
That don't mean we can't take the long way
Home, home, home

If you like the way that sounds
We can leave this place right now, right now---
