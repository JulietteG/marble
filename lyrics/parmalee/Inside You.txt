If I only knew what I was getting into
I would have turned around
and walked away from you
But now I sit back and close my eyes
And I think back through all the lies
That we told to keep them from knowing

And Ive tried to hold on
But I cant hide inside you anymore
My page is torn
I cant hide inside you anymore
I cant hide inside you

And now that its all out in the open
And theres no reason for us to hide
I can sit back and realize that
It wasnt just a waste of time
But I cant wait for you any longer

I wash it down
Down
[I wash it down it makes it better,
I wash it down it makes it better]---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
