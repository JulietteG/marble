Theres a certain moment
When theres nothing left to say
Time seems to pass too slowly
As I watch you fade away
Sometimes I lose you completely
Even when youre standing in front of me
Was it everything you thought it would be
Did you get what you wanted
Was it everything you thought it would be, you thought it
Would be

Sometimes when you hold me,
and run your fingers through my hair
You feel like you could own me
but hates too much to bear

And I ask too many questions
Maybe I didnt see, yeah
That you were everything
I thought you would be---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
