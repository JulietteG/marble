Yeah we could wait for the sun to go down
Count the hours til' its time to go out
But the radio's on
And its playin' our song
Girl I cant help but see the sweat on your skin
Makes me want to put something cool in your hand
And take that T-shirt off
Is that so wrong

Whatcha say we do a little day drinkin'
Tell me girl are you thinkin' what i'm thinkin'
We could stay right here
And just start workin' on a buzz soakin' in the sun
No we ain't in no rush
So whatcha say we do a little day drinkin'
Yeah some day drinking

Girl there's just somethin' bout nothin' to do
We could turn a happy hour right into two
Three or four if you want
It'd be a shame if we don't

Let's go
So come on and raise a cup
Ahh yeah bottoms up
Until the night comes you and me just day drinking
Tell me girl are you thinkin' what i'm thinkin'
We could stay right here
And just start workin' on a buzz soakin' in the sun
No we ain't in no rush
So whatcha say we do a little day drinkin'
Yeah, yeah some day drinking
Ain't nothin wrong with a little day drinkin
Some day drinkin---
