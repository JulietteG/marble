OK, talk to you 
South America, Australia, France, Germany, UK, Africa 

Calling out around the world 
Are you ready for a brand new beat 
Summer's here and the time is right 
For dancing in the street 
They're dancing in Chicago 
Down in New Orleans 
In New York City 

All we need is music, sweet music 
There'll be music everywhere 
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing, 
Dancing in the street, oh 

It doesn't matter what you wear, 
just as long as you are there 
So come on, every guy, grab a girl, 
everywhere, around the world 
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street 

It's an invitation across the nation, 
a chance for folks to meet 
They'll be laughing and singing, music swinging 
Dancing in the street 

Philadelphia, PA 
Baltimore in DC now 
Don't forget the motor city 
On the streets of Brazil 
Back in the USSR 
No matter where you are 

All we need is music, sweet music 
There'll be music everywhere 
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing 
Dancing in the street, oh 

It doesn't matter what you wear 
Just as long as you are there 
So come on every guy, grab a girl, 
everywhere, around the world 
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street 

Way down in L.A., everyday 
Dancing in the street 
Cross in China too 
Me and you 
Dancing in the street 

Don't you know 
They'll be dancing 
Dancing in the street---
