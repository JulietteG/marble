I gave her the means, she had the will
I kept on pushin, for the kill
I never thought , shed finish me
As she shot me down and left me to bleed
With my gun x 6
Mmmmmm
Solo
Open my eyes, my body cold
It shouldnt end this way, I want to grow old
Scramble to my feet and stumbled home
I forgave my girl, I dont want to be alone
She took me back and stitched me up
The whole time smiling cause she won
But one day Ill get back
My gun x6
Yeah
solo
She took me back and stitched me up
The whole time smiling cause she won
But one day Ill get back
My gun x6
But one day Ill get back
My gun x6---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
