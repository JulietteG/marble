Look out, look out for the day we find out what this is all about.
Look out, look out for when the east turns west and the north becomes the south.

We all seem to be losin the handles we were usin
Like holdin the illusion in our hand.
But though the time is passin' the partys ripe for crashin'
And why become the passion of your plan?

Woohoo woohoo we got to understand.
Woohoo woohoo common and clap your hands

Look out look out for the quiet whisper soon becomes a shout
Look out look out for the hidin' places have all been found out

We got no choice in choosin' except the voice your usin
But the ground that youll be losins made of sand
But while your mind is flashin', youll find your colors clashin'
And why become the passion of your plan?

Woohoo woohoo we got to understand.
Woohoo woohoo common and clap your hands
Woohoo woohoo we got to understand.
Woohoo woohoo common and clap your hands ---
