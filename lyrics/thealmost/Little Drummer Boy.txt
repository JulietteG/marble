Come they told me
pa rum pum pum pum
a new born king to see
pa rum pum pum pum
our finest gifts we bring
pa rum pum pum pum
to lay before the king
pa rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
so to honor him
pa rum pum pum pum
when we come

pa rum pum pum pum
a am a poor boy too
pa rum pum pum pum

pa rum pum pum pum
thats fit to give a king
pa rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum

pa rum pum pum pum
on my drum?

mary knodded 
pa rum pum pum pum
the ox and lamb kept time
pa rum pum pum pum

pa rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
then he smiled at me
pa rum pum pum pum

pa rum pum pum pum 
me and my drum---Lyrics submitted by casey.
