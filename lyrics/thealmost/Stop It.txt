it seems like every time we're here I look right back at you. 
and as your eyes perk up and you say and boy don't you come unglued
I'll be so kind of busted up, on your floor 
I'll make a change, so that you want me more 
So that you want me more! 

Is this really my idea I had no clue that all of this is really happening 
my thoughts remain,  lying on the floor 
its not my fault i'm such a allfull messy war 

and now we're here at break next beach oh just to make me feel
less aware of all the time this the times I made you 
as stronger than you really wanted to 
and make a face that says you know just want to do 
You know just what to do!

Is this really my idea I had no clue 
that all of this was really happening 
my thoughts remain, lying on the floor 
its not my fault im such a awful messy war
War!

it's true I fell but your love covers me 
its true I fell!

Is this really my idea I had no clue that all of this really happening 
my thoughts remain, lying on the floor 
its not my fault im such a allful messy war 
Is this really my idea I had no clue, that all of this was really happening 
my thoughts remain lying on the floor 
its no my fault im such a awful messy war---Lyrics submitted by Tay.
