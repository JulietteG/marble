Hey yeah, hey hey
Just tell me, what's the difference thats between
Being myself and being
Oh So...
Together with my thoughts I'll..
I'll cut and stab and make my...
I'll cut and stab and make my...
Example

For those about to tell me to,
I'll never listen to you

I'll never go, I don't wanna know (I don't need to know)
Why won't you stay, your so far away (I don't need to)

This is the part where you take,
You take your place and I just...
Just take mine
I've never been so sick of... 
So sick of seeing you so...
You so blind

All of these things you offer to,
The ones who forget you

I'll never go, I don't wanna know (I don't need to know)
Why won't you stay, your so far away (I don't need to)

I'll get you back, cause I've been known for,
Seeking my, for getting my, for stealing my revenge

I'll never go, I don't wanna know (I don't need to know)
Why won't you stay, your so far away (I don't need to know)---Lyrics submitted by Charde`a.
