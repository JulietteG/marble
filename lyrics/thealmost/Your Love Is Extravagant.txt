your love
is extravagant
your friendship
is so intimate
i find I'm moving
to the rhythms of your grace
your fragrance is intoxicating
in our secret place
your love
is extravagant

spread wide,
in the arms of christ
its a love that covers sin

no greater love
have i ever known
you have given me a friend
capture my heart again
capture my heart again

your love
is extravagant
your friendship
is so intamate
i find i moving
to the rythems of your grace
your fragrance is intoxicating
in our secret place
your love is extravagant

spread wide 
in the arms of christ
its a love that covers sin
no greater love 
have i ever known
you considered me a friend
capture my heart again
capture my heart again
capture my heart again
capture my heart again---Lyrics submitted by justine.
