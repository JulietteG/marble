Get in, get in, it feels like it's almost time 
Acting like it; you know you'll get the first prize 
Sickness makes us larger than life 

This makes us larger, larger 

Here, is a message for your phone 
I wanted you to know this is getting 
out of hand 

Drinking, drinking I'm feelin' oh so slow now 
Waiting, waiting for that feeble 
last round 
This all makes us smaller than life 

This makes us smaller, smaller 

Here, is a message for your phone 
I wanted you to know, this is getting 
out of hand 
Here, is an idea for your book 
Open up and take a look 
Inside it's filled with lies 

Be what you wanna be 
When you're doin' what you do 
Free what you wanna free 
When you're comin' so unglued 
Don't act like you have to speak 
Your thoughts right now 

Here, is a message for your phone 
I wanted you to know this is getting 
out of hand 
Here, is an idea for your book 
Open up and take a look 
Inside it's filled with lies 

Here, is a message for your 
Here, is an idea for your 
this is getting out, this is getting out.---Lyrics submitted by alyssa.
