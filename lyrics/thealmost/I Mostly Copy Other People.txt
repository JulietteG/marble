So this is the time when you be what you just wanna be
 I always thought this would come oh so naturally
I'm gonna do just what order me to do
 So chase me, chase me, I'll run twelve 
circles around you...
 I'll make this way worse than you know

 Ain't it a shame that they won't 
remember all of this 

 Let's get, let's get it goin'
Make a mess way worse than you know
 We'll beat this town black and blue
with my quick and easy flow...
 They will ask us where we came from
 Where's the place that we blew in from
 I wanna make them like us 
 I wanna make them worship us...
 It will make you feel like you're in love

Ain't it a shame that they won't 
remember all of this 
We're all just fakin' out with someone 
 Who tells us 
 What we should miss 

More fake than you have ever been 
 More fake than you have ever spin spin
 The truth gets a chance

We're all just fakin' out with someone 
 Who tells us 
 What we should miss 

 Don't tell me what to miss
 Don't tell me what---Lyrics submitted by khadija.
