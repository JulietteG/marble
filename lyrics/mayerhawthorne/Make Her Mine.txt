Ooo
I may not drive a new Mercedes
But I'll chauffeur my girl, to the edge of the world
I may not wear a golden watch now
But Ill be right on time, for a woman so fine

When I love so pure, 
The object of my affection, well thats her

(Chorus)
She lives on the other side of town
And I know that her father doesn't want me hangin' around
I'm gonna turn her whole world upside-down
Im gonna make her mine, o mine, o mine
Im gonna make her mine

She shops on rodeo drive,
But I love that girl, yes I love that girl
And I know Im qualified, to love that the girl
Shes the only girl, in the whole wide world

I may not be a rich attorney
But i'll win my girls heart in a trail of love
I may not have the giant mansion
But I'll treat her so right, keep her warm at night

I got love so pure, 
The only woman that I want in the world is her

(Chorus)
She lives on the other side of town
And i know that her father doesn't want me hangin' around
But I'm gonna turn her whole world upside-down
Im gonna make her mine, o mine, o mine
Im gonna make her mine

Oooh
Im gonna make her mine, o mine, o mine
Im gonna make her mine---Lyrics submitted by marty.
