The way you move your hips
When your struttin' down the street
Oh it makes a mess so weak in the knees
Lipstick on your lips
When you say those words so sweet
Oh have mercy darlin I'm beggin you please

When we're all alone girl
And there's no one else in sight
And I'm holdin' you so tight and so true
Well then you pull away girl
Just when I think that I'm home
And you leave me all alone
And I'm feeling so blue, well

(Chorus)
Your easy lovin' ain't pleasin' nothin'
Baby, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget teasing loving, I need that tender loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come on

You know I need you girl
Come on darlin' don't be scared
It's as natural as the birds and the bees
I'll get on the floor
When your dancing next to me
Oh have mercy darlin, Im beggin you please

When we're all alone girl,
And there's no one else in sight
And I'm holdin' you so tight and so true
Well then you pull away girl
When there's magic in the air
And you leave me hangin there
And I'm feelin so blue

Chorus

Oooh, I don't want nobody else
When I got you by yourself
Come on, come on
