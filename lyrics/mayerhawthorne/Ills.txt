Woo 
A babys born and fathers gone
Cant live with what hes done
You know now mamas torn
She cant afford to raise her son

You know the ills of this world they can get you down
You know the ills of this world they can get you down
But then you get back up

Way down in New Orleans the city screams
Theyve got it black and white
And when the levys broke, woah
Sink or float and people lost their lives

You know they needed aid 
They hoped and prayed but it was just too late
And now the familys dry
They know inside doesnt have to be that way

You know the ills of this world they can get you down
You know the ills of this world they can get you down
But then you get back up

You know the ills of this world they can get you down
You know the ills of this world they can get you down
But then you get back up---Lyrics submitted by marty.
