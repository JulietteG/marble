Well I wish that it would rain 
Heavy rain down from the sky 
Maybe then you wouldnt see the teardrops in my eyes 
Well I wish that it would rain 
It would be a great disguise 
Maybe then you wouldnt see the teardrops in my eyes 
And all of the raindrops that fall down on my face 
Erase all the memories of you and your embrace 
Ill long for the moment that I lose this bitter taste 
And I dont want you to see me this way 

Well I wish that it would rain 
Heavy rain down from the sky 
Oooh maybe then I wouldnt see you walking right on by 
Well I wish that it would rain 
Let it storm just for awhile 
Oohh yeah maybe then you wouldnt see this sadness in my smile 
Ooh noo and all of the raindrops that fall down on my face 
Erase all the memories of you and your embrace 
Ill long for the moment that I lose this bitter taste 
And I dont want you to see me this way 

Rain down rain down (x2) 
Rain down rain down on me 
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Manuel.
