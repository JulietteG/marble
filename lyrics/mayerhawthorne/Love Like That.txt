1, 2!

You come around, you make me sick
That cool lovey-dovey shit
You never care how far you go
Just can't get enough of it
I bite my tongue, I bide my time
You lick your lips, you drink your wine
I keep on waiting, waiting in line
For some kind of sign

I pretend that I don't notice
But I know down deep inside

That I want a love like that
Yeah, I want a love
Strong like a heart attack
Fire me up
I want a love like that
Yeah, I want a love
Strong like a heart attack
Fire me up

C-c-c-c-call me up real late at night
When the sex isn't dynamite
Let's skip dessert, that miniskirt
Yeah, you know it's the one I like
I wish you well, you wish me worse
I write your speeches that sound rehearsed
I keep on reaching, but in reverse
Hoping I can break this curse

I pretend that I don't notice
But I know down deep inside

That I want a love like that
Yeah, I want a love
Strong like a heart attack
Fire me up
I want a love like that
Yeah, I want a love
Strong like a heart attack
Fire me up

Going out my mind
Waiting for some sign
Going out my mind and I say
Going out my mind
Waiting for some sign
Going out my mind

I want a love like that
Yeah, I want a love
Strong like a heart attack
Fire me up
I want a love like that
Yeah, I want a love
Strong like a heart attack
Fire me up---
