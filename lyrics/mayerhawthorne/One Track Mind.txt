Ohh Ohh
My baby's got a one track mind
Only shopping bags with expensive tags
My baby's got a one track mind
And she buys her thrills when my heart unveils

Ooh I know what I'm doing is wrong
But baby gives me good loving all night long
My baby's got a one track mind but she's so fine

My baby's got a one track mind
Only thing she knows is designer clothes
My baby's got a one track mind
Only crme brle and she gets away

Ooh I know I'm in a bad situation
But baby knows just how to get my heart beat racing
My baby's got a one track mind and shes so fine

When she walks in heels it gives me chills
Oh when I get the bills I swear 
My heart skips a beat for real

My baby's got a one track mind
Only shopping bags with expensive tags
My baby's got a one track mind
And she buys her thrills when my heart unveils

Ooh I know what I'm doing is wrong
But baby gives me good loving all night long
My baby's got a one track mind but she's so fine
Yeah well she's so fine
Ooh she's so fine
Yeah well she's so fine---Lyrics submitted by marty.
