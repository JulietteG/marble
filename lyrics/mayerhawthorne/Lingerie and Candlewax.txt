Can't live with you anymore
Can't live with no one else
Drinkin' at two in the morn
And I just can't help myself

Angel on my shoulder said
Hold up
Don't touch it
I'm so torn up
Latoya Luckett
Fuck it
We grown up
Don't hide it
I got somethin' rolled up
And we gon' light it
United
And then we

Smokin' in
The cadillac
Take a hit
Pass it back
Starts with this
And ends with that
Lingerie & candle wax
I know
I shouldn't worry about it
But I don't want
Want to live without it

Can't live with you any more
Can't live with no one else
Drinkin' at 2 in the morn
And I just can't help myself

Devil on my shoulder said
Go on
You can have it
Just pick the phone up
Reach out and grab it
Damn it
We grown up
Don't hide it
I got somethin' rolled up
And we gon' light it
United
And then we

Smokin' in
The cadillac
Take a hit
Pass it back
Starts with this
And ends with that
Lingerie & candle wax
I know
I shouldn't worry about it
But I don't want
Want to live without it

You know what I need, babe
You know what I need, babe---
