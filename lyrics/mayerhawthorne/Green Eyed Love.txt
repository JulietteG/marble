My love, my green eyed love
We'll watch the clouds from above
Well c'mon, lift me up

My love, my velvet rope
Take me away from it all 
When I feel I can't cope

(Chorus)
They say, they say, they say 
You're no good for me
But I know, I know, I know that's a lie
And sometimes, oh sometimes 
I just don't know anymore
But I never want to say goodbye

My love, my green eyed love
You know when push comes to shove
I need you, you're in my blood

My love, unlawfully wed
Take me outside of it all 
When I'm stuck in my head

(Chorus)
They say, they say, they say 
You're no good for me
But I know, I know, I know that's a lie
And sometimes, oh sometimes 
I just don't know anymore
But I never want to say goodbye

My beautiful green eyed love
I'm always dreamin of
My beautiful green eyed love

(Chorus)
They say, they say, they say 
You're no good for me
But I know, I know, I know that's a lie
And sometimes, oh sometimes 
I just don't know anymore
But I never want to say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by marty.
