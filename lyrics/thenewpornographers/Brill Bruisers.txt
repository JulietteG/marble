Out on the waves
Over the railing asking the crowd
Send you back
To stage its sail it's sailing away
They left behind
Looking for searchlights leading the charge
The mass appeal
To brilliant bruisers taking the wheel

And the sea was alright and it was alright, it's
It's all we know now to never go back

Now the grenade
And it's seconds before the bang
Wanted to keep
Much of that leader of your gang
Born at the hearts
Of brilliant bruisers where we find them
And 'til we do
We'll have to drift until we find them

And the sea was alright
And it was alright, it's
It's all we know now to never go back

With the junkyard science
To hang on
And do a bang-on
Impression
Will young sorrow
It's tied in
Firing of the sirens
Go in fighting
To crying
The rising star dying
Of this own virus
It's tied in
The firing of the sirens

And the sea was alright
And it was alright, it's
And now we know how to never go back
And the sea was alright
Yes it was alright, it's
It's all we know now to never go back---
