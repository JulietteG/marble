I have to watch you come back to earth
Now it's all I can do
Will you still be convinced wild flowers
Are waiting for you

In my mind I've done good things
And never cared why
And my mind is an open door, with nothing inside

Looks like the autumn is upon us
It's turnin' so cold
When everything said's either faded out
Or written in stone

If you could find an easier road, you'd take it today
You could have taken me anywhere
You just take it away

I have to watch you come back to earth
If it's all I can do
Will you still be convinced wild flowers
Are waiting for you

Have we ever done good things
And never cared why
'Cause my mind is an open door, with nothing inside---Lyrics submitted by joeri schelfhau.
