when your weary
feeling small
when tears are in your eyes
i will dry them all
I'm on you side oh
when times get rough
and friends just can't be found

(chorus)
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down

when your down and out
when your on the street 
when evening falls so hard
i will comfort you
I'll take your part 
o when darkness comes
and pain is all around

(chorus)
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down

sail on silver girl
sail on by
your time has come to shine
and all your dreams are on their way
see how they shine
if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind 
(look over your shoulder)

(chorus)
like a bridge over troubled water
i will ease your mind
like a bridge over troubled water
i will ease your mind---
