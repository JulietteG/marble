I got no time to worry
I live my life the way that I want to
I live today not tomorrow
Don't need no perks I get paid by the hour

[Chorus]
Out in the streets 
Light shining bright
That's where I'm going to be tonight
That's where I feel right
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing can get me down
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing can get me down

Ain't got no home I'm a mover
I pack my bags whenever I want to
Life is a game I'm a gambler
I play to win cause I don't feel like losing

[Chorus]

Get me down

Ain't got no need to raise a family
No steady job now, no chance
I'm running free
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing can get me down
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing can get me down---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
