Verse 1 :Fresh like the kiss of morning dew,
Thats how it felt,that day we meet, and i first layed eyes on you...yeah
Its like you walked right up out my fantasy,
and then you left that day, girl why did you abondone me...(maybe one day ull see)

Hook :And i wonder, if you'll ever find out, how it was supposed to beeeeeeeeee.(baby)
Said i wonder, if you'll ever find out, how it was supposed to beeeeeeeee.(Baby)

verse 2 :Now when i think back too the days you were mine...
Or how i wish, i could flip a switch to turn back the hands of time...(oh Baby)
You were the one that made me real,
Now that your gone,tell me what in the world am  i supposed to feel.
Without you here with me....


Hook :And i wonder, if you'll ever find out, how it was supposed to beeeeeeeeee.(baby)
Said i wonder,said i wonder if you'll ever find out, how it was supposed to beeeeeeeee.(Baby)

Something tells me ive been wrong
all the love i felt that you shouldve given....
Never thought you'd leave me on my ownnnn.....
Now i see that its over(and i hope one day you''ll see)

Hook :And i wonder, if you'll ever find out, how it was supposed to beeeeeeeeee.(baby)
Said i wonder,said i wonder if you'll ever find out, how it was supposed to beeeeeeeee.(Baby)---Lyrics submitted by kerry.
