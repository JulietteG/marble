Wasted so much time for ya
Ooh I think I mustve been blind for ya
Almost lost my mind for ya 
Told myself I would die for ya
I hit that wall thinking
How Im gonna get you back all weekend
Guess thats your decision
You should think about what youre missing
All day, all night 
When its the right time Im a find my baby
And Im thinking like all day, all night
If its the right time Im a find my baby

So I get the finest clothes I can find on retail
And I try to pay attention to every single detail
I just wanna girl who still looks good with no makeup
And when I find her I promise Im never gonna break up

never gonna break up 
(never gonna break up)
never gonna break up
(never gonna break up)
never gonna break up
never gonna break up

All this time I lost on ya
Played it cool when I shouldve flossed on ya
Had a few girls that I turned down
Wish I knew then what Ive learned now
I hope you yearn for me
I hope your loneliness burns for me
Cause Im ok now
Give me time Im a show you how I get down

So I get the finest clothes I can find on retail
And I try to pay attention to every single detail
I just wanna girl who still looks good with no makeup
And when I find her I promise Im never gonna break up

never gonna break up 
(never gonna break up)
never gonna break up
(never gonna break up)
never gonna break up
never gonna break up

And if youre wondering how im doin baby
I can be sure that I learned a lesson from you girl
And if youre wondering what im doing baby
Trust me I got it, im taking care of me


never gonna break up 
(never gonna break up)
never gonna break up
(never gonna break up)
never gonna break up
never gonna break up


So I get the finest clothes I can find on retail
And I try to pay attention to every single detail
I just wanna girl who still looks good with no makeup
And when I find her I promise Im never gonna break up

Break up
Break up
Never, never break up
Break up
Break up 
Never, never break up (2x)---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
