VERSE1
You've got fashion and style
I'm lovin' your smile and 
The way you get down
I can't see no one else
It's you by yourself, yea
In spite of the crowd
(Baby no one else matters)

It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction (addiction)
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction

While all the girls say

HOOK
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You're my addiction
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You're my addiction

BRIDGE
When I'm lookin' in the mirror
Honey, you are all I see
And it could not be no clearer
That I need you here with me

VERSE2
I was hopin you'd notice
The way that I like to 
Have you around
Listen and you will find that
Your heart beats for me
Girl, I hear the sound
