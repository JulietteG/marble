Intro:  Yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah, R. Les

Verse 1:
You made a difference in my life/it happened at the moment when I saw your face/it must have been something in your eyes/that made it easy like a Sunday/it's not hard to understand/cause anyone who sees you feels the same way/so I had to take the chance/to let you know you're so amazing.

Chorus:
I.R.I.N.A/see I might not speak your language/but I know just what to say/I.R.I.N.A./oh yeah, ooh I wanna see you everyday.

Verse 2:
I wanna get to know you/to see what makes you laugh/I wanna be your future/forget about your past/I wanna make you happy/by just being myself/cause I can't be nobody else/no.

Bridge:
La,la,la,la/sometimes words they just get in the way/so I say/la,la,la,la/sometimes the words get in the way (they get in the way) /so...

Outro:  Just rock with it/and though you might not speak my language/said I'm liking you.---Lyrics submitted by Janelle.
