I keep your picture beside my bed 
And I still remember everything you said 
I always thought our love was so right 
I guess, I was wrong 
I always thought you'd be by my side 
Mama, now you're gone 

What I wanna know baby 
What we had was good 
How come u don't call me anymore? 
Yeah 

Listen, I still light the fire on a rainy night 
I still like it better when you're holding me tight 
Now hold it, everybody said, everybody said 
That we should never part, oh yeah 

I always did think we looked kind of cute together myself 
Say to me baby, baby, baby 
Why, why you wanna go and break my heart? 
Why'd you wanna do it? 

All I wanna know baby 
What we had was good 
How come u don't call me anymore? 
Why don't you call me girl? 

Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die 
If you don't call me, mama, girl, you gotta try 
Down on my knees beggin' you, please, please 
Why can't you call me sometime baby, yeah 

Just one lousy dime, baby 
Why can't you call me sometime? Oh, no, no 
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone? Yeah 
You know I don't like bein' alone 
Why, why must you torture me? 
Why you gotta torment me so?---
