(feat. Zooey Deschanel) 

[Chorus: Zooey] 
Don't, don't you wanna 
Fall in love tonight 
She said, don't, don't you wanna 
Fall in love tonight 

[Verse 1: Prince] 
Special night, my favorite crew 
The moon threatened to dance her out of her shoes 
In his ear, he was about to hear 
An offer that he could not refuse 

She said... 

[Chorus: Prince] 
Don't, don't you wanna 
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight 
(She said) 
Don't, don't you wanna 
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight 

She said... 

[Verse 2: Prince] 
Underneath the taffeta 
There ain't no better hiding place 
If I see the moon, I'll just laugh at her 
Wanna wake up to your, your pretty face 

[Chorus: Both] 
Don't, don't you wanna 
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight 
(She said) 
Don't, don't you wanna 
Don't you wanna do it till the morning light 

She said... 

[Verse 3: Prince] 
We can sleep all day tomorrow 
Dream about this fantasy, fantasy 
We don't have to backspin, apologize, or borrow 
Uh, about to go hard, y'all ready for me 

[Chorus: Both x2]---
