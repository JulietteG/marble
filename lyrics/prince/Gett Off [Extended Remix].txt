Im gonna put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve
Theres a rumor goin all around that you aint been getting served
They say that you aint you-know-what in, baby, who knows how long
Its hard for me to say whats right when all I wanna do is wrong

Get off
23 positions in a one-night stand
(get off)
Ill only call ya after if you say I can
(get off)
Let a woman be a woman and a man bea man
(get off)
If you want to baby here I am
Here I am
(here I am)

I clocked the jizz from a friend of yours named Vanessa Bett
She said you told her a fantasy that got her all wet
Something bout a little box rhythm, mirror and a tongue inside
What she told me then got me so hot
That we could slide

(get off)
23 positions in a one-night stand
(get off)
Ill only call ya after if you say I can
(get off)
Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
(get off)
If you want to baby here I am
(Here I am)

One-two-three
 Nah little cutie I aint drinkin
Scope this, I was just thinkin
You plus me, (tongue click) what a ride
If you was thinkin the same we could continue outside
Lay your pretty body against the parkin meter
Strip your dress down like I was strippin a peter pauls almond joy
Let me show you baby Im a talented boy

Everybody grab a body pump it like you want somebody
(Get off)

Everything about you just screams of a real sexy affair
The way you walk the way you (pause) flip your hair
Baby girl Im all days when Im scopin that body rare
Betcha Ima pack a lunch and spend a while there

Get off
23 positions in a one night stand
get off
Ill only call ya after if you say I can
Get off
Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Get off
If you want to baby here I am
Here I am

Im gonna kiss you in front of everybody I dont care 
Thats right Ill Pull your dress up, shit
You aint got any underwear on
I shoulda known, I shoulda known
Butterscotch curly haired wish you had some draws on
Now
Go on freak to the bone
I couldnt believe it
We goin home

Everybody grab a body pump it like you want somebody

So here we
So here we
So here we
So here we are here we are my paisley crib
Whatchoo want to eat
(Ribs)
Toy, I dont serve ribs
You better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when you sat down
Honey, them ribs is gone but thas aight
I clock em that way
Reminds me of something James used to say
I like em fat
I like em proud
You gotta have a mother for me now move your big ass round this way so I can work on that zipper baby

Tonight youre a star
And Im the big dipper

Everybody grab a body pump it like (get up) you want somebody x2

Ooooo I think I like her with the dress half on, unzip it far enough to see the crack of dawn
Dont worry about the bust Ima lock up every door 
Then we can do it in the kitchen on the floor
In the bathroom standing on the tub and holdin on the rod
Youre in the closet underneath the clothes and 
oh my god
on the dresser with your feet in the drawers
in the pantry on the shelf I guarantee you wont be bored
pool table yeah move the sticks
put the eight ball were short a stick
Duddly do-no-wrong
tonight getting nailed just let him kick it
kick it x3

Im gonna put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve
Theres a rumor goin all around that you aint been getting served
They say that you aint you-know-what in, baby, who knows how long
Its hard for me to say whats right when all I wanna do is wrong?

(get off)
23 positions in a one night stand
(get off)
Ill only call ya after if you say I can
(get off)
Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
(get) off
If you want to baby here I am

come on
flute solo

get off
get off (get off)
get off (get off)

get off (get off)
get off (get off)---Lyrics submitted by Toni.
