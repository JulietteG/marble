Tell me who in this house know about the quake?

I mean really, really
If you know how 2 rock say yeah (yeah)
If u know how 2 party say oh yeah (oh yeah)
But if u aint hip 2 the rare house quake:
Shut up already, damn!

Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
Theres a brand new groove going round (housequake)
In your funky town (housequake)
And the kick drum is the fault
You gotta rock this mother, say (housequake)
We gotta rock this mother, say (housequake)
