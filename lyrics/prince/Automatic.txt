You ask me if I love you, it's automatic
'Cause every time you leave me, I die, that's automatic too
You ask me to forgive you, when you know, I'm just an addict
So stop the music baby, you know, you're all I want to do
(Hey)
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do, ooh
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with you

You ask me if I'll kiss you, it's automatic
And if you cry, me cry, boo-hoo, that's automatic too, ooh
I would never leave you, no matter what you do
Stop the music baby, you know, I'm an automatic fool
(Hey)
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do (and don't stop)
A-U-T-O-matic, oh, I'm so in love with you

I'll rub your back forever, it's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll look for a needle in a haystack, that's automatic too, ooh (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll go down on you all night long, it's automatic (I will, yes I will babe)
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong, that's automatic to (A-U-T-O-matic)
(Hey)
(A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)
Tell me what to do, babe
(A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you)
(Hey) so in love with you, yeah (A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)
Tell me what to do, babe (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you)
So in love with you, baby, yeah (hey) (A-U-T-O-matic) alright, alright (just tell me what to do)
Tell me what to do baby (A-U-T-O-matic) yeah, yeah, yeah (so in love with you)
Whoo (hey)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)

C'mon baby
A-U-T-O-matic, tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic
So in love with you

Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream
Baby, you're the purple star in the night supreme
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love
I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kissed, not with our lips but with our souls
Stop me if I bore you
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
Can you hear me., why do I love you so much?
It's strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked, can you hear me?
I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me

When it comes to you I'm automatic baby
There's no one else like me
I'm the best you'll ever find
No-one else could understand you, you're to complex
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know you
That's automatic too
Can you hear me?
(A-U-T-O-matic) yes, I'm addicted to your pleasure
I'm addicted to your pain
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
Automatically insane
Undress me (A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
Hey (A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(Hey)
Fasten your seat belts
Prepare for takeoff---
