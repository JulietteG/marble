Get it, Get it
Get turned up
Get it, Get it
Get turned up
Get it, Get it
Get turned up

Lets funk

So finally beloved we meet at last
Middle of the here, never-mind the past
Only way to get to where ya never been
Lets party like you aint gonna party again

Lets funk, lets roll
Get it turned up get it out of control
Get into the rhythm its good for the soul
Lets funk, lets roll
Get it turned up get it out of control
Come on everybody lets funk, lets roll

Whether youre coming by bus or train
Shake tho its hatin cause they going insane
Im talking about a million dollar party to nickel and dime
Another motherfucker youre committing no crime

Lets funk, lets roll
I say get it turned up get it out of control
Get into the rhythm its good for the soul
Lets funk, lets roll
Get it turned up get it out of control
Come on everybody lets funk, lets roll

The only way to last til the break of dawn
Is put your phone down get your party on
Who ya gonna call when its obviously us
Everybody you know is rockin in here

Lets funk, lets roll
Get it turned up get it out of control
Get into the rhythm its good for the soul
Lets funk, lets roll
Get it turned up get it out of control
Come on everybody lets funk, lets roll

I dont really care what ya all really do
I dont really care what ya all really do
I dont really care
I dont really care
I dont really care what ya all really do

I dont really care what ya all really do
I dont really care
I dont really care
I dont care what ya all really do

Lets funk, lets roll (lets roll, lets roll)
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Get into the rhythm its good for the soul
Lets funk, lets roll
Get it turned up get it out of control
Come on everybody lets funk and roll---
