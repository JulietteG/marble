I...I...I...I...
Erotic city
Erotic city

All of my purple life
Ive been looking for a dame
That would wanna be my wife
That was my intention, babe

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty u and me, erotic city come alive
We can fuck until the dawn, making love til cherrys gone
Erotic city cant u see, fuck so pretty u and me

Everytime I comb my hair
Thoughts of u get in my eyes
Ure a sinner, I dont care
I just want your creamy thighs

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty u and me, erotic city come alive
We can fuck until the dawn, making love til cherrys gone
Erotic city cant u see, fuck so pretty u and me

All of my hang-ups r gone
How I wish u felt the same
We can funk until the dawn (til the dawn) (until the dawn)
How I wish u were my dame (baby wont u call my name)

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty u and me, erotic city come alive
We can fuck until the dawn, making love til cherrys gone
Erotic city cant u see, fuck so pretty u and me

Baby, ure so creamy

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty u and me, erotic city come alive
We can fuck until the dawn, making love til cherrys gone (til the dawn)
Erotic city cant u see, fuck so pretty u and me

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time (u and me)
Some time, some time, some time, erotic city
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Fuck so pretty u and me, erotic city come alive

We can fuck until the dawn, making love til cherrys gone (come alive)
Erotic city cant u see, fuck so pretty u and me
We can fuck until the dawn, making love til cherrys gone
Erotic city
