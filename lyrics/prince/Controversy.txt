I just can't believe all the things people say (Controversy) 
Am I black or white? Am I straight or gay? (Controversy) 
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? Yeah (Controversy) 

CHORUS: 
Controversy 
Controversy 

I can't understand human curiosity (Controversy) 
Was it good 4 U? Was I what U wanted me 2 be? (Controversy) 
Do U get high? Does your daddy cry? (Controversy) 

CHORUS 

Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? (Yeah, ooh yeah) 
Some people wanna die so they can be free 
I said, life is just a game, we're all just the same 
Do U wanna play? (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 

CHORUS {x3} 

{Lord's Prayer} 
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name 
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven 
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses 
As we forgive those who trespass against us 
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil 
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever 

CHORUS {x2} 

Love ya, love ya, baby 

CHORUS {x3} 
(Oh yeah, yeah) 
(Everybody, oh yeah) 

Listen... 
People call me rude, I wish we were all nude 
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules 
People call me rude, I wish we were all nude 
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were (was) no rules 
{repeat 2 more times} 

Yeah! (Controversy) 
Oh yeah (Controversy) 

Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? 
Let me tell U, some people wanna die so they can be free 
I said life is just a game, we're all just the same 
Don't U wanna play?
