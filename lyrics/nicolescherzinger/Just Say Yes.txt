I'm running out of ways to mak you see
I want you to stay here beside of me
I won't be ok and I won't pretend I am
Just tell me today and 
Take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test
Nor a trick of the mind its only love.

Its so simple and you know it is
You know it is
We can't be to and fro like this
All our lives
You're the only way to me
The path is clear
What do I have to say to you
For Godsakes dear
For godsakes dear
For godsakes dear
For godsakes dear
For godsakes dear

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test
Nor a trick of the mind it's only love

I can feel your heart beat through my shirt
And this was all I wanted
It's all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want
Its all I want

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test 
Nor a trick of the mind it's only love

Just say yes
Cause I'm aching and I know that you are too
For the touch 
Of your warm skin as I breath you in.---Lyrics submitted by nirishia.
