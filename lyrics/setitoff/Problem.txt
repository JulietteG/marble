Set It Off, 2014
You got one more problem with us here
Go!

Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to, I want you
So tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it, I want you

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up, but it's you?
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back, but it's you
Cause I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a girl that can't get no love from me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it, but it's you

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

Listen close
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Set It Off, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what

One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem---
