(feat. Jason Lancaster)

Tell me I'm clear to breathe this air alone tonight
Take this all in, the sun will dim but I'm alive

They're gonna try to clip your wings
Lock you up and make you sing
But they'll never cage your dreams so fly away

Cause we've got tomorrow, we're the pages in the wind
We've got tomorrow, we're the tale that lies within
There's always another day, another night
A bittersweet blessing in disguise
Tomorrow, we're the authors of our lives, tomorrow

Eyes open wide, daydream at night, my thoughts collide
Some day they'll see, behind their screens, me shining bright

They're gonna try to clip your wings
Lock you up and make you sing
But they'll never cage your dreams so fly away

Cause we've got tomorrow, we're the pages in the wind
We've got tomorrow, we're the tale that lies within
There's always another day, another night
A bittersweet blessing in disguise
Tomorrow, we're be the authors of our lives, tomorrow

And oh, I've been obsessed, in search of success
Been blinded by the light
Sometimes you are the spider, sometimes you are the fly
Flying towards the sky, our starting line

Cause we've got tomorrow, we're the pages in the wind
We've got tomorrow, we're the tale that lies within
There's always another day, another night
A bittersweet blessing in disguise
Tomorrow, we're the authors of our lives, tomorrow

Cause we've got tomorrow
We'll be the authors of our lives, tomorrow---
