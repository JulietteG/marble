(feat. Kreesha Turner)

Staring at the sunset
Living tonight with no regret
No I'm not ready to go yet
Still got a song stuck in my head

Keep running the melody
Keep running the melody
I wanna hear the melody
Keep running the melody

In the heat of the music
I feel the beat and I lose it
No I'm not ready to go yet
This song it goes round in my head

Keep running the melody
Keep running the melody
I wanna hear the melody
Keep running the melody

This is the party of my fantasy
With all of the faces that I want to see
You bring me closer and I feel the heat
Everybody knows that all we need is love

Keep running the melody
Keep running the melody
I wanna hear the melody
Keep running the melody

Live your life
Feel free
Live your life
Feel free
Live your life
Feel free
Live your life
Feel free

This is the party of my fantasy
We feel the way that we want to feel
Take anything that you want from me
Everybody knows that we need is love

Keep running the melody
Keep running the melody
I wanna hear the melody
Keep running the melody---
