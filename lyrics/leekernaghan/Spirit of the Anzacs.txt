He's a drover drifting over Western plains
He's a city lad, a clark down Flinder's Lane
They're in the trenches at Lone Pine
And on the Flander's firing line
A willing band of ordinary men

He's all of them
He's one of us
Born beneath
The Southern Cross
Side by side
We say with pride
He is all of them
He is one of us

He's a pilot on a midnight bombing raid
He's an Able Seaman on the armoured dale
She's a nurse in Vietnam
They're on patrol in Uruzgan
Sons and daughters rising to the call

The spirit of the ANZACs
Proud and strong
Spirit of the ANZACs
Will live on and on and on

They are one of us---
