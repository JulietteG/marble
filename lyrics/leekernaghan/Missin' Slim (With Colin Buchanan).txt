Davey has a photo
From the day they met slim dusty
It hangs beneath the long horns in a simple timber frame
I dont know who is prouder davey or his old man
But you could see it in their faces and the way they said his name
Their missin'slim

Missin'slim
The bush has lost a hero and we all remember him
He was our mate, he was the king
Were missin'slim, missin'slim

Scotty is a mountain man
Hard as stoney granite
When "pub" came on the radio i swear i saw a tear
His life was a movie, Slim dusty was the sound track
And he never thought the end, Was ever quite so near
His missin'slim

Missin'slim
The bush has lost a hero and we all remember him
He was our mate, he was the king
Were missin'slim, missin'slim

From the
To the end of the Canning Stockroot
Three rivers and that covaham
and out to Camowheal
Bullie Bullie Station
Charleville and Isa
Where the rain still tumbles down that way
In Nulla Nulla creek
They're missin' Slim

Missin' Slim
The bush has lost a hero and we all remember him
He was our mate
he was the king
We're missing slim
Missin' Slim
Missin' Slim
We're all missin' Slim---Lyrics submitted by ben.
