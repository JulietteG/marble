It was Ansett 603
He sits down next to me
We were flyin' out across the Great Divide
Bound for WA
He shook my hand and said g'day
There I was, Slim Dusty by my side

I was flyin' with the king
Ridin' on the wind
A small town boy from nowhere
My head up in the clouds
All the times I heard him play
And here I was today
I was flyin', I was flyin' with the king

Was Trumby ridin' slow
30,000 feet below
Way down there round a fire of gidgee coal
The desert stretchin' on
Home to countless Dusty songs
He was the man who walked a country mile

I was flyin' with the king
Ridin' on the wind
A small town boy from nowhere
My head up in the clouds
All the times I heard him play
And here I was today
I was flyin', I was flyin' with the king

Before I knew the wheels touched down
He smiled and said "I'll see you round"
There was so much more to say but he was gone
An' now he's gone

I was flyin' with the king
Ridin' on the wind
A small town boy from nowhere
My head up in the clouds
All the times I heard him play
And here I was today
I was flyin', I was flyin' with the king---
