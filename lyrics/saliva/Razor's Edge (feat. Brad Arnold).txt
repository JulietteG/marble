Walking on Razor's edge, so hard for me to find my way home.
How could it have come to this?
So hard to pick the right from the wrong.

I can't try to hide behind myself anymore.
I can't try to reason with the pain and misfortune.
So I will grab hold to forever and walk right through this open door.

Walking on this lonely road, the heartbreaking pain at my side.
Without two arms to hold me, nothing but the chain of goodbyes.

I can't try to hide myself anymore.
I can't try to reason with the pain and misfortune.
So I will grab hold to forever and walk right through this open door.

I can't try to hide behind myself anymore.
I can't try to reason with the pain and misfortune.
So I will grab hold to forever and walk right through this open door.

I can't try to hide behind myself anymore.
I can't try to reason with the pain and torture.
So I will grab hold to forever and walk right through this open door.---
