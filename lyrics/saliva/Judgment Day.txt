Hot day in the summer sun. It's a 100 and 21.
Lock tays (?) and machine guns. Another day and another harm (?). 
Looking for a good place to hide. Foring fide on my strong side (?).
Me and my buddys haven't realized. It's just a job, we do'nt wanna die.

I miss my family. (I miss my girl.)
I miss my friends. (In my hole world.)
I hope i make it back again.
BANG, BANG, BANG! Another body goes. (Down it's way.)
Another mother world. (Cry it's way (?) .)
Another ?kofent? world. (Down it's maze (?) .)
BANG, BANG, BANG! Another body goes. (Down it's way.)
Another predators world. (Say his name)
Another ?kofent? world. (Hold it's rage.)
Until Judgement Day.

Hyoa!                  (xD)

Focus in and stay relaxed. Before i have the damned hart attacks.
Stay alive, and stay in ?tacos?. Got me noise. I wanna make it back.
This can't be the ?ant? for me. I got lost up, do you see?
Raise my kids and my family. I pray God is protecting me.

I miss my family. (I miss my girl.)
I miss my friends. (In my hole world.)
I hope i make it back again.
BANG, BANG, BANG! Another body goes. (Down it's way.)
Another mother world. (Cry it's way (?) .)
Another ?kofent? world. (Down it's maze (?) .)
BANG, BANG, BANG! Another body goes. (Down it's way.)
Another predators world. (Say his name)
Another ?kofent? world. (Hold it's rage.)

Sweet guitar solo

I miss my family. (I miss my girl.)
