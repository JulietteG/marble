Father, blessed Father, it's morning again
I give You Father, myself Father, continue Your plan
I know together we can climb mountains in the sky
No one can stop us when I'm standing by your side
When trouble's knocking here again
I'll tell him Jesus has my hand
He'll walk me through

Father, loving Father, create in me
A pure love Father, Your love Father... instill it in me
I remember the nights I've cried for You
Now I only have to die for you

Thank you Lord, You've made it clear just for me
I see the light, it's burning out the night
Oh Father, it's morning, morning, morning...---Lyrics submitted by Noel.
