Where have you come from
Where are you going
Tell me what's brought you here now
Is your heart singing
Then share what you're bringing

We all are a part of the show
'Cause we are all going home
'Cause we are a family and we are all going home
Are you listening
We are all going home so come join the family
'Cause we are all going home

But is your heart quiet
Is something not right
Can you tell me what's blocking the way
Well just ask the Father
He knows every problem
He'll carry that burden away

'Cause we are all going home
'Cause we are a family and we are all going home
Are you listening
We are all going home so come join the family
'Cause we are a family and we are all going home
Yes we are all going home---Lyrics submitted by Noel.
