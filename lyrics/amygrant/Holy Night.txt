Chorus:

Sleigh bells ring are you listenin' in the lane snow is glistenin'

a beautiful sight we're happy tonight walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the Blue Bird here to stay aya aya is the new bird who sings 

a litte song as we go along walkin' in a winter wonderland

in the meadow we can build a snowman he'll say "are you married"

we'll say "no man" but you can do the job while your in town 

later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire to face unafraid 

the plans we made walkin' in a winter wonderland

Chorus:

Sleigh bells ring are you listenin' in the lane snow is glistenin' 

a beautiful sight we're happy tonight walkin' in a winter wonderland

walkin' in a winter

walkin' in a winter

walkin' in a winter a-wonderland---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
