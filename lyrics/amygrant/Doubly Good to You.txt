If you see the moon
Rising gently on your fields
If the wind blows softly on your face
If the sunset lingers
While cathedral bells peal
And the moon has risen to her place

You can thank the Father
For the things that He has done
And thank Him for the things
He's yet to do (if you find true love)
And if you find a love that's tender
If you find someone who's true
Thank the Lord
He's been doubly good to you

And if you look in the mirror
At the end of a hard day
And you know in your heart
You have not lied
And if you give love freely
If you earn and honest wage
And if you've got Jesus by your side

You can thank the Father
For the things that He has done
And thank Him for the things
He's yet to do (if you find true love)
And if you find a love that's tender
If you find someone who's true
Thank the Lord
He's been doubly good to you---Lyrics submitted by Vicki Vince.
