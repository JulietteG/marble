Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you
Just how much good that it's
Gonna do you just to

Sing anew
The song your heart learned to sing
When He first gave His life to you
The life goes on and so must the song
You gotta sing again
The song born in your soul
When you first gave your heart to Him
Sing His praises once more

Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you
Just how much good that it's
Gonna do you just to

Sing aloud
The song that someone is dying to hear,
Down in the maddening crowd
As you once were before you heard the song
You gotta let them know
The truth is alive to shine upon the way
So maybe they can go
Sing your praises once more

Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you
Just how much good that it's
Gonna do you just to

Let the name of the Lord be praised,
Both for now and evermore,
Praise him, oh, you servants
Give your

Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you
Just how much good that it's
Gonna do you just to

Sing, sing sing
Come on
Sing, sing, sing,
I can hear you now
Sing, sing, sing---Lyrics submitted by Noel.
