I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl
 And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world
 But thats alright as long as I can have one wish, I pray
 When people look inside my life, I wanna hear them say

She's got her father's eyes
 Her father's eyes
 Eyes that find the good in things
 When good is not around
 Eyes that find the source of help, when help just can't be found
 Eyes full of compassion, seein' every pain
 Knowing what you're going through, and feelin' it the same

Just like my father's eyes 
my father's eyes
 my father's eyes 
Just like my father's eyes

On that day when we will pay for all the deeds we've done
 Good and bad they'll all be had to see by everyone
 And when you're called to stand and tell just what you saw in me
 More than anything I know, I want your words to be

She had her father's eyes, her father's eyes
 eyes that found the good in things when good was not around
 eyes that found the source of help when help would not be found
 Eyes full of compassion, seein' every pain
 Knowin' what you're goin' through and feelin it the same

Just like my father's eyes,
 My father's eyes,
 My father's eyes,
 Just like my father's eyes,
 My father's eyes,
 My father's eyes---Lyrics submitted by staci couvion.
