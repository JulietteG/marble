here i am, alone and i don't understand
exactly how it all began
the dream just walked away
i'm holdin' on
when all but the passions' gone

and from the start
maybe i was tryin' too hard
it's crazy 'coz it's breakin' my heart
things can fall apart but i know
that i don't want you to go

and here was i
when they ignore th cause inside
but they learned from what's left behind
and fight for something else
and so it goes
but we have both learned how to grow

and from the start
maybe we were tryin' too hard
it's crazy 'coz it's breakin' my heart
things can fall apart but i know
that i don't want you to go

oh, it's just too much
taken on the whole world all by myself
oh, there's nothin' done
unless i stop trustin' somebody else
somebody else and...
love agsin....

and from the start
maybe we were tryin' too hard
it's crazy 'coz it's breakin' our hearts
things can fall apart but i know
that i don't want you to go

maybe we were tryin' too hard
it's crazy 'coz it's breakin' our hearts
things can fall apart but i know
that i don't want you to go

oh noh....

i don't want you to go

say that you won't you.....---Lyrics submitted by nira.
