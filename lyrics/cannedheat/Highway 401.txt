Well were going down the highway going down the highway 401

Its the road to Toronto got to get there cuz were on the run
Na (now) her daddys in his pickup and he aint about to call me son

Were getting close to the border and were getting farther from his gun

Well we started out in Phille when I saw you cruising in the isle
I took one look at you and you me that old(ole) come on smile

So you jumped into my limo and we talked about it for a while
And you said it didnt matter that you could come with me any how

Well so no(now) were on the road and were moving just as smooth as we can
And I hope I got some time before I have to deal with your old man

SOLO

And I hope I got some time before I have to deal with your old man

Well were going down the highway going down the highway 401

Its the road to Toronto got to get there cuz were on the run
Na (now) her daddys in his pickup and he aint about to call me son

Were getting close to the border and were getting farther from his gun

Say babe I didnt know you were only seventeen when you stepped into my limosine

I really hope your daddy is an understanding man

You sure know your way around for such a young thing

You sure learnt your lessons well

You will be eighteen when I come back to Ohio wont ya?

Um um!---Lyrics submitted by Relentless Fish.
