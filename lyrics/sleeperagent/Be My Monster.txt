Baby I don't love you but I think I'm gonna try.
Nothing ever happens for the reasons we decide.

Honey I don't love you don't think I'm gonna lie.
The grass just wasn't green enough up over on your side.

Oh my it's up and down.
I spin my head around.
I'm possessed by the sound your heart makes when I'm bound. X2

Baby I've been cryin' so long I don't think they're my tears anymore. (Anymore)
Maybe I've been dying too long I don't think I'm alive anymore. (Anymore)

Tell me that you want to but you do not compromise.
I'll stitch up the pieces like the bride of Frankenstein.

You can be my monster and I'll be your sleeping child.
If you keep the horror up then we can go all night.

Oh my it's up and down.
I spin my head around.
I'm possessed by the sound your heart makes when I'm bound. X2

Baby I've been cryin' so long I don think they're my tears anymore. (Anymore)
Maybe I've been dying too long I don't think I'm alive anymore. (Anymore)
And lately I've been thinkin' of you but it ain't those "lovely thoughts" no more. (No more)
Baby I've been cryin' so long I dont think they're my tears anymore. (Anymore)

And you, you can be my monster.
I'll be your bride.
And if you stay haunted, I'll be satisfied ...

Oh!

Baby I've been cryin' so long! (Whoaa oh oh!)
I don't think they're my tears anymore! (Whoaa oh oh!)
Baby I've been dyin' too long! (Whoaa oh oh!)
I don't think I'm livin' anymore! (Whoaa oh oh!)
Baby I've been cryin' so long! (Whoaa oh oh!)
I don't think they're my tears anymore! (Whoaa oh oh!)

And you, you can be my monster.
I'll be your bride.
And if you stay haunted,
I'll be satisfied.---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
