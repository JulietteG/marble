Tell me, are you burnt?
Show me, where it hurts.

I'll force a smile just to lay with, all I wanna do, is lay with you.
Oh no what I'd do, to lay with you. I'd get so hiiigh.
Cuz I've been waitin' all this time to get mine I've been,
Oh it might take awhile. 
Cuz I've been waitin' all this time to get mine I've been,
Gonna take my time, hopeless heartache crime, but I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it.

Make me, before I make you.
Take me, before I break you.

I'll force a smile just to lay with, all I wanna do, is lay with you.
Oh no what I'd do, to lay with you. I'd get so hiiigh.
Cuz I've been waitin' all this time to get mine I've been,
Oh it might take awhile. 
Cuz I've been waitin' all this time to get mine I've been,
Gonna take my time, hopeless heartache crime, but I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it.

You can run and you can hide.
In the end it's you I'll find. X2

I'll force a smile just to lay with, all I wanna do, is lay with you.
Oh no what I'd do, to lay with you. I'd get so hiiigh.

All I wanna do, is lay with you!
Oh no what I'd do, to lay with you!---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
