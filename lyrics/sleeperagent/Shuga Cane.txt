I see you (I feel you there).
I'll take you (Anywhere).
Make it (What you want).
I got it (You like to flaunt).

Let's strip down show each other our stab wounds. 
Seven pounds and you'll get my eyes too.
Make our rounds to a series of empty rooms.
Uh huh, I swear, you'll get yours too.

We gonna have a ball but we ain't got no need for chains.
We gonna roll them bones and meet you at the blood lust bank.
And though it's plain to see! You're gonna break my knees!
With your shuga cane.

Come on (Play one more).
I'll be your (Yarn folklore).
Swaddled (Rags with care).
I've got some (Change to spare).

Let's strip down show each other our stab wounds. 
Seven pounds and you'll get my eyes too.
Make our rounds to a series of empty rooms.
Uh huh, I swear, you'll get yours too.

We gonna have a ball but we ain't got no need for chains.
We gonna roll them bones and meet you at the blood lust bank.
And though it's plain to see! You're gonna break my knees!
With your shuga cane.

.....

We gonna have a ball but we ain't got no need for chains.
We gonna roll them bones and meet you at the blood lust bank.
And though it's strange to see! You're gonna break my knees!
And yeah it's strange to see! You're gonna break my knees!
With your shuga cane.---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
