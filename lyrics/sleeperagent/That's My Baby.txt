C'mon shuga don'tcha cry.
I don't wanna ever have to say goodbye.
Don't starch your pants with cheap romance.
And freudian slips don't come off on the fly.

But I'm never satisfied.
No!

Don't wait, I'm never gonna chase.
A tailgate, I'm never gonna say,
"That's my baby there and he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby there and he don't need to know, no he don't."

Unleash your bark but don'tcha stray.
I'm sick and tired of fetchin' runaways.
Tint your lips with lover's spit.
You throw your weight I throw my fits away.

Ain't it a shame?
No!

Don't wait, I'm never gonna chase.
A tailgate, I'm never gonna say,
"That's my baby there and he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby there and he don't need to know, no he don't."
That's my baby there and he don't need to know you at all!
That's my baby there and he don't need to know, no he don't.

Wound too, tight to come undone!
This pick-apart not never ... just ain't enough.

Darlin' just pry to come undone!
I'm holdin' out for the jinx... Do with it what you want.

Don't wait, I'm never gonna chase.
A tailgate, I'm never gonna say,
"That's my baby there and he don't need to know you at all."
"That's my baby there and he don't need to know, no he don't."
That's my baby there and he don't need to know you at all!
That's my baby there and he don't need to know, no he don't.

No he don't...---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
