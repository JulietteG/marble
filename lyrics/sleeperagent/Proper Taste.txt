Expert parallels I'm not sinking,
Up or down to your swan song singing.
(Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa, oh oh oh oh)
Textbook sound it out what'choo readin'?
Outside the lines your color's bleedin'.
(Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa, oh oh oh oh)

You (lack) prop-(er) taste.
Wipe (me) from (your) face.
Tie (me) up (I'm) laced and stay... 
estranged!

Call me pumpkin carve me out.
I'm a candle blow me down.
What's my name? Spell it out.
But not, too loud ...

Interrobang, what'choo sayin'?
On your knees, keep on prayin'.
(Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa, oh oh oh oh)
Begging me please but I'm not shakin'.
On my tail, you're not stayin'.
(Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa, oh oh oh oh)

You (lack) prop-(er) taste.
Wipe (me) from (your) face.
Tie (me) up (I'm) laced and stay...
estranged!

Call me pumpkin carve me out.
I'm a candle blow me down.
What's my name? Spell it out.
But not, too loooud ...

Jump up on your innocence.
I'll turn it into garden kitsch!
C'mon baby throw a kiss.
I'll catch it with a dirty fist!

You (lack) prop-(er) taste.
Wipe (me) from (your) face.
Tie (me) up (I'm) laced and stay...
estranged!

Call me pumpkin carve me out.
I'm a candle blow me down.
What's my name? Spell it out.
But not, too loud ...---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
