As a girl I kissed them.
My heart a telephone.
Such noise to listen.
Too many sounds so...

(I let go!)
I think I feel it.
(I let go!)
I'm wild like children.
(I lay low!)
Misplaced a million miles from home.

And so fine I feel, far and wide.
Far and wide.

Unravel and revel, unravel and revel!

And this lust was built in, 
Straight into my bones.
No need resist it.
It's a drag so ...

(I let go!)
I think I feel it.
(I let go!)
I'm wild like children.
(I lay low!)
Misplaced a million miles from home.

And so fine I feel, far and wide.
Far and wide.
.....
Unravel and revel. X8

And so fine I feel, far and wide! X4

Oooh ahh oooh.
Oooh ahh oooh.
Oooh ahh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oooh ahh ooh ooh ooh ooh....---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
