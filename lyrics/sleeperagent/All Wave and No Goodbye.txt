Pull me up, before I start sinking.
I'll drown, if I overthink it.
You're the one that I want to keep breathin'.
All I need's a single cell to believe in.

Hate to say, it's me you might've outgrown.
Our days are numbered, and it's just getting old.
You're desert bound and your monolith's crumblin'.
But grab your guns and I'll come runnin' ouuut....

I'm gonna make you believe in me.
Gonna make you believe in me.
But you can't make me make up your damn mind.
Gonna make you believe in me.
Gonna make you believe in me.
But you can't stop my heart from runnin' wild.

"The Nothing's" comin' now here's my nowhere odds.
You're never there you were always lost in thought.
So slow you're movin' backwards baby crawl,
Back to, your old Kentucky home...

They call, I beckon to their cries.
I feed into their weary, dreamy eyes.
Unlike you and the safe-nets that'cha use,
They gamble too and they'll never leave me behind ...

I'm gonna make you believe in me.
Gonna make you believe in me.
But you can't make me make up your damn mind.
Gonna make you believe in me.
Gonna make you believe in me.
But you can't stop my heart from runnin' wild.

(Ahhh) X4
(Ahhhhhh)

You're a ghost!
Be here now! X2

She'll see! (How ya been?)
She'll see! (How we were back then)
And Chelsea, I've been doin' fine,
I'm all wave and no goodbye ...---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
