Here's the Hope Six Demolition Project
Switching down the Benning Road
The well-known "pathway of death"
At least that's what I'm told
And here's the one sit-down restaurant
In Ward Seven, nice
OK, now this is just drug town, just zombies
But that's just life

In the Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope, hope, hope, hope

Here's the highway pathway of death and destruction
South Capitol is its name
And the school that looks like shit-hole
Does that look like a nice place?
Here's the old mental institution
And the Homeland Security Base
And here's God's Deliverance Centre
A deli called M.L.K

And The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope, hope, hope, hope

They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here...---
