And so I've arrived
With gloat in my eyes
Are you paying attention?

I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone as I watched you go?
Are you mad because I don't know what you used me for?
I've been looking for so long in America
Throw my hands in the air

Flash, fade in
Say you care, but you don't
You know I hate it
It's a rich kid game and it'll blow up with a throw
That's all that it really is

I was searching for something as I watched you go
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone as I watched you go?
Are you mad because I don't know what you used me for?
Always talking about one day in America
Same old story, you are porcelain
I've been looking for so long
But you cut me out
Throw my hand to the air cause I...

Look at us
Oh, the friends we were
So generous
But that rich kid pain what it is to be alone
It's only really used

I was searching for something as I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone as I watched you go?
Are you mad because I don't know what you used me for?
Always talking about one day in America
Same old story, you are porcelain

In America, in America
In America, in America
In America, in America---
