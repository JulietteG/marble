Stop!
The train is riding
Down to the station where you lived
When we were school kids

Hey!
The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral 
Round this town of steam

My Body tells me no!
But I wont quit
I want more, I want more 
My Body tells me no!
But I wont quit
I want more, I want more 

Stop
The train is riding
Down to the station where I lived
When I was a cool kid

Hey!
Is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn 
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves 

My Body tells me no!
But I wont quit
I want more, I want more 
My Body tells me no!
But I wont quit
I want more, I want more 
And it rides out of town

Oh, its my road (x^)
And
its my war (X2)
His eyes are open 
Its my war (X2)
His eyes are open (X2)

My Body tells me no!
But I wont quit
I want more, I want more 
My Body tells me no!
But I wont quit
I want more, I want more 
And it rides out of town---Lyrics submitted by kaela.
