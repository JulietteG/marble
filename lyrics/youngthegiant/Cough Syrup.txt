Life's too short to even care at all oh 
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control

These fishes in the sea they're staring at me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

A wet world aches for a beat of a drum 
Oh oh

If I could find a way to see this straight 
I'd run away 
To some fortune that I should have found by now 

I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all oh 
I'm coming up now, coming up now out of the blue
Oh oh

These zombies in the park they're looking for my heart 
Oh oh oh oh 
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun oh oh 

If I could find a way to see this straight 
I'd run away 
To some fortune that I should have found by now 

And so I run now to the things they say could restore me 
Restore life the way it should be 

I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down 

Life's too short to even care at all oh 
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
Oh oh 

If I could find a way to see this straight 
I'd run away 
To some fortune that I should have found by now 

And so I run now to the things they say could restore me 
Restore life the way it should be 

I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down 

One more spoon of cough syrup now
Oh

One more spoon of cough syrup now
Oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Jacky.
