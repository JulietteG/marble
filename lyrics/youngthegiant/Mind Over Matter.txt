Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love

I missed that train 
New York City: it rains
Fly to East L.A.in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
'Cause I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinking about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow

Tokyo: snows
Go to watch the show; curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
'Cause I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

I missed that train 
New York City: it rains
Fly to East L.A.in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

Tokyo: snows
Go to watch the show; curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
'Cause I'm a young man after all!
(I missed that train)
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
(Fly to East L.A.)
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
(all the lights aglow)

And if the world don't break
(Tokyo: snows)
(Go to watch the show)
(Curtain's closed)
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall---
