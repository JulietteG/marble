Well I was waitin' on platform 9 'cuz a boy's gotta pay his dues
I was sittin' there killin' time
I was doodlin' on my shoes
And I was noodlin' on this song
I was hummin' it all along
When the bus finally came I put my book away and I didn't get back home 'till dawn

Where would I go without you?
Without you to guide my way?
Where would I be without you?
I'd be wandering day by day

So when the garbage truck woke me up I remembered this simple tune
I filled up my coffee cup and I greeted the afternoon
'Cuz everyday is a brand new start and the sun always warms my heart
When I got on the bus I wrote this one for us so we might never be apart---Lyrics submitted by diego bono.
