It's two o'clock in the morning babe
I wanna call but I know it?s late
But you left message on the phone to get back to you
So I'm calling you up, cause I'm feeling kinda lonely
And just for tonight you can be my one and only
So when you come round, we will get down
If it feels right we can do it all night
Betcha can't wait

Betcha can't wait, betcha can?t stop
Thinking ?bout my love rock, do I hear the penny drop
Baby come on, betcha can't wait
Betcha wanna stay, now I wanna play
Girl I gotta hundred ways, really wanna make your day
Let's get it on, betcha can't wait

Try to picture what you're wearing now
Don't disappoint me don't you let me down
The thought of you has gotta hold on me
I'm gonna touch you in the right spot baby
Feed you my love it will drive you crazy
Betcha can't wait, baby it's all good

Betcha can't wait , betcha can't stop
Can't stop thinking ,bout my love rock, baby come on
No not tonight, stay here with me , I want you baby
Betcha can't wait , betcha can?t stop
Can't stop thinking ,bout my love rock, baby come on
Baby come on---Lyrics submitted by reymar alad.
