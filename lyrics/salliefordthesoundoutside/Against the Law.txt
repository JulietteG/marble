I wanna eat you up, like a piece of cake
Even if it was the worst mistake
Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me

Wanna suck you up, in a straw
Even if it was against the law
Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me

No I dont know, what they saw, but it wasnt against the law
No I dont know, what they saw, but it wasnt against the law
No I dont know, what they saw, but it wasnt against the law
No it wasnt against the law aw aw

Wanna take off all your clothes
Wanna get rid of all my woes
Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me

I wanna teach you, about that line
I wanna teach you, wanna teach you right
Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me

Well I dont know what they saw but it wasnt against the law
Dont know what they saw but it wasnt against the law
No I dont know what they saw but it wasnt against the law
No it wasnt against the law aw aw

Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me
Baby baby wont you be with me---Lyrics submitted by Mike Miller.
