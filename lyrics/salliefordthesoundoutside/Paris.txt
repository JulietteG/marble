Here I'm sitting in the most romantic city in the world
And I can't seem to get you off my mind
Here I'm sitting in the most romantic city in the world
And I can't seem to get you off my mind

You're like a Parisite
You're like a Parisite
You're like a Parisite
You're like a Parisite

I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again
I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again
I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again
I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again

Cause here I'm sitting in the most romantic city in the world
And I can't seem to get you off my mind
Cause here I'm sitting in the most romantic city in the world
And I can't seem to get you off my mind

You're like a Parisite
You're like a Parisite
You're like a Parisite
You're like a Parisite

I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again
I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again
I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again
I think I'm in trouble again, trouble again

And I can't save you, man, you can only save yourself
And I can't save you, man, you can only save yourself
Just like I can only save myself
Just like I can only save myself---Lyrics submitted by Gina Tallman.
