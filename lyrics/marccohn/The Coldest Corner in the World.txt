Weatherman says a front is moving in
It's coming from the Arctic
On a bone-chilling wind
But that ain't news to me
It's the way its always been
Cause I live on the coldest corner in the world

Tree man came down from Canada today
He smiles at me and now I know Winter's here to stay
But I don't need no pine tree to remind me anyway
Cause I live on the coldest corner in the world

Somebody help me
Help me please
I'm suspended in a deep freeze
And I don't need the Savior
I need 85 degrees
And a woman who loves me

Wind keeps whipping off the river
Is it the wind or something else
That make me shiver?
It don't matter anyway
Cause I know soon I'll be delivered
From the coldest corner in the world---
