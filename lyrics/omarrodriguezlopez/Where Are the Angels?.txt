Oh Lord, where are the angels of the murderers?
Oh Lord, were their manners intended for the love of grief?

Oh, we don't know. 

Oh Love, where are the voices of the troubled minds?
Oh Love, were their manners intended for the love of crime?

Oh, we don't know.

You heard the frown of the highway
It took all of your fear to give me back away

Yes, you gave me everything
And I gave you all the love
Yet, you threw me aside

Where in the world can I find myself another angel?
Oh where in the world, I ask myself in hopes of answer

We don't know.---Lyrics submitted by Juan Jo Reyes.
