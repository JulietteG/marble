So good, so good
So good, so good

No change, no games
No cheers, no pain
Is this real?
Cause I feel like I'm living a fantasy

You're too good to be true
I feel like new
You're feeling me and I'm feeling you
I never ever thought that I could have it all
But you got all I need and more

Cause I ain't never have love as good
You treat me just the way you should
Better than before
You keep me coming back for more

Your love is so good, so good, so good
Your love is so good, so good, so good

No love, no games
You're not the same
I'm glad I gave you a try
Cause you keep me high
I see myself with you for the rest of my life

You're too good to be true
I feel like new
You're feeling me and I'm feeling you
I never ever thought that I could have it all
But you got all I need and more

Cause I ain't never have love as good
You treat me just the way you should
Better than before
You keep me coming back for more

Your love is so good, so good, so good
Your love is so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
Your love is so good
So good, so good, so good
Your love is so good

You got me open, I'm so in love with you, baby
You got me hypnotized, I'm so in love with you baby
Just like the ocean I'm deep in love with you baby
You got me open
So good, so good,
I ain't never love as good
You treat me just the way you should
Better than before
You keep me coming back for more

Your love is so good, so good, so good
Your love is so good, so good, so good---
