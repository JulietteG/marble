(feat. Anthony Hamilton)

See my sun wont shine
Aint no stars at night
I swear the sky aint blue,
Its raining strong and gray without you

Aint no flame in the fire
Im just empty inside
I'm sick by the very thought of
Spending my days and being without you

(Pre-Chorus)
Got me thinking but I do
You got me thinking, thinking
To you I always will be true
Ill always yea
And I know you feel it too

(Chorus)
Say that you want me
Say that you need me
Say that youll have me just the way that I am
Say that you love me
Theres no one that loves me
Say Im your woman
And you are my man, my man

You better say that
And Im your woman
Say you love me baby
I love you baby

So whats it gonna be?
Even the blind could see
You cant deny this love defined between you and me

See I love you baby (and I love you boy)
I couldnt love you more
Its you for me and me for you
This love we have  its true

(Pre-Chorus)
Got me thinking but I do
You got me thinking, thinking
To you I always will be true
Always be true
And I know you feel it too

(Chorus)
Say that you want me
Say that you need me
Say that youll have me just the way that I am
Say that you love me
Theres no one that loves me
Say Im your woman
And I am your man

You are my man

Aint that right?
Say
Woo woo woo woo
Dont you want me?
Need me
You got me thinking, thinking

(Pre-Chorus)
Got me thinking but I do
I do, I do
To you I always will be true
Sad our love  it is true
And I know you feel it too

(Chorus)
Say that you want me
Say that you need me
Say that youll have me just the way that I am
Say that you love me
Theres no one that loves me
Say Im your woman
And you are my man, my man

Say it
Say that you need me
Say that you need me baby
Just the way that I am
I aint never wanna say it baby
Say that you love me
Theres no one that loves me
Say Im your woman
And you are my man, my man---
