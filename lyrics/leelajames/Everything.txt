Waited so long
Seems like a lifetime
But then, yeah, came you
To mend my broken heart
Heaven, should be an angel
So this time I know it's true
Seeing what's real

Yes, you are, you're my
My everything
My everything
You are my everything
The sunshine to my rain
My everything
You are my everything
You are
There's no other that I can say
You're simply my everything

And I'm so thankful
To finally find someone
That I can call my own
And you love me
Love me more than I
Could ever be loved before

Yes, you are, you're my
My everything
My everything
You are my everything
The sunshine to my rain
My everything
You are my everything
You are
There's no other that I can say
You're simply my everything

You are my everything
Everything, everything
You are---
