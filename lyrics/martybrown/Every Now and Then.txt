I thought that I'd forget about you
and easily find someone new
But my heart can't live without you
So what am I suppose to do?

When every now and then, I get that ol' time feelin
Every now and then, you memory comes reelin
Like o' deep in the night, it cuts like a knife
to know that you don't love me

I know that I'm the one to blame
I filled your life with so much pain
I hurt you and I'm so ashamed
How I wish it could be the same

But every now and then, I get that ol' time feelin
Every now and then, you memory comes reelin
Like o' deep in the night, it cuts like a knife
to know that you don't love me

Love can be taken for granted
It's so easy to do
You can learn from mistakes in your life
My mistake was loving you

When every now and then, I get that ol' time feelin
Every now and then, you memory comes reelin
Like o' deep in the night, it cuts like a knife
to know that you don't love me

You don't love me
every now and then, I get that ol' time feelin
Every now and then, you memory comes reelin
Every now, every, every now
Every now and then---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
