You take my breath away
You set my heart on fire when you look at me like that
All I feel inside
Is something that I never want to hide

Wonderful angel, do you see what I see
When I hold you (when I hold you), do you feel what I feel
Theres something magical, the way your heart is joined with mine
How I love you (how I love you) and I always will

Youve got the best of me
Theres just no doubt that I am a better man with you
All I feel inside
Is something that I never want to hide---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
