Close your eyes
We're heading to the other side
Close your eyes
We're heading to the other side

I've been going through some troubles
You know what we came here for
I just wanna say I love you
And I don't wanna hide no more
Love is like the darkest tunnel (Tell me you love me, yeah)
Who knows what we came here for (Touch me, touch me there)
And I just wanna say I love you (Tell me you want me, yeah)
'Cause I can't see the light no more (Take me, you want me there)

So when you close your eyes
We're heading to the other side
Where it's greener
Legends are made of believers
So could you hold your sign
So I can see you through the night
Freedom is a fever
Rather have her than leave her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Close your eyes

Close your eyes
We're heading to the other side

I've been going through some troubles (Tell me you love me, yeah)
You know what we came here for (Touch me, touch me there)
I just wanna say I love you (Tell me you want me, yeah)
And I don't wanna hide no more (Take me, you want me there)
Love is like the darkest tunnel (Tell me you love me, yeah)
Who knows what we came here for (Touch me, touch me there)
And I just wanna say I love you (Tell me you want me, yeah)
'Cause I can't see the light no more (Take me, you want me there)

So when you close your eyes
We're heading to the other side
Where it's greener
Legends are made of believers
So could you hold your sign
So I can see you through the night
Freedom is a fever
Rather have her than leave her
Rather have her than leave her
Close your eyes (leave her)
Close your eyes (leave her)
We're heading to the other side

Close your eyes
We're heading to the other side
Where it's greener
Legends are made of believers
So could you hold your sign
So I can see you through the night
Freedom is a fever
I'd rather have her than leave her
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
