I can only be strong for so long
And I never give in til you're gone
I fight for control when you hold me tight baby
It's way too soon so I kiss goodnight

And I there I lie in the night wide awake
In the night time baby I
Feel it all, I see it all, I see your face
In the night time baby
I done it all in my dreams
You and me
In the night time baby
And if you call me tonight you will see
In the night time baby

I'm not trying to make you wait
And I'm lying if I say I can
And I know that I'm worth it I am babe
But baby I know you deserve it
I know you want it
You know I want it

There I lie, in the night, wide awake
In the night time baby I
Feel it all, I see it all, I see your face
In the night time baby
I done it all in my dreams
You and me
In the night time baby
And if you call me tonight you will see
In the night time baby

Baby won't you stay with me yeah
Stay with me
See we belong, it's meant to be
Baby won't you stay with me
Stay with me

Here I lie, in the night, wide awake
In the night time baby I
Feel it all, I see it all, I see your face
In the night time baby
I done it all in my dreams
You and me
In the night time baby
And if you call me tonight you will see
In the night time baby---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
