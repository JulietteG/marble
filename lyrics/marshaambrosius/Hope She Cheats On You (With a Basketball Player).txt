Ooooow-woah ooooow-woah oh-oh
I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa
Hope that she Kim Kardashianed her way up
Dont know the difference 'tween a touchdown and a lay-up 
got you on Viagra in order for you to stay up 

Hook: 
I may sound bitter Im a little bitter 
Just a little bitter because you were with her
Im Salt Lake City now Im on up out the picture 
Remember how it was when I was with ya

Chorus: 
Baby sex so good do you remember? Ohhh (2x) 
Well Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa) 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope youre feeling lonely baby now we're not togetha) 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa) 
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that Im without you) 


I hope she cheat on you with a NFL balla
She ignores ya every single time you call her 
Brand new Louie gotta have it spend ya money on her
When you wanna hit it she acting like she doesnt wanna 

Hook: 
I may sound bitter Im a little bitter 
Just a little bitter because you were with her
Im Salt Lake City now Im up on out the picture
Remember how it was when I was with ya

Chorus: 
Baby sex so good do you remember. Ohhh (2x) 
Well Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa) 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope youre feeling lonely baby now were not togetha) 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa) 
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that Im without you) 
She cute and all but that wont last forever
What I had for you was so much better.
Yeah the grass ain't greener on the other side of town, now look at how it all turned out now
Im a little bitter, just a little bitter but Im doing better cause we ain't togetha
Ya sorry excuse for somebody I was into 
Remember what it was when I was with you

Chorus: 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa) 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope youre feeling lonely baby now we're not togetha) 
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basket ball playa) 
Look at how it all turned out now (Now that Im without you)---Lyrics submitted by Michell.
