I'm a material girl, living this material live
I been around this whole world
All alone, a couple times
It can get kinda lonely, baby
You're too busy to notice sometimes
I been without you, my love
Without you by my side

All the happiness this money can't buy
Oh, I wanna spend all my time with you
All the lovin' I've been missin' in my life
Oh, I, wanna spend it all with you, babe

I feel this void in my heart
Sponsored links

Broken in pieces my heart
Far too many times I've been hurt
Give it up on what I deserve
What I deserve is real love
All that I haven't deserved
No, I give everything to this love
Now, because I spend way too much

All the happiness this money can't buy
Oh, I wanna spend all my time with you
All the lovin' I've been missin' in my life
Oh, I, wanna spend it all with you, babe

Spending all of my time on other wrong things
Means nothing without you baby
I guess I was wrong, baby
Longing for you now
Baby, I can end the finer things, all the diamond rings
But they ain't worth what is you and I

All the happiness this money can't buy
Oh, I wanna spend all my time with you
All the lovin' I've been missin' in my life
Oh, I, wanna spend it all with you, babe---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
