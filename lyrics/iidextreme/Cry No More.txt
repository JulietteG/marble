Cry no more, no more, no more
Shoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Hmm, you fell so deep in love
'Twas like the fairy tale that somehow came true
But then it fell apart
Became a nightmare, what happened to the love

Now that it's over
You've been crying all night long, yeah
Oh, yeah, baby
Thinkin' of your sweet memory
Wondering what you done wrong, ey... baby

(Heartaches you) Heartaches you've had
You gave your very best
You don't have to cry no more (No more)
I'm what you're looking for (Mmm, hmm)

No more lonely nights
Wipe the tears from your eyes
You don't have to cry no more
I'll never leave you lonely

If you give me the chance
I'll wipe your tears away, put a smile upon your face
I'll be there to kiss you in the moonlight
Be the mornin' sun that greets you, be the whisper that says goodnight

'Cause life's not over
This is just the beginning, yeah... ooh, yeah
Put your hands in my hand
I'll show you love, baby, yes, I will, I'll never leave

(Heartaches) Heartaches you've had
You gave your very best
You don't have to cry no more (No more)
I'm what you're looking for (Trust me, baby)

No more lonely nights (Ooh, yeah)
Wipe the tears from your eyes
You don't have to cry no more (Shoo doo doo doo shoo doo)
I'll never leave you lonely (Woo)

I'll hold you in the middle of the night (Hey, baby)
Everything is gonna be alright (Come close to D'Extra)
Cry no more ('Cause you don't have to cry no more)
I'm what you're looking for (That's right 'cause I'll be there)

I'm the one that you've been looking for (I'll hold you all night long)
You don't have to cry no more (Wipe all those tears away)
Cry no more (I'll be here for you, girl, I promise)
I'll never leave you lonely (Forever)

Cry no more, no more, no more
I'll treat you right, girl
Cry no more, no more, no more
I'll make love to you all night long

I wanna kiss you from your head right down
Cry no more, no more, no more
Right down to your toes, woo
Cry no more, no more, no more

I can treat you like you need to be treated, baby
Yeah... yeah... hey... hey...---Lyrics submitted by Demont.
