Don't know if I should quite sing this song
Don't know if it maybe might be wrong
But then again it maybe might be right
To tell you 'bout the bullet and the red light

You know I'm not from this place
I'm from a different time, different space
And it's real uncomfortable
To be stuck somewhere you just don't belong

But I got 8 good reasons to stick around
8 good reasons, well maybe nine now

I had a dream one night
About a bullet and a red light
You know it felt alright
You know it actually felt quite nice

If I could have gone
Without it hurting anyone
Like a child, I would have found me mum
Like a bird I would have been flown

You know I don't much like life
I don't mind admitting that it ain't right
You know I love to make music
But my head got wrecked by the business

Everybody wanting something from me
They rarely ever wanna just know me
I became the stranger no one sees
Cut glass I've crawled upon my knees

But I got 8 good reasons to stick around
8 good reasons, well maybe nine now

I had a dream one night
About a bullet and a red light
You know it felt alright
You know it actually felt quite nice

But I got 8 good reasons to stick around
8 good reasons, well maybe nine now
8 good reasons to stick around
8 good reasons, well maybe nine now
Well maybe nine now---
