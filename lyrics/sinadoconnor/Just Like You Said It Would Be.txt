I will walk in the garden
And feel religion within
I will learn how to run with the big boys
I will learn how to sink and to swim
And there's talk in the houses
And people dancing in rings
Ah, when you close my eyes, babe?
I can see most everything
I can see most everything

It's just like u said it would b
It's Just like u said it would b
It's just like u said it would b
It's Just like u said it would b

I can see too many mouths open
Too many eyes closed, ears closed
Not enough minds open
Too many legs open
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do
Why isn't it why, why
I don't see why I listen, why, why

La La la la la la la la la (x4)

When I've walked in the garden
When I'm walking off stage
When everything's quiet
Will you stay?
Will you be my lover?
Will you be my mama?
I said will you be my lover?
I said will you be my babe?
When I lay down my head
At the end of my day
Nothing would
Nothing would please me better
Than I find that you're there

When I lay down my head
At the end of my day
Nothing would
Nothing would please me better
Than I find that you're there when I wake

Just like u said it would b
Just like u said it would b
Just like u said it would b
Just like u said it would b

Will you be my lover?
Will you be my mama?

Just like u said it would b
Just like u said it would b
Just like u said it would b
Just like u said it would b---Lyrics submitted by niamh.
