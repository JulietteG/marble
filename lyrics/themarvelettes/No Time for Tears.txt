I've got no time, no time for tears
Though you walked out on me, oh yes you did
My life must go, you see
Though our love has ended
I've got another to be friends with
Oh I'm just gonna pick up the pieces (pick up the pieces)
& start life all over again

'Cause I know cryin' won't bring you back, my love
& a word about you, baby, won't bring you back, my love
Like the wise, I realize what's done is done
Why should I cry? (Why should I cry?)
When you didn't love me anyway

I've got no time, no time, no time, no time for tears
Life holds too many joys to worry 'bout an unfaithful, unfaithful boy
Just like I loved you, there's other fellas lovable too
So I'm just gonna pick up the pieces (pick up the pieces)
& start life all over again,

'Cause I've got no time, no time, no time for tears
Cryin' won't bring you back, baby
...& fade---Lyrics submitted by hosandra hough.
