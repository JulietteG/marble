ooh, ooh, yeah yeah,

i know that you wanna talk about it,
but i gotta put it in your mind,
I feel like we've been through this story a thousand times 
I feel like we've been going around and around in circles 
Ooh why, we gotta put this behind us, yeah, yeah 

Baby, listen to me, please don't walk out that door 
'Cause if you ever need me 
I'd be lost, I'd be going crazy (I go crazy) 
'Cause I don't want nobody else (no, no) 
I just wanna be with you (with you) 
You're the only one who completes me baby 
You're the one who makes me whole 

Why is it that everytime I looked in your eyes (looked in your eyes) 
I see something wrong, insecurity 
When all along I was trying make it right (make it right) 
Keep us going strong, and loving you faithfully 

Baby, listen to me, please don't walk out that door 
'Cause if you ever need me 
I'd be lost, I'd be going crazy (I go crazy) 
'Cause I don't want nobody else (nobody, no, no) 
I just wanna be with you 
You're the only one who completes me baby 
You're the one who makes me whole 

Ooh, baby 
'Cause I don't want nobody else (nobody else, no, no) 
I just wanna be with you (be with you) 
You're the only one who completes me baby 
You're the one who makes me whole (makes me whole) 

Hahaha, let me holla, girl 
Girl you're messing with a player 
And a player will probably play ya 
But a player thinks he's sticking with you 
(I'm sticking with you) 
Not a streets-create, so much distrust 
That I'd probably be ready to break it to you 
Now I ain't trippin' 
We can kick it in the morning (yeah) 
We can make it in the evening (yeah) 
Stroll through the park with the Cali smoke grievin' 
Believe it, I wouldn't even leave you for nothin' 
That's why I'm man enough to say my feelings I ain't finding 

Let's go on the road to the end of the sunshine 
I'ma forget about your past, hoping you forgot mine 
I'd be focus on my grind, you'd be trying to hold me down 
I told you I'd be your boy 
Come on, baby girl, let's ride (let's ride) 

'Cause I don't want nobody else (no, no) 
I just wanna be with you (with you) 
You're the only one who completes me baby 
You're the one who makes me whole 

(I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be with you, no, no) 
'Cause I don't want nobody else 
I just wanna be with you 
(I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be with you) 
You're the only one who completes me baby 
You're the one who makes me whole (you're the one that makes me whole) 

'Cause I don't want nobody else (I don't want nobody else) 
I just wanna be with you 
(I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be with you) 
You're the only one who completes me baby 
You're the one who makes me whole---Lyrics submitted by Kelseyy.
