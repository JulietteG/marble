oh,
i need to find somebody who cant sleep at night, 
without holding me,
without holding me tight,
i want someone who sees me all the time in their dreams,
and then wakes up,
thinkin just of me,
spent time on my own,
spent time being free,
now i just wanna be,

[CHORUS]
overloved,
over needed,
over wanted,
over missed when im away,
overloved,
over dreamed of,
over cared about,
over everything,
i'll give anythin to be over loved.

oh,
i want someone who cant wait to kiss me again,
even though its been, 
a minute since they last did,
want someone who loves love songs and dedicates them to me,
and two loving arms,
never out of reach,
been fine on my own,
did fine being free,
this time i wanna be,
this time i wanna be.

[CHORUS]

want someone to talk to me,
would talk so sweet,
want someone whos there to share there world with me,(oh baby)
ive been to0 lonely,
for to0 many nights,
this time i need someone here in my life,
this time i want someone holdin me tight,
been under kissed,
under touched,
now i just wanna be.

[CHORUS]

oh, i just wanna be,
by someone whos over in love with me,
over kissed,
over touched,
over missed,
overloved.---Lyrics submitted by Kae.
