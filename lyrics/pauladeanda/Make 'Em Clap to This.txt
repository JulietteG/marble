Make 'em clap to this 4x

Ak'Sent:
Here is Ak'Sent and Paula sitting side ways in a 6-foot candy-painted pole, im a robber 'cause I clap raps like a 45 revolver, told her it's like nova, nova down on his deck keep shining on my neck, neck, f it im the best so rearrange your bestest we the best kept secert from the west yes

Paula:
I'ma think of a little something 
Make a play'a want to know about me 
When you hear a thump thumpin' 
B bump a bump,bump 'til it's hard to breathe 
Ladies shake the little somethng 
'Cause you know, this is what the boys like to see
Fella's no ,don't get it twisted
Baby look but don't touch no hands on me

Bridge:
If you like it from a circle 
So put the ladies in the middle and let 'em do their thing
Said if you like it from a circle Move back
Give me some room to do what i do, ohhh 

Chours:
Make 'em clap to this, when they watch you move
Make 'em clap to this, when you shake your thing
Make 'em clap to this, you know what to do tonight
To have them boys like ohh
Make 'em clap to this, ohh ohh 3x (only this line not the chours)

Ova' there staring at me licking your lips trying to impress
Looking like you wanna touch me
(don't trip) Get fresh and you will get checked
Ladies, they just put the jam on
When yo hear it you be talkin' about this much
Felas make some room now 
And let the ladies get right to it

Bridge:
Said if yo like it from a circle
So put the ladies in the middle let 'em do their thing
Said if you like it from a circle(move back)
Give me so room, to do what I do,ohh 2x

Chours:
Make 'em clap to this when they watch you move
Make 'em clap to this whenyou shake your thing
Make 'em clap to this you know what t do tonight
To have them boys like ohh
Make 'em clap to this ohh,ohh 2x

Ak'Sent:
Baby im so grovy, check how i move 
Gucci coverd with Loui, Prada Channel and more Gucci
Hottest chick and you know it me and Paula the lowest 
My job is keepin me glowing
The source of my rhyme, I own the source of rhyme
They keep me thrir 5 mics,but i'd rather have dollar signs
So my girls thy get it poppin' hustlin' make rap in the trap 
Paula D. keep em' clappin'

Chours:
Make 'em clap to this when they watch you move
Make 'em clap to this when you shake your thing
Make 'em clap to this you know to do tonight
So grab them boys like ohh
Make 'em clap to this ohh,ohh 2x
