I'm feeling you tonight, shorty
I see you looking fly, shorty
Big proof from the corner of my eye
Gotta let you know that I'm digging your style
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

I'll be down for you
Come and take a walk with me and tell me what's on your mind
Can I have a little bit
Just a little bit of your time
Just so you know, ooh

I'll be down for you
I just wanna let you know that I'm gonna hold you down
I just wanna tell you boy that I ain't playing around
'Cause I'm for real, I'm for real
Here's the deal
I'm going to give it to you like this
If you're down for me, then
I'll be down for you

I'm not like a usual girl
Something like a usual boy
Never have to worry about be trippin'
You should already know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

I'll be down for you

If you look into my eyes, then you'll see what I see
Then you'll realize what you're missing is me
'Cause we belong to each other, I can tell that it's right
Boy I gotta tell ya by the end of tonight

I'll be down for you
I just wanna let you know that I'm gonna hold you down
I just wanna tell you boy that I ain't playing around
'Cause I'm for real, I'm for real
Here's the deal
I'm going to give it to you like this
If you're down for me, then
I'll be down for you

From the first time I laid eyes on you
I just had to let you know (let you know)
That I'll be everything you needed (everything)
'Cause you'd never need
And there's no other way to tell you that

I'll be down for you
I just wanna let you know that I'm gonna hold you down
I just wanna tell you boy that I ain't playing around
'Cause I'm for real, I'm for real
Here's the deal
I'm going to give it to you like this
If you're down for me, then
I'll be down for you

I'll be down for you
I just wanna let you know that I'm gonna hold you down
I just wanna tell you boy that I ain't playing around
'Cause I'm for real, I'm for real
Here's the deal
I'm going to give it to you like this
If you're down for me, then
I'll be down for you---Lyrics submitted by shaneil.
