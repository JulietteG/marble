Could be here
I kind of doubt it
Could be clear
But look kind of clouded
Could be here 
I kind of doubt it
In this world
Could be fate
I kind of hope it's what
Makes me wait
I kind of know it 
When early's late
I kind of doubt it
In this world
So hold me now
Could be here
I kind of doubt it
Could be clear 
But look kinda of clouded
Could be here
I kind of doubt it
In this world
I might behave 
I kinda hope so
but goods crooked 
I kinda know so
I might be brave
I've gotta go so
In this world
Of all the fools
The truth will shatter
Into infinite proof
The puzzle matters
Moire that how
The pieces hook
They come apart
To make more good
I might be strange
I kinda know so
But good's crooked
I gotta show so
I might  be brave
I've got to go so
In this world 
So hold me now
It's the same old poise
That matters
Hold me now
I cannot do this
If I walk alone---Lyrics submitted by Yolanda Rodrigu.
