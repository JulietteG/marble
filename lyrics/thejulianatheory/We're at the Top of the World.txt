We're at the top of the world,
you and I.
We've got alot of time
and it sure feels right.
Cause you reached in your pocket
and pulled out a pass
that says you can take me anywhere.

Chorus: (4x)
Sha la la la.
Sha la la la la la la.

Verse 2:
We're on the top of the world,
here tonight.
We've got alot of time
and it sure feels right.
Cause I'm up here running behind you.
I'm up here running in repeat.

Chorus

We're at the top of the world,
you and I.
We've got alot of time
and it sure feels right.
Cause you reached in your pocket
and pulled out a pass
(you can take me anywhere 5x)---Lyrics submitted by Peter.
