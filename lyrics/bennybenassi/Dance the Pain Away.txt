(feat. John Legend)

Ill take my time
Let the tears fall down
From my face
Wash the pain away
Were all speeding
Lost in this race
And my hearts in a hearse
Can we put it in reverse, babe

Cause I cant even feel the drum and bass
Its drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My minds a million miles away

Ohh, Everybodys going to the floor
Maybe I dont want to dance anymore
Dont want to dance anymore
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I cant dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I cant dance the pain away

Touch that dial
Im changing the station
Cause I cant smile
Like everyone else
Play my sad song
In heavy rotation
I wont go out
Im trying to save myself

I cant even feel the drum and bass
Its drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My minds a million miles away

Ohh, Everybodys going to the floor
Maybe I dont want to dance anymore
Dont want to dance anymore
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I cant dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I cant dance the pain away

I cant dance tonight
Oh everybodys movin but Im tired
I cant dance tonight
I try to keep it movin but I but I but I

I cant dance the pain away
I cant dance the pain away
I cant dance the pain ---
