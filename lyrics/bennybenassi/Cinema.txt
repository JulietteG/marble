I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favourite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's comin'
Forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop runnin'
To me 'cause I'll always be waitin'

You are a cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are a cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
A cinema my cinema
A cinema a cinema a cinema a cinema

Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessin'
Forever my wonder
Hope you start undressin'
All my dreams and take me under

You are a cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are a cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
A cinema my cinema
A cinema a cinema a cinema a cinema

Never know what movie you're playin'
Never know what movie you're playin'
Never know what movie you're playin'
Never know never know never know

You are a cinema
I could watch you forever
Action, thriller
I could watch you forever
You are a cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema my cinema
A cinema a cinema a cinema a cinema---
