(feat. Gary Go)

The lights blur in the sky
The sun starting to die
As we're coming to light
A retro for the fade
No fear we are brave
This night is gonna save us

When the wind is in your hair
I just stare
For a second I don't care
I just stare

As the sun leaves and leaps through my hands, I think
Let this last forever
Let this last forever
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let this last forever
Let this last forever

Fall back to the ground
Spellbound by the sound
Surrender me now
No need to be scared
True love's gonna get us there
And start to whirl around us

As the sun leaves and leaps through my hands, I think
Let this last forever
Let this last forever
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let this last forever
Let this last forever

As the sun leaves and leaps through my hands, I think
Let this last forever
Let this last forever

When the wind is in your hair
I just stare---
