Summer down in the wilderness
Summer down in the ragged dress
All the walls as you move past
Show their tears

Yesterday your arms were wide
Now my fingers they are tied
To the pistols at your side
Moves to me

Night comes on and all caught wrong
Hear your haunted ocean song
All tangled up in dreams
All tangled up in dreams

Born to lose and born to win
All the hours tracing skin
In a pile now for the wind
To scatter

And if I said i believed in you
We still know what you would do
Through the door into the blue
Little bird

Night comes on and all caught wrong
Hear your haunted ocean song 
All tangled up in dreams
All tangled up in dreams

No one to hear your screams---Lyrics submitted by jacob.
