Memory, oh memory
what is it you did bring?
I have brought you a sweet dreem.
from far across the sea

Down to the station,
where the train has pulled in,
see the cars of silver and gold.
The coal hits the fire,
and the wheels start to spin,
oh yout're going round the sun
don't ya know.

Memory, oh memory
where is it I must go?
Away from you, but do not weep,
such wonders you will know.

It's down to the station,
where the traing has pulled in,
see the cars of silver and gold.

And the coal hits the fire
and the wheels start to spin
oh yout're going round the sun
don't ya know.---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
