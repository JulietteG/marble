We like to drink and party hard
We're not afraid to fight, we're not afraid of die
We like to fuck, any girl will do
We're not ashamed of the things we do

Drink, fight and fuck
Drink, fight and fuck

Give me a bottle, Jack Daniels will do
Stay out of my way I'm gonna flatten you
Give me a girl, I don't care who
'Cause drink, fight and fuck is what I'm gonna do

Drink, fight and fuck
Drink, fight and fuck

Drink, fight and fuck
Drink, fight and fuck

We like to drink and party hard
We're not afraid to fight, and we're not afraid of die
We like to fuck, just any girl will do
We're not ashamed of the things that we do

Drink, fight and fuck
Drink, fight and fuck---Lyrics submitted by John D.
