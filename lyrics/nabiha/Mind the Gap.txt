Isn't it funny?
I like to dance when I'm on my own
And whenever it's sunny (yeah)
You know I don't wanna stay at home
I fly in my dreams almost every night
And I'ma be down with Miss Marple for life (ay)
It's the incidental things
That makes me who I am

Mind the gap
Mind the girl
Have another drink on me
Grab a seat in the world
Yeah, have it your way
I don't give a damn about the looks I bear
Even when it snows I'm wearing flowers in my hair
Mind the gap
Mind the girl

Life isn't easy
But I cry when I watch the news
Not everything's peachy, no
But let's keep a good attitude
My friends know I always run late on a plan
And I like a good man with humor and warm hands
It's the incidental things
That makes me who I am

Mind the gap
Mind the girl
Have another drink on me
Grab a seat in the world
Yeah have it your way
I don't give a damn about the looks I bear
Even when it snows I'm wearing flowers in my hair
Mind the gap
Mind the girl

Gotta do something crazy
At least once a day
It's good for you baby
Sugar for the brain
(Hahaha, peace)

Mind the gap
Mind the girl
Have another drink on me
Grab a seat in the world
Yeah, have it your way
I don't give a damn about the looks I bear
Even when it snows I'm wearing flowers in my hair
Mind the gap
Mind the girl
(What do you want?)
Mind the gap
Mind the girl
Have another drink on me
Grab a seat in the world
Yeah, have it your way
I don't give a damn about the looks I bear
Even when it snows I'm wearing flowers in my hair
Mind the gap
Mind the girl---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
