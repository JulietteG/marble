You're only a rainbow away
And I'm sitting here soaking wet, waiting for you
You're only a rainbow, just a rainbow away
And I'm reaching out hoping that you see it too

But I'm telling you, that I'm no fool
'cause I know what rainbows do

They fade away,
Fade away,
Fade away, away,
Stormy day, found it's way
And I wish I could hold you now

I'm only a rainbow away, my friend
And if you could see
What others see
You wouldn't feel so bad

And I'm telling you
'cause I've been there too,
That storms are like rainbows too

They fade away,
Fade away,
Fade away, away,
Stormy days,
Drift away,
And may someone be holding you now---Lyrics submitted by mecca.
