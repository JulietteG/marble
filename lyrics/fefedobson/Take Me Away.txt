I was waiting all my life to know you
All about you
And now, I'm staring in your eyes, ocean blue
I'm all about you

And in our mind, it comes so easily
But there's a feeling coming over me
I wanna show you, but there's nowhere we can really be free
Everybody's watching
Wouldn't it be good if we could be together?

Take me away, take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid, navigate and I will steer
To the sun, we will run

I try to remember when I was just a child
In my room
My imagination used to run wild
But I never knew

That nothing's ever as it seems to be
When a dream collides with a reality
It should be easy when two people love each other truly
Everybody's talking
Wouldn't it be good if they would understand us?

Take me away (away), take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid (afraid), navigate and I will steer
To the sun, we will run

We will run, woah
We will run, yeah

Wouldn't it be good if they would understand us?
Wouldn't it be good if we could be together?
Take me away!

Take me away (away), take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid (afraid), navigate and I will steer
To the sun, we will run, woah
(I will run)
I will run with you wherever you go
Don't be afraid, let's run away and I will steer
To the sun, we will run---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
