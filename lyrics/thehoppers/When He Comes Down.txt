When Jesus was here
He gave us the words of eternal life
He gave us His peace
And He said, Ill not leave you alone
And though I wasnt there
When the multitude watched him ascend
Two angels in white announced
He would come back again

What a blessing it was
To be part of that crowd
Gathered there that day
To see Him go up
And in clouds see Him taken away
But I know in my heart
That a greater blessing waits now for me
Oh, cause Im part of that crowd
Thats been watching the sky faithfully

-CHORUS-
My eyes shall see King Jesus
When He comes in clouds of glory
If I am sleeping, Ill be awakened from the grave
And if I remain, Ill hear the trumpets joyful sound
I didnt see Him go up
But Ill see Him when He comes down

-BRIDGE-
Ill be like Him
Ill be like Him
Though I dont know just what Ill be
Ill be like Him
Ill be like Him (Ill be like Him)
Ill be like Him (Ill be like Him)
Though I dont know (Dont know) what Ill be (Ill be), Ill be like Him
I shall see Him as He is
And thats good enough for me
Ill be like Him
When He Comes Down

My eyes shall see King Jesus
When He comes in clouds of glory
If I am sleeping, Ill be awakened from the grave
And if I remain, Ill hear the trumpets joyful sound
I didnt see Him go up
But Ill see Him when He comes down

And if I remain, Ill hear the trumpets joyful sound
I didnt see Him....I didnt see Him
Oh, I didnt see Him go up
But Ill see Him when He comes down
When He comes down---Lyrics submitted by Robin.
