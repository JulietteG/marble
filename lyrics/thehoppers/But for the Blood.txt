They found him in the garden of Gethsemane, 
they led him to a cross which he took willingly 
for our salvation he laid his life down, 
his precious blood fell like tears to the ground 

Great is the Mercy Great is the Love 
Great are my many sins But for the Blood 
I'd still be drowning in death's bitter flood 
Hopelessly perishing, but for the blood. 

I tried to buy mercy with all my good 
I tried to earn grace but there's no way I could 
If I gained the whole world I'd still be lost 
Without the blood Jesus shed on the cross. 

Great is the Mercy Great is the Love 
Great are my many sins But for the Blood 
I'd still be drowning in death's bitter flood 
Hopelessly perishing, but for the blood. 

Great is the Mercy Great is the Love 
Great are my many sins But for the Blood 
I'd still be drowning in death's bitter flood 
Hopelessly perishing, but for the blood. 

Great is the Mercy Great is the Love 
Great are my many sins But for the Blood 

(I'd still be drowning in death's bitter flood 
Hopelessly perishing, but for the blood.)X2 

Great is the Mercy Great is the Love 
Great are my many sins But for the Blood 

(I'd still be drowning in death's bitter flood 
Hopelessly perishing, but for the blood.) X2---Lyrics submitted by chelsea fryar.
