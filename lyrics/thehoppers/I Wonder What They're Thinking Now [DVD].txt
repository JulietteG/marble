They heard Him preach and watched the crowds that gathered
Amazed at how the hungry souls were fed
They saw it when the blinded eyes were opened
They even watched the Master raise the dead
Then they heard Him cryin' as He prayed there in the garden
There's the cross, the crown of thorns upon His brow
Those men who walked beside Him, I wonder what they're thinking now

For another crowd is gathered and they're all arrayed in splender
And singing Holy,holy to the Lamb
They see a million angels that only have one purpose
To give all glory to the great I Am
Do you think they still remember how they walked away from calvary
And left Him there on Golgotha's ground
Those men who walked beside Him, I wonder what they're thinking now

They all but one soon died for serving Jesus
Though their hearts were sometimes filled with fear and doubt
Those men, they're now in heaven, and I wonder what they're thinking now

For another crowd is gathered and they're all arrayed in splender
And singing Holy,holy to the Lamb
They see a million angels that only have one purpose
To give all glory to the great I Am
Do you think they still remember how they walked away from calvary
And left Him there on Golgotha's ground
Those men who walked beside Him, I wonder what they're thinking now

For another crowd is gathered and they're all arrayed in splender
And singing Holy,holy, holy holy to the Lamb
They see a million angels that only have one purpose
To give all glory to the great I Am
Do you think they still remember how they walked away from calvary
And left Him there on Golgotha's ground
Those men who walked beside Him, I wonder what they're thinking now

Those men who walked beside Him, I wonder what they're thinking now---Lyrics submitted by Cindy Stephens.
