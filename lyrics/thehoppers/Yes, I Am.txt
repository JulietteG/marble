It is settled I am certain 
In my heart and in my mind 
I pass the glory curtain and
I leave this world behind
I will stand with the immortal 
With the happy land in view 
And i'll journey through the portal
Down the golden avenue

I'm gonna leave some glorious morning yes i am yes i am 
I'm gonna cross that chilly Jordan yes i am yes i am
Though the water is deep and the river is wide 
I'm gonna stand on the other side
I'm gonna leave for the heaven someday yes i am yes i am

I am waiting at the station
Listening closely for the call
I have made my reservation 
With the one who paid it all
Not by might not by power 
But in Christ and Christ alone
I am leaving any hour 
Praise the lord i'm going home

I'm gonna leave some glorious morning yes i am yes i am 
I'm gonna cross that chilly Jordan yes i am yes i am
Though the water is deep and the river is wide 
I'm gonna stand on the other side
I'm gonna leave for the heaven someday yes i am yes i am
(repeat x2)
I'm gonna leave for the heavens someday
I'm gonna leave for the heavens someday 
I'm gonna leave for the heavens someday
Yes, I am Yes, I am.---Lyrics submitted by michelle lane.
