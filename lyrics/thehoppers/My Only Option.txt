Verse1
What is that standing before me today?
Another big mountain, that won't move away
I could be discouraged, but I won't this time
My only option is climb

Chorus
My only option is strength in the Lord
He'll give me the power like He has before
I can't be defeated thats not God's design 
My only option is climb

Verse2
There are some mountains that will move away
There's another bright wonderful sun shiny day
I face a battle that's different this time
But my only option is climb

Chorus
My only option is strength in the Lord
He'll give me the power like He has before
I can't be defeated that's not God's design
My only option is climb

Tag
I can't be defeated that's not God's design
My only option is climb---Lyrics submitted by cjavery.
