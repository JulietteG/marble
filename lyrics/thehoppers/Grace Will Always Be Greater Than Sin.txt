In holy pages this truth can be found
A promise to stand on when darkness abounds 
Oh, right never loses and wrong never wins 
And grace will always be greater than sin 

Grace will always be greater than sin 
Calvary has proven it time and again
Whatever youve done 
Wherever youve been
Gods grace will always be greater than sin

Broken and bruised from the choices youve made
Sin has a price and so often youve paid 
Oh, but Jesus is waiting 
New hope is in Him 
And grace will always be greater than sin

Grace will always be greater than sin 
Calvary has proven it time and again
Whatever youve done 
Wherever youve been
Gods grace will always be greater than sin

Grace, grace Gods grace 
Grace that is greater than all my sin 
Whatever youve done 
Wherever youve been 
Gods grace will always be greater than sin---Lyrics submitted by Eric.
