Kim:
The earth was corrupted
So God interrupted
He had repented 
Of all He had made

Well then Noah was summoned
The flood was soon coming
When all that was breathing
Would be washed away

Claude (lead), Dean and Kim:
In desperate manner 
The saws and the hammers
Worked day and night
Building an Ark

He pleaded with sinners
It's finished now enter 
Then God shut the door and
They drown in the dark

Dean: 
Oh, after the rains fell
After the flood swelled
Noah decided
To look for dry land

So he opened the window
His face felt the sun glow
Then he flung the dove skyward
Right out of his hand

Connie:
Months with no sign of
That one little white dove
Noah thought God had
Completed His plan

Oh, he saw the rainbow
But where did the dove go
So pure was her nature
Where could she land 

Where could she land

Kim:
The waters diminished
The earth won't replenish
Still there was but one
Who was found without sin

The Hoppers: 
They may not believe us
But when John baptized Jesus
That same Holy white dove
It descended on Him

Oh sweet Holy Spirit
Dove of pure white
We never witnessed 
Your wings in full flight

But you found us a rock
In the flood of our sins
Now you're nesting in us
Cause you landed on Him

In the midst of the Jordan
Stood the purest of men
Someday we shall fly
Cause you landed on Him

And one day we will witness
Your wings in full flight 
Sweet Holy Spirit
Dove of pure white

Dove of pure white---Lyrics submitted by G Goines.
