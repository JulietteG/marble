You got a home stopping 
You won't be left here 
It's coming and it won't be asking 
Got nothing when there is nobody left in your home again 
You got a home stopping 
And it won't be asking 
And it get caught up and it don't be asking 
but don't get caught up 
With the people who won't left you home again 
So we're running a long way home 
We're running always home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 

You got a home coming 
When you least expect it 
Finally can type the love you left it 
I loose my heart my head my home 
You got a home stopping 
And it won't be asking 
And it get caught up and it don't be asking 
but don't get caught up 
So we're running a long way home 
We're running always home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 

And I don't get wast one day 
Now God let it don't waste it 
We're running along 
The last one takes us now 
We're running along 
The ones will break us 
So we're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 
We're running along we are 
We're running a long way home 
We're running a long way home 
We're running a long way home---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
