After the big parade, when all the limelight fades
I'll be the one to kiss your eyes
The roar fades in the air, like hope from a lover's prayer
The light from my heart begins to rise

Chorus:
And they said I couldn't love you, and that it would never last
He's just a crazy boy, just look at his past
And they said I couldn't love you, but that was just a lie
I couldn't love you more if I tried

I was the lucky one, the one having all the fun
Running into the sun, the party never ends
You waited there for me so loving and patiently
Shutting out sad words from your friends

Chorus
And they said I couldn't love you, and that it would never last
He's just a crazy boy, just look at his past
And they said I couldn't love you, but that was just a lie
I couldn't love you more if I tried

I don't own any armor, and I might not be that brave
You might be the one I resuce, but I'll be the one you save

Chorus
And they said I couldn't love you, and that it would never last
He's just a crazy boy, just look at his past
And they said I couldn't love you, but that was just a lie
I couldn't love you more if I tried---Lyrics submitted by Line.
