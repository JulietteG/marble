Now I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical

Catch that fellas better check the sound
'Cause I break these boys and wreck this town
I steal your toys and claim your ground
I steal your toys and claim your ground
Just cus su nu su ne, cus su nu su ne
If you in the crowd, can ge-e-et it out.
Baby ask around, baby ask around.
'Cause it's my time and I stand proud.
In my hands I got it, had it
Be down it's my turn now.

Now... Now... Now... Now...

Now I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now

Your time is now youre off the wall (Your time is now youre off the wall)
Stand up and get your extraball (Stand up and get your extraball)

'Cause I go hard pound for pound
Got a voice of a sinner and scream out loud
Just cus su nu su ne
If you in the crowd, can ge-e-et it out.
Baby ask around, baby ask around.
'Cause it's my time and I stand proud.
In my hands I got it, now
Wanna Shon just ask me how
You wanna be down it's my turn now.

Your time is now youre off the wall (Your time is now youre off the wall)
Stand up and get your extraball (Stand up and get your extraball)

Now I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
But in the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk (Your time is now)
But in the extraball (youre off the wall)
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk (Your time is now)
But in the extraball (youre off the wall)
It's purely physical
I think your time is now

Your time is now youre off the wall (Your time is now youre off the wall)
Stand up and get your extraball---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
