Well I dreamed that I was back
back in my hometown
and in my dream things were different
cause I stuck around
I dreamed of a house on a quiet little street
with a fridge full of beer and children at my feet

and I used to hate this town
oh, back when I lived here
in my dreams I dont hate this town
Im thinking Im lucky I live here

well it seems in my dream 
Id taken my dad up on his offer 
and took over the hardware store
and in my dream that old store 
was looking better than it ever had before
I dreamed of a life lived in no rush
I dreamed of a quiet and gentle hush

Tell you, I used to hate this town
oh, back when I lived here
in my dreams I dont hate this town
Im thinking Im lucky I live here

Well a few months after that dream
I found myself driving back
about all I could find of that old town
was a rusted out old railroad track
I dreamed of the difference I might have made
cause I dreamed of the difference if I had stayed

Tell you I used to hate this town
oh yeah, when I was there
in my dreams I dont hate this town
Im thinking Im lucky I live here

Oh, whyd I ever leave this old town?
Didnt want to work in no hardware store
I wish Id stayed.---Lyrics submitted by Bobbofallenstar.
