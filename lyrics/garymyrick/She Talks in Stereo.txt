I look in your eyes
You would look at my face
You would see clearly
Is it all 20 20 vision?
Oh, yeah

i feel the pull on me 
its the gravity 
of your voice 
your magnetic attraction"
Oh, yeah

She talks in Stereo
She sounds so good to me
She talks in Stereo

She talks in Stereo
She sounds so good to me
She talks in Stereo
oh, yeah

Steadily moves
Like the grooves on a record
My head spins
When she talks to me
Oh, yeah

Slip and sliding 
We go gliding by
And I can hear her say
My baby says "Hey"

She talks in Stereo
She sounds so good to me
She talks in Stereo

She talks in Stereo
She sounds so good to me
She talks in Stereo

I look in your eyes
You would look at my face
You would see clearly
Is it all 20 20 vision?
Oh, yeah

Slip and sliding 
We go gliding by
And I can hear her say
My baby says "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"

She talks in Stereo
She sounds so good to me
She talks in Stereo

She talks in Stereo
She sounds so good to me
She talks in Stereo

uh, yeah
She talks in Stereo, She talks in Stereo
My baby talks in stereo, talks in stereo
She talks in stereo, talks in stereo---Lyrics submitted by Troy  Axtens.
