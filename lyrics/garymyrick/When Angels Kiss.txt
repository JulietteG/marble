My momma told me
When I was a child
Everywhere there was magic
On my shoulder
An angel rides
Turn out the lights and you will see

When Angels Kiss
There is electricity
They touch my hand
There is a spark inside of me

Oh daddy, daddy
Someday I'll be a man
I'll live and love and fall and cry
And pick myself up
Because I understand
There's more to this what it seems

When Angels Kiss
There is electricity
They touch my hand
There is a spark inside of me

When Angels Kiss
We are this
Not just lightning striking
I gave it away
This secret exists
The power of passion cannot fall

I feel you in the cool of the night
You touch my face we glow in the light
We shine in the light
We shine
We shine in the light

When Angels Kiss
There is electricity
They touch my hand
There is a spark inside of me

When Angels Kiss
When Angels Kiss
When Angels Kiss
When Angels Kiss---Lyrics submitted by Anastasia Beave.
