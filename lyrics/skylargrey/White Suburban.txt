I knew you before
Took a lifetime to forget
But as my eyes meet yours
I take all I can get
Lay light up the shadows of my heart
Return stolen works of art
Yeah, you wont discern this moment

Great, but I still remember you
In that big, old, white Suburban
And although you look right past me
With disregard
The first warm hand burned twice

But gazing still at the ground
More alone than I was then
I have searched your eyes
But they dont comprehend
I crawl back into the shadows of my heart
And just sit there in the dark
Where you dont require the love youll still take

But I still remember you
In that big, old, white Suburban
And although you look right past me
With disregard
And although Ive since moved on
And Ive been in love a few times
Theres still a piece of me
That holds on to you
Cause love first wont happen twice
Wont happen twice
It wont happen twice

I remember you
In that big, old, white Suburban
And although you look right past me
With disregard
And although Ive since moved on
And Ive been in love a few times
Theres still a piece of me
That cant let go of you
Cause the first wont happen twice---
