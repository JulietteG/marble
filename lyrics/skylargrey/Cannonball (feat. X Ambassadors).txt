Well they can try to sink us, but I'll just swim
Because my will is stronger than a gale force wind

Look out, look out, cause each time I fall
I'll be crashing down, right through your door

Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball
Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball, cannonball

And when they light their torches, when they scream my name
I'm gonna raise my flag and gonna give 'em hell

Look out, look out, cause each time I fall
I'll be crashing down, right through your door

Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball
Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball, cannonball

At the end of the day
When the air is still and the sky is grey
Let's swim
Who will be standing?
I challenge you all
Bombs away, bombs away

Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball
Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball
Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball
Here I come
Cannonball, cannonball, cannonball---
