When you close your eyes,
you can see the day rewind,
all the laughs and stupid fights,
you and I we roll like thunder in the skies.
Just like a party breaks at dawn,
it never stops for long.

I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song that is unsaid,
our memory is always within reach,
I will return I will return don't you ever hang your head.

When you're feeling empty,
I will be the fuel you need,
to keep on pushing on down the lonely street
and I'm always in the dark unseen.
Home like headlights on the lawn,
I'm never gone for long.

I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song at each sunset
our memory is always within reach,
I will return I will return don't you ever hang your head.

I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return don't you ever hang your head,
I will return in every song at each sunset
our memory is always within reach,
I will return I will return don't you ever hang your head.---
