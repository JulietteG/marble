Smart ass little girl, always on the run
Playing with fire and daddy's gun.
Falling in love on stolen wine
Where did we go wrong my foolish child?

She said...
I'm too young to drink, too green to think
You say these things and it wears me out.
Too young, too frail, but sometimes I feel
Like old blue jeans
'Cause you wear me out.
You wear me out.

Well, who are you to judge, miss accidental wife?
Who was the genius that brought me to life?
Well you're such a hypocrite to think me so unwise.
I'm just trying to see the world through my own eyes.

But you say...
I'm too young to drink, too green to think
You say these things and it wears me out.
Too young, too frail, but sometimes I feel
Like old blue jeans
'Cause you wear me out.
You wear me out.

Well I'm tattered and torn, see what you do?
Just admit it was all because of you
When I don't come home 'til the early morning.

I'm too young to drink, too green to think
You say these things and it wears me out.
Too young, too frail, but sometimes I feel
Like old blue jeans
'Cause you wear me out.
You wear me out.
Don't you know that you wear me out.
You wear me out.---
