When the music's loud
And there is nothing to say
You can only watch me move you can only watch me sway

See how I turn.
And never walk away
See how I hang around
How I "patiently await"

You're so far away
Wouldnt you agree?
Its time to make your move
Make your way over to me

Chorus:
Come closer now
If you wanna talk to me
Come tell me now
Do you like what you see?

Come here- sit down
If you wanna get next to me
Wont you tell me now?
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?

I use your high
And if you can follow my sees
How take you to a place youve never been

If I showed you everything
I'd have you on your knees
So lets take it slow- like a long night's sweet dreams

You're so far away
Wouldnt you agree?
Its time to make your move- Make your way over to me

Chorus:
Come closer now
If you wanna talk to me
Come tell me now
Do you like what you see?

Come here, sit down
If you wanna get next to me
Wont you tell me now?
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?

Here I am right before your eyes
I think you see something that you like
I hope now you realized
Ive got you hypnotized

All alone in a crowded room
Theres only me and you
Come baby- come to me soon, before the music through

Chorus:
Come closer now	
If you wanna talk to me
Come tell me now
Do you like what you see?

Come here, sit down
If you wanna get next to me
Want you tell me now
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
