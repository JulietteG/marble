you see right through me.
how do you do that shit x3
how do you x4
[x2]

verse 1 :

you let me win,
you let me ride
you let me rock
you let me slide
& when they lookin'
you let me hide.
defend my honor
protect my pride.
the good advice
i always hated
but looking back
it made me greater.
you always told me
forget the haters
just get my money,
just get my weght up.
know when i'm lying,
know when i'm crying
its like you got it
down to a science
why am i trying
no you aint buying,
i tried to fight it
back with defiance.
you make me laugh
you make me hoarse
from yelling at chu
and getting at chu
picking up dishes
throwing them at chu.
why are you speaking
when no one asked you.

chorus :

you see right through me.
how do you do that shit x3
how do you x4
[x2]

verse 2:

what are we doing,
could you see through me ?

cause you say nikki
and i say who me ?
and you say no you
and i say screw you.
then you start dressing
and you start leaving
and i start crying
and i start screaming
the heavy breathing
but what's the reason.
always get the reaction you wanted
im actually fronting
im askin' you something
yo, answer this question,
class is in session,
tired of letting
passive aggression
control my mind,
capture my soul
ok your right
just let it go.
ok you got it,
it's in the can.
before i played it
you knew my hand.
you could turn a free throw into a goal.
nigga got the peep hole to my soul.

chorus:

you see right through me.
how do you do that shit x3
how do you x4
[x2]

stop ohhh..
..stopp ohhh.
would you just stop looking through me cause i just can't take it.
no i can't take it.

you see right through me.
how do you do that shit x3
how do you x5
[x2]

you see right through me.
(you see right through me baby)
you see right through me x2
....yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by chandr.
