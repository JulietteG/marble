She said her name was Nicki
She came to play, and her body was sick yeah
She kill when she walks, so sexy when she talks
Oh, you know she gonna blow your mind.

I got em like, oh, which one of them Ima dead
Cuz when they get sick, they start to cough bread
So (coughs cough cough) just cough up that bread

And that just goes to show Im that b-tch

And this is the anthem, this this is the anthem
And this is the anthem, this this is the anthem
In ear, in ear, in ear, All in ya in ear
