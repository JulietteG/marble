My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy
Used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money
He was getting some coins
Was a shooter with the law
But he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen
He was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse
Bitch I came for us to kill
Who wanna go first?
I had them push daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half of pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck 'em in my automobile
And I'm hitting it with his girls
And he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real
That he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney
He want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag
And I hit 'em with the jab like
Dum du-du-dum, du-du-du-du-dum dum

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
(I get it) Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt (look look look, look at her butt)

This dude named Michael
Used to buy motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower
I ain't talking about Eiffel
Real country ass nigga
Let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep
Now he calling me Nyquil
Now that bang bang bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name romaine
And when we done
I make him buy me romaine
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck 'em in my automobile
And I'm hitting it with his girls
And he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real
That he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like em boney
He want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag
And I hit em with the jab like
Dum du-du-dum, du-du-du-du-dum dum

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
(I get it) Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt (look look look, look at her butt)

Pull at the middle
But you got much pack
Pull at the middle
But you got much pack
Oh my God
(Look at her pack)

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Don't don't don't, my anaconda don't
D-d-don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
(And) Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt (look look look, look at her butt)
