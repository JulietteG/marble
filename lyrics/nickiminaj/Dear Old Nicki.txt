maybe you died cuz everybody asking where you at
i tried to channel you in hopes that i can stare your back
but its like every intersection we just missed each other
you got your fans waiting, tell me you aint six feet under
and tell that you coming back, and you just took a break
maybe i blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
in high in site i loved your rawness and i loved your edge
cuz it was you who took me down from jumping off the ledge 
your earrings bamboo, your long nails to, 
your BMW everytime you came through
you was the brave heart 
you stole wayne heart :p 
you never switched it up, you played the same part
but i needed to grow, and i needed to know
was there some things inside of me that i needed to show
so i just deaded you, left you in all black
but dear old Nicki, please call back   :,^(

you told me, you'll come when, i needed you
and you said it so sweetly, i believed you 
but im standing, here calling, i cant see you
but i am holding you, holding you, holding you, to dat

yo, did i chase the glits and glamour, money, fame, and power
cuz if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
i shoulda kept you wit me, getting at them nameless cowards
they was no match for you, couldnt defeat you powers
i had to make them changes
i hope you understood
you see for every bad, i did a ton of good
but you was underground, and i was mainstream
i live a life now, that we would day dream
my only wish is you come enjoy it wit me
get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers wit me
the money came yea, tripled, and quadrupled  it
but i still miss up when we were just on some stupid shit
and it still fucked the media
they ridiculed you never believed in ya 
they just deaded you, left you in all black
but, dear old Nicki, please call back

you told me, you'll come back when, i needed you
and you said it so sweetly, i believed you 
but im standing, here calling, i cant see you
but i am holding you, holding you, holding you, to dat

yes im holding you, holding you, holding you 
yes im holding you, holding you, holding you   (2x's)
yes im holding you, holding you, holding you
                                 to dat---Lyrics submitted by ahzheona.
