I get it crackin like a bad back?
Bitch talkin she the queen, when she looking like a lab rat
Im Angelina, you Jennifer
Cmon bitch, you see where Brad at
Ice my wrists and I piss on bitches
You can suck my diz-nik, if you take this justice
You dont like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah they know what this is, givin this the business
Cause I pull up and Im stuntin but I aint a stuntman
Yes Im rockin Jordans but I aint a jumpman
Bitches play the back cause they know Im the front man
Put me on the dollar cause Im who they trust in
Ayo SB, whats the f-cks good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shipping wood
Them nappy headed hoes but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
a bitch woooooooooooooooooould

[Hook]
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (x3)
You a stupid hoe, (yeah) you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (stupid, stupid)

Look bubbles go back to your habitat
MJ gone and I aint having that
How you gon be the stunt double to the nigga monkey
Top of that Im in the Phantom looking hella chonky

Ice my wrists and I piss on bitches
You can suck my diz-nik, if you take this justice
You dont like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah they know what this is, givin this the business

Cause I pull up in that Porsche but I aint a Rossi
Pretty bitches can only get in my posse
My name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey yo, baby bop, f-ck you and your EP
Whos gassin this hoe? BP?
Hmm think, 1,2,3, do the Nicki Minaj blink
Cause these hoes so busted
Hoes is so crusty, these bitches is my sons
And I dont want custody
hoes so busted
Hoes is so crusty, these bitches is my sons
And I dont want custody

[Hook]

If you cute than your crew can roll
If you sexy eat my Koo-Koo raw
Put ya cape on, you a super hoe

Stupid hoes is my enemy
stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me
Then she coulda prolly came back!

Stupid hoes is my enemy
stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me
Then she coulda prolly came back!

Youre a stupid hoe
Youre a stupid hoe
You're a stu-u-upid hoe
And I ain't hit that note but 

Now, F-ck you stupid hoe
I said f-ck a stupid hoe,
Now, F-ck a stupid hoe
I said f-ck a stupid hoe,
Now, F-ck a stupid hoe
