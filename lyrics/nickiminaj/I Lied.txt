Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didnt love you I lied I lied
Even though I said I didnt need you I lied I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said dont touch me I lied, I lied
I cant fall for you, cant give my all to you
I cant let you think that Imma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said lets see
But I aint mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker wont let you break mine
Cause Ill be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasnt real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what youd
Do If I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you

So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you ---
