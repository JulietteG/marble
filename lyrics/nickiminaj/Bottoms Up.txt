Trey Songz:
Yeah
Oh oh it's Mr. Steal Your Girl 
Oh oh it's Mr. Steal Your Girl oh oh 
Let's go

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), ey, what's in your cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw your hands up 
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up 
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), pocket full of green 
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans 
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up (up, up)

You know what it is girl, we back up in this thang
Money stay in my pocket, girl, I'm like a walkin' bank
Tell me whatcha drank, tell me whatcha thank
If I go get these bottles, we go alcohol insane
Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride 
Hatin' ass nigga move to the move to the move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), ey, what's in your cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw your hands up 
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up 
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), pocket full of green 
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans 
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up (up, up)

My vision's blurred, my words slurred 
It's jam packed (yeah), a million girls 
And I ain't tryin to lead 'em 
We drunk so let me be your alcohol hero
Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin ass nigga move to the move to the move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), ey, what's in your cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw your hands up

Nicki Minaj:
Yo, could I get that Tron?

Could I get that margarita on the rock rock rocks? 
Could I get that salt all around that rim rim rim rim?

I don't say "Hi", I say "keys to the Benz"
Keys to the Benz? Keys to the Benz!
Muhfuckin right yeah, V to the 10
If a bitch try to get cute Imma sock ha
Throw a lotta money at her then yell fuck ha, fuck ha, fuck ha

Then Imma go and get my Louisville Slugger
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm really such a lady

We give a lotta money to the babies out in Haiti
Yellin' all around the world, 
Do you hear me? Do you like my body?

Rest in peace to Anna Nicole Smith 
Yes, my dear, you're so explosive
Say hi to Mary Mary and Joseph
Now bottoms up and double my dosage

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), ey, what's in your cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw your hands up 
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up

Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans 
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up), throw ya hands up
