St-st step up in the party like my name was bad bitch

sometimes its just me and all my bottles all alone
i ain't comin' back this time

this club is heatin',this party's blazin'
i can't believe it ,this beat is bangin'
i cant believe it (i can't believe it)

and put the iron to your face you old wrinkled bitch!

Oh we just had to kill it
