Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em 
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em 
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em 
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em 

[Verse 1] 
All these bitches is my sons 
and I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em 
a couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em 
If i had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em 
Let me shake it off 
I just signed a couple deals i might break you off 
and we ain't making up I don't need a mediator 
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2] 
This stone is flawless F1 
I keep shooters up top in the F1 
a lot of bitches beggin' me to eff one 
but I'ma eat them rap bitches when the chef come 
Throw some fresh one's 
more talent in my mu'fuckin left thumb 

she a'int a Nicki fan then the bitch def dumb 
you a'int my son you my muthafuckin step-son 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
All these bitches is my sons 
and I a'int talking 'bout Phoenix 
bitch I get money so I do's what i pleases 
I live where the muthafuckin pools and the trees is 
broke bitches so crusty (disgust me) 
gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty 
trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b 
couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me (EW) 
Im the terminator bitch talk slick I'ma have to terminate her 
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator 
you my seed I spray you with germinator 
Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub 
If you could turn back time, Cher 
You used the be here but now you gone Nair 

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
