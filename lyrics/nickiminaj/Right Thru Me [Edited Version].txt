chorus: 
you see right through me. 
how do yall do that shit x3 
how do yall x4 
[x2] 

verse 1 : 
you let me win, 
you let me ride 
you let me rock 
you let me slide 
& when they lookin' 
you let me hide. 
defend my honor 
protect my pride. 
the good advice 
i always hated 
but looking back 
it made me greater. 
you always told me 
forget the haters 
just get my money, 
just get my weght up. 
know when i'm lying, 
know when i'm crying 
its like you got it 
down to a science 
why am i trying 
no you aint buying, 
i tried to fight it 
back with defiance. 
you make me laugh 
you make me hoarse 
from yelling at chu 
and getting at chu 
picking up dishes
throwing them at chu. 
why are you speaking 
when no one asked you. 

chorus : 
you see right through me. 
how do yall do that shit x3 
how do yall x4 
[x2] 

verse 2: 
what are we doing, 
could you see through me ? 
cause you say nikki 
and i say who me ? 
and you say no you 
and i say screw you. 
then you start dressing 
and you start leaving 
and i start crying 
and i start screaming 
the heavy breathing 
but what's the reason. 
always get the reaction you wanted 
im actually fronting 
im askin' you something 
yo, answer this question, 
class is in session,
tired of letting 
passive aggression 
control my mind, 
capture my soul 
ok your right 
just let it go. 
ok you got it, 
it's in the can. 
before i played it 
you knew my hand. 
you could turn a free throw into a goal. 
nigga got the peep hole to my soul. 

chorus: 

you see right through me. 
how do yall do that shit x3 
how do yall x4 
[x2] 

stop ohhh.. 
..stopp ohhh. 
would you just stop looking through me cause i just can't take it. 
no i can't take it. 

you see right through me. 
how do yall do that shit x3 
how do yall x5 
[x2] 

you see right through me. 
(you see right through me baby) 
you see right through me x2
