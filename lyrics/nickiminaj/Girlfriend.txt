This is for my BFF girlfriend (2x)

Ay yo Where My BFF

Where that N**** Hugh Hef
When we pull off at the light 
Why everything else get left 
Why they screwing up they face
Why they lookin a Hot mess

Them B***** is always S******
My clock be tick tick tickin
Them chickens is finger lickin'

And thats why we do it Brezzy
Stuntin in Louis Vezzy
We straight without a perm 
And u B****** is Stupid Peezy

Would you like some rice wit dat

I mean I want some ice with that
No soda 
Where your owner 
Give your lisence back H**
