We like dem boys wit dem rubberband bands
He move wait keep a couple grand grand
So so where ya money put it in ya hand hand
na now make it flip make it do a handstand

(CHORUS)
Do a handstand woiuld ya do a handstand flip det money make you do a handstand

 Nicki Minaj
Its official bang ya pistol play ya money its funni i mean it tickles
I needa d-bhoy i need a president
Nd if ya spendin stacks i need some evadence
Then they can bring out all them cars that they rap bout 
Then i might let you eat it like i put da snacks out

Flip dat money falip it like a handstand

He's a banka by nature
He'll call or stick up the debt that you owe an thank ya
He'll switch the toys out never the same route
But niccas actin like they ain about ta pay out
Takin me out justa ask me how my day went
Tryna show me all his number one investments
He know what i like stay on ya job tight
I pop if you can pop like you got rubberbands we like

(CHORUS)

 Shanell

Then we can stick together like new dallas out the printers
Bad boys i catch call me undercover 
Street grind im  khold cum motha fhh

 Nicki Minaj
Yo yo i flip it like handstands he cookin dem tan grams
Give'em the grand slams in back of da fantam
