(Intro:)
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
I like to be the same
Fire and Fire
Everything is fire
Fire the whole place

Yeah
Yeah

Ohhhhh
Ohhhhh

(Verse 1:)
Man shit, out this mad world
I'm not your only one crazy world
I'm shouting out the haters
Yeah they know who's the feelers
They maybe out of their mind
Yeah of their kind...
Ni-ni-ni-nicki got of of his side
Oh,, Yeah I was riding off the car
and I was shot in the bar 
they don't learn anything in the fire
Man Man what you doing
Hey Hey where you going
Oh I'm in the AMA
I never hide I never bide
I have lot of misses
Yes. I miss you
Gone my attire
All my patience shit this man
Pink Friday is rocking to December

(Pre-Chorus:)
What You like
What You want
Is top like a skyscraper
Is expensive like a ring
But I think you're my King

(Chorus:)
But you're fi-i-i-ired
I hate you
I hate you................
And you're fired
You're fired fi-i-i-ired
You go run run run
Go run run run run
Run run run run run 
Baby you're fired 
But you're fi-i-i-ired
I hate you
I hate you................
And you're fired
You're fired fi-i-i-ired
You go run run run
Go run run run run
Run run run run run 
Baby you're fired 

(Verse 2:)
Shit and Damn
You've never been ashamed
Ohio everything but my heart own
I have a heart
I have a cart
I live everything without your heart
Just wait and wait
Until you fades
You never never been a superman
You never never been a butterman
I've like when you're a bad boy
But I hate when you're a stupid guy
Cause you nver like Psy
You've never learn to fly
You've never fly high
Cause Pink Friday till 12:00

(Pre-Chorus:)
What You like
What You want
Is top like a skyscraper
Is expensive like a ring
But I think you're my King

(Chorus:)
But you're fi-i-i-ired
I hate you
I hate you................
And you're fired
You're fired fi-i-i-ired
You go run run run
Go run run run run
Run run run run run 
Baby you're fired 
But you're fi-i-i-ired
I hate you
I hate you................
And you're fired
You're fired fi-i-i-ired
You go run run run
Go run run run run
Run run run run run 
Baby you're fired 

(Bridge:)
Here we go again
At the top of the world
I never believe you came from here
Cause I mean you never love me
At the first place

(Intro:)
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
I like to be the same
Fire and Fire
Everything is fire
Fire the whole place
