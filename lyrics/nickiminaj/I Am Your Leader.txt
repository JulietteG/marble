[Verse: 1 - Nicki]

Uh, look sucka, this my gun butta'
Street fighter bitches, dis' da' up cutta'
Nunchuka'
No time to ducka', sign of the cross
Cause this is her last suppa'
Play with me, check who came with me
I bought a couple 9's, plus the K's wit' me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, access the damages
Cause this is that oh!, this is that oh!
And yes i body bitches, go get the bandages
Young yummy, fuck you got from me
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy
I'm me the top shotta', drop the top toppa'
Big fat pussy, with a icy watch.

[Chorus]

I am your leader
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick

[Verse: 2 - Nicki]

When I fly, it's one letter & one numba'
You wack hoes could get hot for one summa'
After that the Queen, I still reign here
I'm Santa Clause to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey Rick
I just gotta' toy, cost $850
Now I'm in the hood, niggas' is gettin' woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies
I'm a brand bitch, imma' brand
Go to Harlem and get Cam
It's dipset, get your dick wet
Boarded the big jet & gotta' big check
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winnin'
I'm on my Russel Simmons
Nicki denim
Nicki linen.

[Chorus]

I am your leader 
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick.

[Verse: 3 - Rick Ross]

Jealous niggas' is gossip
Watch me tie up my laces, (woah)
Bitches be jockin'
Tell by the look on they faces
8 digits I'm clockin'
A lot of gold in my bracelet 
7 figures on watches
I told my momma' i made it 
Made a deal for my project
Just give me $10 mil', I'm gravy
I went back to the projects
& $2 mil' in Mercedes
I get hit from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle
Just gave Rihanna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suit
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talkin' play-off seat
Know that boy busy ballin', I like to play all week
Monday Night with the Raw
I'm Vince McMahon with the beat
Power slammin' them hammers
I getchu' handle for free, so where the fuck is her manners?
She give me brain while I tweet.

[Chorus & End of Rick Ross' Verse]

Dm, In the DM, you CM
You fuck it, you love it
Mothafucka's on my dick
Suck it.

[Chorus]

I am your leader
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick.

[Verse: 4 - Cam'ron]

See the car is European
But got it imported from Tokyo
Lookin' like a shark
The nose, call it Pinnochio
Well off, wealthy, LV, logo
Middle of July but the wrists is on snowfloor
Only do the aspens, ya'll can have the Poconos
I'm sunny & you my sun
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip
Live with the pies, got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need a asprin
She said you're only Cameron
Girlfriend you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tamperin'
You're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl
Watch your manners
She run and tell her mother, I think I love him Nana
Because you sat up on my lap, Nah I ain't Santa
They call me p-piper
OJ no glove, I knife her
Never be a wifer
Why would I fight her? Don't even like her.

[Chorus: x2]

I am your leader
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick.---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey Lichte.
