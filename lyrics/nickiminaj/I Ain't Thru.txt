So aint nobody iller than me
and I aint being cocky Im just saying
its time for me to do me
time for me to live my life
and I aint worried bout yall
all you hating ass broads

with your hating ass fits
hating ass this
hating ass lips
so give me my elbow room
its time for me to come through
Im shining like my time,
Im shining like my purse
Im shining like my shoes
see Ive been here on my grind
doing mine and I aint through

[Chorus]
I aint through
Ima, Ima, Ima live it up
Ima, Ima, Ima do it up
I gotta live it
I aint through (I aint)
Ima, Ima, Ima live it up
Ima, Ima, Ima do it up
oh no

Im shining like my time,

Im shining like my shoes
