Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He can come inside, in my playpen
Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So I think that i'm going in for the taking
Heard through the grapevine that he caking
We could shoot a movie he could do the taping
Boom boom pow, this thing be shaking
I ain't even tryna find out who he dating

Cause I know he gotta wife at home,
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playing them g-g-games
I'mma runaway, I'mma runaway-ay-ay

I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
Cause he look like he modeling clothes in Dublin,
So I think that he gettin' that green-tha-goblin
Heard through the grapevine that he hang low
We could shoot a movie, could bang like Rambo
Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wonderin' if he could understand my lingo

Cause I know he gotta wife at home,
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playing them g-g-games
I'mma runaway, I'mma runaway-ay-ay

I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom

Boy i'm in this club, slow now
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you feeling me from the jump,
I wanna ride too
You got that hot sh-t
Boy ya blessed,
Let me feel up on your chest
Flexin', you the man, you the man, one hundred grand
The same power, Game down, guess I play it terribly
Come baby, let there, let me stay there
Lemme show you how I run, take-ya-to-my playground
Come and get this va va voom voom

I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it,
I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it,
you got that boom boom---Lyrics submitted by Milan Monroeal.
