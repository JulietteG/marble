Bitches they serious
 Yeah these bitches delirious
 All this bitches inferious
 I just pimp my interiors
 I just pick up and go
 Might pick up a hoe
 Might give conversations
 If you kick up the dough
 Never mind my money
 Never mind my stats
 Every bitch wanna be me
 You can find them in sacks
 Pink Friday two Milli
 Superbass triple plat
 When you see me on Ellen
 Just admit that I'm winning
 Do a show for Versace
 They request me by name
 And if they don't get Nicki
 It just won't be the same
 When I'm sitting with Anna
 I'm really sitting with Anna
 Aint a metaphor, punchline
 I'm really sittin with Anna
 Front row at Oscar De La Renta, posture
 Aint a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
 Put these bitches on lockout, where the fuck is your roster
 I pull up in that new new, marinara and pasta

[Chorus]

 Shake my head, yo I'm mad, aint a bitch in my zone
 In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
 Got the certification, cause it come with the stone
 But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 And my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone


7up went and gave, my commercial to Cee-Lo
 But dont tell 'em I said it, lets keep it on the d-low
 If you need you a look, just put me on your song
 But you know it'll cost, about 6 figures long
 But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets
 Flying spurs for hers means i'm fuckin above it
 And I just got a ghost and i'm callin it Casper
 But this shit is so cold it belong in Alaska
 Why da fuck i'm I stylin I competes with myself
 When u win against Nicki u depleted your wealth
 And i'm not masturbating but i'm feelin myself
 Paparazzi is waitin cuz them pictures would sell
 Yeah now dont you feel stupid yeah dats egg on your face
 If you wasn't so ugly i'd put my dick in your face
 Dick in your face put my dick in your face

[Chorus]

 Shake my head, yo I'm mad, aint a bitch in my zone
 In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
 Got the certification, cause it come with the stone
 But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 And my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

Oo-ooh dick in your face
 Oo-ooh dick in your face
 Oo-ooh dick in your face
 Put my dick in your face
 Put my dick in your face yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Lil Barbie.
