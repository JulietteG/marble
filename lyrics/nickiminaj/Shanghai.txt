[Hook]
On the real nigga, Im a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real nigga, Im a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
(Roll up on ya, r-r-roll up on ya)
(Roll up on ya, r-r-r-r-roll up on ya)

[Verse 1]
8 mil on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string
Aint fucking with you bitch niggas, and thats real rap but I do sing
Make room when I come by, aint speaking, Im dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, its a matter of time before one dies
Cause them dudes out and them twos out
All sixes like schools out
Niggas know if they talk slick that Im winter fresh
Theyll get chewed out
Cause them dudes out and them twos out
All sixes like schools out
Niggas know if they talk slick that Im winning fresh
Theyll get chewed out
Their shit aint regular rich, so they end up in a ditch
Im not a regular bitch, so when niggas see me, they jump on my dick
He not a regular shooter, so when you see me, salute her
Aint got a knife in my hand, but Im choppin it up with some niggas from Cuba

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ask Jay who he married, 80 thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie, got 'em aggy
These bitches is light-weight, Im always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate, cause we move work through that Tri-State
Cause them boys out, and them toys out
Still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time
Or that Mayweather like Floyds out
Cause them boys out, and them toys out
Still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time
Or that Mayweather like Floyds out
All of these bitches in pocket, Im bout to make a deposit
Tell em to go head and gossip, as long as your house is the size of my closet
Anybody I call, they picks up, even if they was gettin they dick sucked
These niggas dont make a mix-up, tell em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell em niggas go step they bricks up, (tell em niggas go step they bricks up)

[Hook]

[Outro]
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai, yeah
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
