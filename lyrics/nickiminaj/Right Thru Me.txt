You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 1]

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when Im lyin, know when I'm cryin
Its like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin, no you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin at you, and gettin at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin them at you
Why are you speakin when no one asks you?

[Chorus]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you?

[Verse 2]

What are we doin, could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki, and I say who me
And you say no you, and I say screw you
Then you start dressin, and you start leavin
And I start cryin, and I start screamin
The heavy breathin, but whats the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
Im actually frontin, Im asking you somethin, yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay youre right, just let it go
Okay you ride it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You can turn a freak ho to a cold
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

[Chorus]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you?

[Bridge]

Stop
Stop
Wont you just stop looking through me
Cause I cant take it
No, I cant take it

[Chorus]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

You see right through me
You see right through me, baby
You see right through me
You see right through me
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
STOP!
