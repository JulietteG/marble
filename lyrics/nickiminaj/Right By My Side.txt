(feat. Chris Brown)

It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I wont lie, Im feeling it
You dont know, Im missing it
Im so dumb, I must admit
Its too much to hold it in
I cant say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now
Gotta let you know how Im feeling
You own my heart he just renting
Dont turn away, pay attention
Im pouring out my heart oh boy

[Chorus]
I-I, Im not living life
Im not living right
Im not living if youre not by my side
oooh-ohhh

I-I, Im not living life
Im not living right
Im not living if youre not by my side
oooh-ohhh

[Chris Brown]
Lets meet at our favourite spot
You know the one, right around the block
From the nice place, that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Care to sit down, lets talk it out
One on one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand
Make you laugh again, I need to be near you
Gotta let you know how Im feeling
Own my heart, and she just renting
Don't walk away, pay attention
Im pouring out my heart girl

[Chorus (Nicki Minaj + Chris Brown)]

[Bridge]
I cant eat I-I-I-I
I cant sleep I-I-I
What I need I-I-I
Is you right by my side

I cant eat I-I-I-I
I cant sleep I-I-I-I
What I need I-I-I-I
Is you right by my side

It ain't your spit game, its your dick game
That got me walking round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue wit em when the Lakers on
Other than that Im getting my Marc Jacobs on
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
Cause he know that itd be a wrap
when Im riding it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone
Cause all them bitches is ratchet
And now let me get in my truck
Cause all them bitchesll catch it
Wait wait wait, damn there I go again
I be trippin, I be flippin, I be so belligerent
Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant
I dont even remember though I was probably hella bent

[Chorus]
