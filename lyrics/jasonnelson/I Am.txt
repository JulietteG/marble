I am the creator
I am the maker of the universe
I am the one who spoke into nothing
And all creation heard
I am He who has all power in my hands
And if you believe
On my word you can stand

I am healer
Mender of broken hearts
I am Alpha Omega
Your destiny and where you start
I am the one who does impossible things
Thats who I am
Just let me be who I am for you

I am the one who sees a need
And always provides
I am the one whose name is a tower
Where you can run and hide
I am He who has all power in my hands
And if you believe
On my word you can stand---
