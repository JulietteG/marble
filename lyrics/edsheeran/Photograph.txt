Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
Its the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And its the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby, therell be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can keep me
Inside the necklace you bought when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby, therell be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go

When Im going, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home---
