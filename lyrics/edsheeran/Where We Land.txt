Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When Im next to you

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I cant make up my mind
So lets freefall
See where we land

Its been this way since we were young
Well fight and then make up
Ill breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I cant make up my mind
So lets freefall
And see where we land---
