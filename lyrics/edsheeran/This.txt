This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
And you are the one that make me loose it all
And you are the start of something new, ooh

And I'll throw it all away
And watch you fall
Into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
But watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing, hmmm

And I thrown it all away
And watched you fall, into his arms again
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now

And take me back
And take me home
And watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back, for...

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new---Lyrics submitted by jordan abbott.
