When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go

Well I know there can come fire from the sky
Till we find the purest of kings
Even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, Im just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

The seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And the hunger more profound

Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, Im just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain

And the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
Oh, no no, never reach the poor

And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
Fill the sky with all they can drop
When its time to make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain---
