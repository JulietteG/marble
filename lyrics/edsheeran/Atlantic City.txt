Well, they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
And they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk, they're gettin' ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gamblin' commissions hangin' on by the skin of their teeth

Now baby, everything dies baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies, someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

And baby, everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
But with you forever I'll stay
Goin' out to where the sands turn into gold
So put on your stockin's babe, 'cause the nights gettin' cold
Everything dies, maybe that's a fact
Maybe everything that dies someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job, but it's been hard to find
Down here, there's only winners and losers
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey, last night I met this guy
And I'm gonna do a little favor for him

Baby, everything dies, that's a fact
Maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City---
