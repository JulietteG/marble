Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, hello, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush, I say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

Cos you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all 
You need me.

I sing, I write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Dont need another wordsmith to make the tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last, if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

Cos you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me.

Cos with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right, I wont stop till my name is in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice, on red carpets, now Im on Arabian nights
Because Im young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and Im going hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
Yeah, the games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up, Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when Im singing them out
From day one, Ive been prepared, with VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cos its another day, plus I keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean-cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me, Im still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
Im still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say Im up-and-coming like Im fucking in an elevator

Cos you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all 
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I dont need you.---Lyrics submitted by Hayley Horan.
