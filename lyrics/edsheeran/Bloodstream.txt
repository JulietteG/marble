I've been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sin on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How to get so faded
How to get so faded

Oh no no, don't leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh, color crimsing in my eyes
Wanted to free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burning in my bloodstream

Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burning in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
So tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a love
Thought I'd find it really boring
God make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon her broken heart

Oh no no, don't leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh, color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burning in my bloodstream

Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burning in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
So Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart---
