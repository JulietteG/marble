If we take this bird in
With its broken leg 
We could nurse it
She said

Come inside
For a little lie down
With me 

If you fall asleep
It wouldn't be the 
Worst thing

But when I wake up
Your make-up 
Is on my shoulder

And tell me if I lie down
Would you stay now 
And let me hold you

Chorus:
But if I kiss you
Will your mouth breath 
This truth 
Darling how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do

And its not complete, yet
Mustn't get our feet, wet
Cos that leads to, regret
Diving in too soon

And i owe it all to you
My little bird...
My little bird

If we take a walk out
In the morning dew
We could lay down
So I'm next to you

Come inside for 
A little homemade tea
If you fall asleep then
At least your next to me

If I wake up
You see its late love
Get back to sleep

I'm covered by nature
And I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree
With you beside me

Chorus:
But if I kiss you
Will your mouth breath 
This truth 
Darling how i miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do

And its not complete, yet
Mustn't get our feet, wet
Cos that leads to, regret
Diving in too soon

And i owe it all to you
My little bird [4x]

Bridge:
And all of these things 
I'm sure of
I'm not quite certain
Of your love

And you made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With it's broken leg to die

Chorus:
But if I kiss you
Will your mouth breath 
This truth 
Darling how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do

And it's not complete, yet
Mustn't get our feet, wet
Cos that leads to, regret
Diving in too soon

And I owe it all to you
My little bird [4x]---Lyrics submitted by brianna roan.
