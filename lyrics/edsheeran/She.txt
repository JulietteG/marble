I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That Id never leave her
Now Im ready to go
And strange as it seems
Shes endless to me
Shes just like paperwork
But harder to read

Patience, my enemy
And lovings my friend
Its harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasnt sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time
I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me
For dear life
And blocking my way

Patience, my enemy
And lovings my friend
Its harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
Wont you stay?
She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
Ill stay, anyway
Cos she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself---
