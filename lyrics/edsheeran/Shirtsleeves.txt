I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
Well be sinking in
So Ill learn to swim in the oceans you made
Ill hold ya
And youll think of him
And pretty soon you will be floating away
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat love
And Im captain of the skinning boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirt sleeve under your eye
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve under your eyes
Your eyes

I still taste old water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And Ill drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you
These cuffs are covered in your make up
Ill never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And Ill hold onto the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat love
And Im captain of the sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve under your eyes
Your eyes
Your lips
Your mouth
Your thighs
Your back
You drive me wild
Tonight the fact is Im
Im on the way home
Im on the way home
I lied I tried to cry but Im
Im drowning in the oceans you made

When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve under your eye
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve under your eyes
Your eyes---
