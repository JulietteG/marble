I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you be a part time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used lay
And re stacks is what the speakers played
Id be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath
Wed use each others air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
Wed go anywhere our minds would take us
And Id say you were beautiful without your make up
And you dont need even to worry about your weight cos
We can all be loved the way that god made us
At times the only reason that we could break up
Cos you would always tell me I was away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
So say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
Cos I aint ever coming home Nina
Oh wont you leave me now
And Ive been livin on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cos thats you and me both Nina
Oh wont you leave me now

And every weekend in the winter youd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where wed eat on our own
Cos every day when I was away wed only speak on the phone
Watching blue planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we was two rabbits
And then youd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
Id disappear, youd call me selfish
I understand but I cant help
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But youll be in between forever so I guess well have to take a step back
Overlook the situation cos mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And Im not saying we should be taking a break
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and its too late
So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane
But in a day wed have to say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
Cos I aint ever coming home Nina
Oh wont you leave me now
And Ive been livin on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cos thats you and me both Nina
Oh wont you leave me now

Love will come and love will go
But you cant make it on your own
Sing that song
Go oh wont you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you cant mend your broken heart
Take it back go oh wont you leave me now

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
Cos I aint ever coming home Nina
Oh wont you leave me now
And ive been livin on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cos thats you and me both Nina
Oh wont you leave me now---
