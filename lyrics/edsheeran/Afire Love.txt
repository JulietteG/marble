Things were all good yesterday 
And then the devil took your memory 
And if you fell to your death today 
I hope that heaven is your resting place 
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain 
But then that could have been the medicine 
And now youre lying in the bed again 
Either way Ill cry with the rest of them. 

And my father told me, Son, 
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face, 
And youre not the only one. 
Although my grandma used to say, that he used to say 

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night 
And the lie inside for a little while he wrote 
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up 
And were wrapped in light, in life, in love. 
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut 
For theyre designed to be together oh 
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one 
And were set alight, were afire love, love, love oh. 

Things were all good yesterday 
Then the devil took your breath away 
And now were left here in the pain 
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain 
And now my family is one again 
Stapled together but the strangers never friend. 
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen 
Six years old I remember when. 

My father told me, Son, 
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face, 
And youre not the only one. 
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say 

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night 
And the lie inside for a little while he wrote 
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up 
And were wrapped in light, in life, in love. 
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut 
For theyre designed to be together oh 
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one 
And were set alight, were afire love, love, love oh 

And my father and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah 
And my mother and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah 
And my mother and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah 
And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah 
And my father and all of my family 
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah---
