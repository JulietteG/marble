Oh Im a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I cant work it out
How going through the motions
Going through us
And oh Ive known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my own words
Are all over written on the signs
But youre on my road
Walking me home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe Im a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I cant shake this feeling now
Were going through the motions
Hoping youd stop

And ohhh Ive only caused you pain
I know but all of my words will always below
Of all the love you spoke
When youre on my road
Walking me home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe Im a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

And for how long, I love, my lover
I feel love M---
