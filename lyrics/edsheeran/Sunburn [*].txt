Youre not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, Im searching for what used to be mine

And I saw your eyes
And I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things arent clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers and all thats in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things arent clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss you

Dont drop me in
Its not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scarred and left me
Like a sunburn

Dont drop me in
Its not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss you ---Lyrics submitted by Olivia.
