Its late in the evening
Glass on the side now
Ive been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I dont wanna know
If youre getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-mans land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Louder!
Sing!

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local rage no
I dont really know what Im supposed to say but I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said its nice to meet ya and then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know shes a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, Im in deep
If anybody finds out Im meant to drive home but Im drunk and gonna live it now not?
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now shes kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Louder!
Sing!

Can you feel it? All the guys in here dont really wanna dance
Can you feel it? All that I can here is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so hoped you taked my hand

Before the beats kicks in again
can you feel it?
can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe---
