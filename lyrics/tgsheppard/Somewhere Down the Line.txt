I know who you belong to, From the way that he holds you
But I'm getting the feeling, That you could be mine
Now is not the time or the place, And there's no telling when
From the look that you gave to me, Were sure to meet again

Some other place, Some other time
We will be together, Somewhere down the line

There's no use in pretending, How this night will be ending
You'll be leaving together, I'll go home alone
But my heart tell me that someday soon, That will make up for the time we lose
You'll be waiting in the dark somewhere, For a love that you can't resist

Some other place, Some other time
We will be together, Somewhere down the line

Somewhere down the line, It's just a matter of time
I'm gonna make you mine, Somewhere down the line

Some other place, Some other time
We will be together, Somewhere down the line

Some other place, Oh some other time
We will be together, Somewhere down the line---Lyrics submitted by Bryan.
