Stop and just breath a little
Let it go, go, breath a little
Just let it, let it, Let it breath a little
STOP! and just let it breath a little
Let it, Let it, Let it breath

My train just pass
So as I wait for another, uh
This is the rhyme that I uttered
See it's more than having the world in my hands
It's like the galaxy spread across the keys of this baby grand
So as we expand together for better or worse
I create music for the You and I verse
Seems like a blessing but it's also a curse
When I'm deep in depression is a time that it works
My best material is written when everything's pi-vi-tal, each thought is cri-ti-cal
It's like the tears on from eyes
Rains on the pain it becomes a lubrication for the thoughts in my brain

Stop! and just breath a little

Let it go, go, breath a little
Just let it, let it, Let it breath a little
STOP! and just let it breath a little
Let it, Let it, Let it breath a little, Uh
Just let it breath a little
Let it, let it flow, let it breath a little, just uh
Just let it breath a little
Let it, let it, let it breath

Stop! and just breath a little

Just make sure everything's alright
You nearly missed your flight
But I hope we meet toni-i-ight
Now I'm chillin' in this club with bad deception
Trying to text directions to my heart
So she can come and we can dance and then get down
Down, baby girl let's get down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Let's Get Down
Down, baby girl let's get down
Down, down, down, down
Stop! and just breath a little, DOWN
Down, baby girl let's get down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Let's Get Down
Down, baby girl let's get down
Down, down, down, down
Stop! and just breath a little!

Finish!---Lyrics submitted by Kamyab Tizro.
