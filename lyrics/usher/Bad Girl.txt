Sho Nuff
Shawty, what it do
Yeah, ooh now, pimpin', oh boy

What y'all know about a supermodel?
Fresh out of Elle magazine
Buy her own bottles
Look, pimp juice, I need me one
Bad little mother
I hear you saying
I need a bad girl
Let me hear you
If you're a bad girl

Players, when you see me
Act like you know me
I keep a dollar worth of dimes
You know pimpin' ain't easy
For all my chicks in the club
Who knows how to cut a rug
If you're a bad girl
Get at me, bad girl

Ooh, work me, baby
Shakin' it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl
Say yeah
Get at me, bad girl
What sexy lady is
Coming home with me tonight?
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl
Super bad, baby
Get at me, bad girl

Now I've seen a lot of broads
All on one accord
Every one looked the same
But take a look at my dame (my dame)
For sure, she take that Hypnotic or Alize
There ain't much more I can say
But I need a girl
If you're a bad girl

Got one thou' on the bar, now
Chick need a drink on the floor, now
Look at them bad girls movin' it
Making faces while they doin' it
Ah, I want to take one to the restroom
So close I'm smelling like your perfume
If you're a bad girl
Get at me, bad girl

I'mma get me one of them (ohh)
Get me one of them
Get me one of them (one of them)
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh
Get at me, bad girl
I'mma get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them (maybe two or three)
Get me one of them (it's cool with me)
Oh oh oh oh oh (I need a bad girl)
Get at me, bad girl

If you want to party
I got what you're looking for
Come see me in the V.I.P. (For bad company)
It's very necessary
To be that kind of girl for me
If you are, then baby girl, let's leave

Ooh, work me baby (Oh, work me, baby)
Shakin' it the way I like (Ooh, shake it, baby)
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl
Say yeah
Get at me, bad girl (Oh, what sexy lady)
What sexy lady is
Coming home with me tonight?
I'm ready to be bad (to be bad)
I need a bad girl
Super bad, baby (ooh, bad girl)
Get at me, bad girl

I'mma get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them (one of them)
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh
Get at me, bad girl
I'mma get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Get me one of them
Oh oh oh oh oh
Get at me, bad girl
Calling all girls, around the world
Yeah, get bad, if you're out there
I wanna see you, if you hear me
Get at me, bad girl
Calling all girls, around the world
Yeah, stay bad, if you're out there
I wanna see you, if you hear me
Get at me, bad girl---
