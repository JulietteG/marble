[Intro]
Do u luv me
[Oh oh]
Unconditionally
[Oh oh]
Say me ull neva leave me
[Oh oh]
Or run away
[Oh oh]
But I have a confession

[Chorus]
Everything that iv been doin is all bad
I got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride
Iv been tellin u so many lies
Aint no good it's all bad
I just wanna confess
It's been goin on so long
Girl I been doin u so wrong
And I want u 2 kno that
[X2]

Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend
Everytime you called I told you,
"Baby I'm workin." (No! )
I was out doin my dirt (Oh! )
Wouldn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (Just listen)
Actin like I didn't leave you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
Bet you probly believe you got a good man
I man that never would do the things I'mma 'bout to tell you I've done
Brace yourself
It ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else (oh no)

[Chorus]
[X2]

If I could turn back the hands of time n start all ova I would
Instead of everything bein all bad
Baby everythin would be all good
I dnt wanna lose u
But I kno when tellin u aint make u wanna stay
U probly just wanna run away
I'm mad enough 2 punch me in my face
I'm been livin like an idiot
N I deserve it every bit of it
I kno
2day is the day when I end up lyin in the bullshit girl
I'm sorry
Baby
I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around wit this stress on my chest
I confess

[Chorus]
