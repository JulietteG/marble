This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna

Leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything came between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run an talk to when me and my
Girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I come home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you and how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna

Leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Now what's bad, is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do, should I
Tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna

Leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go
And if she may not understand it why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it but the feelings just to strong

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
Come along with
You make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna

Leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna

Leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do---
