Hey x4

Watch me on the dance floor
I love the spotlight
listen to The people screaming out more, more
cuz I create the feeling that keep em coming back, uh yeah
cuz I create the feeling that keep em coming back 
so captivating when I get on the floor

well you're impatiently waiting
I know you need me I can feel it
I'm a beast I'm an animal
I'm that monster in the mirror

the headliner, finisher, 
I'm the closer winner,
best when under pressure,seconds left, pressure on,

Chorus: 

If you really want more,
scream it out louder, 
if you're on the floor, 
bring out the fire,
and line it up, 
take it up higher, 
push it to the limit more!

Repeat chorus

get off your hands
put them I'm the air
if you want more, more
cuz I can create the feeling

I go hard, can't stop, 
but if I stop
just know that Ima bring it back
never quit don't believe in that

well you're impatiently waiting 
I know you need me I can feel it
I'm a beast I'm an animal
I'm that monster in the mirror
the headliner, finisher,
I'm the closer winner, 
best when under pressure 
seconds left, 
pressure on,

chorus x2

ohoh ohoh ohoh (x3)

push it to the limit more 

ohoh ohoh ohoh (x3)

push it to the limit more

chorus (x2)

oh oh oh (x3)

push it to he limit more!

DONE
