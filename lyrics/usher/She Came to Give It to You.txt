(feat. Nicki Minaj)

Said it aint what you do cause
(Everybody knows what's up cause everybody wanna get next to me)
Said if you do what I do, shell be yours tonight
Imagine she cant get a getaway
Well she dont want nobody crowding her space
Wouldnt that be weird? Aw yeah
She was up tonight to get down
But she dont wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldnt that be weird? Aw yeah

So confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do its what you do tonight
And there aint no shortcut to doing something right
Said if you do what I do, shell be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz and have a good time

So many benefits to to being wild, just be cool enjoy the ride
Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldnt that be weird? Yeah
Dont be stingy with it pass the J, when I hit it this headache go away
Yeah thats weird

So confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do its what you do tonight
And there aint no shortcut to doing something right
Said if you do what I do, shell be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz and have a good time

Yo, he want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl
You know who, get the worm it's the early bird
Flow, slicker than MJ, early curl
I got to clip these niggas like Sterly Sterl
I seen him in the club, he could get the cub
I ain't talking about baseball but go get the glove
Don't be like OJ and forget your glove
I'm tryna get faded, nigga go and get the drugs
Five plus five what they call that? Ten
Out in Japan we be counting that, Yen
Ladies who you trying to get it popping with? Men
No little boys in the circle of Usher
Got'em under pressure
When your girl come through, Nicki gone crush her
And tell your man play the back like a spine
He only last six seconds like a Vine

So confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do its what you do tonight
And there aint no shortcut to doing something right
Said if you do what I do, shell be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz and have a good time

Yo, I am Nicki M and he is Usher
All these niggas be tryna cuff her
What you know about that Swiffer duster
Until next time you motherfucker
