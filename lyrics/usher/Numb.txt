They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill only makes you stronger
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is alone, lone, lone, lone

Time, some things never change here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, then you go I don't care
If it bothers go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

I can feel you now

Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well is that really insanity
Or just a losers' game
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
Cause forever is alone, lone, lone, lone

Time, some things never change here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, then you go I don't care
If it bothers go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb

I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now

But you can't feel it do ya?

Shake it off, then you go I don't care anymore

I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now

Can you feel it?---
