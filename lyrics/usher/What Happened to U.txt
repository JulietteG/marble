When you give it up, you get it on
What happened to you yeah
From the beginning to where I was getting
But I was with it, and I'll admit that
She was clear it was a kinda thing
It wouldn't be easy for me to let it go
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time
I got a head someone got left behind
The world is yours, your sign is that aligned
And in no time, I hear, money clouds fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fainted cause I miss you
Give me your bag
But the issue this we can get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
Cause I miss you, give me your bag
What happened to you
What happened to you

Did what I wanted, freaked out the honies
I stayed only mine, mine was on the money
Pack whatever, whenever hot tub forever
Black young and clever

When you give it up, you get it on
Love would be the only reason to look back
And when you turn it on, you can't turn it on
But picture me complaining the notice
Money clouds fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fainted cause I miss you
Give me your bag
But the issue this we can get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
Cause I miss you, give me your bag
What happened to you
What happened to you

What sense does it make to have everything and nothing
At the same time...
Where are you
I need you, yeah
I'm looking for you, girl, come and share all these

Money clouds fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fainted cause I miss you
Give me your bag
But the issue this we can get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
Cause I miss you, give me your bag
What happened to you
What happened to you

I'm happy for you, wherever you are ---
