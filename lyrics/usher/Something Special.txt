Oh, yeah yeah yeah

This ones for the lovers, follow me

Clearly this is new for me
I get excided when you hear my dear
Make no mistake you are all I see sugar
My visions never been so clear
We both know that I've been running so long
This time love won't let me leave
Please be patient, hesitation aside
We're almost where we need to be
But in the mean time let me say what's on my mind

Baby I think we've got something special
Girl you and me together will take over the world
You know I love you
I need your soul
So happy I just want to let everybody know
We're never scared to let it show
Having too much fun with this and that or what
Somewhere allong on the way
Everything fell in place

I'm so proud how you represent me baby
Better rock in the money
Dolce&Gabbana;, Roberto Cavalli Louis or Gucci girl
No matter what you wear you do your own with it
I feel the same years from year
But in the mean time let me say what's on my mind

Baby I think we've got something special
Girl you and me together will take over the world
You know I love you
I need your soul
So happy I just want to let everybody know
That I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together will take over the world
You know I love you
I need your soul
So happy I just want to let everybody know
Know I need you baby (I love you)

Somewhere allong on the way everything fell in place
I think we got something special
Girl you and me will take over the world
You know I love you
I need your soul
So happy I just want to let everybody know
That I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together will take over the world
You know I love you
Girl, I need your soul
I'll never ever let you go, no

You're so special---Lyrics submitted by martaysha.
