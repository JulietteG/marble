how you work it baby?(yeah)
I love the way that you be poking it out

so please believe we gone be twirking it out 
by the end of the night

waiting all day, to wrap my hands
around your waist 
and kiss your face 
wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
not even for a minute 
and ill sit here long as it takes
to get you all alone
but as soon as you come walking my way

I get the chills whenever i see your face
and you in the place girl

and i get a taste girl
no need to creep cause baby I ain't ashame
of calling your name girl


I waited all day,to wrap my hands 
around your waist 
and kiss your face
wouldn't trade this  feeling for nothing 
not even for a minute
and ill sit here long as it takes
to get you all alone
but as soon as you come walking my way

  **Chorus**


And girl I feel like it's our first time
ever time we get together 
baby loving you feels better 
anything, anything
with all my heart, you won't need a ring and i promise our time away , wont change my love
