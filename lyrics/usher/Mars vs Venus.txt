Your eyes, say it all, all
They're fixed upon an object of desire
You can't control
No
But gravity compels you to ignite and explode
Oh
'Til our time and space combine you fantisize
The unknown
Oh

Girl, it's taken off the ground, you know how I put it down 
Have you seeing stars, Baby
This is the big bang, so unpredictable 
Sex, love and find out whose in control 
Mars vs Venus
When the worlds collide
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire 
Sex, love and find out who can tame desire 
Mars vs Venus 

Seduce and analyze, yeah
Objective is to conquer deep inside
Make paradise

Girl, it's taken off the ground, you know how I put it down 
Have you seeing stars, Baby
This is the big bang, so unpredictable 
Sex, love and find out whose in control 
Mars vs Venus
When the worlds collide
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire 
Sex, love and find out who can tame desire 
Mars vs Venus 
x2

Pitch black, tossed amidst the galaxy between the sheets
Want that only you and I
Generate when we collide
Oh that, don't make my emotions peak
If I let go then I'll be weak
Your control is my defeat
I repeat
Never, never, never, never
Will I give up? No, no, no, no

This is the big bang, so unpredictable 
Sex, love and find out whose in control 
Mars vs Venus
When the worlds collide,
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire 
Sex, love and find out who can tame desire 
Mars vs Venus
