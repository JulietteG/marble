Yes step down in town again
you think about me now and then
been missing my love a friend
let's say we have a 2nd round again

Girls it's been a while
so I thought I hit you up
you never love for mine
let's stick it up on the left doors
the last time I love you ..baby
so let me feel you up
guess been a minute
I know you miss the way we touch
you can think about you don't want it
you don't wanna come across to..
come see the light for a second

Chorus:
Girl I'm in your town, come over
girl don't let me down I wanna be for long
should you ..the time want it for remember
girl you mean your best respect unless girl

Said you wouldn't but you did it, oh girl
I can tell you regret it 'cause you ain't been touch like this
says the last time

..every time we can dance, oh daddy
who else cares, let em out, but I'll be back around
baby you can think around if you want to
but I gotta be have ..
..be ready for a second round

Chorus:
Girl I'm in your town, come over
girl don't let me down I wanna be for long
should you ..the time want it for remember
girl you mean your best respect unless girl


Yes step down in town again
you think about me now and then
been missing my love a friend
let's say we have a 2nd round again
