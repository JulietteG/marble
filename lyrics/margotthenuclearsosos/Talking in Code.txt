I gatta' go
and you're talking in code
said 'I know where you've been
and I know where you go"

but I've been tired
from the minute I woke
I stopped listening
the moment you spoke
and said "I'm long gone
yeah I'm long gone"

and I'm sleeping alone
in a house I don't own
cause if you're touring your mind
you'll get lost every time

you'll sing me sad songs
to keep me awake
in that bedroom
where we hid away
baby im long gone
yeah im long gone

and your voice cracked
like a piano
you keep moving
where are you going?
baby we're long gone
yeah we're long gone---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina Sue.
