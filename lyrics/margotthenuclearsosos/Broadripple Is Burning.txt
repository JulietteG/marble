Children broad ripple is burning
and the girls are getting sick
of huffin glue up in the bathroom 
while your boyfriends pick up chicks

and darling I'm lost
I heard you whispering 
that night in the fountain square
the trash filled streets
made me wish we were headed home

and there was love inside the basement
where that women used to lie
in a sleeping bag we shared upon 
the floor most every night
and darling I'm drunk

and everything that i have loved
has turn to stone
so pack your bags, and come back home

and I'm wasted, you can taste it
don't look at me that way
cause ill be hanging, from rope
I will haunt you like a ghost

If my woman was a fire
she'd burn out before i awake
and be replaced by pints of whiskey,
cigarettes and outer space

then somebody moves
and everything you thought you had was gone to shit
we've got a lot, don't ever forget that

and I wrote this on an airplane
where the people looked like ants
and where the woman that you loved was gone
she was bound in east Japan

don't fucking move
'cause everything you thought you had will go to shit
we've got a lot, don't you dare forget that

and I'm wasted, you can taste it
don't look at me that way
'cause ill be hanging from rope
I will haunt you like a ghost

and I'm wasted, you can taste it
don't look at me that way
'cause ill be hanging from rope
I will haunt you like a ghost---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina Sue.
