I remember hoop pants
Man mama could dance
Spinning like a Spanish guy
Burnin like a sweet Banshee

When I was a boy
Didn't have me no toy
Played my daddy's guitar
Until my fingers turned green
Cause my daddy played the guitar and my mama was a disco queen

And I grew up in the city
Didn't need to read no magazines
Been in too many fights
Too many bars
Did too many drugs
Left too many scars
Daddy played the guitar and mama was a disco queen

Dance mama
Well I came from Queens
The land of the Mets
Went to Flushing high school
smokin menthol cigarettes

Fought in gang fights
With all of my clan
Throwing bricks down from the roof tryin to kill the man
Didn't look for trouble
But I was always to blame
Guess bad trouble was my middle name
Now I play my funky blues in all of the bars
Singing my songs while I play the guitar

But I can't help thinkin bout the days behind
All the brothers that are gone that are blowin my mind
Like Taco, Tony and Joey D
Any one of them mutha fuckers sho coulda been me

I remember my own mama
Dancing in the breeze
And my daddy playing guitar
While I sat on his knee

I play it for money
I play it for women
For Jimmy, for Abba
Yeah it might sound silly
But when mama would dance and daddy would strum
I even knew back then what I had to become

And it may sound funny to somebody else
I play it cause I have to, I play it for myself
I play it cause I ain't got nothing to lose
That's how a white boy got the blues

Daddy played the guitar and mama was a disco queen
Daddy played the guitar and mama was a disco queen
Daddy played the guitar and mama was a disco queen
Daddy played the guitar and mama was a disco queen
