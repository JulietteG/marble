My brother saw them fighting in the kitchen late one Sunday evening 
He was peeking through a hole the door 
My mother she was furious and screaming
He explained, but she wouldn't believe it
"Good parents never give you more than a flash in the forest" 

All we got was a flash in the forest (all that he got was a flash in the forest) 
All we got was a flash in the forest tonight (a flash in the forest)
All we got was a flash in the forest (all that he got was a flash in the forest) 
All we got was a flash in the forest tonight
A flash in the forest (a flash in the forest)
A flash in the forest tonight

He says digits and facts you can't believe in,
Says the politician to the television "There's simply no way this can be wrong" 
Now the opposition says he makes mistakes and that he couldn't be further from the truth, man
It's impossible to see further beyond than a flash in the forest

We want more than a flash in the forest (all we got is a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest tonight (a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest (all we got is a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest tonight
A flash in the forest (a flash in the forest)
A flash in the forest that night.

We want more than a flash in the forest (we want more than a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest tonight (a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest (we want more than a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest tonight (a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest (we want more than a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest tonight (a flash in the forest)

We want more than a flash in the forest (we want more than a flash in the forest)
We want more than a flash in the forest that night.---Lyrics submitted by val achebe.
