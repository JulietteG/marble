The zebra, hunting for tigers,
tigers from Pluto, a spirit that burns

The future, unwilling to guide us,
guide us to love, so, the pattern returns

I'm just hoping for the morning sun
To shine on someone who won't make me feel wrong

Another night in the jungle
A jungle that echoes, my twosome-less life

Why bother, I know that you like me
Like me to death, so, just hand me the knife

I'm just hoping for the morning sun
To shine on someone who won't make me feel wrong (x4)

I'm just hoping for the morning sun, 
The morning sun who won't make me feel wrong---Lyrics submitted by Regan Cannon.
