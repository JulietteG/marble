This is harder then I thought it would be
Being there in my prozac dreams
Saw your beauty and I kept in mind
Imagine your smell and touch
Imagine all of us

I'm sure we want to find our place
We're alone inside - that'll never change

Grinnin', duckin' and runnin' time
Fill in the blanks
For what it's worth
Fouled up beyond all repair
I could of course be wrong
I could of course be blind

I'm sure we want to find our place
We're alone inside - that'll never change

(Guitar solo...)

I'm sure we want to find our place
We're alone inside - that'll never change

This is harder then I thought it would be
I'm still here in my prozac dreams
Seeing your beauty
Keeping all in mind
No chance to survive
My Love
Goodbye

(Guitar solo til the end...)---Lyrics submitted by Seb.
