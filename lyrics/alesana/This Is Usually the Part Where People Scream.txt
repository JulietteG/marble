You'll beat me? Bring it on, bring it on 
You're gonna save the day? Bring it on, bring it on 
You Ready? Bring it on I'll show you another thing or two 
You may think you're clever, but you're not 
You better get the coffins out Trust me kid that's where you're sleeping tonight 
There's no guarantee we'll get out alive 
Stop your whining, let's get busy 
Baby, its time to lock and load 
Stop your whining, let's get busy

(Chorus)
Welcome to the show 
It's a story that you've heard a thousand times 
So take a seat and get lost with me 
This tale will never stop being told 
Welcome to the show 
Its a chance to save the world or lose the girl 
Let's save the world 
Heroes will save the day 

You may think you've won, but I promise you it's not over 
This could be our one last chance to finally rise up 
So here we stand and here we will fight 
None of us shall run 
from anyone 
Storms are gathering 
There's no guarantee we'll get out alive 
Stop your whining, let's get busy 
We have to rise above and fight 
We'll be heroes 

(Chorus)

This is the part where you are supposed to scream x3
When you scream, we'll be heroes 

(Chorus)

Let's save the world 
Heroes will save the day 
Let's save the world Heroes will always save the day---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
