I welcome you to paradise!
Its what you wished for
A mountain of filth haunted by tortured shrieks of the dead!
I know youll love it here!

Time stops and once again Im stranded nowhere
And yet again Im so confused
Why stop?
It honestly cant get much worse and Im better off here than on my own

Step right up, come one and all!
I will be your host tonight!
Welcome to the dreams of hell!
Youre in for a wild ride!

Its strange but I feel right at home
Its odd but I dont want to go
Am I a fool? Am I crazy to want to stay? Do I belong?
Another time, another place? This will do just fine

Foolish mortal, what did you think?
That youd shackle the hands of time?
And defeat the Gods themselves?
Sweet vanity youre my favorite sin!
Swallow mountains and choke on them
Then drown yourself on Lazarus
Spread your wings and grab the sun
Sweet vanity youre my favorite sin!

Pretty lady lets dance!
I bet you thought that you could choose to leave?
Everybody is dead!
Youre all alone and Im the one, the only one! Yea!

Ill do whatever it takes
Oh, whats another mistake

Back and forth and upside down as we laugh ourselves to sleep
Were trying to escape
An evil place so full of wonder taking a hold of me...

Feeling the pressure, I should be over you
Slave to the pleasure, I cant get over you
Tonight well try to pretend that were alright, yea
Say its forever, dont let me fade away

Everythings gone, everythings lost
What have I done? Can it be undone?
Where did you go? Will I find you?
This is our home, sweet home. The canvas went up in flames

Pretty lady lets dance!
I bet you thought that you could choose to leave?
Everybody is dead!
Youre all alone and Im the one, the only one! Yea!

Ill do whatever it takes
Oh, whats another mistake

Back and forth and upside down as we laugh ourselves to sleep
Were trying to escape
An evil place so full of wonder taking a hold of me...

Feeling the pressure, I should be over you
Slave to the pleasure, I cant get over you
Tonight well try to pretend that were alright, yea
Say its forever, dont let me fade away
Im everything you want, Im everything you need
Youre everything to me, dont let me fade away

Foolish mortal, what did you think?
That youd shackle the hands of time?
And defeat the Gods themselves?
Sweet vanity youre my favorite sin!
Swallow mountains and choke on them
Then drown yourself on Lazarus
Spread your wings and grab the sun
Sweet vanity youre my favorite sin!

Parting is such sweet sorrow
Come back to me soon my dear
I will be counting the days
Farewell my love
This is our home, sweet home
Drench yourself in the cries of the damned!
Spill their blood!
Bathe in bliss as we torture the sane!
Help me, God!---
