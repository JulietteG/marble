Remember why youre here

Fall for me
Lay yourself before the demon
Spread your legs, bite your lip, meet his eye
Drooling, engorged, wide eyed, shaking, youve got him
Dont fall for me
Dont relent invite him to you
Guide his hand, take his breath, consume him
Gasping, lusting, weakened, frozen, youve won
If you should peek beneath the veil
Dont be surprised to find me there

Im ashamed, a victim of the curse

I think I like the fight
Wrong feels so right, baby
Im flirting with lunacy
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession

Please dont forget who he is, my Bel.
A monster who enjoys the fear
Never forget what he is, my Bel
A monster who designed the fear

Listen to me, keep your focus
Your one true love waits in anguish

Lick your lips as the sweat drips down
and taste the torture as you crawl, begging for more, yea!

Im ashamed, a victim of the curse

I think I like the fight
Wrong feels so right, baby
Im flirting with lunacy
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession

Remember why youre here

Im ashamed, a victim of the curse

I think I like the fight
Wrong feels so right, baby
Im flirting with lunacy
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession---
