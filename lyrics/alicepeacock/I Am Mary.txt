I am Mary

I am Mary.
I was pretty. 
You may remember me 
from the ninth grade. 
The boys would hold me
and my friends told me
the world would know me
someday.

Well, I made choices.
Heard some voices.
Fought the battles,
inside my head.
Lifes a fabric 
but when I grab it
all I got was
a hand full of thread.

There is a stairwell
that, I know so well, 
the sick its gone out on the street.
A crumbled dollar 
to start a fire,
so that I could warm my feet.

Police stations, investigations
of a fire, 
burning bright.
They show me pictures, 
of those children, 
and told me, 
I was there that night.

Ohooooooo             ohohooooo

Conversations
and medications, 
and all my friends
have left me now.
No one could see them, 
but now I need them,
to help me figure
all this out.
Why do they feed me 
and give me tv
and the blanket 
for my feet? 
But somethings working,
cause it starts hurtin 
when it all comes back to me.

Ohooooooo           ohohooooo

I am Mary.
I was pretty.
You may remember me 
from the ninth grade.
The boys would hold me
and my friends told me, 
the world would know me
someday---Lyrics submitted by lisa.
