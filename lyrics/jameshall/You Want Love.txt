You want love
You don't know what it means
All you know is that you need someone to hold, and to hold you

You want love
Did you think that love would find you?
Come and break those chains that bind your heart and soul and make you whole?

You want love x4

You want love
You don't know what it is
All you know is that you meet someone and then they take you home

You want love
But it's love that you're afraid of
Did you think that you were made of stone and find out you were wrong?

You want love x4

Is it destiny, is it blind love?
Or a bullet through your heart?
It's a sad disease, it divides us
And keeps us all apart

[La La La]

You want love x11---Lyrics submitted by Anastasia.
