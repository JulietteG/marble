I want to live so,
that God can use me

Sopranos: 
Any Time
Any where

Yes, A vessel of honor
Sanctified for, for your use

I want to live so,
that God can use me

Sopranos: 
Any Time

Altos & Tenors:
Any Time

Sopranos:
Any where

Altos & Tenors:
Any Where

Yes, A vessel of honor
Sanctified for, for your use

Use me
Sopranos: Lord
Altos: Lord
Tenors: Lord
Use me
Use me

Vamp:

I present my body a living sacrifice Holy
Which is my reasonable service,

Yes, A vessel of honor
Sanctified for, for your use

Use me
Sopranos: Lord
Altos: Lord
Tenors: Lord
Use me
Use me

(Vamp)

Yes, A vessel of honor

Sanctified for (x3)
For your use---Lyrics submitted by Terrance Wright.
