In the middle of the night
Thats when you caught my eye
I chased you round in memories
Through the breeze and the trees
and you tease me but hey

The clocks turning all around
And your still playing these games
It's such a waste to bring me down,down,down
Don't bring me down cause

Hey girl, I wanna catch your wave
Hey girl, I wanna drift away with you
Hey girl, you've got an undertow
Hey girl, hey girl. don't wanna let you go

When I turned sixteen
Thats when I started to dream
I chased you round in memories
Through the breeze and the trees
And you tease me but hey

Well every princess has her knight
And i'm still in it for the fight
Not givin in
I'm gonna win,win,win
I'm gonna win cause

Hey girl, I wanna catch your wave
Hey girl, I wanna drift away with you
Hey girl, you've got an undertow
Hey girl, hey girl, don't wanna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go

Hey girl, I wanna catch your wave
Hey girl, I wanna drift away with you
Hey girl, you've got an undertow
Hey girl, hey girl don't wanna let you go

Hey girl, I wanna catch your wave
Hey girl, I wanna drift away with you
Hey girl, you've got an undertow
Hey girl, hey girl don't wanna let you
Hey girl,hey girl, don't wanna let you go
I'll never let you go
Alright---Lyrics submitted by Delilah.
