Oh what mess
you've got the best of my heart
It broke and now it's just a joke
Cause you're moving right along
I'm still here and you're gone
Oh what shame
You know I didnt mean for the winds to change
Won't ever be the same
Cause the kisses that you blew
Could never ever move

I think I need some time by myself
Without anybody else
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
I need to go far away
A few years back would be ok
I just need to unwind
In my time machine

Hey you
Ya i'm talking to you
You lost the love in bed
And now it's just dead
Cause it didn't mean a thing
Waiting for a ring
Hey it's a game
And ain't it a shame that it's just a show
I thought that this was love
But I can't be fooled again
I'm cryin' out
But I can't give in

I think you need some time by yourself
Without anybody else
You just need to unwind
In your time machine
You need to go far away
A few years back would be ok
You just need to unwind
In your time machine

All the things that we could change
(things that we could change)
Now we'll never be the same

I think I need some time by myself
Without anybody else
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
I need to go far away
A few years back would be ok
I just need to unwind
In my time machine

By Myself
I don't need anybody else
I just need to unwind
In my time machine
In my time machine---Lyrics submitted by nowanadzieja95@gmail.
