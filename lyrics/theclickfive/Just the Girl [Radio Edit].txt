She's cold and she's  cruel
but she knows what she's doing
She pushed me in the pool
at our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
but i dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems, 
she's the one I'm after

(chorus)
Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I dnt want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's just too much for me
But I keep comming back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret for more then an hour
She runs on 100 attitude power
And the more she ignores me
the more I ador her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her
 (Chorus)

The way she sees me
on her caller ID
she won't pick up the phone
she'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
Cause every word she's said 
is still rinin' in my head
Still rinin' in my head

She's cold and she's cruel
but she knows what she's doin'
knows just what to say
so my whole day is ruined

Cause she's bittersweet
she knocks me off of my feet
and I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
she's a mystery
she's too good for me
but i keep comming back for more
she's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for
I'm lookin' for
I'm lookin' for
I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for.....oh---Lyrics submitted by Hillary.
