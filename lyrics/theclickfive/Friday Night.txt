Manic Mondays singing you to sleep
You could use some time to breathe
Wake up please
A lonely weekend isn't what you need
You won't feel so guilty cuz you'll love the crime on

Friday night
Baby are you sleeping
Friday night
My heart is still beating
It's all right
Open up your sleepy eyes
Come alive, come alive on Friday night

Wearing night clothes never felt so cold
Wish we were a little older
Restless souls
I cant hold this ladder for too long
Wont you open up your window
Come outside on

Friday night
Baby are you sleeping
Friday night
My heart is still beating
Its all right
Curfew's gunna break my heart,
So come and meet me in the dark
Friday night
You're under the covers
Friday night
We could be lovers
Its all right
Open up your sleepy eyes
Come alive, come alive on Friday night

Baby it's no surprise
The price is right
I'm bob barker
Hold on to the prize
Cuz its Friday night, Friday night come alive

Friday night
Baby are you sleeping
Friday night
My heart is still beating
Its all right
Curfew's gunna break my heart,
So come and meet me in the dark
Friday night
You're still under the covers
Friday night
We could be lovers
Its all right
Open up your sleepy eyes
Come alive, come alive on Friday night

Yeah
Come alive come alive on Friday night
Oh
Come alive, come alive---Lyrics submitted by nowanadzieja95@gmail.
