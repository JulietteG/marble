Tried to take a picture of love 
Didnt think i'd miss her that much
I wanna fill this new frame
But its empty

Tried to write a letter in ink
Its been getting better i think 
I've got a piece of paper buts its empty

Its empty

[Chorus]
Maybe we're trying trying to hold
Maybe we're torn apart
Maybe the timing is bleeding alot
We're empty

And i even wonder if we
Should be getting under these sheets
We can lie in this bed but its empty

Its empty

Maybe we're trying trying to hold
Maybe we're torn apart
Maybe the timing is bleeding alot
We're empty

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Maybe we're trying trying to hold
Maybe we're torn apart
Maybe the timing is bleeding alot
We're empty

Maybe we're trying trying to hold
Maybe we're torn apart (We're empty)
Maybe the timing is bleeding alot
We're empty---Lyrics submitted by juff.
