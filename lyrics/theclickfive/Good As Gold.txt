Two birds taking flight
One rest, the other guides them home
They love but they don't know...

Two bricks, lay in line
Weathered but the red and white still show
They love but they don't know

One can make a heartache
While another makes it strong
Settle up before it's gone

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Cuz our time is made of gold
And we can spend it all night if we spent it right
Let's take as much as we can hold
Now I'm reaching out an empty hand
Hold it there until it's full
Make it last, cause this is all we have
A love as good as gold

Some days turn us down
Shaking up all out doubting bones
We love but we don't know

Some nights keep us up
The turnaround is always touch and go
We love but we don't know

One voice makes a heart race
While the others just made noise
Settle up before it's gone?

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Cuz our time is made of gold
And we can spend it all night if we spent it right
Let's take as much as we can hold
Now I'm reaching out an empty hand
Hold it there until it's full
Make it last, cause this is all we have
A love as good as gold

A love as good as gold

So Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Cuz our time is made of gold
And we can spend it all night if we spent it right
Let's take as much as we can hold
Now I'm reaching out an empty hand
Hold it there until it's full
Make it last

Oh, tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Cuz our time is made of gold
And we can spend it all night if we spent it right
Take as much as we can hold
Now I'm reaching out an empty hand
Hold it there until it's full
Make it last, cause this is all we have
A love as good as gold

A love as good as gold---Lyrics submitted by jennifer darica.
