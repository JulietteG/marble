Yesterday
I waited for your friends to walk away
So I could say just what I mean

I know we're moving fast
We're running from the past
I'm holding on before it fades away

Could it be that maybe it's our first mistake
And Baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight
There's a reason why they say that we should give it time
But time is not enough
And that's the reason why
When you're young you fall in love

Standing still
I'm waiting round to see if this is real
Cause I feel like I'm asleep
I'll open up my eyes
Cause you might be the type
Of girl that makes me dream when I'm awake

Could it be that maybe it's our first mistake
And baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight
There's a reason why they say that we should give it time
But time is not enough
And that's the reason why
When you're young you fall in love

So tell me can this really work
Or will we end up getting hurt
Is this love or myth
So tell me are you in for this
There's so much than we can see
More than you
More than me
It takes two to believe

Maybe it's our first mistake
And baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight

Maybe it's our first mistake
And baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight
There's a reason why they say that we should give it time
But time is not enough
And that's the reason why
When you're young you fall in love

That's the reason why when you're young you fall in love
That's the reason why when you're young you fall in love---Lyrics submitted by Yan.
