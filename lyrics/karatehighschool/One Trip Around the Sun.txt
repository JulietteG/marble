i'm all fucked up in my tent i'm rocking got your picture in my space suit pocket hope that i don't explode. i didn't think that i'd leave earth this soon i'd rather be spending more time with you. but there's one thing i want you to know. One trip around the sun, one trip and i'll be done. when i come back home i'll give you a space suit and we'll head out over the clouds just me and you. my cap and walls start to shake. debbie double deck all the gauges in here the law of physics will break. Hold my hand we're gonna blow this place we're gonna take a chance out in outter space we'll leave the world behind, we'll leave the world behind. i dream about how you and i will one day get together and we'll plan our big escape. we'll start our home out on mars. Alien babies are the hot new trend guess i'll have to have 25 again. Hold my hand we're gonna blow this place, we're gonna take a chance out in outter space we'll leave the world behind, we'll leave the world behind. the g-force is done and my face apart and all i see is stars. so many things to say but the equal stuff is page but i can't wait till i get home. hold my hand we're gonna blow this place, we're gonna take a chance out in outter space we'll leave the world behind, we'll leave the world behind. hold my hand we're gonna blow this place, we're gonna take a chance out in outer space we'll leave the world behind, we'll leave the world behind.---Lyrics submitted by Hailey.
