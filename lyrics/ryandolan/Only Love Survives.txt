All our lives weve been afraid
Watching the world decline till nothing remains
But in our darkness hour, right before the dawn
The old world dies, the new day is born

Were gonna live like its our last night alive
And were dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun dont rise
In the end only love survives

So be love, be love
Just be love (Just be love), only love (only love)
We are love (We are love), only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned you got to make love a state of mind
Cause in the end only love survies

So let the world collide, dont be afraid
If its the end of time love will remain

To live like its the last night alive
And were dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun dont rise
In the end only love survives

So be love, be love
Just be love (Just be love), only love (only love)
We are love (We are love), only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned you got to make love a state of mind
Cause in the end only love survies

So be love (Be love), only love, love, love
(To be love, be love), only love, love, love
(Cause in the end) Only love survies---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
