Somethings happening to me inside, I can feel it
Climbin' up the walls can't sleep at night, I can feel it
Wanna be with every woman in sight, I can feel it
Some say wrong I say right 'cause I can feel it

I just can't concentrate on you because
I`m dedicated to love can't get enough
|`m dedicated to love Dedicated to love

I'm all revved up n' ready to go, I can feel it
Hey little woman I want you to know, I can feel it
When I touch you my temperature rises, I can feel it
Hey little woman you better realize that l can feel it

And if I stare at you it's just because

I'm dedicated to love can't get enough
I'm dedicated to love Dedicated to love
l'm dedicated to love, can't get enough, Im Dedicated to love

If you need a little information
If you need  little sympathy
If you're in a little desperation
Talk to me talk to me now

Baby it's the best it's the best sensation, can you feel it
Let's have a party a celebration, can you feel it
Now I wanna know if you want it too, can you feel it
'Cause baby I know I love you cam you feel it

But if I take you home it's just because
|'m dedicated to love can't get enough
|'m dedicated to love Dedicated to love
|'m dedicated to love, can't get enough, I`m Dedicated to love
Im dedicated to love---Lyrics submitted by tac.
