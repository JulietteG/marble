All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the,

[Verse1]
You and your Girls are going out tonight
Ya'll be plannin' so we right
You got somethin' boys can't deny (Heres a hat)

Cut you open and your just wide
You ain't tired wanna cause a riot
And
Who can say no to you
Wait til they get a load of you

[Chorus]
A hundred dollar bills look  Ashoo! Ashoo! (x4)

All the girls standing in the line for the Bathroom!
All the girls standing in the,

Superstar ask you what you have
Bartender get the drank we just laugh
He talkin bout an autograph
He just wanna dance in you reckless paths
Close your eyes see colorful things you wanna
Let go for the wonderful things just a
Fit more just to get in the ling
So we can answer the brain and you can flip wit da pain

A hundred dollar bills look  Ashoo! Ashoo! (x4)
