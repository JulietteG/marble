I think this one's for the radio
(turn the lights on)
I think this one's for the radio
Baby, yeah

Hold on
Don't say nothing I just wanna make sure that your eyes are working
And what goes on, here
Only concerns the two of us
Cause it's only the two of us
And I feel like it's 'bout time for me to show you all, girl
All the freaky things that I'm thinking, baby

Your clothes are all off
And the bed is right there
Besides your high heels all you're wearing is your hair
I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Pleasure principle can you work it in the chair
And I can get you right
With your legs up in the air
Now I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh baby

It's been so long
Since somebody put it on ya like I'm 'bout to put it on ya
Let's make one thing, clear
The things I'm 'bout to show you, I already know you gon' love, girl
And it's gonna be so fine for me to break you off, girl
Because I know just what your body needs, baby

Your clothes are all off
And the bed is right there
Besides your high heels all you're wearing is your hair
I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Pleasure principle can you work it in the chair
And I can get you right
With your legs up in the air
Now I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh baby

I wanna hear your body say my name, say my name
And you gon' be so happy that you came, to get it baby
So gon' get outta them clothes, go head and go down, over there on the floor
I'm dedicated, to pleasing you
I know you're ready baby

Your clothes are all off
And the bed is right there
Besides your high heels all you're wearing is your hair
I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Pleasure principle can you work it in the chair
And I can get you right
With your legs up in the air
Now I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh baby ---Lyrics submitted by katrina.
