Baby you should let me love you, let me love you,
Baby you should let me love you,
You should let me love you, (let me love you, let me love you)
Baby you should let me love you

Just relieve your stress (relax) chill your ring finger
and freeze ya chest
cop you a new beamer the beads is next
and even though it's a want I need the sex
I hope it's just insecurity
Cuz' I know she feelin' me
Diggin the growth and the maturity
But I got hard luck
Cuz' honey keep keepin' her guards up
So I'm just tryna' even the odds up
And that part sucks to have to keep goin' back in on her
When she knows that I been on her
Since Back in the days in manhattan after the matinee
When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)
And the right mind (right mind)
It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time)
When I get her imma' grab her by the wrist
Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this...

Baby you should let me love you, let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smell the perfume, the make up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories you know that they are all lies
As bad as you are you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was you man baby you'd (never worry about)
What I do (I'd be coming home)
Back to you (every night doing you right)
Your the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star I just want to show you, you are...

Baby you should let me love you, let me love you, baby you should let me love you.
(You should let me) Love you,
Let me love you baby you should let me love you

What you want a cruise?
Avenues and a ride with a pair of shoes
Shining like a diamond sittin' high with raised latitude
(Ah ha) listen baby I could change your attitude
You chillin' with the king you ain't dealin' with them rapper dudes
(Hey) keep it real kick it with me is what you rather do
I was poppin' before you, gonna' be the same after you
I ain't gonna chase you, I'd rather replace you
In case you wonderin' I'm stuntin' and way major
If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you,
Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex will amaze you
Look you don't want to past the chance (hey)
Spend the summer in the bottom half of france
Don't be alarmed I don't mean no harm
I'll help you before I hurt you
I'm tryna' rebirth you
I wanna love you
I ain't just have to nail you
You already know I can show you
better than I can tell you...

Baby you should let me love you, let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be---
