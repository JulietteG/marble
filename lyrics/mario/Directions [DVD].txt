Baby If you tryin to get to good love you have to 

[Mario Singing]
Follow the directions 

I can tell
That you never been and you
Wast alot of time 
Cause you tryin find 
This place but it aint in a phone book
And what you heard is wrong so it aint no need to look
You heard alot about it
And now you want to go
But the serect is
Girl you got to know
Somebody thats been there before
N girl you lookin at em
Oh girl you lookin at em

If you want to go there
I'm a show you how
But you cant be scared
Listen close
N pay attention 
N Follow the directions
You gonna make a left
On touchin' Blvd.
When you see a Kissin St
Make a right keep straight
And go all the way 
And that will run you in to good love

Dont get me wrong
I aint been alot 
But I been enough to know
Were the spot is
N girl i promise i can get you there in minutes
We can stay there as long as you want untill your finished
You heard alot about it
And now you want to go
But the serect is
Girl you got to know
Somebody thats been there before
N girl you lookin at em
Oh girl you lookin at em

If you want to go there
I'm a show you how
But you cant be scared
Listen close
N pay attention 
N Follow the directions
You gonna make a left
On touchin' blvd.
When you see Kissin St.
Make a right keep straight
And go all the way 
And that will run you in to get love

It wont take long to get there

No stops
No lights
No traffic
Enjoy the ride girl you're in my care
And I know just what I'm doin

I'm a pro behind the wheel
Trust me I got skills
To take you where you wanna go
So before you get in
I need to know

If you wanna go there
I'm a show you how
But you can't be scared
Listen close
N pay attention
N follow the direction
You gonna make a left
On touchin' blvd.
When you see Kissin St.
Make a right keep straight
N go all the way
N that'll run you in to good love
