Damn baby 
I just don't understand where we went wrong 
I gave you my heart 
I gave you my soul 
I gave you 

[Verse 1] 

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first, 
It was about 8 years ago 
Don't act like you don't know. 
We were sitting at home in your momma's living room, 
Cause, (We couldn't be alone) 
See your momma knew I was something else, she knew how I felt. 
Back then we were in school, 
And that's your favorite excuse, 
Growing up I was a fool, 
And I can't lie, I'm missin' you 
Listen and don't trip, 
Think I need a bottle with a genie in it. 
Here's my wish list, 

(First one), I would create a heart changing love 
(Second one), I'll take your heart and fill it all up 
(Third one), but I don't need a lot of wishes cause, 
I'll be okay if I get one 

[Chorus] 

If I had one wish, we would be best friends 
Love would never end, 
It would just begin. 
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, 
Promise to love you, 
Trust me, I'll trust you. 
If I had one wish, we would run away, 
Making love all day, 
Have us a baby. 
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life, 
Can you be my wife? 
Make it right this time. 

[Interlude] 

If I had one wish, 
One wish, one wish, one wish. 
One wish, one wish, one wish. 
One wish, one wish, one wish. 
One, wish, one wish, one wish 

[Verse 2] 

And tell me is this the only way I, 
Can get you right back in. 
If so, then searching I'll go, 
Then I can have you for sure. 
Then you'll be loving me, 
Holding me, 
Kissing me. 
So girl don't tell me what, 
I'm feeling is make believe. 
I swear if I lose, 
A second chance with you, 
I wouldn't know what to do, 
I'd probably check myself in, 
To some kind of clinic, 
I couldn't be alone, 
Because without you I'm sick 
Here's my wish list 

(First one), I would create a heart changing love 
(Second one), I'll take yours and fill it all up 
(Third one), but I don't need a lot of wishes cause, 
I'll, be okay if I get one 

[Chorus] 


If I had one wish, we would be best friends (we'd be best friends) 
Lovin' never end, (never end) 
It would just begin. (Starting here right now) 
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, 
Promise to love you, (promise to love) 
Trust me I'll trust you. (I trust you) 
If I had one wish, we would run away, (yes we would) 
Making love all day, (it would feel so good) 
Have us a baby. 
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life, (oh yeah) 
Can you be my wife? 
Make it right this time. 
If I had one wish 

[Interlude] 

I don't even know 
How we ended up on this road, 
And even though we are grown, 
Girl I just want you to know
