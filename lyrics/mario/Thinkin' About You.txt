(Intro)
I think this ones for the radio
Oww

When the afterparty is over
And everyone around us is leaving
Thats when I want you to come closer
Shawty your the only one that im needing
So when the afterparty is over
And for no particular reason
I want you to pull me in closer
And tell me that tonight you aint leaving

(Verse 1)
Its 2:30 and it seems like everybody is about to leave
And I can see you reaching out for me
Without a single word I know just what your thinking oww
Im hoping you can stay a little while longer
Cause I like to see that theres chemistry between you and me
Im pretty sure we'll make that good old kind of love

(Chorus)
When the afterparty is over
And everyone around us is leaving
Thats when I want you to come closer (thats when I want you girl)
Cause your the only one that im needing
So when the afterparty is over
And for no particular reason
I want you to pull me in closer (pull me in closer)
And tell me that tonight you aint leaving
Said I been think, think, think, thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
So tell me that tonight you aint leaving
Said I been think, think, think, thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
So tell me that tonight you aint leaving
Been thinking bout you wooaahhh

(Chorus)
When the afterparty is over, ohh yea
And everyone around us is leaving (there leaving)
Thats when I want you to come closer (thats when I want you girl)
Cause your the only one that im needing
So when the afterparty is over (when the partys over)
And for no particular reason (come lay in my bed baby)
I want you to pull me in closer
And tell me that tonight you aint leaving
Said I been think, think, think, thinking about you all night

So when the afterparty is over girl we gon play hard
You and me together in bed all night and day long
Its Ace love, we make love to the same song

(Chorus)
When the afterparty is over
And everyone around us is leaving
Thats when I want you to come closer
Cause your the only one that im needing
So when the afterparty is over
And for no particular reason
I want you to pull me in closer
And tell me that tonight you aint leaving
Said I been think, think, think, thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
