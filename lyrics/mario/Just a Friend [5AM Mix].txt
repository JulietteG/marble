I wanna know your name and 
I wanna know if you gotta man (I wanna know)
I wanna know everything
I wanna know ya number and if I can come over and
I wanna know what ya like
I wanna know so I can do it all night
But you're telling me I'm just a friend
You're telling me I'm just a friend

Oh baby you (Oh baby you) 
Got what I need (Got what I need)
But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend
'Cause I can be your ('Cause I can be your)
Fantasy (Fantasy)
But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend

I wanna know you in and out
I wanna know what you're all about (I wanna know)
I wanna know what makes you laugh
I wanna know about your past
I wanna know how you move
I wanna know so I can move too (I wanna know)
But you're telling me I'm just a friend
Telling me I'm just a friend

Oh baby you (Oh baby you)

Fantasy (Fantasy, yeah)
But you say I'm just a friend (But you say I'm just a friend, girl)
But you say I'm just a friend

(Oh, can you) Give me one reason why (why)
You wouldn't want this kinda guy
'Cause I stay dipped, I stay lace
And I know you know I'm fly
Girl, stop playing games with me
And let's get it on tonight (Tonight)
You got nothing to lose
Let me do what I do (What I do)
Oh baby you

But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm just a friend)
'Cause I can be your 
Fantasy (Can I be your fantasy)
But you say I'm just a friend (Come on girl)
But you say I'm just a friend

You can call me anytime you like (Oh anytime)
It doesn't matter day or night (Said it doesn't matter)
We can do whatever you 
Wanna do it's up to you
Don't fight the feeling that you feel (Don't fight the feeling)
I can tell that it's real (Oh girl)
So won't you have me as your man
Why you say I'm just a friend

Oh baby you 
Got what I need 
But you say I'm just a friend 
But you say I'm just a friend 
'Cause I can be your 
Fantasy (Can I be your, I can be your fantasy)
But you say I'm just a friend 
But you say I'm just a friend (Mario, Mario) ---Lyrics submitted by briana.
