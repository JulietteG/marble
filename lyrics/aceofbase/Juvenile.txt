The juvenile, in a time when the night is so cold.
The juvenile, has the key to the end.
The juvenile, in the end that is why we are here.
The road will take us to the end, tomorrow's foe is now a friend.

Why don't we do it, like they used to do it oh so long ago.
They kept together til' the bitter end. (Old and young)
Today we don't care, either 'bout the youth or 'bout the old.
They cannot raise their voice yet.  But later they will do.

The juvenile, in a time when the night is so cold.
The juvenile, has the key to the end. (Always believe in...)
The juvenile, in the end that is why we are here.
The road will take us to the end, tomorrow's foe is now a friend.

No education, we don't need no education,
telling us, the right to choose if we have no choice. (No, no, no)
It's so explosive, any day it'll burst into a fire.
Oh, come down and guide us, before it is too late.

(Repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
