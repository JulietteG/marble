I came home to a house without you
The air was stale the walls were bare
But somehow I still knew that you were there

(Chorus)
I wanna see you more
I miss your company
I wish that things were still
The way they used to be

A phone call at 3 a.m.
To come and pick me up
Was I born to be a ballet dancer, or an astronaut
If I needed to talk you'd make the time for me
I wish that things were still the way they used to be

But only for a day
Just so I could say
That I remember you
Because I wouldn't be the same
If anything was changed
And that's the truth

(Chorus)(X2)
I wanna see you more
I miss your company
I wish that things were still
The way they used to be

But only for a day
Just so I could say
That I remember you
But only for a day
The way they used to be
Only for a day
Just so I could say---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
