There's a time 
When we try 
To begin what is ending 
If at first you don't succeed
Then we just end up pretending
If the dream isn't real
Is the lie worth defending? 
Close your eyes, cover your ears, shut your mouth.

You can be naive but I know you're not stupid

You'll wake up
When I walk out
Isn't that the way it plays?
The leaver leaves, the stayer stays.
You wouldn't make a move
So I made mine
Isn't it a pity? 
I wish you were really in it for life
I wish that you were in it for life

What you give 
Is what you get
And what you got's
Now next to nothing
Cause the life that you've accepted
Is the one's that's least disruptive
Are you aware of the fact 
That when I pull there's no pulling back
You have half the mind, half the heart, half the will

You can act naive but I know you're not stupid

You'll wake up
When I walk out
Isn't that the way it plays?
The leaver leaves, the stayer stays.
You wouldn't make a move
So I made mine
Isn't it a pity? 
I wish you were really in it for life
I wish that you were in it for life

Some people talk like they can't hear
Some people walk but get nowhere
And when I'm done with the run
I'm going on
I'm sure I'll be your biggest regret
You'll never forget

You'll wake up
When I walk out
Isn't that the way it plays?
The leaver leaves, the stayer stays.
You wouldn't make a move
So I made mine
Isn't it a pity? 
I wish you were really in it for life
I wish that you were in it for life

Yeah, you can run, but you can't hide
Cause everything you're running from
Is locked inside
So let it the fuck out!---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
