The window's cracked 
I'm looking out
I see her and I'm filled with doubt
I don't if this parking place is just another empty space
Words I said are coming true,
I don't know if it's me or you
This promise is too hard to keep
I have to speak

(chorus)
So what I lied
But the truth would have been suicide
Monogamy is all she wants from me
But I see my life,
And it's way to short
Don't blame for not being subserivent to others' needs
I'm at the point where honesty doesn't ever work for me.

Did my best to try and be
A mirror of society
But we both know the mirror's cracked
And everybody's in the act
Thinking what they cannot feel
Hoping they can make it real
Reality is killing me
(Is killing me)

(chorus)

Monogamy is all she wants from me
But i see my life,
And it's way to short.

Erect a life i'll never see
i'll step back from the scenery
And laugh at all the other guys
Who never could excape inside
Stuck like flies on sticky tongues
Chewed up for their life is done
I'm not here to compromise or apologize

(chorus)

Life, is too short
Life, is too short
Life, is too short.---Lyrics submitted by chelsea.
