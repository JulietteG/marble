Verse 1

I'm holding onto white balloons 
Up against a sky of doom
Tell me you see them
'Cause what's inside of me is invisible to most
Even in clear view

I'm sending out a signal to the possibility of you
'Cause right at this moment
I know you're connected to a part of me that I dont even know myself

Chorus

The changes in me
Are likely to be like the weather
Stormy and clear strength into fear bound together

Verse 2

But I'll break my silence
If I believed that you and me could ever be
More than just what's been behind us
I tried and left, they came and went
I got rejected out again
But no one believes me
I've worn a hundred faces
Of the character replacements and now
And now nobody sees me

Chorus 2

The changes in me
Are likely to be like the weather
Cloudy at best...

Bridge

Angels lift me
Are you with me?
Im holding onto you like I'm holding onto white balloons

Carry me away
I hope that you dont break
Don't break---Lyrics submitted by kenny.
