[Verse 1]
We have a situation here
It's clear, it's not disappearing
We keep fucking what is pure
No cure, and it keeps happening
Over and over again
Over and over again
We have a situation here
It's clear, it's here

[Chorus]
Dead space
The only thing that's left to fear is
To late to ever start again
They rape us over and over and over and over
But I'm still alive
But I'm still alive in this dead space

[Verse 2]
They're not gonna let us out of here
The fear is taking over
We need to get up out of here
It's clear, the sky is falling
It's falling on top of our heads
It's falling while we're in our beds
They're not gonna let us out of here
They're not gonna let us out of here

[Chorus]
Dead space
The only thing that's left to fear is
To late to ever start again
They rape us over and over and over and over
But I'm still alive
But I'm still alive in this dead space

Dead space
The only thing that's left to fear is
To late to ever start again
They rape us over and over and over and over
But I'm still alive
But I'm still alive in this dead space!
