I held onto you for as long as I could
But today, you fell away
Now all I hold are the memories we barely made

I stood on the edge of your bridge until I felt the rain
push me away
My confusion left me fast as the vertigo came

What I believe to be true
It was only a dream
Lived in me
I just projected it over your beautiful scream
I self medicated my way through this mess
That we made
So I could say
There was nothing
But I waited
I waited

This was my mistake
Broken are plans we made
So I will be traveling anyplace
Cause anywhere's better than
Here we rest in peace
rubble beneath our feet
I shouldn't have followed you anywhere
Cause anywhere's better than here

Where is the space I could move in
Could I rest my head
There's nothing left for me here
Its hard to leave behind
The one thing that made me feel alive
So i slide
From paranoid to paralyzed


This was my mistake
Broken are plans we made
So I will be traveling anyplace
Cause anywhere's better than here

This was my mistake
Broken are plans we made

Here we rest in peace
rubble beneath our feet
I shouldn't have followed you anywhere
Cause anywhere's better than here---Lyrics submitted by asd.
