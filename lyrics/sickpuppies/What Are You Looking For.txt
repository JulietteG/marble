I walk the line of the disappointed 
I celebrate when Im in pain
My heart and mind can be disjointed 
I built a bed in this hole Ive made 
I recognize that I am damaged 
I sympathize that you are too 
I wanna breathe without feeling so self-conscious
But its hard when the world is staring at you

Chorus 

Another piece of the puzzle that doesnt fit 
You throw you arms up youre so damn sick of it
What are you working for? 
What are you searching for?
Love 
You wont be thinking of cars when 
Youre on your death bed and dying
Youll only be thinking of 
What are you paying for? 
What are you praying for?
Love

Verse 2 

You join the line of the getting richer 
You keep your pace but its moving slow 
You are defined by all that You have hoarded 
But youre surprised it doesnt fill up the hole

Chorus 2

Another piece of the puzzle that doesnt fit 
You throw you arms up youre so damn sick of it
What are you coping for? 
What are you hoping for?
Love 
You wont be thinking of cars when 
Youre on your death bed and dying 
Youll only be thinking of 
What are you paying for? 
What are you praying for? 
Love

Bridge 

Ill never be what I see in the TV screen 
Ill just keep on dreaming of what Im never gonna be
I cant think of a better way to waste my time than try.

Chorus 3

Another piece of the puzzle that doesnt fit 
You throw you arms up youre so damn sick of it 
What are you hurting for?
What are you searching for?
Love 
You wont be thinking of cars when
Youre on your death bed and dying 
Youll only be thinking of 
What are you paying for? 
What are you praying for? 
Love, love, love, love
You wont be thinking of cars when
Youre on your death bed and dying
Youll only be thinking of 
What are you working for? 
What are you looking for?---Lyrics submitted by Mitchell.
