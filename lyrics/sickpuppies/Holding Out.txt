Everybody's telling me to just keep it together,
Get back on track, get out of the sack, and that will make it better,
Well maybe I don't wanna get out of the water every single day
Not yet just yet!
WON'T YOU WAIT TILL I CAN FEEL THE PAIN!

So this time around got a little bit of time got
a little bit left to say
Because I'm just a loser you like to abuse got a
little bit left to say
I gotta a little bit of time to cleanse my mind
So would you look at the world with a different
time
Rack them all up and knock them down
RACK THEM ALL UP AND THEM BLOW THEM ALL OUT!

(chorus)
Been holding out
For a better day to come
Then I'll see the sun
With you
Been holding out
For a better day to come
Then I'll see the sun 

(breakdown w/ words)

(chorus)
Been holding out
For a better day to come
Then I'll see the sun
With you---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
