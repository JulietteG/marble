Waiting for another line
Cause you throw them at me all the time
Gotta get away from all her lies
And I gotta get away from mine

Tell me where to go
When fate wont deliver
Cause I cant forgive her

When I let her know
This pain Ive been living
Will her next collision
Be me?

Brings these situations down
And her tempers always on the rise
Im living what Ive seen before
Well I wont take this anymore
Its time to hold this to the light

Tell me where to go
When fate wont deliver
Cause I cant forgive her

When I let her know
This pain Ive been living
Will her next collision
Be me?

Cause her mental prison
Is not my decision
So Im cutting my losses this time
Im no longer living
Through her tunnel vision

Tell me where to go
When fate wont deliver
Cause I cant forgive her
When I let her know
This pain Ive been living
Will her next collision
Be me?

Gotta get away from
Gotta get away
Gotta get away this time

Tell me where to go
When fate wont deliver
Cause I cant forgive her

When I let her know
This pain Ive been living
Will her next collision
Be me?
