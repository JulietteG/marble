If you wanna sink to the bottom with me
Come get gotten withered and rotten beneath
1, 2, 3, and down you go
You'll be starting before you know
If you wanna sink to the bottom with me

We're all rotten
Buried and forgotten
Livin it up underground
Let's take a ride (hey hey hey)
You really can't be lookin so surprised
If you can't beat 'em might as well eat 'em
No one's getting out aive
Give it a try (hey hey hey)
It really is a wicked way to die (Oh)

Listen my friend to the sound of a sweet melody
Doesn't it seem to resound like an old memory
Screamin and cryin we'll have none of that
You had you're chance now just sit and relax
Don't you wanna sink to the bottom with me?

We're all rotten 
Buried and forgotten
Livin it up underground
Let's take a ride (hey hey hey)
You really can't be lookin so surprised
If you cant beat 'em might as well eat 'em
No one's getting out alive
Give it a try (hey hey hey)
It really is a wicked way to die

You get used to it in a while
Look at the way each of us smile
You all live in a fantasy 
This is exactly what you need

If you wanna sink to the bottom with me
You get real gotten withered and rotten beneath
1, 2, 3, and down ya go
Feel that smile just start to grow
If you wanna sink to the bottom
We're all rotted buried and forgotten
Livin' it up underground
So take a bite (hey hey hey hey)
You really can't be lookin' so surprised
If you cant beat 'em might as well eat 'em
No one's getting out alive
So dare to try (try try try)
It really is a wicked way, It really is a wicked way, It really is a wicked way to die!

Their all just so pathetic
It's all Psychosomatic
The more they think the more we know
So welcome home---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
