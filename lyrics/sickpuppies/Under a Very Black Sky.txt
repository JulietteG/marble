I had a dream you had a weapon
I couldn't see it in the dark of the night
It's easy to hide
Under a very black sky

Over the moon, just beyond Saturn
I watched in vain as the missiles took flight
We lost our lives
Under a very black sky

Under a black sky (x3)

Colors explode under your microscope
But just through my eyes it's all black and white
I lost my mind
Under a very black sky

We live our lives mostly pretending
You have a secret, you'll never know mine
I'll wear my disguise 
Under a very black sky

It's easy to love you, easy as hell
When you're anyone, anyone else
It's so hard to fake it I know you can tell
If you're anyone, anyone else (x3)

Under a black sky (x3)

At first you believe, and then you start lying
Swallowing pain like it's shredded up glass
I'm bleeding inside
Under a very black sky

Disappointment is cool, but hope can be cooler
I felt them both till I thought I could die
Now all my tears are dry
Under a very black sky

Under a black sky (x10)---Lyrics submitted by Matt F.
