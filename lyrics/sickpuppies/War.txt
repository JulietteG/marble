Faking Falls, Stop and Stall. Take it all back. 'Cause I'm taking mine. I'm taking mine. Time is up. Out of luck. Should have stood up. When you had the time. Now you're out of time
(lets do this)
(Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!)
Lock and Load, Rock and Roll. Bitch it's all over. You're going down. 
(You're going down)
Get ready to settle the score, And get ready to face the floor. 'Cause it's time to remember it's (war)
(Chorus) 
This is war and it's on tonight. So get up and fight. Get up and fight. You had all your life to run and hide. Now step up. Step up.
(lets do this)
Second round. Going down. How about a little reaction, man? You can barely stand. Bitch slap. Slow attack. Man that was pratically suicide. You're next in line.
(Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!)
Get ready to settle the score, And get ready to face the floor. 'Cause it's time to remember it's (war)
(Chorus)
This is war, and it's on tonight. So get up and fight. Get up and fight. You had all your life to run and hide. Now step up. Step up.
(lets do this)
'Cause we're all about ready to break. We're all about ready to break. We're all about ready to break. Yeah We're all about ready to break. Yeah we're all about ready to break. This is war and it never ends. So get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!
You had all you're life to run and hide. Step up, Step up! This is war!
(and it never ends) 
This is war!
(and it never ends) 
This is war! 
(lets do this)
(lets do this)
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
