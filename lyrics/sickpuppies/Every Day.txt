Been away so long I dont remember this place, 
And I'm feeling scared, 
Of course you don't know what i've been going through. 
but I'd like to think you care,

(chorus)
Everyday is change, 
With a different problem to face, 
Everybody feels a different type of strange,
But you don't throw it away,

Nowadays everybody's trying to be,
The latest real cool hip thing know what I mean.
Not about you and how you arrange.
And it doesn't matter that I'm really going insane,
Cause you are you and I am me,
we are all in control of our own destiny,
Follow your heart open your mind,
And enjoy your life it only comes one time,

(chorus)
Everyday is change, 
With a different problem to face, 
Everybody feels a different type of strange,
But you don't throw it away,

(breakdown)

Come on!
Everyday is change, 
With a different problem to face, 
Everybody feels a different type of strange,
But you don't throw it away,

Everyday is change, 
With a different problem to face, 
Everybody feels a different type of strange,
But you don't throw it away.---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
