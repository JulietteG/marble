If you wanna know how far to go to hell just ask me
If you wanna see the view from your knees come down and join me
I'm the final straw, the nail in the coffin just by being
Who I am is so god-damned

(Chorus)
I'm not the master of the universe
I walk the earth the wrong way
Met my potential and fulfilled the worst
My best is cursed the wrong way

(The wrong way)
X4

Your glass is half, his glass is full, my glass is empty
You're running short of "not enough" well I got plenty
I've come a long way
I went the wrong way
And who I am is so god-damned

(Chorus)
I'm not the master of the universe
I walk the earth the wrong way
Met my potential and fulfilled the worst
My best is cursed the wrong way

And when I die I'm gonna fly and come and get you
And when you try and run I'll be the curse upon you
It's going to end, It's going to end

In the race for disaster I will come in first
That's what I've learned
The hard way

(WHAT?!)

If you wanna know how far to go to hell just ask me
If you wanna see the view come down and join me

I've come a long way I went the wrong way (X3)---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
