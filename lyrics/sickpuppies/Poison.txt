Here I sleep
With one eye open
While you're dreamin'
Next to me
Well at least I gave up hopin'
You're some kind of miracle
That set me free

Starting over
God only knows where we've been
Starting over
There's not an option

You're like poison on my tongue
So bittersweet
But I like it
I love it
Poison on my tongue
And it keeps killing me
But I like it
I love it

Ohh Ohh Ohh

Here's a pill
Why don't we take it?
Cause I heard it makes it
Not okay
Wait until we both are naked
Save the bullshit for another day

Starting over
God only knows where we've been
Starting over
There's not an option

You're like poison on my tongue
So bittersweet
But I like it
I love it
Poison on my tongue
And it keeps killing me
But I like it
I love it

You make me wanna jump off a ledge!
Rise? a new life come back from the dead!
And do it again
Do it again
Do it again
((Can't understand this part))
And it keeps killing me
But I like it
I love it

On my tongue
She's like poison on my tongue
She's like poison

She's like poison!
Poison!
Poison!
Poison!

She's like poison on my tongue
So bittersweet
But I like it
I love it
Poison on my tongue
And it keeps killing me
But I like it
I love it---Lyrics submitted by Matt F.
