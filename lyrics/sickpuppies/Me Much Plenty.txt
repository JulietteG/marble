Don't wanna be lost anymore
I find myself at the door
I'm too scared to go
Been in this life far too long
I wanna see the sun 
Inside my mind (inside my mind)

Do you know what you came for?
If you don't even know, whats the point of being alive
Get up, get up, get up and fight
Get up, get up, just live your life

Don't wanna be lost anymore
I find myself at the door
I'm too scared to go
Been in this life far too long
I wanna see the sun 
Inside my mind

Do you know what you came for?
If you don't even know, whats the point of being alive
Get up, get up, get up and fight
Get up, get up, just live your life (come on)

'Cause everyday is not a waste
It's all the same everyday
Cause what (what) you (you) see (see) isn't al (al) ways (ways) what you get


Do you know what you came for?
If you don't even know, whats the point of being alive
Get up, get up, get up and fight
Get up, get up, live your life---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
