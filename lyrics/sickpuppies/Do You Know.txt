I wish I could see what's outside
Be to places I've never seen before
A place where time doesn't take it too long to pass (no one has to lie)
Where everything is simple as it seems
There is no paper weight, to die to die

Do you know how it feels inside?
To know that everyday in every way your losing your mind

Well don't tell me what I know
Because your the one, that I'm gonna show

A place where time doesn't take it too long to pass (no one has to lie)
Where everything is simple as it seems
There is no paper weight, to die to die

Do you know how it feels inside?
To know that everyday in every way your losing your mind
(All the time, Ohh mind all the time(X2), Inside)---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
