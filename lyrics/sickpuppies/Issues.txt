I wanna wake up 
I ve been walking in my sleep to long wake up 
Im so sick of dreaming 
I wanna slow down 
I wanna be part of what is happening around me
Without breathing 
Without feeling 
Without screaming 
So Im leaving 

Chorus 

Im consciously unconscious 
Why am I filled with hate 
I like to blame my parents 
Im sure youd do the same 
Swallow the hurt 
Spit out the jerk thats not afraid

Verse 2 

I turn the page 
To a chapter that they thought was just a phase 
But it consumed me 
Youre right I am a failure and when my life turns to shit it wont have anything to do with the fact thats all you ever taught me how to do so you can relax!
Without feeling 
Without breathing
Now Im Leaving

Chorus 

Im consciously unconscious 
Why am I filled with hate 
I like to blame my parents
Im sure youd do the same 
Swallow the hurt 
Spit out the jerk thats not afraid 
Turn the page



Ive been hiding, drowning,
Ive been yawning, starving
Ive been feeling nothing---Lyrics submitted by Mitchell.
