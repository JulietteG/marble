Tell me all your plans and Ill laugh back in your face
Preach me your religion if youre dumb enough to pray
I tried to make a change, to get a better way, to make a little more money
I tried to get away to see if I could stay and look what I became honey

Chorus

What is it Im after 
Searching for disaster 
watching my whole life flash in front of my eyes
weve been given answers
still were walking cancers 
dressed up as a life

Verse 2

Get all your news from a corporate company
trade in your opinion for a gallon of gasoline GO!
I tried to get away to see if could stay 
and look what I became honey

Bridge

This life
Is a waste of life 
this life is a fucking lie!---Lyrics submitted by Mitchell.
