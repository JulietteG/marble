Today is what I'm not afraid of.
Its tomorrow that scares the hell out of me.
I can't begin to imagine a world without you.

But my sweet darling, I have to.
But my sweet darling, I have to let you go.
You'll always be with me, but I'm sorry I'm not coming home.
This is what you wanted, its what you wanted.
And now I got to go, so I'm sorry I'm not coming home.

You know what baby
Did I ever tell you that you're the best thing in my life?
So sorry that I turned out to be the worst thing in yours.

Why can't you let go of my hand?
Crack a smile for me, and give me one last thrill.
Why can't you let go of my hand?

We are life & we are death.
We are love & we are hate.
We are good & we are evil.
We are just.. so perfect.

It started with "I think I'm falling in love with you."
It ends with "I'm sorry I'm over you."

You'll always be with me, but I'm sorry I'm not coming home.
This is what you wanted, its what you wanted.
And now I got to go, so I'm sorry I'm not coming home.

I embrace our life. I embrace our death.---Lyrics submitted by Dameon.
