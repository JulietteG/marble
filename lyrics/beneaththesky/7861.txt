7861 Blackthorne.

7861 Blackthorne.

They found a the body.
Hanging from the ceiling.
Once again staring down at a  casket casket casket. Run far away from the casket casket casket. Don't let me go back inside.
Now are you set free?

Now are you set free?
Now that you left us in your cage. Once again something apart of my life dies again, and lives              again.                  
What made you decide that the only way is the wrong way? Was it the thought of failure? 
Or was it the girl? 
Or was it the drugs that became your friends that night? 

Look at you now. Look what you've done. I can't promise you a rose garden.
Can you see her? This vision with closed eyes. Watching you I'm not ready for this. Through her eyes It's time for the final act. Can you see? Do you believe? Will you save me? As the curtains closed.

Now don't ever hear me wrong. These years have passed me by. And I'm still wondering why? Why a man would take his life? Take his life. I still love you my friend. 

They look at me now. They know what I've done. They can't promise me a rose garden.
Can you see her? This vision with closed eyes. Watching you I'm not ready for this. 
Through her eyes It's time for the final act. Can you see? Do you believe? Will you save me?
As the casket closed.

As you struggle within your noose, what was your last thought? As you struggle within your noose, what was your last thought? Just cut your rope. Just cut your rope. Just cut your rope. Just cut the rope. You could of been saved. You could of been saved. You could of been saved. You could of been saved.  Just cut your rope.---Lyrics submitted by jeff.
