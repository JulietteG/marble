People say i'm in the way
People say never betray
Oh, when i've gone, when i've gone
You'll turn to me, when i've gone, when i've gone

Need a little understanding for all i've done
In another situation i don't belong (belong)

Every day humiliate
Every way solemn in trait
Oh, when i've gone, when i've gone
You'll turn the key, when i've gone, don't belong

Need a little understanding for all i've done
In another situation i don't belong
Need a little understanding for all i've done
In another situation i would belong (belong) (bis).---
