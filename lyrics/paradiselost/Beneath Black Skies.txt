This reprisal search for words
Analyse what it's worth
Set the stars ablaze from earth
In thoughts sublime we immerse

Another fear I can't see
All blown away

You say you'll never run away
From a certain pointing light

Beneath black skies I search for words
Hell relies on what is worse
Heaven lies on sullen earth
Fall then rise
Fall then birth

Another fear I can't see
All blown away 

You say you'll never run away
From a certain point in life

Is there something wrong?
Nothing I sense no belong ---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
