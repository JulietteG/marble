I was just a normal guy
life was just a 9 to 5
with bills and pressure 
piled up to the sky
She never asked
she knew I'd been
hanging with my wilder friends
looking for some other way to fly
and 3 days straight was no big feed
to get by with no food or sleep
and crazy was becoming my new norm
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
and sleep right through the calm before the storm

My life was just an old routine
Every day the same damn thing,
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I'll tell you The high cost of living
ain't nothing like the cost of living high

That southern baptist parking lot
is where I'd go to smoke my pot
And sit there in my pickup truck and pray
And staring at that giant cross
just reminded me that I was lost
and it just never seemed to point the way
As soon as Jesus turned his back 
I'd find my way across the tracks
looking just to score another deal
with my back against that damn 8 ball
I didn't have to think or talk
or feel

My life was just an old routine
Every day the same damn thing,
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I'll tell you The high cost of living
ain't nothing like the cost of living high

My whole life went through my head
laying in that motel bed
watching as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land
and my sweet wife was my best friend
but I traded that for cocaine in a hole
With my new found sobriety
Ive got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had and threw away
This prison is much colder than that one
That I was locked up in just yesterday

My life was just an old routine
Every day the same damn thing,
Hell I can't even tell if I'm alive
I'll tell you The high cost of living
ain't nothing like the cost of living high

I'll tell you the high cost of living 
ain't nothing like the cost of living high

Just leave that stuff alone!---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
