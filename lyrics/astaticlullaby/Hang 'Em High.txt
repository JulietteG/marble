This life in a car crash
This life in a car crash
Can we make it out alive

He finds himself
He's lost in
The breath between life and drowning

Cauterize
These open wounds
The burning flesh
The smell
Of these past five years
Paralyzed
With no will to move
The killing grounds
The Stakes
Of these past five years
These past five years

And it's more than just a loss
But it's over
We're not singing mournful thoughts
And it's over
(And I can't wait)
Can't wait
(Until we give it all away)
And we're giving up our lives
For this revolution

For this revolution
This revolution

Realize
That the broken glass
The caution tape
The cries
Are just parting ties with the times you spent alone
We have been left to make it alone
Running through these flooded hallways
Can we make it out alive

And it's more than just a loss
But it's over
We're not singing mournful thoughts
And it's over
(And I can't wait)
Can't wait
(Until we give it all away)
And we're giving up our lives
For this revolution

These open wounds
Still run
This broken glass
Has left me so
So individual
So individual
So individual
In time
This is life in
A car crash

And it's more than just a loss
But it's over
We're not singing mournful thoughts
And it's over
(And I can't wait)
Can't wait
(Until we give it all away)
Can't wait
(Can't wait)
And we're giving up our lives
For this revolution

And it's more than just a loss
But it's over
We're not singing mournful thoughts
And it's over
(And I can't wait)
Can't wait
(Until we give it all away)
And we're giving up our lives
For this revolution---Lyrics submitted by Cash.
