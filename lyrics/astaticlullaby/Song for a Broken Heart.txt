Take this for what it's worth 
This song, my smile 
Now take this for what it's worth 
This song, my smile 
Smile 

I write to you from hell my song, leaving the foot against the gas 
And the wall that must have said your name 
(I write to you from hell tonight)
Weaken me, for nothing you can say can stop this now 
Would a noose replace his lips? 
(Would a noose replace)

Can a song replace a broken heart? 
Now can a song replace broken love? 
No 

On the beach, I remind myself 
That holding hands is so powerless 
Tonight, I don't even have the stars 
To hold onto 
(To hold onto) 

Paint 
Paint this red 
Paint this red 
Yeah, paint this red 
Paint 
I'll paint this red 
I'll paint this red 
Paint this red 

Her picture will remain unbroken, 
she cries tonight, "I fall in love" 
(I fall in love) 
Wipe each tear away with sandpaper 
Tonight I'm not alone 
And I just wanna get your fucking voice out of my head 

Can a song replace a broken heart? 
Now can a song replace broken love? 
No 

Fall within the brake 
Won't you fall within the brake? 
Won't you fall?
Why won't you fall?
On the brake? 

On the beach, I remind myself 
That holding hands is so powerless 
Tonight, I don't even have the stars 
To hold onto 
(To hold onto) 

Can a song replace broken love? 
Now can a song replace broken heart? 
No 
No
