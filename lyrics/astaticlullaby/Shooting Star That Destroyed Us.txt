A star up in the sky
 A poem to the dead
 Let this mistake
 Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
 So drain out my lungs
 Before the fluid brings a choke
 I can not inhale the sparkle of your voice
 [x2]

 Let me walk 
 On high wire of rusty nails
 While barefoot shedding the flesh of our existence

I wanted to break the fall!

A star up in the sky
 A poem to the dead
 Let this mistake
 Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
 So drain out my lungs
 Before the fluid brings a choke
 I can not inhale the sparkle of your voice

 Now's the time
 Now's the time

The more I try, the more I lose
 But today, remember me?
 But today, remember me?
 But today, your eyes

Your eyes
 They shine
 Your eyes
 [x4]

Your eyes

Your eyes
 They shine
 Your eyes

Walking home
 Street lights go out
 [x2]

A star up in the sky
 A poem to the dead
 Let this mistake
 Bring a vivid crystal to her eyes
 So drain out my lungs
 Before the fluid brings a choke
 I can not inhale the sparkle of your voice

Whoa (Whoa) Whoa (Whoa, oh)
 Whoa, (Whoa)
 Whoa, (Whoa, oh) oh---Lyrics submitted by Diego.
