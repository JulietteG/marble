I'm driving, listening to my radio,
Checkin' out the airwaves,
For something to believe in.
Gimme Somethin' to hold true
Give me something to sing about
Give me a reason to care
I'll sing along forever.

Watered-down words covered in song,
Trying to hide the truth,
That life is beautiful, and life is pain
Give it to me straight, touch my heart.

I'll sing along forever.

I'll sing along forever.

I'll sing along forever.

I'm driving, listening to my radio,
Checkin' out the airwaves,
For something to believe in.
Gimme somethin' to hold true
Give me something to sing about
Give me a reason to care
I'll sing along forever.
Give it to me straight, touch my heart.
I'll sing along forever.---Lyrics submitted by Keep.
