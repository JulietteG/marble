It's not enough that I love you
There's all these things I have to prove t o you
You use the sun to erase the past
But you think it only raises for you

But I'm afraid of being hurt that's true
But not afraid of any physical pain
Just as I am always scared of water
But not afraid of standing out in the rain

The last person in the room she hugged
Was the person that loved her the most
Nobody noticed that I was down on the rug
I'm getting better at becoming a ghost

I know that you want more
But would you fight for
My love

And I've hurt you before
But can you ignore
My love

You're walking out my back door
Looking back for
My love

I know that you want more
But would you fight for
My love

People do their best to not let passion begin
It's dead before it has a chance to start
And so then there I am, the caretaker of sin
To your abandoned and malignant heart

It's such a pleasure, to sing with you together
Making love when there is nobody home
But I can't kiss you 'til you lift up your chin
You have to want to stop being alone

I want you to fight for
My love
I want you to fight for
My love
I want you to fight for
My love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
