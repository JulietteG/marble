We must be thieves
Of each other's minds

Like we're on some parallel
I know you all too well
On some parallel
I know you all too well

We must be side by side
In the vacant time

Like we're on some parallel
I know you all too well
On some parallel
I know you all too well

Desperately talking slow
The creases are in your clothes
I don't have to ask, I know, I know you
Don't like to be left alone too long in suspense

We will be thieves
Of each other's minds

'Cause we're on some parallel
I know you all too well
On some parallel
I know you all too well

Desperately talking slow
The creases are in your clothes
I don't have to ask, I know, I know you
Don't like to be left alone too long in suspense

We don't have to separate to keep ourselves in place
We don't have to separate to keep ourselves in place
We don't have to separate to keep ourselves in place---
