I got no truck with you, woman 
Always comin' over when I ain't home 
You hand a buck to me baby 
Tried your luck, you tried to get in my song 
Oh well your mama was a bastard 
Had your plastered face all over the scene 
You got hassled by your daddy 
Always pushing trying to make you come clean 

You broke your tongue talking trash 
Now you're tryin' to bring your garbage to me 
I got some words for your ass 
You better find somebody else up the street 
Two monkeys jumping on the bed 
And one fell off and hit his head on the ground 
The other monkey called the doctor 
Said another body dead on the ground---
