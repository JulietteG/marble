(Yeah)
Cut off the bottoms of my feet
Make me walk on salt
Take me down to the police
Charge me with assault
A smile on her face
She does what she wants to me

That's right and
She don't care what kind of wounds she's inflicted on me
She don't care what color bruises that she's leavin' on me
'Cuz she's got freedom in the 21st century
(Alright)

(Listen)
Two black gadgets in her hands
All she thinks about
No responsibility no guilt or morals
Cloud of judgement
Smile on her face
She does what she damn well please

(Right)
And she don't care what kind of things people used to do
She don't care that what she does has an effect on you
She's got freedom in the 21st century

Cut off the bottoms of my feet (Cut off the bottoms of my feet)
Make me walk on salt (Make me walk on salt)
Take me down to the police (Take me down to the police) ---
