This light
That shines on me tonight
Turns on
When you wander through my door

And your friends
Won't see you to the end
I'm sure
But you love them anyhow

Lost feelings of love
Lost feelings of love
That hover above me

Lost feelings of love
Lost feelings of love
That hover above me

The ghosts
That visit me the most
Drop by
'Cause they know they can find me here

And they claim
To be help from me in chains
But come on
They're guilty as sin, my dear

I'm becoming a ghost
Becoming a ghost
So nobody can know me

I'm becoming a ghost
Becoming a ghost
So nobody can know me

These stones
That are thrown against my bones
Break through
But they hurt less as time goes on

I'm alone in my home
Alone in my home
Nobody can touch me

All alone in my home
Alone in my home
Nobody can touch me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
