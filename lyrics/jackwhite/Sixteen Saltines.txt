She's got stickers on her locker
And the boys' numbers there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers then I lick my fingers

Well, every morning I deliver the news
Black hat, white shoes, and I'm red all over
She's got a pink mailbox that she puts out front
Garbage in,
Garbage out,
She's getting what she wants

Who's jealous?
Who's jealous?
Who's jealous?
Who's jealous of who?
If I get busy then i couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be getting through and touching you

Spike heels make a hole in a life boat
Drifting away when I'm talking and laughing as we float
I hear her whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home

Force fed, forced meds 'til I drop dead
You cant defeat her, when you meet her youll get what I said
The Lord knows there's a method to her madness
But the Lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness

She doesn't know but when she's gone I sit and drink her perfume
And I'm sure she's drinking too, but why, where and what for and who?
And I'm solo rowing on one side of the boat.
Looking up, throwing up, a lifesaver down my throat

Who's jealous? Who's jealous? Who's jealous? Who's jealous of who? [x3]---
