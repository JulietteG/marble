The sun and the moon never change
They just rearrange, but not in the new day
Gold exchanges for silver
And a light on the river gets carried away
Explain

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

I lift up my head and I wonder
Just who it is calling, calling my name now
I trip on my way and I blunder
My head hiding under a blanket of shame

High and low may I go
Where God only knows just where I am going
High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going

The people around me won't let me
Become what I need to, they want me the same
I look at myself and I want to
Just cover my eyes and give myself a new name
The stones in the sky never worry
They don't have to hurry, they move in their own way
But I have to choose what to do
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say---
