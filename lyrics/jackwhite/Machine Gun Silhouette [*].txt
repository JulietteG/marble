I wore a shirt one day with a machine gun silhouette,
sportin' a rainbow clip
I had this gun guy staring at me,
wondering where I got it and he just about flipped over it.
I don't know his name, yeah,
but just the same, he buys a literal mountain of death
And I lost 5 or 6 bidding wars against him, yeah, until I had no money left
I said until I had no money left
Yeah, until I had no money left.
Oh!

I don't want you getting hurt if you're too disappointed
if the feathers are broken and dead
The birds look good in person,
but not in the photos and super vice versa, I bet
I've seen the auctioneer getting pretty frustrated
if something good gets underbid
When I went down there I got pretty damned suspicious,
but he seems like a pretty good kid
Yeah, he seems like a pretty good kid
Well, he seems like a pretty good kid

This joint's been around for a while and it feels like
the same old crowd each time
But there's always that chance of a shill biddin' trucker
trying to help the old man make a dime
There's one gun guy coming straight out of Texas doesn't
eat not one for himself
He's got a kingdom of gun shops,
he likes to decorate 'em with the trophies of somebody else
Yeah, the trophies of somebody else
Well, the trophies of somebody else---Lyrics submitted by Bruno Freda.
