I was in the shower so I could not tell my nose was bleeding
Dripped down my body to the floor right below my feet and
I looked in the mirror at my face, I thought I had a disease

And there's a woman with her fingers in my ice box
She peeked around the corner and asked me if I'm okay
She put the ice upon my tongue and then it melted away

Alright, oak floor, soft pine bedroom door, yeah
Speak easy, make her mine if she's bored, yeah
And theres a dry pine ceiling that is out of my reach

I woke up and my hands were gone, yeah
I looked down and my legs were long gone
I felt for her with my shoulder
But there was nobody there

I thought she left a note, just a tag on the pillow there
And then I noticed theres a rag next to my ear
The clock was ringing but it wasnt nothing that I could hear

[Break:]
Alright
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Sometimes someone controls everything about you
And when they tell you that they just can't live without you
They ain't lyin', they'll take pieces of you

And they'll stand above you and walk away
That's right and take a part of you with them ---
