Tell the truth, no lies, I can take it.
Bend your breath just this once.
Run your mouth, I bet I can catch it.
You sound just like a Judas

And if there's anything I learned
That would keep me stranded
If I take you and your word
Then I'm empty handed
A tongue like yours should be
Burned and branded
So I can see you lie to me
I wish the air would color red
When you're breathing
And so I could have seen it coming
Look in my eyes when you say you love me
So I can see you lie to me

Lost be found
I'm a bloodhound born for seeking
Poor prey, must be tired
Say you're grown
But your acting drives over bleeding
And now it's all far

And if there's anything I learned
That would keep me stranded
If I take you and your word
Then I'm empty handed
A tongue like yours should be
Burned and branded
So I can see you lie to me
I wish the air would color red
When you're breathing
And so I could have seen it coming
Look in my eyes when you say you love me
So I can see you lie to me---
