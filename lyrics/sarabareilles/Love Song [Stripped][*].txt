Head under water and you tell me to breathe easy for a while,
Breathing gets harder even I know that,
You made room for me it's too soon to see 
If I'm happy in your hands
Unusually, I don't want too
Blank stares and blank pages
No easy way to say this 
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cuz you ask for it 'cuz you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cuz you tell me it's 
Make or break and this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay, ay yay
If all you have is leaving I'm a
Need a better reason to write you today 
Ayy yay

I learned the hard way, that they all say
Things you want to hear
My heavy heart sinks deep, down under 
You and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
"Hello" to high and dry
Convince me to please you 
Make me think that I need this to 
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am


I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cuz you ask for it 'cuz you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cuz you tell me it's
Make or break and this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay, ay yay
If all you have is leaving I'm a 
Need a better reason to write you 
A love song today, ay yay

Promise me that you'll leave the light on
To help me see the daylight my guide gone
'Cuz I believe there's way 
You can love me because I say

I won't write you a love song
'Cuz you ask for it 'cuz you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you love song 
'Cuz you tell me it's make or break and this
Is that what you want in a love song
'Cuz you ask for it 'cuz you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cuz you tell me
It's make or break and this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you stay, ay yay
If your heart is nowhere in it I don't want it
For a minute
Babe, I want the seven seas when I'll believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today, today, ay yay ay yay yay---Lyrics submitted by Kahlia.
