You can have Manhattan
I know its for the best
Ill gather up the avenues
And leave them on your doorstep
And Ill tip toe away
So you wont have to say
You heard me leave

You can have Manhattan
I know its what you want
The bustle and the buildings
The weather in the fall
And Ill bow out of place
To save you some space
For somebody new

You can have Manhattan
Cause I cant have you

Ahhhhh

You can have Manhattan
The one we used to share
The one where we were laughing
And drunk on just being there
Hang on to the reverie
Could you do that for me?
Cause Im just too sad to

You can have Manhattan
Cause I cant have you

And so it goes
One foot after the other
Til black and white begin to color in
And I know
That holding us in place
Is simply fear of whats already changed

Ahhhhh

You can have Manhattan
Ill settle for the view
The sunsets facing westward
The sand beneath my feet
And Ill wish this away
Just missing the days
When I was one half of two
You can have Manhattan
Cause I cant have you

Bye bye
bye bye
bye bye
bye bye ---
