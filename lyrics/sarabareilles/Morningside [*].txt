I'm not scared of you no
Or so I say
There's no reason to run
Although I may
I'm not as sure as I seem
This much I know
What does it mean when you leave
And I follow

CHORUS
I could try to forget
What you do when I let you get
Through to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like a fire
And you bring rain I desire
Til you get to me on my morningside

Keep my distance I try
No use, no o oh
But no matter the month
I'm back to you

CHORUS
I could try to forget
What you do when I let you get
Through to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like a fire
And you bring rain I desire
Til you get to me on my morningside
Let me down you never
Baby blues don't you ever
I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
Afternoons run for cover
And hope for it just wonder
What it looks like here on my morningside

Look back
Don't you dare let me start to do that
I don't care if the things that I have
Only make me afraid to lose
I need to let go
Need to want to keep letting you know
That we both have a reason to follow
Long as we let this lead
I'm barely breathing

CHORUS
I could try to forget
What you do when I let you get
Through to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like fire
And you bring rain I desire
Til you get to me on my morningside
Let me down you say never
Baby blues don't you ever
I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find
Afternoons run for cover
And hope for it just wonder
What it looks here on my morningside---Lyrics submitted by Kimberly.
