Hold my breath and I'll count to ten
I'm the paper and you're the pen
You fill me in, you are permanent
And you'll leave me to dry

I'm the writer and she's the muse
I'm the one that you always choose
She will falter and gift her blame
And it starts all over
Again, again, again, again

She is bright lights and cityscapes
and white lies and cavalcades.
And shell take all you ever have,
But Im gonna love you.
You say maybe itll last this time.
But Im gonna love you,
You never have to ask.
Im gonna love you
Til you start looking back.
Im gonna love you so right.
I wouldnt need a second chance.

Shield your eyes from the truth at hand.
Tell me why itll be good again.
All those demons are closing in
And I dont want you to burn.
Never mind what I said before;
I dont want any less anymore.
You are carbon and I am flame.
I will rise and you will remain

For bright lights and cityscapes.
And landslides and masquerades.
And shell take all you ever have,
But Im gonna love you.
You say maybe itll last this time.
But Im gonna love you,
Youd never have to ask.
Im gonna love you
Til you start looking back.
I wouldnt need a second chance.
I wouldnt need a second chance.
I wouldnt need a second chance.
I wouldnt need a second chance.---
