Time
To tell me the truth
To burden your mouth for what you say
Pieces of paper in the way
Because I can't continue
Pretending to choose
These opposite sides on which we fall
Loving you later's if at all
No right minds could wrong be
This many times

My memory is cruel
I'm queen of attention to details
Defending intentions if he fails
Until now
He told me her name
It sounded familiar in a way
I could have sworn I'd heard him say it ten thousand times
Oh if only I had been listening

Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me
Always between the lines
Between the lines

I thought I
Thought I was ready to bleed
It would move from shadows on the wall
Stand in the center of it all
Too late, two choices
To stay or to leave
Mine was so easy to uncover
He'd already left with the other
So I learned to listen through silence


Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me
Always be
You and me
Always be

I tell myself
All the words he surely meant to say
I talk until
The conversation doesn't stay on
Wait for me I'm almost ready
When he meant let go 


Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me 
Always be
You and me 
Always between the lines
Between the lines
Between the lines---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
