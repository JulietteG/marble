Keep drinking coffee
Stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things Id say 
If only I were able
But I just keep quiet 
And count the cars that pass by
Youve got opinions man
Were all entitled to em
But I never asked
So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast
I hate to break it to you babe
But Im not drowning
Theres no one here to save

(Chorus)
Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare to tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you
And ride off into 
Your delusional sunset
Im not the one whos lost
With no direction oh oh
But youll never see
Youre so busy making maps
With my name on them in all caps
You got the talking down
Just not the listening

(Chorus)
Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare to tell me who to be	
Who died and made you king of anything

All my life
Ive tried
To make everybody happy
While I
Just hurt 
And hide
Waiting for someone to tell me
Its my turn to decide

(Chorus) 
Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare to tell me who to be	
Who died and made you king of anything

Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare to tell me who to be	
Who died and made you king of anything

Let me hold your crown babe---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
