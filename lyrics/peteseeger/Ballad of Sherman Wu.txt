As I roved out on the streets of Northwestern,
I spied a young freshman dejected and blue, I said,
"Young man--why are you dejected?"
He said, "I'm Chinese and I can't join Psi U!"

"I see by your frat pin that you are a Psi U,
If I had a frat pin I'd be one too,
But I can't have a frat pin and I can't be a Psi U,
I can't be a Psi U because my name's Sherman Wu."

The dean said, "Now Sherman, don't raise a commotion,
It's wrong to wash laundry in public you know,
If he was just Jewish, Italian or German,
But he's so damn Chinese the whole campus would know."---Lyrics submitted by TB Terpstra.
