Well, I got a girl, lives upon the hill
Well, I got a girl, lives upon the hill
Sometimes she won't, sometimes I think she will
You got to shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker

Well, I love you baby, tell you the reason why
Well, I love you baby, tell you the reason why
Every time you leave me, go lay down and die
You got to shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker

Well, go on baby, go on back to school
Well, go on baby, go on back to school
Well, your mama told me, nothing but a fool
You got to shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker

You got to shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker---Lyrics submitted by Robert buchan.
