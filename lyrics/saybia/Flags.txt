Flags

Nothing seems to work behind these walls
Communication is breaking down
Empathy is nothing but a myth
So tell me who you really are

Flash
And our world is no more

From coast to coast
From flag to flag

Mirrors on the wall don't tell the truth
I try to look the other way
Reflect myself in eyes of those I love
They tell me who I really am

Flash
And our world is no more

From coast to coast
From flag to flag

From coast to coast
We wave our flag

Then it occurred to me
We're standing close now, to breaking up

From coast to coast
We wave our flags for nothing---Lyrics submitted by Mar.
