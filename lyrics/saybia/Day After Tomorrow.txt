Please tell me why do birds
Sing when you're near me
Sing when you're close to me?
They say that I'm a fool
For loving you deeply
Loving you secretly

But I crash in my mind
Whenever you are near
Getting deaf, dumb and blind
Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame
It's burning like the sun
And I call out your name
The moment you are gone

Please tell me why can't I
Breathe when you're near me?
Breathe when you're close to me?
I know you know I'm lost
In loving you deeply
Loving you secretly, secretly

But I crash in my mind
Whenever you are near
Getting deaf, dumb and blind
Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame
It's burning like the sun
And I call out your name
The moment you are gone

Tomorrow
I'll tell it all tomorrow
Or the day after tomorrow
I'm sure I'll tell you then

Well, I crash in my mind
Whenever you are near
Getting deaf, dumb and blind
Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame
It's burning like the sun
And I call out your name
The moment you are gone
Moment you are gone---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
