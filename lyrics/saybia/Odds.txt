Odds
The odds are against us right now
And the stakes are getting higher and higher
Still you talk, of dreaming
About all the things we could do
If I placed all my bets on you
And you placed all your bets on me
They're shooting to kill around here
But I know thats not keeping you away from my home
Is it me? Is it you?
Is it what's yet to come?
If I placed all my bets on you
While you placed all your bets on me
War is over
I lower my arms
War is over today

I lay down my arms for you
If you du the same
I will pull you through
And carry you home
Let me carry you home

If you're walking the streets in your own?
Tired of feeling cold and alone
I'm still here, I'm still waiting
Waiting for you to return
And bring passion back to my life
Compassion back to my life
War is over
I lower my arms
War is over today

I lay down my arms for you
If you do the same I will pull you through
And carry you home
Let me carry you home---Lyrics submitted by Sepehr.
