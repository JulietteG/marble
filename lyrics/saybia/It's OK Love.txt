Its OK love
Caught in a well
between heaven and hell
it's getting lonely out here
highways and hotels
and head liner shows
it's all just making me sad

Sorry if I ever let you down
I never meant to
stayed inside the only world I knew
'till I forgot
that nothing is as beautiful as when
I am with you
and life isn't life out there
without you here

Just when I thought
there was nobody out there
no one who quite understood me
I glanced to the side
and I found you there smiling
patiently holding my hand
saying over and over
it's ok love
easy love
I'm here

So finally I'm ready to reveal
what my heart tells me
bring out all that's good inside of me
and let it shine
knowing that I'll never be alone
while I'm with you
and life isn't life out there
without you here

Just when I thought
there was nobody out there
no one who quite understood me
I glanced to the side
and I found you there smiling
patiently holding my hand
saying over and over
it's ok love
easy love
I'm yours---Lyrics submitted by Mar.
