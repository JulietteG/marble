I made a list
Im all packed up
Im ready to go
Its my last stop

Ill soon be far away
You can watch me go
Or you can change your mind
Come with me on the road

Youre giving up the luck
You wanna work with God
And one more thing needs love

Why ask why?
Love has the time to change your mind
No chain on
You know I have to go

(x2)
And if youll stay here
Give your all for love
And you knew Ill fall in love
Before Id go

Come with me
Now and be young
And when we go
Tell me where youre from

(x2)
Why ask why?
Love has the time to change your mind
No chain on
You know I have to go

(x2)
And if youll stay here
Give your all for love
And you knew Ill fall in love
Before Id go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
