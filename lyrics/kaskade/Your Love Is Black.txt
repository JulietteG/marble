Look out to the calm sea
 I don't know why 
 that I
 want to cry
 when I feel 
 this high

 Nature seems to know me
 so many times
 shes been below me
 and so I sing and we dream
 as my soul she tries to live

 seems I lost my way last night
 but I was reborn by daylight
 seems I get another chance
 another chance to dance away

 now you bring your lovin back
 but don't you know your love is black
 and now you're hear pouring in the dark
 cuz you cant see inside my heart
 my heart....
 my heart....

 look out
 your love is black
 look out 
 your love is black
 look out..
 your love...
 is black...

 close my eyes 
 and I can breathe 
 I can feel
 what is right 
 what is true 
 what is real

 seems you lost your way last night
 and you were back here by daylight
 now your words are black and cold
 and your lines are tired and old
 nature is calming me
 cuz your love was harmin me
 and now I shed that coat of arm
 I wasn't safe there in your arms

 look out
 your love is black
 look out
 your love is black
 look out..
 your love..
 is black...

 (speaking) : lost my way
 its true I loved you once
 its true you were once mine

 lost my way

 ooooo

 lost my way....
 lost my way....

 cuz I lost my way
 I lost my way
 I lossstt my wayy..
 lost my wayy..
 lost my way..---Lyrics submitted by automatic.
