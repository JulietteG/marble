I want to be with you
Would do anything
Within reason for you
But if you dont feel
The way I feel about you
Ill just let my heart break

You have no soul
Its a love letter
Cause theyre playing
On your heart strings
Youre wishing
I would be well
Cause your heartbeat
Sets the song feel

(x2)
I dont need you
I just want you
I want you
When youll hear this
Youll know Im
Youll know

You have no soul
Its a love letter
Cause theyre playing
On your heart strings
Youre wishing
I would be well
Cause your heartbeat
Sets the song feel

(x2)
I dont need you
I just want you
I want you
When youll hear this
Youll know Im
Youll know---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
