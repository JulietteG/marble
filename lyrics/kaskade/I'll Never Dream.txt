Word's can mean or mislead
Laying the heart on the line.
For that second, you believe
A life without him, you'll survive
I try

I'm asleep but I can never dream
'Cause dreaming brings me back to you
I try to think of what the future holds
Because my past belongs to you

Lovely as a summer breeze, taking away memories
Just hoping for a miracle embracing my life without you
I try

I'm asleep but I can never dream
'Cause dreaming brings me back to you
I try to think of what the future holds
Because my past belongs to you

I'll never dream
It brings me back

I'll never dream---Lyrics submitted by yur.
