When I was young I would stand alone
With visions of worlds that were all my own
The lights in the sky weren't that far away
Living in the vastness of outer space

All my life I've been a star
Holding a light up in the dark
While I try to keep clear
Of all the waves in your atmosphere

All my life I've been a star
Holding a light up in the dark
While I try to keep clear
Of all the waves in your atmosphere
Of all the waves in your atmosphere
Of all the waves in your atmosphere

When I was young I could hear the sound
A melody pure and a rhythm loud
Oh, this sound took me away
Carried through the vastness of outer space

All my life I've been a star
Holding a light up in the dark
While I try to keep clear
Of all the waves in your atmosphere

All my life I've been a star
Holding a light up in the dark
While I try to keep clear
Of all the waves in your atmosphere
Of all the waves in your atmosphere
Of all the waves in your atmosphere

Of all the waves in your atmosphere
Of all the waves in your atmosphere
Of all the waves in your atmosphere---
