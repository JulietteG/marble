Featuring Haley

Now In the silence
I find myself alone
Its just what I wanted
To be on my own

Floating on the water
Stare at you tonight
So keep up the magic
Space of time you light

Now in this small bed
When all have gone away
Its the time that I bonded
The time that I prayed

(x2)
Floating on the water
Stare at you tonight
So keep up the magic
Space of time you light---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
