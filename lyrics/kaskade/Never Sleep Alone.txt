You know Im tired
Of living like a ghost
God only knows
Ive given more than most
I cover up scars
That emptiness has caused
When the chemicals take
Will it be me you dream of

Theres a heartbeat
Somewhere
Love, Im gonna find you there
In the darkness
Sleepless
Love, I wanna have you near
We never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone

You shake me up
The moment before sleep
Youre calling out
The demons inside me
And when theyre gone
The hours Im awake
I take these pills
And pray to god theyll take---
