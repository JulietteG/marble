Were so, were so, were so unlike
The others who run around
We dont, we dont, we dont mind
Were everything we really want

Its why we come here
Were turning, were turning round round round round
This moments so real
Were burning ,were burning down down down

Summer night
In my dream
Oh I wanna go back
Wanna go back
You were mine
We were young
You were all that I had
All that I had
Summer nights

I know, I know its just a state of mind
That separates the two of us
Because we know its just a matter of time...

Its why we come here
Were turning, were turning round round round round
This moment feels so real
Were burning, were burning down down down

Summer night
In my dream
Oh I wanna go back
Wanna go back
You were mine
We were young
You were all that I had
All that I had
Summer nights

Sing to me oh would you please
And heal my soul with harmonies
While all the people gather round
To hear your voice and feel the sound---
