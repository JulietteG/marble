It's my hope, it's my fear
It's my dream, all my tears
It's a start, it's an end
Then I start again, I start again

It's my hope, it's my fear
It's my dream, all my tears
It's a start, it's an end
Then I start again, I start again

Feelings that I don't know
Mornings when I can't go
Like I've lost my way again

Then I stumble as I rise
If you look into my eyes
There's a chance that you will get in

It's my hope, it's my fear
It's my dream, all my tears
It's a start, it's an end
Then I start again, I start again

The reason is a guess
The place where that is left
Vision's not just what I see

The world is on my side
The reason left to hide
The moments that it made me

Hold my dreams, my tears
It's the starting
Then I start again, I start again

It's my hope, it's my fear
It's my dream, all my tears
It's a start, it's an end
Then I start again, I start again

It's my hope, it's my fear
It's my dream, all my tears
It's a start, it's an end
Then I start again, I start again

It's my hope---Lyrics submitted by Kjersti.
