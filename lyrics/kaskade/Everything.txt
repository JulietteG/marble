I'm finding, the more I see you
the more I can see
Now I'm not hiding, anymore
Come on baby, let me know how you feel
Come on baby, I can see this is real

Ever since your love filled my life,
I see it's changing everything
Don't you know the way you move yeah,
It's so right, it's better than anything
You are the sun in my night, shining for me baby
Love is so right, come on I'm feeling everything

You know me, in a way like no one ever before
You hold me forever
come on baby, let me know how you feel
come on take me, I can see this is real

Ever since your love filled my life,
I see it's changing everything
Don't you know the way you move yeah,
It's so right, it's better than anything
You are the sun in my night, shining for me baby
Love is so right, come on I'm feeling everything---Lyrics submitted by Debby.
