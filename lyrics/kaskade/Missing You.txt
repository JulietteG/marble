Ive seen your eyes in a million faces
What else could I ever see but you?
Tell me your heart is the only answer
Tell me that youre feeling this way too

Tell me the only one
That youve been missing
Is the one missing you

I never thought Id run
But I made a mistake
So let me come back to you

Ive seen your eyes in a million faces
What else could I ever see but you?
Tell me your heart is the only answer
Tell me that youre feeling this way too

Tell me the only one
That youve been missing
Is the one missing you.

I never thought Id run
But I made a mistake
So let me come back to you

Tell me the only one
That youve been missing
Is the one missing you.

I never thought Id run
But I made a mistake
So let me come back to you.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
