I think I gonna buy me a gun
A nice little silver one
And in a crowd someday
You wont see it coming anyway

Maybe you been holding her hand
Or watching her shitty band
Really what did you expect
Spending moments lying in her bed

Your lies came so easily
I cant believe you think they work on me
I watched you both hide out
You didnt want the world to find out

You took your love away from me
But I am thankful, everyday
She took your love away from me, from me
And I am thankful, everyday

She took your love away from me
And I am thankful, everyday
You took your love away from me, from me
And I am thankful, everyday

But I think Im gonna buy me a gun
A nice little silver one
In a crowd someday
You wont see it coming anyway---Lyrics submitted by Maaike van der Wel.
