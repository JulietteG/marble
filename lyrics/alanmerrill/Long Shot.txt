Does anybody have enough?
I want to know
"Cos love is such a feeling
And it seems so hard to find the answers
oh yeah

Is anybody just too tough?
I gotta know
My heart is still healing
Still to out of step to be a dancer

All the pretenders have come and gone
The race is on, the pace is hot
Bet everything that I've got
On a long shot

Does everybody hurt the same?
I've got my doubts
When measuring emotions
I wonder how it feels 
To build a wall?
Oh yeah

Does everybody play a game?
I can't work out
The practice of devotion
The higher the love
The longer the fall

All the pretenders have come and gone
The race is on, the pace is hot
Bet everything that I've got
On a long shot

She's got me in the middle
She's got him on the right
She's got another on the left side
Now there's no end in sight

I need a love to keep me warm
Only time will show
If I ride out this storm
I've just got to know
'Cos it's not so complicated
See a finger of fate
When it points in your direction
Don't you wait or hesitate

All the pretenders have come and gone
The race is on, the pace is hot
Bet everything that I've got
On a long shot

All the pretenders have come and gone
The race is on, the pace is hot
Bet everything that I've got
On a long shot---Lyrics submitted by Chris Cruz.
