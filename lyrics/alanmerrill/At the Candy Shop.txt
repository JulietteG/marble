Once upon a time, in New York City
East 49th street, there around
There was a place
With wall to wall sweeties
They put the icing on this town
Pick out a girl
Go up to a room
And have a whole lot of fun
Go back downstairs
Have drink or two
Then pick another one
At The Candy Shop, yeah yeah

The madam there
A lady named "T"
She got the long black hair
I like her cousin
Little Amy Jamie
She gets me rockin' down there
There's smackie Jackie
With her bowed backside
It's just as round as it can be
And Cindy's really pretty
But she never likes to work
And Savannah's doing me for free

At The Candy Shop (at the candy shop)
You can rock until you drop
At the candy shop (at the candy shop)

If you have the money
You never have to stop At The Candy Shop

Then one sad day
The po-lice came came around
Vice moved madam "T" away
I hear she's got
A brand new house of heat
Down in sunny FLA.
Where you can
Pick out a girl
Go up to a room
And have a whole lot of fun
Go back downstairs
Have drink or two
Then pic another one

At The Candy Shop (at the candy shop)
You can rock until you drop
At the candy shop (at the candy shop)

If you have the money
You never have to stop At The Candy Shop
You can rock 'n rock 'n rock
At The Candy Shop
If you have the money
You can get the honey
At The Candy Shop
Yeah
At The Candy Shop, sexy sexy ladies
Well well, at The Candy Shop
What about Melissa, Zoe, Kimberly
"T"'s all right, Yeah
At The Candy Shop
If you have the money
You'll have a good time!---Lyrics submitted by Chris Cruz.
