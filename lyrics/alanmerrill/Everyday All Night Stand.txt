It's raining so hard today
Hope the flight's not cancelled out to L.A.
Not today
We're on at 7:30
The customs men are checking
And I'm dirty (7:30)

I play guitar
In a rock n roll band
Traveling hard
On an everyday all night stand

Bathing in the praises
Of a thousand girls with anxious faces
Oooh the praises
Sweet and strange young ladies
Come backstage so cool or acting crazy (young ladies)

I play guitar
In a rock n roll band
Traveling hard
On an everyday all night stand

Spreading reputation
Records gonna break across the nation
Reputation
Electric emotion
Open up your ears and take the potion (emotion)

I play guitar
In a rock n roll band
Traveling hard
On an everyday all night stand

I play guitar
In a rock n roll band
Traveling hard
On an everyday all night stand
An everyday all night stand
An everyday all night stand---Lyrics submitted by Chris Cruz.
