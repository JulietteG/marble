The Helium Hag, in her astral drag
From her head to her socks
She's got a heart of rock
But with a few hot licks
She's a slick wet quick
The Helium Hag (yeah yeah!)

She's got spider hips
And boot lace lips
With rubber band eyes
And black belt thighs 
She's gonna finish your body
With her bump, rub you out karate (yeah yeah!)

Look out boy
You're playing with a sorcerer's daughter
Look out boy
She's gonna use the tricks
That he taught her


Her hair is long
And she wrote this song
When she walks she floats
And she owns the oats
She invented insane
And Vanity's her real name (yeah yeah!)

Look out boy
You're playing with a sorcerer's daughter
Look out boy
She's gonna use the tricks
That he taught her

The Helium Hag, in her astral drag
From her head to her socks
She's got a heart of rock
But with a few hot licks
She's a slick wet quick
The Helium Hag (yeah yeah!)
Yeah yeah! Yeah Yeah!
