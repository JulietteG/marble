Who Am I 
Don't say it'll stay this way forever

I'm afloat in the ocean trying not to sink
I'm a crack in the asphalt you walk by in the street
I'm a falling star you'll never see
The last ? by the ?

So Who am I?

Don't say it'll stay this way forever
Don't say it'll stay this way forever

I'm the lesson you'll never learn
The sickness that was never your concern
I'm the big suprise at the end of the night
The bridge that knock at the corner of your mind

So Who am I?

Don't say it'll stay this way forever
Don't say it'll stay this way forever

Don't say it'll stay this way forever 
(you dont know, you dont dont, you never know)
Don't say it'll stay this way forever
(you dont know, you dont dont, you never know)

I'm holding on
Yes I am
Careful what i wish for
I am the knot in your stomach
The Phlem in the your throat
The message saying your not home

Don't say it'll stay this way forever
(you dont know, you dont dont, you never know)
Don't say it'll stay this way forever
(you dont know, you dont dont, you never know)

I'm afloat in the ocean trying not to sink---Lyrics submitted by Jorge.
