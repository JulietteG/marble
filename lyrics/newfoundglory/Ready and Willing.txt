I defied the odds
Dead end cul-de-sac gridded streets that felt like jail
A maze of palm trees, led to nowhere
Built my own boat so I could sail
They said, you won't make it
You're just wasting all your time
But I've got no patience
And hate to stand in lines

Ohh I'm ready and I'm willing to take you on
Ohh I'm ready and I'm willing to lose it all

I search the channels to find stations
I used to watch when I was young
Only to find a reality that's fine
Settling for dumb
There's no more heroes
No one showing us the way
So I sift through my old 45"s
To remind myself

When my back goes out, I'll know I did it all
And have stories to tell
When my eyes go bad, I'll know I've seen it all
They'll be light when my vision fails
My legs will go bad
But I walked 5 continents
So I won't need to stand
I hope this life I lived will wake you up
So you could do it again

Are you ready are you willing to take it on?
Are you ready are you willing to lose it all?---
