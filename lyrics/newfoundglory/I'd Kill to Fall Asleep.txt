Eyes open, I'm wide awake
I feel I'm in a coma state
I'll lay here on my back and watch the fan turn

Conversations cross my mind, but nothing of the speaking kind
TV images repeat there one lines

Back and forth I toss and turn
It feels like strings are holding up my eyes

I'd kill to fall asleep
I'd kill to fall asleep

Putting up a losing fight
I'll never see this end tonight
The thought of just one dream it consumes me

Numbers on the clock turn back, my pleas are having no affect
The beating of my heart keeps the time going

Back and forth I toss and turn
It feels like strings are holding up my eyes

I'd kill to fall asleep
I'd kill to fall asleep

They say that when you sleep your body's at rest
I wouldn't know what sleep felt like if I tried my best
Polaroids and memories can fade away, so can I...

Back and forth I toss and turn
It feels like strings are holding up my eyes

I'd kill to fall asleep
I'd kill to fall asleep

I'd kill to fall asleep
I'd kill to fall asleep

I'd kill....---Lyrics submitted by tony.
