Everything that could have went wrong, went wrong this year.
Nothing recently has made me want to stand up and cheer.
Everything you haven't said has finally come back to you.
Now is not the time. Now is not the time.

I know you never liked any gifts I gave to you...
This holiday is overrated.
It turned out the way I expected.
This holiday is one to forget.
Another year, this time I'll regret that I spent too much time and money on you.

Why do I only remember the bad times we had?
I guess everything we do does reflect.
Everything you wish you said, has finally come back to you.
Now is not the time...No no, it's not the time.

I know you never liked any gifts I gave to you...
This holiday is overrated.
It turned out the way I expected.
This holiday is one to forget.
Another year, this time I'll regret that I spent too much time and money on you.

This holiday is overrated.
It turned out the way I expected.
This holiday is one to forget.
Another year, not another year.

This holiday is overrated.
It turned out the way I expected.
This holiday is one to forget.
Another year, no not another year.

I hope you spend it alone.---Lyrics submitted by angela.
