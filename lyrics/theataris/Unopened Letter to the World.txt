If i died tomorrow, will this song live on forever?
Here is my....
...unopened letter to a world
that never shall reply.

If i died tomorrow, will this song live on forever?
Here is my....unopened letter to a world
that never shall reply, never shall reply.

From this second story window 
i can hear the church bells calling out my name
This table is set for one.
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town.

On random notes of parchment, im scrawling my existance, dressed in white.
This candle radiates throughout the night
and its never burning out, never burning out.

From this second story window, i can hear the children down on main street
They're singing their songs tonight.
In the shadows i will listen to their every movement.

Mr. Higginson, am i not good enough for the world?
am i destined only to die, the same that i lived....
in seclusion.

From high upon this mountain i can almost see your lonley windsill
They'll carry you off tonight. 
There's a ghost in your old bedroom and a candle burning bright.

If i died tomorrow, will this song live on forever?---Lyrics submitted by Enid.
