I start up in the sky
Go slowly passing by
The lights below
Spell out your name
You're comfort on my mind
And you're with me all the time
And lots of feelings I can't explain

I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone

Out of every girl I might
No other can compete
I'd ditch them all for a night with you
I know you don't believe
You mean this much to me
But I promise you that I do

I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone

If I had one wish this is what it would be
I'd ask you to spend all your time here with me
And we'd be together forever
We'd buy a small house in south central LA
Raise lots of kids then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a quik-e-mart for you
I'd go to the pound an let all the cats go free
Just as long as you'd be with me

I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone---Lyrics submitted by charlie.
