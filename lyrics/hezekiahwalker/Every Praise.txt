Every word of worship with one accord 
Every praise every praise is to our God. 
Sing hallelujah to our God 
Glory hallelujah is due our God 
Every praise every praise is to our God. 

God my Savior 
God my Healer 
God my Deliverer 
Yes He is, yes He is 

Yes He is, yes He is (repeat) 

Every praise is to our God. 
Every word of worship with one accord 

Every praise every praise (repeat) 
Is to our God---
