People come
People go
Your life has been
Out of control
Youre confuse
Dont worry your soul

It will get better
Better
It will get better
Better
It will get better
God is in control

Find your praise
Within your heart
Hold it close
Dont ever depart
It gets cold in the night
But youll be alright

It will get better
Better
It will get better
Better
It will get better
God is in control

Whatever state I find myself in
I learn how to be secure
Knowing that God
Will supply all my need
And it works out for my good

It will get better
Better...

God Hes in control... ---
