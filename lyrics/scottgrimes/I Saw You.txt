I saw you
Don't think you saw me
''cause if you did
You wouldn't be this way
You'd wanna know what's on my mind

Don't call me lover
''cause I don't know who would answer
There seems to be two of us in that boat right now
So I guess I'll sail away

I heard you might be lonely
And you got no time for me
Well I've never seen that face before
It's something I guess I'll never see

I heard you might be leaving me
Guess my life will go on without you
Guess there's no good way to say goodbye
So I'll be on my way

I heard you might be lonely
And you got no time for me
Ooh, well I've never seen that face before
It's something I guess I'll never see, no

I saw you
Don't think you saw me
''cause if you did, you wouldn't be this way
You'd wanna know what's on my mind

I heard you might be lonely
And you got no time for me
Well I've never seen that face before
It's something I guess I'll never see, no, yeah
Never seen that face before, hey yeah yeah
Don't take me, hurt me, heart away
''cause I got something to say...---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
