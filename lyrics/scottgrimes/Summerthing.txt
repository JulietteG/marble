It was almost a year ago
Walkin' down Beach Blvd, quarter to nine
It was dark and the moon was low
Nothin' going on about when she caught my eye

I looked left and you looked right
I knew right there you were mine tonight
The only thought to think was
I was hoping she was over twenty-one

Had a fake tatoo painted on her right hand
And blue jeans on, walkin' in the sand
I thought, I'm not Mr Right, but I'm mister right now
Then I walked up to her and said how ya do
She looked and me and said who are you
I said, I'm the one you want
I'm the one you need
My summerthing

Ten days and a week had passed
And we're still going at it like a honeymoon
I know she knows it'll never last
But I'm hoping that it doesn't end real soon

I came down and you were here
Flowers on the table and a nice cold beer
You asked me what I thought when I saw you for the very first time

You had a fake tattoo painted on your right hand
And no shoes on, walkin' in the sand
I thought, I'm not Mr Right but I'm mister right now
Then I walked up to you and I said hi
You looked at me and said who's this guy
I said, I'm the one you want
I'm the one you need

My summerthing
My golden ring
My sunset fling
My summerthing
Then I started to smile
Thought I'd stay for awhile

I looked left and you looked right
I knew right there you were mine for life
The only though to think was you
What once was one is now for two
So will you take my ring?
''cause now you're my forever summerthing

You had a fake tattoo painted on your right hand
And no shoes on, walkin' in the sand
I thought, I'm not Mr Right but I'm mister right now
Then I walked up to you and I said hi
You looked at me and said who's this guy
I'm the one you want
I'm the one you need
My summerthing
My summerthing
My summerthing
My summerthing---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
