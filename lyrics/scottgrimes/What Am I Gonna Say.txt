Venus has fallen from the skies
Scattering stardust in my eyes
How could you think that these were tears for you
The higher you build a dream, the harder it can fall
Now I find i've lost a love I never owned at all
Love is the sweetest lullaby
Makes you forget to question why
Though it was never what you meant to do
Maybe it's crazy but it's true
My love's a fact
And it amazes me how much I need to get you back

What am I gonna say
What am I gonna do
Maybe it's best to stand in line
Leaving it in the hands of time
Now what am I gonna say
I'm the one you used to love
The smiles we shared are fading like the stars at break of day
What am I gonna say

How can I tell my friends you're gone
When I don't know where we went wrong
Everyone said we were the perfect pair
Is it too soon, is it too late
To make it right
Can I get through to you
If we should chance to meet tonight

What am I gonna say
What am I gonna do
Maybe it's best to stand in line
Leaving it in the hands of time
Now what am I gonna say
I'm the one you used to love
The smiles we shared are fading like the stars at break of day
What am I gonna say

Ooooh Is it too soon, is it too late
To make it right
Can I get through to you
If we should chance to meet tonight

Now what am I gonna say
What am I gonna do
Maybe it's best to stand in line
Leaving it in the hands of time
What am I gonna say
I'm the one you used to love
The smiles we shared are fading like the stars at break of day
What am I gonna say

What am I gonna say
What am I gonna do
Maybe it's best to stand in line
Leaving it in the hands of time
What am I gonna say
I'm the one you used to love
The smiles we shared are fading like the stars at break of day
What am I gonna say
Now what am i gonna say ---
