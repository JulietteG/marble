Just because there's a chip on your shoulder
It doesn't mean it matters to me
If there's something you think you'll never get over
You're gonna have to prove it to me

If you think of yourself as always alone
That's exactly what you'll be
But if it's loneliness you want to overcome
Sooner or later, you're gonna have to trust somebody

You see the way it works is a matter of taste
You can give any way you want
If you're waiting for someone to let themselves in
You may have to wait too long

You just hide your heart
It's such a waste of time, more than you will ever know
So let it fall apart and step on over the line
'Cause sooner or later, you're gonna have to trust somebody

(Hit me!)

There's a moon on the rise and the sun as it dies
Is slippin' down behind the hill
Take the house it hides, a lonely woman inside
With too much time to kill

She just hides her heart
It's such a waste of time, more than she will ever know
So let it fall apart and step on over the line
'Cause sooner or later
(Sooner or later) Sooner or later
You're gonna have to trust somebody---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
