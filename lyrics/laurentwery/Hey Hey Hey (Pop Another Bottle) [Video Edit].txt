Hey hey hey
Pop another bottle
Fill every one cup
Hey hey hey
Who got cheese,
Tell that fool "Roll another up"
Hey hey hey
We dont give a damn
No we dont give a wha-
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
[x2]

Uh, supplying the man
Supply the girls well
Because I am the man, ah-ah
Drop jewels, every jewels
Is natural babe, I ain't trying to be cool
I am the sh*t, I drop champagne
Y'all pop sh*t while I pop champagne
I, took off like a rockets man
Can't chase it in space
When I switch lanes
RnB, House, Rapper
Girls bounce on my lap like a laptop
Still meant that girls make an assdrop
Yo winnin' team throw another backdrop
Guy, I heard enough
Quick stop
Y'all exit fifty for haircut
Blast this sh-, tear the crown
S T F U

Hey hey hey
Pop another bottle
Fill every one cup
Hey hey hey
Who got cheese,
Tell that fool "Roll another up"
Hey hey hey
We dont give a damn
No we dont give a wha-
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
[x2]

[Dev]
Don't make it stop
You 'bout to pop
I-Island hop
Whip-jumping chop-chop
Money leaking and I
Woke up speaking
All that cheeky tongue
I can't stop this - too fun

Uh, so let's roll with it
Don't play like you ain't feeling it
Outside looking like you wanna be in it
Losers is best to switch teams, we winning
No ship for beach, 80 in it
Raise your 60, could just get in it
I'm still Jordan, I rescue did it
I confess, I'm the best, no contest
I've been send here to make it hot
No guitar will ever make you rock
Tilt your head back, take a shot
Virgin to this, well I'ma make it pop
No red light can ever make you stop
Got the green light to light that green
And again never stop
Cause we got it if you like that clean
Now get something to light my team

Hey hey hey
Pop another bottle
Fill every one cup
Hey hey hey
Who got cheese,
Tell that fool "Roll another up"
Hey hey hey
We dont give a damn
No we dont give a wha-
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
[x2]

[Dev]
I light another one up
Hit another homerun
In the midnight sun
With my machine gun
So why don't you come over
Let's have a drink, or two
Some late night dreams
Some deja-vu's

Hey hey hey
Pop another bottle
Fill every one cup
Hey hey hey
Who got cheese,
Tell that fool "Roll another up"
Hey hey hey
We dont give a damn
No we dont give a wha-
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
