My pain is self-chosen
At least so the prophet says
I could either burn
Or cut off my pride and buy some time
A head full of lies is the weight tied to my waist

The River of Deceit flows down
The only direction we go is down

Down, oh down
Down, oh down
Down, oh down
Down, oh down

My pain is self-chosen
At least I beleive it to be
I could either drown
Or pull off my skin and swim to shore
Now I can grow a beautiful
Shell for all to see

The River of Deceit pulls down
The only direction we flow is down

Down, oh down
Down, oh down
Down, oh down
Down, oh down

My pain is self-chosen
Our pain is self-chosen

Down, oh down
Down, oh down
Down, oh down
Down, oh down---Lyrics submitted by Kimberlie.
