I lost my way, but found today
Somebody needed me
Needed me to open up the door
Closed before (uh), thats what Im here for
Now could you help me, find my way back home

So leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
And I will shine
Maybe then I can see
You are my destiny
You and I keepin love alive til the last tear is cried

For all time, youre a friend of mine
And I want to thank you
I thank you, for always being there
Any where, where only fools would dare
And now here I am, my friend 
Reaching out my hand, needing you again

Leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
So I will shine
Maybe then I can see
That you are my destiny
You and I keepin love alive til the last tear is cried

So leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
I will shine
Maybe then I can see
That you are my destiny
You and I keepin love alive til the last tear is cried

Leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
I will shine
Maybe then I can see
That you are my destiny---Lyrics submitted by T.
