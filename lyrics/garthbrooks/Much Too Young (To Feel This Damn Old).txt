This old highway is getting longer
Seems there aint no end in sight
To sleep would be best
But I just cant afford the rest
I got a ride to Denver tomorrow night

I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks aint no one been home
Guess shes through with me
To tell the truth I just cant see what kept the woman holding on this long

And the white lines are getting longer and the saddle is getting cold
And Im much too young to feel this damn old
All the cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
And Im much too young to feel this damn old

The competition is getting younger
Tougher broncs you know I cant recall
A worn out tape of Chris Ledoux, lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends Ive left at all

And the white lines are getting longer and the saddle is getting cold
And Im much too young to feel this damn old
All the cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
And Im much too young to feel this damn old

Lord Im much too young to feel this damn old---Lyrics submitted by jason.
