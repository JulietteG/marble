In another's eyes
I'm someone who
Loves her enough to walk away from you
I'd never cheat, I would never lie
In another's eyes

In another's eyes
I can do no wrong
He believes in me and his faith is strong
I'd never fall or even compromise
In another's eyes

In another's eyes
I'm afraid that I can't see
This picture perfect portrait
That they paint of me
They don't realize
And I pray they never do
'Cause every time I look I'm seein' you
In another's eyes

In another's eyes
Starin' back at me
I see a sinking soul trying desperately
To turn the tide before it dies
In another's eyes

And what they don't see is killing me
And it's a blessing and a curse that love is blind

In another's eyes
I'm afraid that I can't see
This picture perfect portrait
That they paint of me
They don't realize
And I pray they never do
'Cause every time I look I'm seein' you
In another's eyes
In another's eyes
In another's eyes---Lyrics submitted by Christina.
