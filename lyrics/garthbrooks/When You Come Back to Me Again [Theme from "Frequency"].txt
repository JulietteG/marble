Theres a ship out on the ocean,
At the mercy of the sea.
Its been tossed about,
Lost and broken,
Wandring aimlessly.
And God somehow you know,
That ship is me.

Cause theres a lighthouse,
In a harbor,
Shining faithfully.
Pouring its light out,
Across the water.
For this sinking soul to see,
That someone out there still believes in me.

On a prayer,
In a song,
I hear your voice,
And it keeps me hanging on.
Oh, raining down, against the wind.
Im reaching out,
Till we reach the circles end.
When you come back to me again.

Theres a moment,
That we all come to.
In our own time and in our own space.
Where all that weve done,
We can undo,
If our hearts in the right place.

On a prayer,
In a song,
I hear your voice,
And it keeps me hanging on.
Oh, raining down, against the wind.
Im reaching out,
Till we reach the circles end.
And you come back to me again.

And again I see,
My yesterdays in front of me,
Unfolding like a mystery.
Youre changing all that is and used to be.

On a prayer,
In a song,
I hear your voice,
And it keeps me hanging on.
Oh, raining down, against the wind.
Im reaching out,
Till we reach the circles end.
When you come back to me again.

When you come back to me again.---Lyrics submitted by Bridget.
