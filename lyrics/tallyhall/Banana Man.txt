Do you see banana man 
Hopping over on the white hot sand 
Here he come with some for me 
Freshly taken from banana tree 
(1,2,3,4) 
Banana man me want a tan 
Give me double on the bonus one 
Give me more for all me friends 
Dis banana flow never end 

Do you want a banana? 
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm 
Do you want a banana? 
Dis banana for you 

Tonight we dance around the flame 
Then we get to play the spirit game 
Spirit names we shout out loud 
Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud 
Morning songbirds in the tree 
Chant a tune to let the spirits free 
Then we see them in the night 
Spirits jumpin by the fire light 

Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana) 
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm 
Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana) 
Dis banana for you 
( oh ho ho) (ahhh) 

Look you your too uptight you know 
You can laugh and kick it back and go (weee) 
But without a rhythm or a rhyme 
You do not banana all the time 
Fly away from city on the run 
Try to make a little fun 
(ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh) 

Look you come to the bungalo 
Africans you tell me dont you so 
Dont you love the pumping of the drum 
Make you shake until the bum go numb 
Let the bungo play you till you drop 
Dis banana never stop (never stop, never stop) 

Forget all your troubles and go with the flow 
Forget about whatever you may never know 
Like whether whatever you are doing is whatever you should and whether anything you do is every really any good 
And then Forget about banana when it sticks in your throat 
And when they make you wanna bellow but your stuck in a choke and you forget about the yell from the colorful men that'll make you take another one and make a mock of your plan 

Bungale Bungalo make up your mind and tell me no ummmm shhh 

Well its nine o'clock and its getting dark 
and the sun is falling from the sky 
I've never left so early and you may wonder why 
*whistle* 

(talking in the background - srry i cant get what they're saying) 

Tomorow morning on the plane 
No banana make you go insane 
Floating back to busy town 
No banana make you want to frown 

Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana) 
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm 
Do you want a banana? 
Dis banana for 
you---Lyrics submitted by onesidedfilms.
