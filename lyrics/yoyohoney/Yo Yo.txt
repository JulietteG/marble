All the streets have gone to sleep 
mama earths a shell, shell, shell 
all the queens have gone to rest 
its time for freaks to coo, coo, coo, choo. 
Ooh let me in 
Ooh let me in 
Where do you go when no-one cares 
do you! lead your cares to someone else 
throw the dice and take your chance 
hope to god its all in fate
Ooh let me in 
Ooh let me in 

Yo, Yo, Yo 
Yo, Yo, Yo 

I still want you 
I still want you 

Yo, Yo, Yo 
Yo, Yo, Yo 

Only boy who had good sin 
only boy who broke my mind 
the only boy who made good sex 
has made his bed and gone to rest 
Ooh let me in 
Ooh let me in 

Where do you go when no-one cares 
do you lead your cares to someone else 
throw the dice and take a chance 
hope to god its all in fate. 

Ooh let me in 
Ooh let me in, 

Yo, Yo, Yo
Yo, Yo, Yo 

I still want you 
I still want you.
