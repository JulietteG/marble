Deep down inside 
there's a place for you 
Deep down inside 
there's a place to stay 
Inside this love 
there's a place for you to stay 
Deep down inside 
there's a place for you 

Inside this love 
there's a place if you decide to stay. 

Deep down inside 
there's a place for you 
Deep down inside 
there's a place to stay 
Inside this whirl 
there's a place for you to stay 
Don't say a word 
there's a place for you 

Inside this love 
there's a place if you decide to stay 
Inside this love.
