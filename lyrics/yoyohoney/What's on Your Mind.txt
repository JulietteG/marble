What's on your mind 
like the moon 
then its yours. 
Imagine your world 
next to mine 
we'd look so promising up there 
so come on, come out 
come on, come out 

What's on your mind 
this is a call for your lovelife 
this is a call for your lovelife 
for What's on your mind 
this is a call for your lovelife 
this is a call for your lovelife. 

When you say that those eyes 
won't forgive me if I looked up at you 
against myself, 
well, somethings 
pressing; velvet 
and there's not a sign to be seen 
so come on, come out 
come on, come out 

What's on your mind 
this is a call for your lovelife 
this is a call for your lovelife 
for What's on your mind 
this is a call for your lovelife 
this Is a call for your lovelife. 

Baby Its your 
lovellfe. 
Baby its your 
lovelife. 
Baby its your 
lovelife. 
Baby its yours. 
lovelife.---Lyrics submitted by --.
