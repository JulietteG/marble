God you've hit your man hard 
you've hurt your super babies 
Oh God you've hit your man hard 
your super senseless babies 
and its the way they hurt when they drop 
that sends a cold chill flowing through me 

and when the weather fails 
and the weathers vain, you just 

Groove on. Groove on 
Groove on, Groove on. 

I am superstitious maybe 
but I am higher than all the angels 
I am super senseless maybe 
but I am higher than all the angels 
with the love we make when its cold 
it sends a cold chill flowing through me 

and when the weather fails 
and the weathers vain, you just 

Groove on, Groove on 
Groove on, Groove on 
When the music gets you high 
Groove on 
When the music gets you high 
Groove on.
