They fill the air with ease
From the back of the throat
And through the teeth
It's all in the way
You place each phrase
Do it delicately
And watch the pace

I've never been cut so deep
No you weren't ever there to save me
This could have lasted forever
You won't find better
No, no
Now that I'm (x2)
N-N-N-N-N-Now that I'm gone, gone, gone
I dare you to move on, on, on
This could have lasted forever
You won't find better
No, no
Now that I'm (x2)
N-N-N-N-N-Now that I'm gone

When all the smoke clears
There won't be anything left
Call it what you want
This is the last line you'll cross
You're only as sick as your secrets
It's all in the way
You place each phrase
Do it delicately
And watch your fucking pace

I've never been cut so deep
No you weren't ever there to save me
This could have lasted forever
You won't find better
No, no
Now that I'm (x2)
N-N-N-N-N-Now that I'm gone, gone, gone
I dare you to move on, on, on
This could have lasted forever
You won't find better
No, no
Now that I'm (x2)
N-N-N-N-N-Now that I'm gone

Is this what you wanted?

Look how you ended up.---Lyrics submitted by Breonna Nicole.
