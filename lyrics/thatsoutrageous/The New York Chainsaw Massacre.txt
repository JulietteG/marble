Show me one fucking reason why I shouldn't break your knees
I'll tear you limb by limb
Then you'll know what real pain is!

Hearing you scream is so appealing
(Fuck yeah)

I'm gonna take my time tonight,
They won't find you in the morning
Cause you'll be locked up in my trunk
And I'll be on my way
To dig your grave
And drown you in the kerosene
Cause I'm feeling kinda hot tonight, yeah
I'm feeling hot tonight

Listen close, listen close
When I'm fucking talking
You'll never guess what's in store for you

Listen close, listen close
When I'm talking
The consequences are way past due

Look at me, look at me
One more fucking time
I swear this will be the last face you ever see

Look at me, look at me
One more time
And beg for mercy

You turned your back on me
When I needed you most
Look at me now,
I'm on top of the world
Yeah

Get fucked!

Listen close, look at me, I'm care fucking free---Lyrics submitted by isiah wigley.
