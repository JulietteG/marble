Though you can't intimidate the trees
A snowman sweating in a terrible breeze
Put on your new pants move out to France

(Chorus)
All the skeletons in your closet
Are rummaging through your clothes
Looking through your shoe boxes and pockets
Gum wrappers and dumb love notes

People say your brain is like cream cheese
Takes the shape of anything you please
The dust from the trail's under your fingernails

(Chorus)

The leaves in the Luxembourg Garden
Are showing their true colors
They're blushing they're begging your pardon
'Cuz times a jealous lover

I recall the first time
That you passed me by
And I saw my demise
In your stained glass eyes

(Chorus)

Canary singing through the calico teeth

Everything's exactly what it seems---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
