The past is a Pandora's Box
And truth is just a paradox
Like promising to never lie
Let sleeping dogs and lovers lie

You say our love is immortal
Like the blood a sea turtle
But wasn't dear Dorian Gray
Lone as an asteroid in space

(Pre-chorus)
The clock puts its hands round
The hour glass waist

(Chorus)
Like a tree that falls alone
In the woods without a sound
I can't be sure that I exist
When you are not around

From Socrates to Aristotle 
Man's greatest thoughts and deeds
Are mere love notes in cheap beer bottles
Floating out to sea

We placed our bets about his fate
Standing over Schroedinger's grave
As Pavlov's dog chased the cat
His heart bled like a red Rorschach

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus x3)---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
