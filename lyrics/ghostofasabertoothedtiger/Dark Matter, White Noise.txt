Breakfast at the Adlon
My rabbit felt hat on
Paper's filled with clones and bombings
Ugly origami
DNA is our rag doll
Mammoths and Neanderthals
On welfare and adderall 
Plutonium at the shopping mall
Now the bees speak Chinese and
The moon's made of American cheese

(Chorus)
Wake me in a thousand years
When computers can shed tears
Do I have to die before I see
The pigs fly and the fat lady sings

Water's more precious than gold
Even jokes never get old
There's no need to fear laugh lines
Latex skin cannot feel time
Vending machines for memories
Bubble gum and tabloid dreams

(Pre-chorus)
Dark matter and white noise seem
Like ebony and ivory
After all the entropy
We look like black and white noise

(Chorus)

Arms and legs in thrift stores
Celebrity sweat sold to the poor
Choose more than your baby's name
Liz Taylor's eyes 
And Hawking's brain
If you've forgotten how to feel
4DTV can make it real

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
