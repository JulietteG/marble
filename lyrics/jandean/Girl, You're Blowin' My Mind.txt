Flusterations hang up the day
Troubles come my way
Hidden feelings darkness finds
Nighttime's one big grind
I'm blowin' my mind

I'm sacked out most of the day
I just can't make it no way
I'm nowhere till we make love baby
That's when I unwind
Girl, you're blowin' my mind

I see blazin' colors flashin' 'cross my ceilin'
I can't let go, this universe is reelin'
Now don't you dig the same thing that I'm feelin'?
Now don't you know the kind of glow I'm revealin'?

I'm walkin' 'round in a daze
I see the world through a haze
But when you're right here by my side
A different guy you'll find
Girl, you're blowin' my mind

I see blazin' colors flashin' 'cross my ceilin'
I can't let go, this universe is reelin'
Now don't you dig the same thing that I'm feelin'?
Now don't you know the kind of glow I'm revealin'?

I'm walkin' 'round in a daze
I see the world through a haze
But when you're right here by my side
A different guy you'll find
Girl, you're blowin' my mind

Girl, you're blowin' my mind---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
