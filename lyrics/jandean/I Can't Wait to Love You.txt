Yeah, Ive got a strong urge to love you, you know it keeps getting stronger.
If I dont see you soon I just cant hold out much longer.
Now you may have know lots of others who had a talent to kiss you
But I know youll forget them when I show you how Ive missed you.

I cant wait to love you, I cant wait to kiss you, I cant wait to squeeze you.
I cant wait to hold you, I cant wait to touch you, I cant wait to please you.

I was gettin tired of existin because life didnt inspire me.
But now youve turned my mind on since Ive found that you desire me.

I cant wait to love you, I cant wait to kiss you, I cant wait to squeeze you.
I cant wait to hold you, I cant wait to touch you, I cant wait to please you.

I was gettin tired of existin because life didnt inspire me.
But now youve turned my mind on since Ive found that you desire me.---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
