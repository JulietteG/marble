No Sadness,
cause Ill take good care of you.
Dont be blue.
The sun will shine right on through.
So baby dont you worry.

Well be friends now.
We will be just like one.
Havin fun.
A run and playn in the sun.
No one can ever hurt you.

You can come with me,
to the mountains or the sea,
 if you want too.
Everything that is mine,
 you can have it thats just fine,
 with me now.

So smile now.
Arent you glad youre here with me? 
Here with me?
Is where you will always be.

So baby dont you worry.
So baby dont you worry.
So baby dont you worry.---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
