Today I Know my mind
I haven't any fear
And I can see for miles and miles
My destination's clear

Now I can see my life
Unfolding before me
And so I will start my trip
In search of love and life that's free

Today I know my mind
I haven't any fear
And I can see for miles and miles
My destination's clear

The meaning of my life
Was cloudy yesterday
But now that my, my eyes can see
I know that I can find the way

I know my mind
And yesterday is past
Gone with tomorrow's dreams
And plans that could not last

I have the right
To stay here or to leave
To live my life
To seek and to believe

Today I Know my mind
I haven't any fear
And I can see for miles and miles
My destination's clear

Now I can see my life
Unfolding before me
And this hour of my life
It seems like an eternity

Today I know my mind---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
