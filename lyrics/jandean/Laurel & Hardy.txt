Laurel and Hardy where are you?
Stan and Ollie we love you

In a world grown complicated
It comes as quite a surprise
That a couple of simple people
Are still masters in our eyes

Many times you've seen them laughing
Spreading joy for all to see
Mister Laurel, Mister Hardy
I'll tell you what they mean to me

Roller coasters on the rainbow
Running on like endless time
With Stan and Ollie in the front
And Maharishi back behind

Years have passed and they're still here
With a smile that time can't void
And laughter rings throughout the world
For their art preserved on celluloid

In a world filled with confusion
I just want to go back when
Life was filled with simple pleasures
Will they come again?

They were born to put the world on
Slapstick clowning fancy free
Mister Laurel, Mister Hardy
I'll tell you what they mean to me

Roller coasters on the rainbow
Reaching far across the sky
Mister Laurel and Mister Hardy
Never really said goodbye

Many times I've seen them laughing
Many times they've made me cry
And I know they keep folks happy
In that laugh-in in the sky

(Spoken)

OLLIE: What are you trying to do? Can't you stay awake without getting into mischief?

STAN: Well I can't stay awake if I've got nothing to occupy my mind.

OLLIE: I'll give you something to occupy your mind.---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
