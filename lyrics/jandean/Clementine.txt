In a cavern, in a canyon excavating for a mine.
Lived a miner forty niner and his offspring Clementine.

Light she was and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine.
Herring boxes, without topses, that's my chick dear, Clementine.

Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine!
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water ev'ry morning just at nine.
Hit her foot against a splinter and toppled into the foaming brine, Clementine.

Her ruby lips above the water, blowing bubbles, soft and fine.
But, alas, I was no swimmer so I lost fair Clementine.

Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine!
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine

In my dreams she still does haunt me robed in garments soaked with brine.
For in life I used to squeeze her, now she's dead, poor Clementine.---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
