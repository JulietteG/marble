Hate
Hate, Hate
Hate
Hate, Hate, Hate

Love is here to stay
And hearts are open wide
Happiness breaks down
The lonely walls inside

So stay awhile with me
Oh loves come late
When you let hate
Build a place to hide

Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate
Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate
Hate, Hate, Hate

Love
Love

Hate 
Hate

Up and down
And all around

Love and be free
Don't waste your love silently
Silently
Silently

Hate
Hate, Hate
Hate
Hate, Hate, Hate

Love is here for you
Just take the time to ride
High above the fears
You've buried deep inside


So stay awhile with me
Oh loves come late
When you let hate
Put your heart aside

Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate
Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate
Hate, Hate, Hate

Love
Love

Hate 
Hate

Up and down
And all around

Love and be free
Don't waste your love silently
Silently
Silently

Silently---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
