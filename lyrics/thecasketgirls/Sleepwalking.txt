There will be no starting over
It'll just be over
The terrifying and the divine law
(Can't find it)

This road only goes so far
Firefly caught in a bell jar
We all know death is a big black dog

But I'm not afraid to die
I'm willing to go before my time
You won't see me sleepwalking (sleepwalking)
I'm not afraid of death
Maybe I'll finally catch my breath
You won't find me sleepwalking (sleepwalking)

Sleeptalking won't get you nowhere
No devil's deal's gonna end fair
No angel on your shoulder's gonna save you now
(Can't find it)

Last night I dreamt I was homo
No fingerprint no hand to hold
I woke up, cold to the bone

But I'm not afraid to die
I'm willing to go before my time
You won't see me sleepwalking (sleepwalking)
I'm not afraid of death
Maybe I'll finally catch my breath
You won't find me sleepwalking (sleepwalking)

I'm not afraid of death
Maybe I'll finally catch my breath
You won't find me sleepwalking (sleepwalking)---Lyrics submitted by EmilyRose Thorne.
