All around you are wasted plans
Everywhere you look no matter where you stand
Don't get caught with the dead man's hand

Buried my heart in the cigarette sand
Back of a club in Chicago land
We got drunk off the whiskey brand
We're all the same when you can't stand

Don't get caught with the dead man's hand
Playing with fire in the heart land
Don't get caught with the dead man's hand

Don't get caught with the dead man's hand
Playing with fire in the heart land
Don't get caught with the dead man's hand---Lyrics submitted by Jameson Clifton.
