You're a women without a clue, you're a friend of no-ones too 
Keeping track of your lies must be hard for someone new, so-o 
Better not try to get inside my head, you'll find a nightmare waiting 
You, make it worse 
Leave it to the ones who know me, playing that game will only hurt you 
You make it worse and never better 

Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up 
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain 

I'm a girl who sees a fraud, im suspicious and keeping notes 
Watching you go through my friends, waiting here to make my move so-o 
Give an inch you'll take a mile, pulling me down to push yourself up 
You make it worse and never better 

Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up 
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain 
Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up 
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain 

You're so completely twisted, you're so completely evil 
You're so completely wrong 
But here I am still stuck with you 

Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up 
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain 
Manipulating woman, you're making friends and using them all up 
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain 
Manipulating woman, manipulating woman, manipulating woman 
You're making friends and using them all up 
Manipulating woman, manipulating woman, manipulating woman 
You must be used to the pain---Lyrics submitted by Charley.
