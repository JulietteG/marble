I see youve got another bad line,
Youre playing rhythm and its out of time
Youre holding tickets to your one man show
But I can tell you something you dont know 

Na na na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na
Get back, back to the track, get back, back to the trak
Na na na, na na na na na

You do what you want and you play what you want 
But its shit what you do and it sucks what yu play
Its professional suicude, professional suicide
Saving all youve got for a rainy day

Youre always baggin me behind my back
You must be making up for what you lack
I see you had a hit back in 89
Too bad we all dontt age as good as wine

Na na na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na
Get back, back to the track, get back, back to the track
Na na na, na na na na na

You do what you want and you play what you want
But its shit what you do and it sucks what you play
Its professional suicude, professional suicide
Saving all youve got for rainay day

You do what you want and you play what you want
But its shit  what you do and it sucks what you play 
Its professional suicude, professional suicide
Saving all youve got for rainy day---Lyrics submitted by frida.
