so long sweet summer
i stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays
so long sweet slumber
i fell into you, now you're gracefully falling away

hey thanks, thanks for that summer
it's cold where you're going, i hope that your heart's always warm
i gave you the best, i gave you the best that i had
you passed on the letters and passed on the best that i had, so

so long sweet summer 
i stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays
so long sweet slumber
i fell into you, now your're gracefully falling away

i hate the winter in lexington
i hate the winter in lexington
lexington
lexington
