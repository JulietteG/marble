So quiet; another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale; another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed

Please tell me you're just feeling tired
See, it's more than that, i feel that i might break
Out of touch, Out of time

Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
Cuz i can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?

Closed lips; another goodnight kiss
it's robbed of all its passion
Your grip; another time this slack it leaves me feeling empty

Please tell me you're just feeling tired
See, it's more than that, i feel that i might break
Out of touch, Out of time

Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
Cuz i can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?

I'll wait until tomorrow; maybe you'll feel better then
Maybe we'll be better then
So what's another day; when i can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you

This mood of yours is temporary
It seems worth the wait to see your smile again
Out of the corner of my eye will be the only way you're looking at me then

So quiet; another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale; another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed---Lyrics submitted by Jenna.
