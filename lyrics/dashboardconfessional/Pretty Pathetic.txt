You should have heard me sobbing,
as i drove home that night.
Got in to bed and stayed there,
for days i just laid there.
Having been permanently changed, 
but we wont get into that now.
Lets take it from the start.

You should have seen me smiling,
like the world was mine.
She used to call me baby,
softly sometimes.

But if i dwell on those days to long,
i'll feel like my life is over.
And thats no good,
so lets move on.

To the part were i begin to sense her distance.
I panic and hold on tighter,
that makes it worse.
How am i suppose to take it when she says,
'This is something i'm going through, it's got nothing to do with you."

I had a special evening all planned out,
desperately, determined to reignite some spark between us.
She had to feel something for me,

A love as strong as ours, doesn't just go away, 
you cant just turn it off.
Unless she was lying all those times.
But i don't think so. 
I really don't think so.

The way she used to look at me,
made me a thousand feet high.
The meaning of the word 'cool'.
Not the same geek,
who fumbled with his words that night,
The ugliest night.

I said some pretty awkward things.
I got the feeling she felt sorry for me.
I should have seen it was hopeless,
and left it alone.
But i had to go on embarrassing my self.

I miss what we had, i need you so badly.
I miss what we had, i need you so badly.
I miss what we had, i need you so badly.
I miss what we had, i need you so badly.

I must have sounded pretty pathetic i know.
That's why i don't blame her for what she said.
But listening to me, really, we don't know each other to well.
But you're so easy to talk to.
I feel i can tell you almost anything.
I hope i haven't put you off.
I have a tendency to do that.
Why don't i just be quiet?---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
