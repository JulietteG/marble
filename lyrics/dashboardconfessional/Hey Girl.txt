Hey girl, youve got a smart way about you
that makes me wish that
that I was smart enough for you.

Hey girl, youve got a fine laugh,
and I think that I could get used to that.
And youre already used to laughing at me.

So what if your friends think Im crazy, well
I wasnt trying to impress those girls anyway.
Theyre all theory, no action,
and where Im from we live
like its the latest attraction.

Hey girl, youve got a short fuse,
and Ive got designs on lighting you up,
and setting you off,
and watching you burn for me.

The world lives for the weekend
Well, I'll watch as my weeks
bleed right into them
Without a line to divide what is theirs
and what is mine

So what if your friends think Im crazy, well
I wasnt trying to impress those girls anyway.
Theyre all theory, no action,
and where Im from we live
like its the latest attraction.

And go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
everyones gotta get bottom
bottomed out in the long run
and those are the times you need love.---Lyrics submitted by francis.
