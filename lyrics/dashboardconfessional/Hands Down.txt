breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep
this air is blessed, you share with me
this night is wild, so calm and dull
these hearts they race from self control
your legs are smooth as they graze mine
were doing fine
were doing nothing at all

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
so wont you kill me so i die happy
my heart is yours to fill or burst
to break or burry 
or wear as jewlery, whichever you prefer

the words are hushed lets not get busted
just lay entwined her, undiscovered
safe in here from all the stupid questions
"hey did you get some?"
man that is so dumb
stay quiet stay near
stay close they cant here
so we can get some

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
so wont you kill me so i die happy
my heart is your to fill or burst
to break or burry 
or wear as jewley, whichever you prefer

hands down this is the best day i can ever remember, always remember
the sound of the stereo
the dim of the soft lights
the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
and the time on the clock 
when we realized it was so late
and this walk that we shared together
the street was wet and the gate was locked
so i jumed down and i let you in 
and you stood at your door with your hands on my waist 
and you kissed me like you meant it
and i knew that you meant it
that you meant it
that you meant it
you meant it
and i knew that you meant it
that you meant it---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
