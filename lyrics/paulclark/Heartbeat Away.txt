Here I stand before your throne
This man of flesh and bone
I'm seeking....
Forgiveness......
Through your blood
So many times before
My heart has been restored
Your mercy.....
Endures for ever more

'Cause through the gift
Of your own son
You've allowed me to become
The man that I am
Through the blood of the lamb
Your presence is only
A Heartbeat Away.....

Father, it's hard to find
The words inside my mind
That truly........ 
express the way I feel
With the love I now proclaim
Glory unto your name
With honor....
I bow my head and kneel

'Cause through the gift of your own son
You've allowed me to become
The man that I am
Through the blood of the lamb
You're presence is only......
A heartbeat away

Here I stand before your throne......
A heartbeat away.......---Lyrics submitted by tonty.
