'Tis the gift to be simple, 'tis the gift to be free, 
'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be, 
And when we find ourselves in the place just right, 
'Twill be in the valley of love and delight. 
When true simplicity is gain'd, 
To bow and to bend we will not be asham'd, 
To turn, turn will be our delight, 
Till by turning, turning we come round right.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
