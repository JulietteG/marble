one gloomy day in 1942
a man by the name of jason blue
grew sick and tired of poverty and strife
and cried satan bring some pleasure to my life

satan stepped out from a ball of fire
and said jason, i'll grant all that you desire
i'm most glad to welcome you into the fold
it's not everyday i gain a preacher's soul

as the preacher fell from grace
cuz he had to have a taste
of wealth and fame
he's got power he's got gold
but he doesn't have a soul
ain't that a shame...

the world was in the palm of jason's hands
and the ladies were all at his command
but it seems that he just can't be satisfied
he needs more than even satan can provide

as the preacher fell from grace
cuz he had to have a taste
of wealth and fame
he's got power he's got gold
but he doesn't have a soul
ain't that a shame...

as the preacher fell from grace
cuz he had to have a taste
of wealth and fame
he's got power he's got gold
but he doesn't have a soul
ain't that a shame...
