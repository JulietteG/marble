You naked 
You naked 

Feel it in your face when a man kill the sound in the room, damn you ohh 
really the things you say yeah I do, they make a man go mad, 
and let heart take control, I'll even take control 
and let heart take control 
in the evening turn the things are gone 

Stay in the day, stay in the night 
stay till the body is found to the cold baby 
stay in the day, stay in the night, uh ohh ohhh 

I just wanna get underneath it all 

You're making me crazy 
Let the things out to do, do you do do do during the night 
You're making me crazy 
Let the things out to do, do you do do do during the night 
You're making me crazy. 

Feeling let the scene rhyme at you and the smell of your perfume 
I knew was trouble 
Really the thing you make a man give up on..new. 

And let her heart take control 
I'll even take control 
and let her heart take control 
in the evening is not a physical. 

2 x 
You're making me crazy 
Let the things out to do, do you do do do during the night 
You're making me crazy 
Let the things out to do, do you do do do during the night 

I just wanna get underneath it all 
seek and do. 

You naked 
You naked 
You naked 

You're making me crazy 
Let the things out to do, do you do do do during the night 
You're making me crazy 
Let the things out to do, do you do do do during the night---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
