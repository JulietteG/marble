Let me Come into Your Life
Larry Graham

Ive been watching you, watching everything you do
And girl you sure look blue
I can plainly see you need much more than company
Just what you need is me

I can tell by the smile you wear
Ive seen that look before (before),
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You need my love, thats for sure

Cho
I can be such a wonderful thing in your life 
If you let me 
I can be such a wonderful thing in your life 
If you let me
So please let me come into your life

Now your day has come
Its not too hard to see just where Im coming from
I want to make us one
And darling from now on its me an you together
In our happy home
Just singing happy songs

Rept. Cho twice---Lyrics submitted by Joseph Headley.
