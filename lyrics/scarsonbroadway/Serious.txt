All will fall in love with your ego
Trippin'
Everybody's looking for a sunday mission
Ain't nobody searching for a second chance
I'm just looking for a new romance 
Because you're too serious, your gonna
Make me delirious
Because you're too serious for
Lose you lose you lose and then I'm feel-
in' loose 
It's everybody's  losin' and there's no one
choosin'
Ain't nobody searching for a second chance 
I'm just looking for a new romance
Because you're too serious, your gonna
Make me delirious 
Beacause you're too serious for me---Lyrics submitted by luz.
