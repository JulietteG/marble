Here they come, hand in hand, they walk alone, as happy as can be

Here am i, standing by, remembering when she used to walk with me 

Gotta smile when they pass by, i can't let her see me cry

Here they are, and the stars that shine this night, shine for only them 

It's too late,  still i wait and wish those stars would shine for me again

Gotta smile when they pass by,  i can't let her see me cry 

Her love was mine, but i was blind, and let him steal her one day

Now i'm too old to cry, and too young to die and it hurts too much to run away

There they go, they're in love, as much in love as any two you will see 

Here i stand all alone, as much alone as any fool can be

Glad i smiled when they passed by, i'm so glad she didn't see me cry.---Lyrics submitted by Chance Story.
