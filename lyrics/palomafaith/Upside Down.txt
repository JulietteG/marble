Angels watching over me
With smiles upon their face
Cause I have made it through this far
In an unforgiving place
It feels sometimes this hill's too steep
For a girl like me to climb
But I must knock those thoughts right down
I'll do it in my own time

I don't care
I'm halfway there
On a road that leads me straight to who knows where

I tell you what
What I have found
That I'm no fool
I'm just upside down
Ain't got no cares
I ain't got no rules
I think I like
Living upside down

Watching people scurry by
Rushing to and fro
Oh this world is such a crazy place
It's all about the go go go
Sometimes life can taste so sweet
When you slow it down
You start to see the world a little differently
When you turn it upside down

I don't care
I'm halfway there
And I'm just soaking up the magic in the air

I tell you what
What I have found
That I'm no fool
I'm just upside down
Ain't got no cares
I ain't got no rules
I think I like
Living upside down

Whoa whoa whoa
You gotta slow it down
Yeah yeah yeah
But then pick it up
Whoa yeah whoa
Come on and try a little topsy turvy back to front the right way round
Take it slow, slow, slow (you gotta pick it up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (let me see you slow it down)
Hey yo, yo, yo (tell me something something)

I tell you what
What I have found
That I'm no fool
I'm just upside down
Ain't got no cares
I ain't got no rules
I think I like
Living upside down

I tell you what
What I have found
That I'm no fool
I'm just upside down
Ain't got no cares
I ain't got no rules
I think I like
Living upside down---Lyrics submitted by amy.
