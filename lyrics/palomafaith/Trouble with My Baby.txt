Well, you ask for Monday
It's always something
We're getting close, still goes on
You're running out of time

I need someone to rely on
A shoulder to cry on
Instead of someone of mine
Gotta draw the line, baby, baby

You changed and I need a little loving
I can't keep giving all and get back nothing

When will somebody save me?
I got trouble with my baby
Come on, come on, boy, just shake me
Somebody wake me

'Cause I know, I do, too bad for you
I got trouble with my baby
Got trouble with my baby

You got trouble with the motion
Don't know if you're coming or going
There's emptiness in your eyes
Your turn's always tired

Got enough of being a hero
One day I'm gonna give a zero
And you'll have no place to hide
In this heart of mine, baby, baby

You changed and I need a little loving
I can't keep giving all and get back nothing

When will somebody save me?
I got trouble with my baby
Come on, come on, boy, just shake me
Please, somebody wake me

'Cause I know, I do, too bad for you
I got trouble with my baby
Got trouble with my baby

I can't go on like this
You got me so damn pissed
Your talking makes me sick
Momma said there'll be days like this

Now the whole knows I got trouble with my baby
Got trouble with my baby
Come on, come on, boy, just shake me
Please, somebody wake me

'Cause I know, I do, too bad for you
I got trouble with my baby
Got trouble with my baby
Won't somebody help me?
Got trouble with my baby
Trouble with my baby---
