Hmm oh baby, come on

24 hours till I take flight,
Baby left at 10 tonight
Only just a matter of time before I,
Gonna wish I was by your side
It's gonna be a long day a long night
I want you to do me right

Come on take me, take me,
Only you can save and relieve me
Won't you take me, take me,
I just want a scene to make me tonight

Ten thousand people in the state of fever,
I'm blinded by flashing lights
Turn my back on the stage I gotta make an escape,
While the driver waits outside
It's gonna be a long day I need a long night
I want you to do me right

Oh baby take me, take me,
Only you can save and relieve me
Won't you take me, take me,
I just want a scene to make me tonight
Oh baby

Eight hours in and I'm still undressed,
Don't move too fast I'm not finished yet
When I'm with you I wanna lose myself,
Forget the shoe and do something else
7 am and the sun is up,
I need somebody just to fill my cup
9 am I'm out to JFK,
Hit me now take my breath away

Oh take me, take me,
Only you can save and relieve me
Won't you take me, take me,
I just want a scene to make me

Let's see my frequent fly points for you baby
Ha, back on a plane again, what?
Only you, only you
Woah, woah
Oh you make me scream and shout
Turn me on, oh you make me scream
Baby, baby yeah, oh baby

Eight hours in and I'm still undressed,
Don't move too fast I'm not finished yet
When I'm with you I wanna lose myself,
Forget the shoe and do something else
7 am and the sun is up,
I need somebody just to fill my cup
9 am I'm out to JFK,
Hit me now take my breath away

Oh take me, take me,
Only you can save and relieve me
Won't you take me, take me,
I just want a scene to make me, ooo
Oh ooo tonight, yeah tonight---
