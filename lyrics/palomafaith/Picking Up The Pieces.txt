Do you think of her?
When you're with me?
Repeat the memories you made together
Whose face do you see?
Do you wish I was a bit more like her?
Am I too loud?
I play the part
To cover up all these doubts

Perfect part
She's flawless
She's the other woman
Shining in her splendor
You were lost

[Chorus]
Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
'Cause she's gone
In her shadow is it me you see?
'Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces she left behind

I found a photograph behind the t.v
You look so happy are you missing the way it used to be?
Now You've changed this room around more often lately
It's clear that we
And these 4 walls
Still known as hers and yours.

Perfect part
She's flawless
She's the other woman
Shining in her splendor
You were lost

[Chorus]
Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
'Cause she's gone
In her shadow is it me you see?
'Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces she left behind

Are we liars?
In denial?
Are we smoke without the fire?
Tell me please is this worth it?
I deserve it

[Chorus]
'Cause she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
'Cause she's gone
In her shadow is it me you see?
'Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces she left behind ---
