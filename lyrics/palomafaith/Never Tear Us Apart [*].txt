Don't ask me 
What you know is true 
Don't have to tell you 
I love your precious heart 

I, I was standing 
You were there 
Two worlds collided 
And they could never tear us apart 

We could live for a thousand years 
But if I hurt you 
I'd make wine from your tears 

I told you 
That we could fly 
'Cause we all have wings 
But some of us don't know why 

I was standing 
You were there 
Two worlds collided 
And they could never ever tear us apart 

I, I was standing 
(Don't ask me) 
I was standing 
(You know it's true) 
You were there 
(Worlds collided) 
Two worlds collided 
(We're shining through) 
And they could never tear us apart 

You, you were standing 
(Don't ask me) 
(You know it's true) 
I was there 
(Worlds collided) 
Two worlds collided 
(We're shining through) 
And they could never tear us apart 
I, I was standing---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
