Whoa
A hot summer night - It fell like a net.
I've gotta find my baby yet.
I need you to soothe my head
and turn my blue heart to red.

Doctor, doctor give me the news 
I've got a Bad Case of Lovin' You.
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I've got a Bad Case of Lovin' You.

A pretty face don't make no pretty heart
I learned that, buddy, from the start.
You think I'm cute, a little bit shy
Momma I ain't that kind of guy.

Doctor, doctor give me the news 
I've got a Bad Case of Lovin' You.
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I've got a Bad Case of Lovin' You.

Whoa
I know you'll like it, you'll like it on top.
Tell me momma, are you gonna stop?

You had me down 21 to zip
Smile of Judas on your lip
Shake my fist, knock on wood
I got it bad, and I got it good.

Doctor, doctor give me the news 
I've got a Bad Case of Lovin' You.
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I've got a Bad Case of Lovin' You.---Lyrics submitted by john blakemore.
