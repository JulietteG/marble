Enrique Iglesias
Like she wants to mess around

I heard from a friend who heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another that you been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend, too, told you about me, too
Cause I'mma tell you straight up, I been messin' around
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
Yeah, I been messin' around

The way you lick your lips, yeah, I like that
When you act like a bad girl, I like that
That little sexy look you got, mmm, I like that
The way you whisper in my ear how you want it when you want it, girl, I like that
Let's go, baby, let's ride
Let's not talk about it, let's do it
How you want it, in the suspension
Both of them [?]
We can get freaky in the morning or in the afternoon
We can go all night long, baby, it's all up to you

You can get it sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want
Tell me, you want to?

I heard from a friend who heard it from a friend

I'm ready, girl, are you ready?

The way you talk dirty, yeah, I like that
The way you bring other girls, yeah, I like that
The way you wear them heels, yeah, I like that
No thong up under that skirt, ooh, I like that
And you can get crazy, yeah, that's cool
You can get loose, yeah, that's cool

Let's jump on the bar, yeah, that's cool
Let's push the gas, I'm like ooh
I don't mean to be rude, but I swear to god
There's so many things that I'd love to do to you

You can get it sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want
Tell me, you want to?
