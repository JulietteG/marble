And yours truly
This is history in the making

(Now say it with me)
(Say it with me)

They say he don't rap no more
They say like LeBron he ain't got the heat no more
They say he ain't street no more
But like Jay say "How sick am I?" wish 'em health for sure
But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it
Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it
It's crazy baby the way that the 80's made me
I thank God every day that music saved me
I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me
I thank Miami for the way you raised me

I'm a bad man, in an evil world
(That's right)
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
(Give it to me baby)
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
(Ha, ha)
Come on over, give me what I deserve
(Give it to me baby)

Are you ready for love?
Come and get it, girl
Come and get it, girl

Building a billion dollar business from an ounce
Not bad for a Cuban that came from the south
Mami let's make like tig ol' bitties and bounce
So we can make like a baby in here now
I'm cool with it, act a fool with it
With my own playbook, I got no rules in it
I like the girls that's freaky, wild, yeah, and crazy
I like the girls that dirty dance, I'm Swayze
I like the girls that's hot, and fire and blazing
I like the girls that like the sex amazing

I'm a bad man, in an evil world
(That's right)
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
(Give it to me baby)
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
(Ha, ha)
Come on over, give me what I deserve
(Give it to me baby)

Are you ready for love?
Come and get it, girl
Come and get it, girl

I'm a bad man
I know how to move in a room full of woo's
Baby, I'm a bad man
I'm a good man, good guy, but don't get it confused
Baby, I'm a bad man
And I still fight every day like I ain't got nothing to lose
That's right

I'm a bad man, in an evil world
(That's right)
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
(Give it to me baby)
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
(Ha, ha)
Come on over, give me what I deserve
(Give it to me baby)

Are you ready for love?
Come and get it, girl
Come and get it, girl

Baby, I'm a bad man
Baby, I'm a bad man---
