Oh this wild wild love of ours 
It can't be tamed, no 
All this wild wild love of ours 
It can't be tamed, no 
For better or worse 
A blessing or a curse 
Long live this wild wild love of ours 
Long live this wild wild love

Ladies and gentleman 
You're looking at the new play boy 
Who you? 
That's right, Armando Christian Perez 
And when it comes to that pretty lil' bitty kitty 
Don't stop get it get it baby let me pet it 
I got that wild love 
Love to get wild dirty freaky nasty, yeah I said it 
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time 
Don't believe me, bet it 
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure 
Even though it's a catch 22 
It's a gift and curse for sure 
But baby you know that you love it too, that's why 
You need it, you want it (hey) 
All over your body 
This loving I'm giving 
It's worth more than money 
You need it, you want it 
All over your body (hey) 
I know that you want this 
Wild, wild, love 

[G.R.L.] 
All this wild wild love of ours 
It can't be tamed, no 
All this wild wild love of ours 
It can't be tamed, no 
For better or worse 
A blessing or a curse 
Long live this wild wild love of ours 
For better or worse 
A blessing or a curse 
Long live this wild wild love of ours

Not only am I a client I'm the player president 
The globe is my backyard, baby it's evident 
When it comes to Miami, I always represent 
Read all about, ladies and gents 
I'm the done took over the game 
I like my women yin 
I like my women yang 
I like my women fine 
I like them off the chain 
Take 'em all to the world cup, Brazil to-do-bang 
You know I meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em 
Treat 'em, always keep them feeling right 
I don't know if I can handle all five 
But maybe we can try tonight, dale 

You need it, you want it 
All over your body (hey) 
This loving I'm giving 
It's worth more money 
You need it, you want it 
All over your body (hey) 
I know that you want this 
Wild, wild, love
