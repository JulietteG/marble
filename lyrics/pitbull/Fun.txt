(feat. Chris Brown) 

Chris Brown set it up 

Oh, feeling crazy 
The moment's up 
The night is easy 
Let's get lost 
In the shadows 
Somewhere we can go 
And no one else can find 

Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  
Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  

Oh my my  
Looking like a good good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you want you want to love tonight  
Oh my my  
Hook you on a brand new high  
Don't be shy  
I just wanna live tonight 
A little f-u-n  
Fun 

Fresh from Monaco  
Performing for Microsoft  
Miami to L.A.  
G4 we taking off  
I'm a hard worker  
I'm far from the boss  
But when it's said and done  
I'm owning it all  
I know you think it's just rap  
Just this, just that  
Ha ha, right  
Nah baby, this my life  
Wanna have fun for a night  
Danger  

Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  
Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  

Oh my my  
Looking like a good good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you want you want to love tonight  
Oh my my  
Hook you on a brand new high  
Don't be shy  
I just wanna live tonight 
A little f-u-n  
Fun 

[Pitbull Rap] 

Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  
Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  

Oh my my  
Looking like a good good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you want you want to love tonight  
Oh my my  
Hook you on a brand new high  
Don't be shy  
I just wanna live tonight 
A little f-u-n  
Fun 

C'mon mami, you know what it is 
C'mon baby, you know what it is 
I want to uh 
Let's go to the crib 
And if you want 
You can bring your friends 

C'mon mami, you know what it is 
C'mon baby, you know what it is 
I want to uh 
Let's go to the crib 
And if you want 
You can bring your friends 
And we can f-u-n 
Fun 

Let's go 

Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone  
Loosing up your body till you come undone  
Loosing up your body baby, come undone---
