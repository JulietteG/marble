There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love

How will I know
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know

[chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said, there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

How will I know
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know

[chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak

If he loves me, if he loves me not [3x]
Oh, how will I know

[chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
