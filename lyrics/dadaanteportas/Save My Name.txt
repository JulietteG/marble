Something about her looks just like a trick 
I can't figure out what it is 
Maybe because of the way that she moves 
Or maybe because of her lips 

She always drinks this Margerita stuff 
She always blinks with her eyes to bluff 
Hope that she's not too rough to 

Save my name after all we've done 
I lay down a note and I'm out of town 

I'm heading for love - is it wrong or what? 
I'm heading for love - it's my fault or what? 

Something about her just made me stay 
Still can't figure out what is was 
Maybe because she moved like a cat 
Or maybe because of the booze 

She always likes go out and tease 
She never lies 'bout getting on her knees 
She's never hard to please 

Save her name after all we've done 
I lay down a rose and I'm out of town 

I'm heading for love - is it wrong or what? 
I'm heading for love - it's my fault or what? 

Save my name after all we've done 
I lay down a note and I'm out of town 

I'm heading for love - is it wrong or what? 
I'm heading for love - it's my fault or what? 
I laid down a note - ain't it enough or what? 
I laid down a rose - ain't it enough or what?---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
