Boulder, on a night in July 
Boulder, we all used the good eye 
leaving Mike's place 

I don't know if I'm honest but I love you all 
I'm already pie-eyed and I love you all 

I was sitting on a rooftop - such a long, long time 
hoping that the world would stop - turning for all time 

Boulder, on a porch in July 
Boulder, a pizza lullaby 
kept me running all day 

I'm totally honest, I will miss you all 
one more for the road, goodbye to you all 

I was sitting on a rooftop - such a long, long time 
hoping that the world would stop - turning for all time 
I was sipping on a rooftop - for a long, long time 
hoping that the roof would stop - spinning in my mind 

I was sitting on a rooftop - such a long, long time 
hoping that the world would stop - turning for all time 
I was sipping on a rooftop - for a long, long time 
hoping that the roof would stop - spinning in my mind 
in my mind, in my mind, in my mind---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
