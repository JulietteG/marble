I tried to be your angel and I tried to be so nice 
but the only thing you gave me took me by surprise 
one way leads to diamonds and one way leads to me 
I wonder if you know which way will make you free 

lock the world outside my door 
I don't need it anymore 
make it all just go away 
until all black days turn to grey 

I'm a piece of driftwood floating in my dreams 
trying to get hold, trying to get real 
it's hard to write a poem when love begins to fade 
I'm begging you to come back and help me to crusade 

I can't take my eyes off you 
I still need that perfect view 
you're my only vivid scene 
in a world of jaded sin 
jaded sin 

and your love is a dangerous weapon 
it's above every science or Zen 
I am lost in your painful patience 
I'm too weak to conduct my own defence 

you left me here with nothing in a desert without you 
love's more than a mood when it's gone you'll see it's true 
love is touching souls and surely you touched mine 
sometimes you taste bitter and sometimes you taste fine 

lock the world outside my door 
I don't need it anymore 
make it all just go away 
until all black days turn into grey 
turn into grey 

and your love is a dangerous weapon 
it's above every science or Zen 
I am lost in your painful patience 
I'm too weak to conduct my own defence 

got my heart set on winning you 
got my heart set on winning you 

and your love is a dangerous weapon 
it's above every science or Zen 
I am lost in your painful patience 
I'm too weak to conduct my own defence 

I tried to be your angel and I tried to be so nice 
but the only thing you gave me took me by surprise...---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
