Im taking your love coz its all I need
The only thing and its helping me breathe

I dont know how to start but I beg you to listen
Coz so many love songs begin when its done
The beauty of you outshines my self - doubts
And still Im caught in a catch 22
How to I come to my senses

Im taking your love coz its all I need
The only thing and its helping me breathe
Its love what you give
Its love what you live
Its making me sing
Like a word on a wing
Coz your love is the gift of my life

A pocketful of simple pleasures
That everyone should able to bear
Is it too loud or is it OK
When I shout it your heart
God help me come to my senses

Im taking your love coz its all I need
The only thing and its helping me breathe
Its love what you give
Its love what you live
Its making me sing
Like a word on a wing
Coz your love is the gift of my life

Im taking your love coz its all I need
The only thing and its helping me breathe
Its love what you give
Its love what you live
Its making me feel
Like Im spearing in my wings..
Coz you are the gift of my life

Im taking your love coz its all I need
The only thing and its helping me breathe
Its love what you give
Its love what you live
I would have been lost 
If you hadnt been here
Coz your love is the gift of my life---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
