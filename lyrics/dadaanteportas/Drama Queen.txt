It's your birthday now but you stay in bed 
causing a scene about how old you get 

you don't regret your change to brunette 
to me you're just a marionette 
your closet full of new shoes 
of which you've only worn a few 

because you are so dramatic 
let us bow and scrape 
you are so melodramatic 
bow and scrape 

I know well the scene when you order food 
a few things added, a few things removed 

I don't know if we should go 
to this famous gigolo 
VIP hello hello 
I'll just go for the Bordeaux 

because you are so dramatic 
let us bow and scrape 
you are so melodramatic 
let's get out of sight 

because you are so dramatic 
let us bow and scrape 
you are so melodramatic 
let's get out of sight 

sometimes you act so neurotic 
let's just disappear 
sometimes you act so neurotic 
let's get outta here---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
