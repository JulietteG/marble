It's peasful here 
by the old oak tree 
a box of letters in my hand 
i won't stand 

lost and faint 
all because of her 
I like to sit here anyway 
I sing and sway 

my mind can wander 
back to those days 
when we lay and listened to 
Sarah's songs 


and when she smiled 
you'd believe in grace 
she spread her sunshine to the sad 
and made them fine and glad 

and when she smiled 
I would wanna stay 
she lit up every gloomy place 
with the beauty of her face 

still sitting here 
under our old tree 
reading all the lovely words 
she left for me 

wondering 
where her journey ends 
no matter where she's smiling now 
her love descends 

and when she smiled 
you'd beliee in grace 
she spread her sunshine to the sad 
and made tham fine and glad 

and when she smiled I would wanna stay 
she lit up every gloomy place 
with her beauty of her face 

I would risk a thousand deaths 
if I could kiss her once again 
how could her smile shine like the sun 
if only I could see 

and when she smiled 
she gave us a lot 
to light up all the dismal days 
she smiled for everyone 

and when she smiled 
she would welcome you 
with all her loving smiles and ways 
I wish she could be here---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
