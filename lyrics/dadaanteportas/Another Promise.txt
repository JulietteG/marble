Another gloomy day has passed 
Another night without her coming 
I will love her to the last 
But she left me forever 

Another day, another misery 
Another chance beneath you dignity 

But I won't be fighting you know I would die for you 
Cheating and lying you know I could hide for you 
Bit what else can I do 

Another dreary hour has passed 
And I'm still staring at the doorsteps 
Just a glimmer of the past 
One last tie that I can't sever 

Another sip, another glass again 
The wine and I are numbing all th pain 

But I won't be fighting you know I would die for you 
Cheating and lying you know I could hide for you 
Bit what else can I do 

But I won't be fighting you know I would die for you 
Cheating and lying you know I could hide for you 
Bit what else can I do 

But I won't be fighting you know I would die for you 
Cheating and lying you know I could hide for you 
Bit what else can I do---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
