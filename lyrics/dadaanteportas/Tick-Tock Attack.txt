So true, I ain't rude, but I ain't no fool 
So cool, take your time when you break that rule 

No I don't like what I feel 
When the lights are out and I feel the doubt 
I don't like what I am 
When I leave the stage and I turn the page 

Back in my hotel 
No girls around to share the rounds 
Everything I've got 
Is telling me I am, but I know I'm not 

[chorus] 
So true, I ain't rude, but I ain't no fool 
So cool, take your time when you break that rule 
No time, for any doubts, for any clouds 
Your dime, spend it well and take your bow 

No I don't like what I see 
The wheels of time spin away my prime 
I don't like what I hear 
There's a ticking clock in my atmosphere 

Once upon a time 
We used to laugh at the grand design 
Now listen to that clock 
It goes tick tick tock, tick tick tock 

[chors] 
So true, I ain't rude, but I ain't no fool 
So cool, take your time when you break that rule 
No time, for any doubts, for any clouds 
Your dime, spend it well and take your bow 

So lonely are the days 
When the mirror locks my gaze 
How I decay... 

Time won't wait for me 
And time won't wait for you, my friend 
Time for you to see, time is short and nothing's free 
Can you hear my clock it's a tick tick tock, tick-tock attack 
Can you hear my clock it's a tick tick tock, tick-tock attack 
Can you hear my clock it's a tick tick tock, tick-tock attack 
Can you hear my clock it's a tick tick tock, tick-tock attack 

[chors] 
So true, I ain't rude, but I ain't no fool 
So cool, take your time when you break that rule 
No time, for any doubts, for any clouds 
Your dime, spend it well and take your bow 
take your bow... 
take your bow... 
take your bow... 
take your, take your bow...---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
