Oh Lord  Ive been here before 
Oh Lord  I dont need this no more 

Please release me from walking the circle again 

Oh Lord  Ive been here before 
Oh Lord  I cant bear it no more 

Please release me from walking the circle again 
Please release me from wading and fading in the pen 

Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 

Oh Lord  take a look round the globe 
Oh Lord  youve got so many jobs 

Please release me from walking the circle again 
Please release me from wading and fading in the pen 

Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 

Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men 
Please torture other men---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
