As I drove down to El Paso 
from the canyons to Van Horn 
looking for a better life to live 

I couldn't see right 
no end in sight 
just a hitcher in the night 
in my headlight was Ted Levite 

I don't know if you believe me 
but he taught me how to go 
I don't know if you believe me 
but he taught me how to go 
back to my girl, back home to my girl 

Ted and I were driving through the night 
talking 'bout a daughter he don't know 
he said he wants to find his past now 

he waved goodbye 
and headed for her 
his silhouette began to blur 
I never know if he ever found her 

I'm not trying to be like him now 
but you know you got my love 
I'm not trying to be like him now 
but you know you got my love 

Ted Levite taught me how - taught me how to get back home 
Ted Levite's in my mind - I don't know if he was real 
Ted Levite taught me how - taught me how to get back home 
Ted Levite - I'm almost home... 

slowly the sun is rising 
morning's coming way too fast 
was it just a dream of mine 
or was it him who taught me 
how to go back home---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
