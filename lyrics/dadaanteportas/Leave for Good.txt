I think Ill leave for good now 
And shake off your disguise 
To find a new sunrise 
Coz Im dying 

White lies ? is this how you hide 
Your little secrets to sustain my pride? 
White lives and twisted amends 
Is all I get from you and so called friends 

Its all around me everybodys fake 
Its all around me your fake 

I think Ill leave for good now 
And shake off your disguise 
To find a new sunrise 
Coz Im dying 
I think its time to say my farewell 
Ive got to leave my town 
Its time to shut it down 
All this lying 

White lies of legal despair 
To deceive the people who should care 
White noise is all I can hear 
Everyone is listening with half an ear 

Its all around me everybodys fake 
Its all around me your fake 

(chorus) 

I think its time to say my farewell 
Ive got to say goodbye 
No more alibis 
For your lies 

(chorus) 

(chorus) 

its all about denial 
ive got to say good bye, no more alibis for your lying?
