What a friend I had in you - I remember vividly 
I thank you very much indeed for the good old days we had 

you were always my best friend - fine and true 
cheering me up when I was feeling blue 

Me and my friend were better than the rest 
me and my friend were simply the best 
me and my friend tried to conquer all the world 
beginning to the end, just me and my friend 

I have lost track of what he's doing nowadays 
the only thing I've heard was he was wandering in a haze 

does he think of all the bets - that we made 
we never grew out of all the games we played 

Me and my friend were better than the rest 
me and my friend were simply the best 
me and my friend tried to conquer all the world 
beginning to the end, just me and my 

a friend is someone special 
a friend is friend forever 
a friend is someone special 
a friend is friend forever 

time moved slowely 
when you were there 
I'm saying thanks 
for being there 

Me and my friend were better than the rest 
me and my friend were simply the best 
me and my friend tried to conquer all the world 
beginning to the end, just me and my friend---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
