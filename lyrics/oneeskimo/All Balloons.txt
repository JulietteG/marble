It's only five miles to heaven
With all the usual stops
I took the right directions
And I'm farther than I was at the start

And you keep telling me this story 
about some killer bees
Seems they've gone crazy
And they're trying to kill everybody and me

So whatever comes will come
And maybe we're all balloons full of air
And the reason we're deflating
Is to remind us that the ground is there

La la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la la la

Only the craziest of the bees 
know the branches like you do
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference 
between the honey and the glue

This split direction 
is eventually gonna tear us all apart
You know you're going nowhere
but hey, at least you know where you are

So whatever comes will come
And maybe we're all balloons full of air
And the reason we're deflating
Is to remind us that the ground is there
(children cheer)

La la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la la la
(children cheer)

We're all balloons full of air
(children cheer)
We're all balloons full of air
(children cheer)

So whatever comes will come
And maybe we're all balloons full of air
And the reason we're deflating
Is to remind us that the ground is there
(children cheer)

La la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la la la
(children cheer)
La la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la la la
