Slip off my skin
Fall into bed
I'm staying in
with you, you're inside my head
Blow me a smile, blow me a kiss
I'm in a dream, get me out of this

And of all the creatures under the sky
There is you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

And it's all too much
You're in every little thing I touch
And it's all too real
You're in every little thing I feel
And it's all such a waste
You're in every little thing I taste
Come on, come on, come on, come on, be strong

Think of a time, you name the place
I close my eyes, and I'm with you
We're face to face
I see your smile, I feel your kiss
I'm in a dream, get me out of this

And the only thing that I've never tried
Is leaving you with a suicide
And of all the creatures under the sky
There is you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

And it's all too much
You're in every little thing I touch
And it's all too real
You're in every little thing I feel
And it's all such a waste
You're in every little thing I taste
Come on, come on, come on, come on, be strong

Just be, just be, just be, just be strong

Never too much, never too late
Never turn away, never say die
Never let it slip away
Never too much, never too late
Never say die, never say die,
never never never never
(repeat)

Never let it slip away---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
