Givin' up (x4)

I've woken up to the radio
And I've hardly had any sleep
And the song that plays will stay with me all day
And I hate it

Over and over again
Another one of those crazy days
And the same old, same old
May be hard to change
But I'm ready

All the battles (givin' up)
I want to win (givin' up)
Nothing matters (givin' up)
But giving in (givin' up)
So hard to do, so hard to do (it's hard)
So hard to do (givin' up)
Oo oo oohoo (is hard to do)

I realized I was wrong
Still in traffic on my way home
And the song still plays
All the crazy days will go on
When I'm gone

All the battles (givin' up)
I want to win (givin' up)
Nothing matters (givin' up)
But giving in (givin' up)
So hard to do, so hard to do (it's hard)
So hard to do (givin' up)
Oo oo oohoo (is hard to do)

Oo oo oohoo, oo oo oohoo oo (x4)

All the battles (givin' up)
I want to win (givin' up)
Nothing matters (givin' up)
But giving in (givin' up)
So hard to do, so hard to do (it's hard to do)
So hard to do (givin' up)
Oo oo oohoo (it's hard to do)


Oo oo oohoo, oo oo oohoo oo (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
