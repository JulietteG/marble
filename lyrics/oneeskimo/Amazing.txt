I feel sweet, do you feel sweet?
It's amazing
I have no skin and I feel everything
It's amazing

I feel good, do you feel good?
I knew I would, it's amazing
I've wanted this for so long
Now the deed has been done
We shall rise with the sun
And spend our time as one

Now there is no sin in anything
And it's amazing
I love life, I hope you do too
'Cause I love everything, it's all amazing

I feel new, do you feel new?
I understand when they say we're born again
'Cause I've been born again
I'm born again
And it's amazing
It's the best thing, and it's glorious 
It's life-changing, this feeling is amazing
It's the best thing, it's glorious 
It's life-changing, this feeling

This feeling, oh oh oh
This feeling, it's amazing

It's in the stars, in the sun
it's everywhere and everyone
And it will be every day
From now on, from now on 
we are one, and it's amazing
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
