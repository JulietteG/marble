You float like a baby
Trying to escape this
Covered in tar
But every recording
You keep distorting
Like an astronaut

It's a funny old world
Full of headaches sometimes
So whenever you need space
I guess it's okay
When you're floating away
To feel nothing at all
We can be astronauts
if you want to get out of here

You float like a baby
Looking for safety
Somewhere on Mars
But if I'm mistaken
Your body's in England
But your head's in the stars

It's a funny old world
Full of headaches sometimes
So whenever you need space
I guess it's okay
When you're floating away
To feel nothing at all
We can be astronauts
if you want to get out of here

We can get out of here
We can get out of here

We can be astronauts
We can be astronauts

It's a funny old world
Full of headaches sometimes
So whenever you need space
I guess it's okay
When you're floating away
To feel nothing at all
We can be astronauts
if you want to get out of here

We can get out of here
We can get out of here

We can be astronauts
We can be astronauts---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
