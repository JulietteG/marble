Youve been my queen 
For longer then you know
My love for you has been
Every step I take
Every day I live
Everything Ive scene

And if I get things wrong
Dont want you to think
Im running away
But Ive heard from Joe
About this guy
And I want to know

What did he say?
He called me baby baby
All night long

What did he do?
He called me baby baby
Baby baby baby baby 
All night long 

Why Why Why did you need him 
Where was I
Just how close to you is he
Every smile you make
Every touch you make
Every word you say

And it hurts beyond hurts
It was a love that blinds
And a love that stings 
When I heard from Joe
About this guy 
And I want to know

What did he say?
He called me baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
All night long
What did he do?

He called me baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
All night long

What did he say? 
He called me baby baby
Baby baby baby
All night long

Dose my love ever touch you
Dose my love ever reach you
Its never enough
Why is it never enough

He called you baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
All night long 

What did he do?
He called me baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
All night long 

What did he say?
He called you baby baby
Baby baby 
All night long

What did he do? 
He called me baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
All night long

And I know he called you baby baby
All night long

And I know he called you baby baby
All night long---Lyrics submitted by Bec Moore.
