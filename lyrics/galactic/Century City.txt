Girl ya got original paintings,
lined up wall to wall.
Girl you think you've got everything,
well now listen to me,
but ya really got nothing at all.
I came to your house that day,
cause you said you were cookin' the spread,
Well I walked in and sat down over in the corner
I decided to get into your head.

*Chorus**
And all I kept on thinking was I'm stuck down in Century City,
no ride and aint it a pity,
Stuck dead in Century City.
no love and aint it a pity.

I came to L.A.,
just tryin' to show my artistic side.
I wandered around all day,
your actin' funny, your tryin' to hide.
I looked all over town for ya girl,
well, I thought you were all alone,
When I saw your face ____ when you walked into the place,
you said "house man, you should've called me on my cell phone",

*Chorus*

I've been up all night girl,
listening listening at ya going on and on and on and on and on and on.
Ya keep talking about what ya got and what ya friends got,
I don't care about that,
its what's inside that counts.

*Chorus*---Lyrics submitted by Jason Vredeveld.
