so are we over now ,
 do we just turn the page and let the story end ,
 do we just walk away just like we never met ,
i know you said some things 
and now you want to leave 
but baby there's no reason to let a good love die 

CH
why good bye,
 why must it be this way,
 so many words 
so many other words that we could say 
why good bye 
 after all this time can we try
 why goodbye

why cant we work it out 
why cant we talk it out ah little more this time
search  through the land to find  ah mate  that hope still shine
we cant just close the door 
we still  worth fighting for 
we come so far together to leave it all behind

CH


the road of love is never easy 
we get lost along the way 
but in time  we will find our way through
we can make it through the bad  time we can make it through the good time 
and through the stormy weather  , cause we belong together
