Im giving up
It's All eyes on me
Call it out like a family
Stood up back time get it right
Until the rubber leaves the road
You said dont I so I made the truth
Seem like a lie to even you
Control your fears slip
That you do not know where you go to

So dont you worry
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution

One month down and its inside
Oh Im guaranteed to lose my mind
Its dangerous to speak in sign
You might now what Im trying to hide
So from the cradle to quarter age
Oh I bought the book but didnt flip the page
Oh ready this is near, we steer
As far away from the coming of days

So dont you worry
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution

Turn around, put it down and see
That this is really the place to be
Im not you, nor you me
But were both moving steady---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
