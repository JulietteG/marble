See I left my mothers heart
See I left my fathers home
And I fell into a well of hope

I'm carrying my heart but it's made of stone
I'm carrying my heart but my heart is made of stone

See I left my mothers heart
See I left my fathers home 
And I fell into a well of hope

I'm carrying my heart but it's made of stone
I'm carrying my heart but my heart is made of stone
I'm carrying my heart but it's made of stone
oh I'm carrying my heart but my heart is made of stone

Oooh ohhwooahh oooooah aoowoahh
ooooohhh wooaahh ooooooohh oooooaahhh.........---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
