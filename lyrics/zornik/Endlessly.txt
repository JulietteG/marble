Gently floating down below
A river flow
a breath of air, a summers breeze
forever free

You ran across the land
The sun went down
And darkness fell

Theres nothing, no one in your way , or here for you
You love it, hate it all the same
ironicly


Wherever you will go
Wherever you will hide
You always will remember this
whatever you will try
Wherever you will hide
You always will remember this
endlessly

One never knows the consequence
Until it ends
A shiver down your spine again
A dead mens end.

Wherever you will go
Wherever you will hide
You always will remember this
whatever you will try
Wherever you will hide
You always will remember this, endlessly---Lyrics submitted by Kim Jeuniaux.
