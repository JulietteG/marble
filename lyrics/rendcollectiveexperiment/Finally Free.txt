Your mercy rains from heaven
Like confetti at a wedding
And I am celebrating
In the downpour

Your heart is wild with colour
Like a never-ending summer
You burn away the winter
Of my cold and weary heart

My soul cries out holy, holy
My heart is lost in Your beauty
All hope is found in Your mercy
You paid the price now I am
Finally free

Your grace, oh God's the anchor
That's holding me forever
Come trouble or high water
I am steadfast

Yeah, you lift me when I'm sinking
Like the swell of mighty oceans
The power of redemption
Yeah, it gives me wings to soar

My soul cries out holy, holy
My heart is lost in Your beauty
All hope is found in Your mercy
You paid the price now I am
Finally free

We'll cast our crowns before Him
Like the rusting leaves of autumn
Now every chain lies broken
And finally we're free

My soul cries out holy, holy
My heart is lost in Your beauty
All hope is found in Your mercy
You paid the price now I am
Finally free ---
