Thine be the Glory
Risen and conquering son
Endless is the victory
Thou over death hast won

Make us more than conquerors
Through Thy deathless love
Bring us safe through Jordan
To Thy home above

You won, You won, You won
An overwhelming victory

Let the church with gladness
Hymns of triumph sing
For her Lord now liveth
Death has lost its sting

You have won, You have won, risen Son 
Conquering Son---Lyrics submitted by Beth Jade Newby-Wright.
