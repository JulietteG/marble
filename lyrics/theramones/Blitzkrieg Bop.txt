I know you I'm afraid
To take a chance, along with the deep in
Usher baby
Turn the lights on

These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trecking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No buts, or dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby going deeper ain't gon kill me
And I know they are shagging for me
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No buts, or dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby
You'll be my place tonight, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew i, don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

It's raining inside your bed
No buts, or dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive ---
