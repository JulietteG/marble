You'll have to say

You were the sex dream of my magazine,
you blew my mind like no one of the human kind.
You were the only one I could ever speak,
this secret language between us in the sheets.

You made my mind and body so high,
you turned this wild child into a lady by night.
And when I met you long ago, I was so alone,
my heart was beating so fast I had to write this song, and it goes.

You make me feel so beautiful,
Its like the sun is always shining when you are in control.
You are my mister mystery and
There's no way I can explain the way you make me feel.

Late night loving on your balcony,
I'm feeling wobbly in the knees who thought that would be me.
You lift me up to where I wanna be, you make everything so clear I can finally see...

You are, the one that I always think about.
My first love that I made this song about.
You know me well and you always make me feel,
like I'm the one and I know your love is real.

I love it when you whisper in my ear,
you say the sweetest things that I wanted to hear.
I never thought I would feel this way,
and when I leave you in the morning I think of you all day.

I feel so peaceful after we make love,
I lay with you forever just like the sweetest drug.
And the whole world around us stops and stares,
it feels so good to fall asleep knowing that you are there.. c!mon!

You make me feel so beautiful,
It's like the sun is always shining when you are in control.
You are my mister mystery and
There's no way I can explain the way you make me feel.

And when you left me out this day,
I thought you will come back anyways...
you don't, you don't, you don't... 

but that's ok, I ain't gonna fall, I gotta get up and roll, 
that's the way you want it... and I wont help it.
I'm off to search a new lover,
with my chance I might find better..

I can picture you alone and bitter and with the time.. You'll have to say,
"Damn I wonder why I broke up with that cool chick,
now I'm wasting all this time looking for girls to meet."

You are the one, that I always think about,
my first love that I made this song about.
You know me well, and you always make me feel.
Like I'm the one, and I know your love is real.

"I'm so alone, I can get her phone....
I can call her back, and ask her to take me back."
Girl: Hello?
Guy: Heh yeah it's me
Girl: Yea so?
Guy: I made a huge mistake
Girl: Mmm hmm yeah you did!

Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?,
Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?
Ya don't?---Lyrics submitted by amber.
