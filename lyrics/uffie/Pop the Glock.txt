MC Mic 
People Call Me Uff 
When I rock the party 
Bust a nut 
Feadz is breakin' out the beat 
Shit be hotter... Then Me 
Me and He are crusalicious 
Better watch out my clan gets vicious 
Bad ass bitch 
I'm rated X 
I'm gifted
Aint gotta sell sex 
Cross the beach onto the street 
Gotta work hard 
No room to cheat 

Crunk and grind that's my bloodline 
Feadz is mixin 
Uffie's shoutin 
Uffie's bangin 
Feadz is bangin 
Time to get low 
Do the toostie roll 
That's how we do 
Do it hot 
And if you understood would you... 
Stop hatin 
Playing Hard 
I got a loaded body gaurd 
Don't make a move 
You glock then pop 
Uffie's gonna make the shit rock 
Like Dough 
Dough I like 
Boys call me when they feel freaky hot 
I run the show 
You got to slow 
Pick up the pace with your cracked out face 
Uffie's bangin 
Feadz is bangin 
Time to get low 
Do the toostie roll 
That's how we do 
Do it hot 
And if you understood would you... 
Beat my ryhme 
If you can 
Yeah you talk shit 
Think I care 
My style in this flow 
Is confusing cuz you don't know 

Pop the glock x7 
The glock you pop 
Sound like twista 
Fast as hell 
I rock this beat you know damn well 
Gonna make it to the top 
Spit this shit Til your drop 
Down low Is where to keep it 
Boy, doesn't anyone know 
Gonna to tear you down 
Underneath you just a clown 
Time everyone see 
What you really be 

Play the game the game gets played 
I got a man and he goes by feadz 
Play the game the game gets played 
I got a man and he goes by feadz 

Uffie's bangin 
Feadz is bangin 
Time to get low 
Do the toostie roll 
That's how we do 
Do it hot 
And if you understood would you... 
Be my rhyme 
If you can 
Yeah you talk shit 
Think I care 
My style in this flow 
Is confusing cuz you don't know 

Pop the glock 
The glock you pop 
If you out of line 
It's your bang pop 
Pop the glock 
The glock you pop 
If you out of line 
It's your bang pop 
Pop the glock 
The glock you pop 
If you out of line 
It's your bang pop 

Uffie's bangin x3 
Feadz is bangin

Feadz Is bangin 
Time to get low 
Do the toostie roll 
Uffie's bangin 
Feadz is baning 
Uffie's bangin 
Feadz is baning 
Me and he are crusalicious 
Better watch out my clan gets vicious 
That's how we do 
Do it hot 
And if you understood would you... 
Stop hatin 
Playing Hard 
I got a loaded body gaurd 
Don't make a move 
You glock then pop 
Uffie's gonna make the shit rock 
Like Dough 
Dough I like 
Boys call me when they feel freaky hot 
I run the show 
You got to slow 
Pick up the pace with your cracked out face 

Pop the glock x7
