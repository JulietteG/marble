Aaaaah
Aaaaah
Aaaaah

Well, I'd like to tell you all about my dream, it's a place
Where strip malls abound and diversion's mere moments away
Where culture's defined by the ones least refined
And you'll be left behind if you don't fit in
It's all distorted in americana, my way
Well, fuck you

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Well, my dream has come true
Whoa, whoa, whoa
My vision has come true

Now, give me my cable, fast food, four-by's, tat's right away
I want it right now, 'cause my g-ggeneration don't like to wait
My future's determined by thieves, thugs, and vermin
It's quite an excursion, but it's ok
Everything's backwards in americana, my way
Well, fuck you

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Well, my dream has come true
Whoa, whoa, whoa
My vision has come true
Yeah, it's all coming true

I'm a product
Of my environment
So don't blame me
I just work here but I wanna fuck it all!

My rights are denied by those least qualified
Trading profit for pride, but it's ok
Everything's backwards in americana, my way
Well, fuck you

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Well, my nightmare has come true
Whoa, whoa, whoa
My nightmare has come true
Yeah, it's all coming true
Yeah, it's all coming true---Lyrics submitted by makkara.
