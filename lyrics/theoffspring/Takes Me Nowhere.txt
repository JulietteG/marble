Takes Me Nowhere
When the day begins
All the guilt sinks in
And I look on the wreckage of the night
Though I try to break free
The cycle breaks me
Am I ever gonna see the light?

All the friends Ive lost
And the pain Ive caused
Have never been enough just to make me stop
The lines I draw to look at myself
Are turning into somebody else

I know how this will end
But Im starting up again
Turned around, inside out
Cause this way

Takes me nowhere  I cant cant see a way out
Takes me nowhere  I cant cant see a way out
Takes me nowhere  I cant cant see a way out
It beats me up

When I go there  I know I could start again
When I go there  Oh no, here we go again
Takes me nowhere  Oh no, here we go again
It beats me up

Open on this scene
A familiar dream
Of you telling me what I already know
Though the truth seems near
You cant get there from here
But you sure know where youre gonna go

As the rumor wind blows
My infamy grows
Seeing friends above
And I hit another low
The picture I paint to look at myself
Is turning into somebody else

I know how this will end
But Im starting up again
Turned around, inside out
Cause this way

But today, if I change
And stop digging my own grave
I will try, to set things right
Cause this way---Lyrics submitted by Kis.
