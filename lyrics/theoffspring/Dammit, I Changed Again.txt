"Hey, come inside
While I stand here acting bored
(yes I feel this way)
Clear out the cobwebs in my soul

This time I turn around, things have
changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, kick a fit, one more time
Dammit, I changed again

Now I dont see things the way I did 
before
(yes I feel this way)
Things I feel yesterday
Don't matter anymore

Doesn't make any sense
To feel so different than today
(yes I feel this way)
When nothing's changed except for

Next time I turn around, things have
Changed
Now i don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, kick a fit, one more time
Dammit I changed again

Next time I turn around, things have
Changed
Now i don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, kick a fit, one more time
Dammit I changed again

Next time I turn around, things have
Changed
Now i don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight, kick a fit, one more time
Dammit I changed again

I see it---Lyrics submitted by Somorjai dm.
