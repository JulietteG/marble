So here we go
Having the same old fight again
There she goes
Same old game that never ends
If I could say
All the right words
I know I
could make you stay
If I could say 
All the right words
Things would work out all right

And if you go
I won't believe
That it's forever
And you can go
But I'll never leave
Cause it's not over

Replay last night
Talking it out don't make it right
I know she's tired
But my whole word
Is her and all we've got now

And if you go
I won't believe 
That it's forever---Lyrics submitted by La Narsheska.
