One is for envy and one just for spite
The cuts in my heart they show in your eyes

Don't make it better
The twisting knife turns all by itself
Onto someone else

Your self-liberation will leave this behind
Beyond swings and arrows that rain on our minds

Don't make it better
Shake it off it never mattered anyway

If we don't make it alive
Well it's a hell of a good day to die
All our lives that shine strong
Only lasts for so long

And it's ashes to ashes again
Should we even try to pretend
All our lives that shine strong
Only lasts for so long

The banner you're waving is burning in red
It's blocking the sunlight that shines overhead

You against the world diamonds and pearls
Voices inside you churn watch the city burn

Your own liberation will leave them behind
On the swings and arrows that rain on your mind

Don't make it better
Break it cause it never mattered anyway

If we don't make it alive
Well it's a hell of a good day to die
All our lives that shine strong
Only lasts for so long

And it's ashes to ashes again
Should we even try to pretend
All our lives that shine strong
Only lasts for so long

I won't calm down

The banner you're waving is burning in red
You against the world diamonds and pearls
It never mattered mattered mattered anyway

If we don't make it alive
Well it's a hell of a good day to die
All our lives that shine strong
Only lasts for so long

And it's ashes to ashes again
Should we even try to pretend
All our lives that shine strong
Only lasts for so long

Our light that shines strong
Only lasts for so long---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
