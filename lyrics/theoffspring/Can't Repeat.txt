I woke the other day
And saw my world has changed
The past is over but tomorrows wishful thinking
I cant hold onto whats been done
I cant grab onto whats to come
And Im just wishing I could stop, but

Life goes on
Come of age
Cant hold on
Turn the page

Time rolls on
Wipe these eyes
Yesterday laughs
Tomorrow cries

Memories are bittersweet
The good times we cant repeat
Those days are gone and we can never get them back
Now we must move ahead
Despite our fear and dread
Were all just wishing we could stop, but

Life goes on
Come of age
Cant hold on
Turn the page

Time rolls on
Wipe your eyes
Yesterday laughs
Tomorrow cries

With all our joys and fears
Wrapped in forgotten years
The past is laughing as today just slips away
Time tears down what weve made
And sets another stage
And Im just wishing we could stop

Life goes on
Come of age
Cant hold on
Turn the page

Time rolls on
Wipe these eyes
Yesterday laughs
Tomorrow cries---
