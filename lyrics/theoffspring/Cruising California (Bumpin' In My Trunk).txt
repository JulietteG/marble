Hey ho, lets go

(Go Go Go!) Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh Oh Oh!) I wanna feel it
(California) Dont you wish that you could come
Cause were never going home till the summers all gone

Summer time, livings easy
Cruising, bumping, my Huntington Beach
Cause the sun will shine
We have a good time
They all line up for a bump and grind

And the girl that you want is directly out in front
And shes waving her caboose at you
You sneeze achoo
She calls you out and boom!

I know you heard that bass bumpin in my trunk
Bum-bumpin in my trunk, bum-bumpin in my trunk (Oh yeah)
I know you heard that bass bumpin in my trunk (uh huh)
Bum-bumpin in my trunk (uh huh), bum-bumpin in my trunk (lets go)

(Go Go Go!) Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh Oh Oh!) I wanna feel it
(California) Dont you wish that you could come
Cause were never going home till the summers all gone

The sun goes down, the friepits leep
Its another summer night here in the OC
Well I know a baller but I do have an Impala
And I might say Hey but Ill never say Holla

The girl with the glass and a g-string just like a floss
Well shes waving her caboose at you
I bet you do
She calls you out (uh huh)

I know you heard that bass bumpin in my trunk (uh huh)
Bum-bumpin in my trunk (uh huh), bum-bumpin in my trunk (bump that truck)
I know you heard that bass bumpin in my trunk (uh huh)
Bum-bumpin in my trunk (uh huh) bum-bumpin in my trunk (lets go)

(Go Go Go!) Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh Oh Oh!) I wanna feel it
(California) Dont you wish that you could come
With the radio on, plays it all summer long

(Go Go Go!) Youre all Im breakin
(Oh Oh Oh!) My friends are drinkin
(California) Dont you wish that you could come
Cause were never going home till the summers all gone

(California)
(California)

I know you heard that bass bumpin in my trunk (uh huh)
Bum-bumpin in my trunk (uh huh) , bum-bumpin in my trunk (hey ho, lets go)

(Go Go Go!) Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh Oh Oh!) I wanna feel it
(California) Dont you wish that you could come
With the radio on, plays it all summer long

(Go Go Go!) Youre all Im breakin
(Oh Oh Oh!) My friends are drinkin
(California) Dont you wish that you could come
Cause were never going home till the summers all gone

(California) Dont you wish that you could come
Cause were never going home till the summers all gone---
