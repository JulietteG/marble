Before you started tokin' you used to have a brain
But now you don't get even the simplest of things
I can draw a little picture
Or even use my hands
I try to explain but you just don't understand 

Man you're really losin' it
And you've really done a lot of junk now
But you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to you

It's bad enough you do it to yourself
But taking someone with you
Well you know that's something else
I say i'm not that kind of person
I'm not that kind of man
I try to explain but you just don't understand

Man you're really losin' it
And you've really done a lot of junk now
But you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to you

I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back
But you do it in the morning 
You do it in the night
You lie to refrain from just facing your life 
So I'll see you man tomorrow 
You'll be gackin' up again 
I'll see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent
I think of all the times that L tried to lend a hand
I try to explain but you just don't understand

Man you're really losin' it
And you've really done a lot of junk now
But you keep on abusin' it
What in the world happened to you---Lyrics submitted by cathy.
