Sometimes i think i' gonna drown
Cause everyone around's so hollow
I'm alone
Sometimes i think i'm going down
But no one makes a sound
They follow
and i'm alone
Yeah if i make it i'd be amazed
just to find tomorrow
One more day and i'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting
And if i make it i'm still alone
No more hope for better days
But if i could change
Then i'd really be amazed
And when you know you can't relate
To one more shiny face
Your heart breaks
No one cares
And when you know you can't go on
Cause everything is wrong
Your heart breaks
But no one's there---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
