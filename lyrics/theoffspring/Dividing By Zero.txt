Oh, take me higher
All the way to the sun
Down to the wire
Fighting's only begun

Chorus:
It's closing in on you
It's closing in on you
Run from the fire raining down on you
It's closing in on you
It's closing in on you
And no way out

I will persevere
I will resist you here
I will interfere
I'm not the only son
My will will be done
A dissent begun

Chorus:
It's closing in on you
It's closing in on you
Run from the fire raining down on you
It's closing in on you
It's closing in on you
And no way out
Gonna make it through
I'm gonna make it through
Divide by zero like a wrecking crew
It's closing in on you
It's closing in on you
And no way out

Oh, take me higher
All the way to the sun
I will persevere
I will resist you here
I will interfere

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Allan Rocker.
