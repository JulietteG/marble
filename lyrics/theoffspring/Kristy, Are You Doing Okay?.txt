Theres a moment in time 
And its stuck in my mind 
Way back, when we were just kids 

Cause your eyes told the tale 
Of an act of betrayal 
I knew that somebody did 

Oh, waves of time 
Seem to wash away 
The scenes of our crimes 
But for you this never ends 

Can you stay strong? 
Can you go on? 
Kristy are you doing okay? 
A rose that wont bloom 
Winters kept you 
Dont waste your whole life trying 
To get back what was taken away 

Though the marks on your dress 
Had been neatly repressed 
I knew that something was wrong 
And I should have spoke out 
And Im so sorry now 
I didnt know 
Cause we were so young 

Oh, clouds of time 
Seem to rain on 
Innocence left behind 
And it never goes away 

Can you stay strong? 
Can you go on? 
Kristy are you doing okay? 
A rose that wont bloom 
Winters kept you 
Dont waste your whole life trying 
To get back what was taken away 

Oh, clouds of time 
Seem to rain on 
Innocence left behind 
And it never goes away 

Can you stay strong? 
Can you go on? 
Kristy are you doing okay? 
A rose that wont bloom 
Winters kept you 
Dont waste your whole life trying 
To get back what was taken away 

Dont waste your whole life trying 
To get back what was taken away---Lyrics submitted by abby.
