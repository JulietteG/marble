Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it we are one

Dog eat dog
Every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog
To get by
Hope you like my genocide

I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see thing as they are
We're served up on a plate
The pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time 
We can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow

Our time is up

Dog eat dog
Every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog
To get by
Hope you like my genocide

I bet you'd only run
if you saw what goes inside our own 
I bet you'd lead the way
If it were up to you to decide
But i's not

Dog eat dog
Every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog
To get by
Hope you like my genocide---Lyrics submitted by cathy.
