He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrechin' up his shit
He's a Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead...yeah
You know I saw his woman
She was writing his name in blood
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
She said she was his baby
Who looked just like the Hoover Dam
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
He's a Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead...yeah---Lyrics submitted by cathy.
