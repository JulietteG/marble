The winds of fortune
Don't blow the same
She had to get out
And make a change
She had a kid now
But much too young
The baby's daddy's out having fun

He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby mumma
She ain't so slow
He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All the world is getting with I say
Consequences are a lot but hey
That's the way it 
That's the way things go

What was a family
Is now a shell
We're raising kids now
Who raise themselves
Sex is a weapon
It's like a drug
It gets him right into that
Grave that he just dug

She's saying
I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
Her baby daddy
It ain't his only one
She's saying
I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
Everybody's getting with I say
Consequences are a lot but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go

Well it winds up
Broken up 
Really such a shame
But why not
Take a chance
Everything's a game
And it don't stop 
Hooking up
Nothing's gonna change
The more he's trying
The more he's buying

He says
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby mumma 
Don't need to know
He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All the world is getting with I say
Consequences are a lot but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
