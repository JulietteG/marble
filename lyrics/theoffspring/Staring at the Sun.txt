Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Dodging bullets while youre trying to find your way
Everyones around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I wont let them

If I seem bleak, well, youd be correct
And if I dont speak, its cause I get disconnected
But I wont be burned by the reflection
Of the fire in your eyes

As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun
As youre staring at the sun

Hey, when I ran I didnt feel like a runaway
Hey, when I escaped I didnt feel like I got away
Hey, theres more to living than only surviving
Maybe Im not there, but Im still trying

Though you hear me, I dont think that you relate
My will is something that you cant confiscate
So forgive me, but I wont be frustrated
By destruction in your eyes

As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun, whoa

Hey, when I ran I didnt feel like a runaway
Hey, when I escaped I didnt feel like I got away
Hey, theres more to living than only surviving
Maybe Im not there, but Im still trying

Though you hear me, I dont think that you relate
My will is something that you cant confiscate
So forgive me, but I wont be frustrated
By destruction in your eyes

As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun, whoa

Hey, maybe life is like a ride on a freeway
Hey, dodging bullets while youre trying to find your way
Hey, everyones around, but no one does a damn thing
It brings me down, but I wont let them

If I seem bleak, well, youd be correct
And if I dont speak, its cause I get disconnected
But I wont be burned by the reflection
Of the fire in your eyes

As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun, whoa
As youre staring at the sun
As youre staring at the sun---Lyrics submitted by Anonymous.
