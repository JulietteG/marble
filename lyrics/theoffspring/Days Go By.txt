Werent you the light
It wont save you tonight
All our yesterdays
Pictures lost in time
Never enough, towers crumble to dust.
Looking back on the moments of our lives

All your anger, all your hurt
It doesnt matter in the end
Those days go by and we all start again
What you had and what you lost
Theyre all memories in the wind
Those days go by and we all start again

Stars still burn bright, seasons change over night
As we find a way, the times they come and go
Look back in love, a new day rises above
With no end it comes, to carry you back home

All your anger, all your hurt
It doesnt matter in the end
Those days go by and we all start again
What you had and what you lost
Theyre all memories in the wind
Those days go by and we all start again

Oh, oh days go by

All your anger, all your hurt
It doesnt matter in the end
Those days go by and we all start again
What you had and what you lost
Theyre all memories in the wind
Those days go by and we all start again

What you had, what you lost
What you had, what you lost
Those days go by
Those days go by
Those days go by---
