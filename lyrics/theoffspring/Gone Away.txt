Maybe in another life.
I could find you there.
Pulled away berfore your time.
I can't deal it, it's so unfair.

And it feels,
And it feels, like
Heavens so far away.
And it feels,
Yeah it feels like
The world has grown cold.
Now that you've gone away.

Leaving flowers on your grave.
Show that I still care.
But black roses and Hail Mary's.
Can't bring back what's taken from me.
I reach to the sky,
And call out your name.
And if I could trade,
I would.

And it feels,
And it feels like
Heaven's so far away.
And it stings,
Yeah it stings,
The world is so cold,
Now that you've gone away.
Gone Away.
Gone Away.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Oooo Aooo Oooo Oooo Oooo Oh Yeah
I'll Save Your Soul
Woah Yeeeeeaaah. Mmm.

I reach to the sky.
And call out your name.
Oh please let me trade,
I would.

And it Feels,
And it Feels, Like
Heaven's so far away
And it Feels,
Yeah it Feels, like
The world has grown cold.
Now That you've gone away.
Gone Away, Gone Away, Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Ooooo yeah Ooooo Oooo Oooo, Oh Yeah
Yeah Ooooo Yeah Ooooo Oooo Oooo Oooo, Oh Yeah---Lyrics submitted by james.
