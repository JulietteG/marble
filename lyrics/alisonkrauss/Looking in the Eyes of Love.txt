I wonder should I tell you
'Bout all the crazy things I've ever done?
I've been searching all my life
And when I should have stayed, I tried to run.

I was searching for an answer
In a world full of strangers
But what I found was never real enough
Now that I've found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love.

Darlin' you've been good to me
You are so much more than I deserve
I never thought that I would find
Someone who's so sweet and kind like you.

Please believe me when I say
This time I won't run away
I swear by all of heaven's stars above
Now that I've found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love.

Looking in the eyes of love, I can see forever
I can see you and me walking in this old world together,
Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of,
Now that I've found you, I'm looking in the eyes of love.
