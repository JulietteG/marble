Well it's always we ramble, this river and I
All along your green valleys I work 'til I die
My land I'll defend with my life needed be
'Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee dam where the waters run down
Every state in this union us migrants have been
Lord we come with the dust and we go with the wind

California, Arizona I harvest your crops
Then it on up north to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beat from your ground, cut the grape from your vine
Just to place on your table that light sparklin' wine

Well it's always we ramble, this river and I
All along your green valleys I work 'til I die
My land I'll defend with my life needed be
Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free---Lyrics submitted by Carla.
