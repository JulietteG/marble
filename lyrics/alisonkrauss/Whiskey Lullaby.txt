La La La La La La Laaaa La La La La La La Laaaa

She put him out like the burnin end of midnigt cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink his pain away, a little at a time
But he could never get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night..

{ Chorus }
He put that bottle to his head, and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note said "I'll love her 'till I die"
And when we buried him beneth the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La La La La La La Laaaa La La La La La La Laaaa

{ Alison Krauss Solo }
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself 
For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night...

She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Then the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
