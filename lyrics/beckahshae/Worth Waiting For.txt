So long, Ive hoped for you (for you)
So far, no one compares to you (compares to you)

You got me dancing like a fool when Im alone in my room
You have me shouting halleluiah just when I think about you
You got me loopy like a rollercoaster baby and Im hanging on
You got me skipping like a record baby to my favorite song

You are the one, you are the one
Who surpasses all my expectations
My search is done, my search is done
So Im going to have myself a celebration
You are more than I could have ever asked for
Ive never been more sure
This love is so worth waiting for

I know my prayers can be answered
Youve proved dreams do really come true

You got me dancing like a fool when Im alone in my room
You have me shouting halleluiah just when I think about you
You got me loopy like a rollercoaster baby and Im hanging on
You got me skipping like a record baby to my favorite song

You are the one, you are the one
Who surpasses all my expectations
My search is done, my search is done
So Im going to have myself a celebration
You are more than I could have ever asked for
Ive never been more sure
This love is so worth waiting for

You are what I never knew I always wanted
Its so incredible, the better thing that comes from trusting
Ive held patiences hand, youve made me a fan
Its so wonderful to be in Gods perfect plan
Oh I know I am blessed
And I know I would wait for you all over again

You are the one, you are the one
Who surpasses all my expectations
My search is done, my search is done
So Im going to have myself a celebration
You are more than I could have ever asked for
Ive never been more sure
This love is so worth waiting for---Lyrics submitted by Kohrt Terrie.
