What dont kill you can only make you stronger!
Ive taken a few blows, but Im ok though,
You know I just keep going!
Ive been straight knocked down, but I get up again,
Cause I aint no quitter!
So let me take this time to be thankful,
For the way Ive been made stronger!

CHORUS:
Going through the fire, but coming out gold!
Going through the fire, but coming out gold!
And Im going higher with my feet still on the floor.
Going through the fire, but coming out gold!

What dont kill you can only make you stronger!

Pushed back, pushed down, pushed away, its ok,
Cause I just keep movin forward!
Talking smash all that trash that they say,
It just aint worth my consideration no.
So Ima take this time to be thankful,
For the way Ive been made stronger!

{CHORUS}

So Ima take this time to be thankful,
For the way Ive been made stronger!

Cause I can take the pain, its for my good anyway,
Cause I aint gonna break, love holds me together.
This fire is making me better, refined and it dont matter whether,
Im lookin like a loser, cause Ima show you all a winner!
You can have it all, cause Im a giver,
But aint givin up, I aint no quitter!
So I think its better off you know, Im comin out gold!
