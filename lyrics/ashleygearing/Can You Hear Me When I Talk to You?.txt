Time passes by so quickly
But I guess I thought you'd be here forever
I never even had a chance
To say goodbye
There's so many things to tell you
Left unsaid until now

Can you hear me when I talk to you?
Do the words I say ever make it through?
Can you hear me when I talk to you?
'Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

Every night I have the same dream
The one where you get to hold me
We laugh and talk until the morning
And then you vanish, yeah
It always leaves me feeling helpless
When I wake up and you're not there

Can you hear me when I talk to you?
Do you know how much I'd love to be with you?
Can you hear me when I talk to you?
'Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

Livin' in this world without you
I constantly search through my memories
Hoping that I find some treasures
That I passed over, yeah
All that I took for granted
Means so much now and I won't let it go

Can you hear me when I talk to you?
'Cause I never said some things that I meant to
Can you hear me when I talk to you?
'Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

You know I never said some things that I meant to
Can you hear me when I talk to you?
'Cause I'd give anything if I just knew

I miss you Daddy---Lyrics submitted by Janice.
