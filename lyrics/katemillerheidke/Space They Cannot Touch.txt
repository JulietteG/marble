Hows my luck
But somehow I'm with you
Let's leave now 
Let's leave them
And their point of view
My favourite place is me and you

I wake up in the darkest night
I watch you breathe in shadow light
A perfect world lies next to me
And now I don't need to sleep to dream

I just hope I am good enough to keep you

Morning sun warms our skin
And distant sounds
The day begins
Soon their world will come calling for us
But this is space they cannot touch

This is space they cannot touch

I just hope I am good enough to keep you.---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
