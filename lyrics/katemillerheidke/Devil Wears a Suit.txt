End of October
Sun's fallen over
Wolves on the street
Wolves on the street
Roaming
Howling
Smoke in the distance
Strangers are calling
Paid for your time 
Paid for your time, boy
Hold on 
Hold on

He's not underground
He's not in the air
He's not in that book
You take everywhere
The devil wears a suit
He lives in our town
He lives on our street
In your home
In your bed

Aren't you the bright one
Aren't you the trooper
Where did you go?
Where have you been, son
No where
With no one

Talking in circles
Point of confusion
Who needs a hug 
Who needs a hug, then 
You do 
You do 

He's not underground
He's not in the air
He's not in that book
You take everywhere
The devil wears a suit
He lives in our town
He lives on our street 
In your home
In your home
... In your bed

House of your friendly local accomplice
Shoes at the door 
Shoes at the door, please 
Mind your secrets
Out in the garden
Under the elkweed
Ribs in the dirt 
Ribs in a dirt heap
Silence
Silence

[2nd chorus]

The devil wears a suit X3---Lyrics submitted by Madizon McSpaaz.
