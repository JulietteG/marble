You and me
Were good together
So good together
Everyone said it

Before you left
I'd never felt a love like that

More and more lately
You get lonely
You're no stranger to 3AM
You call my number
You call me just because you can

Cause you know I'll come
Cause you know I'll helpless

And maybe this'll be the time I change your mind
Maybe this'll be the time I change your mind
Maybe this will be the night
Maybe this'll be the time I change your mind

I drive for hours
Round the city
But I always end up on your street

One night I slept outside your house
In my car
It was freezing 
I was shivering, thinking maybe this'll be the time I change your mind

I know you know you know
You can say it's not so
It's like being in hell
I fall for you over and over and over again

I know you're using me
For comfort and company
I use you too, to feed my fantasy

You will take what you need
And I will take what I can get
which isn't very much
A little human heat, a little human touch

And maybe this'll be the time I change your mind---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
