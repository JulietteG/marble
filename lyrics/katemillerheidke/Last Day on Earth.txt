Look down,
The ground below is crumbling.
Look up,
The stars are all exploding.

Hey yeah, hey yeah oh oh
Hey yeah, hey yeah

It's the last, day on earth,
In my dreams, in my dreams,
It's the end, of the world,
And you've come back, to me.
In my dreams.

Between,
The dust and the debris.
There's a light,
Surrounding you and me.

Hey yeah, hey yeah oh oh
Hey yeah, hey yeah

It's the last, day on earth,
In my dreams, in my dreams,
It's the end, of the world,
And you've come back, to me.
In my dreams.

And you hold me closer than I,
Can ever remember being held,
And I'm not, afraid to sleep now,
If we can stay like this until.

It's the last, day on earth,
In my dreams, in my dreams,
It's the end, of the world,
And you've come back, to me.
In my dreams.

Hey yeah, hey yeah oh oh
Hey yeah, hey yeah

In my head I repeat our conversations,
Over and over 'til they feel like hallucinations,
You know me, I love to lose my mind.
And everytime anybody speaks your name,
I still feel the same, I ache, I ache, I ache inside.

In my head I repeat our conversations,
Over and over 'til they feel like hallucinations,
You know me, I love to lose my mind.
And everytime anybody speaks your name,
I still feel the same, I ache, I ache, I ache inside.
I ache, I ache, I ache inside.
I ache, I ache, I ache inside.
I ache, I ache, I ache inside---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
