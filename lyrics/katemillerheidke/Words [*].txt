These words are workin' do they work for you? Is there somthing wrong between us is there something i can do? I there somthing I can get back from all the times you threw away shushing up the message when you should have seized the day. Do you think my personality is written in stone, are you positively certain that you know what you've been shown. Now give it up, give it up give it up!

I've been the leader, i've been the follower, i've been the dreamer i've been the wallower, i take the high road, i take the low road, i don't wanna be a mother! I've been down boys, i've been down boys, i've been right to the top, when you hear me coming you can hear a pin drop!---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
