Patience, test my patience.
If I made it too hard for you maybe you should've changed it.

Say it, you should say it,
'Cause I'd say I was wrong just to make it fill all the spaces.

Waiting, always waiting.
If I gave you control would you say that we could've saved it?

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday,
In weakness or in strength,
Change can be amazing.
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you.

I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me. 
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me. 

Chasing, always chasing dreams.
Whyd you stick around, whyd you stay with me?
Whyd you fake it?

Hesitation is killing me too.
But I couldnt save it, I couldnt save it.

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday,
In weakness or in strength,
Change can be amazing.
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you.
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you.

I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me. 
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me. 
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me. 
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me. ---
