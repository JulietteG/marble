I want a new yellow Ferrari from the 90s in the driveway
But I know that you wouldn't like that
I want it now, I want it loud, I want it my way
But everybody doesnt fight like that

Don't tell me about the rules and break them
And don't tell me about mistakes
And make the same ones I have made before
Don't say you love me more
Better not say it
I met her at church
But she could be Satan

You and I are two oceans apart
We're on earth to break each others hearts, in two
And it's hard with you
When I'm too far from you
I look at the stars, do you?

Don't tell me about the rules and break them
And don't tell me about mistakes
And make the same ones I have made before
Don't say you love me more
Better not say it
I met her at church
But she could be Satan

You're LA and I'm Newbury Park
But youre the flame I use when it gets dark
You've got enough pain for both of us
I've got all these things I'm focused on
You treat all the rules like you're the queen
But you and I are few and far between---
