Just got cheated on, no it's not my day 
That's not my bitch, she's not my girl, she's not my babe 
My stomach's in pain 
I hope I don't throw up all over what you told 
But it hurts oh no no 

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me 
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting 
I can't even, can't even hear your side 
Shame on me, you fooled me twice 
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like 
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else 
You like to say that you're right 
Did it make you feel bad 
When you cheated on your man last night 
Did I even ever cross your mind 
You like to say that you're right 
Did it make you feel bad 
When you cheated on your man last night 
Did I even ever cross your mind 
You like to say that you're right 
You like to say that you're right 

Drop head with a time hoodie on me 
Bought a hundred chains now the bitches all linger 
Walk by the crib, smell the kitchen all stanky 
Floor seats, 4 quarter, spent a quarter on the link 
Ridin' through Philly, Meek Milly never lost 
Still ridin' through the strip catchin' licks with my dog 
30 for the whole, 15 for the half 
You could break it down, come and see me with the bag 
Shorty fell in love with a young rich nigga 
Blunt full of smoke and a cup full of liquor 
Say what I mean and I mean what I said baby 
Silk sheets, I be slippin' off the bed baby 

Just got cheated on, no it's not my day 
That's not my bitch, she's not my girl, she's not my babe 
My stomach's in pain 
I hope I don't throw up all over what you told 
But it hurts oh no no 

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me 
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting 
I can't even, can't even hear your side 
Shame on me, you fooled me twice 
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like 
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else 
You like to say that you're right 
Did it make you feel bad 
When you cheated on your man last night 
Did I even ever cross your mind 
You like to say that you're right 
Did it make you feel bad 
When you cheated on your man last night 
Did I even ever cross your mind 
You like to say that you're right 
You like to say that you're right---
