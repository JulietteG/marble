I woke up with the news today and I think there's somebody after me
I got up, put my boots away and my broken bat in the hollow tree
I got nowhere to walk around, I don't know why they hassle me
I don't know what it is today but I think that somebody's after me

Wait through it, cause they were wrong
And we knew it all along

I woke up with the news today and I think that somebody's after me
I got up and the papers said that my hollow bat's from the broken tree
Everyone's got a word to say, but no one knows what to say to me
I don't know what it is today but I think that somebody's after me

Wait through it, cause they were wrong
And we knew it all along
They were wrong
Drive me home

I didn't want to let you down
They're hoping that I might
Nobody's gonna take me down
Not without a fight.

I woke up with the news today and I think that somebody's after me
I got up, put my boots away and my broken bat in the hollow tree

Wait through it, cause they were wrong
We've been through it for way too long
Wait through it, cause they were wrong
And we knew it all along
They were wrong
Drive me home---Lyrics submitted by Os.
