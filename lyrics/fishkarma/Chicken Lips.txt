oh when i was  a little kid i never like to eat momma 
put thangs on my plate I dumped them on her feet 
then one day she made this soup i ate it all in bed
I asked her what she put in it and this is what she said


oh chicken lips and lizard hips and alligater eyes
 monkey legs and buzzard eggs and salamander thighs 
rabbit ears and camel rears and tasty toe nail pies
stir them all together and its mama soup surprise


I went in to the bathroom and i stood beside the sink
i said im feelin slightly ill i think Id think I like a drink
mama said ive just the thing i'll get it in a wink
its full of lots of protien and vitamens i think


oh chicken lips and lizard hips and alligater eyes
monkey legs and buzzard and salamander thighs
rabbit ears and camal rears and tasty toe nail pies
stir them all together and its mama soup surprise---Lyrics submitted by kentrell.
