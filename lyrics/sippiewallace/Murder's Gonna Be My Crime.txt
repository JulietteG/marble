Tell me baby, what in the world is wrong with your mind?
Talk to me pretty papa, tell me what in the world is wrong with your mind?
You keeps me worried, and I'm bothered all the time.

Some folks thinks I'm happy, but oh you don't know.
Some folks thinks I'm happy, but oh, you don't know.
You can never tell what goes behind closed doors.

You made me love you. Now your lover girls done come.
You made me love you. Now your lover girls done come.
If you didn't want me, why in the world don't you send me home?

Baby, you don't know, you don't really know.
Baby, you don't know, you don't really know my mind.
You misuse me and I really don't mind, darlin'. 

Well, I'm charged with stealing, but murder is my crime.
I'm charged with stealing, but murder is my crime.
I'm gonna kill my baby, unless he change his mind.
Lord, change your mind.---Lyrics submitted by Yariana Diaz.
