On bended knee is no way to be free 
lifting up an empty cup I ask silently 
that all my destinations will accept the one that's me 
so I can breathe 

Circles they grow and they swallow people whole 
half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know 
got a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul 
so it goes... 

Don't come closer or I'll have to go 
Holding me like gravity are places that pull 
If ever there was someone to keep me at home 
It would be you... 

Everyone I come across in cages they bought 
they think of me and my wandering 
but I'm never what they thought 
got my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughts 
I'm alive... 

Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere 
underneath my being is a road that disappeared 
late at night I hear the trees 
they're singing with the dead 
overhead... 

Leave it to me as I find a way to be 
consider me a satellite for ever orbiting 
I knew all the rules but the rules did not know me 
guaranteed...---Lyrics submitted by Trina.
