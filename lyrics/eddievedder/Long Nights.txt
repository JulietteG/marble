Have no fear,
for when I'm alone
I'll be better off
then I was before

I've got this life
I'll be around to grow
who I was before
I can not recall

Long nights allow
me to feel I'm falling
I am falling 
the lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling
safely to the ground

I'll take this soul
thats inside me now
like a brand new friend
I'll forever know

I've got this life
and the will to show
I will always be
better than before

Long nights allow
me to feel I'm falling
I am falling 
the lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling
safely to the ground---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
