I will come to you in the day time
I will graze into your bed
I will kiss you in four places
as I go swimming around in your hair
I will squeeze the life right out of you
I will make you laugh and make you cry
and you may never forget it as I make you call my name 
as I shout it to the blue summer sky

and we may never meet again 
so shed your skin lets get started
and you will throw your arms around me
and you will throw your arms around me

I will come to you at night time
I will climb into your bed
I will kiss you in 155 places
as I go swimming around in your hair
I will squeeze the life right out of you 
I will make you laugh and make you cry
and we may never forget it
as I make you call my name as you shout it to the blue summer
sky

and we may never meet again 
so shed your skin lets get started
and you will throw your arms around me 
and you will throw your arms around me

ohh...

..and you will throw your arms around me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
