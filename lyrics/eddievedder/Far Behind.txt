Take leave in conscious mind
Found myself to be so inclined
Why sleep in discontent
For the price of companionship

[Chorus]
My shadow runs with me
Underneath the big white sun
My shadow comes with me as we leave it all
We leave it all far behind

Ah, empty pockets will
Allow a greater sense of wealth
Why contain yourself like any other book on a shelf

[Chorus]
My shadow lays with me
Underneath the big white sun
My shadow stays with me as we leave it all
We leave it all far behind...

Subtle voices in the wind,
And the truth they're telling
The world begins where the road ends
Watch me leave it all behind
Far behind---Lyrics submitted by lucinovna.
