Oh my where do, how do I begin
to answer the question
I know you been wonderin'
When could, why could
How could it all be true
These things, who's that?
And what is he to you?

(Chorus)
He is
the mind injector
the heart protector
the soul defender of anything I fear
the baby conceiver
the make me believer
the joy bringer
the love giver

He is
the dough increaser
the pleasure releaser
the hard knocks knower without the scars to show ya
the night school teacher
the good life preacher
the caretaker
the kiss craver
he is

These words are only
frosting on my cake
feelings explained don't do justice to how I feel
so alive, so in love for the first time
no way can I hide
who.... what...

(Chorus)

He is
the mind injector
the heart protector
the soul defender of anything I fear
the baby conceiver
the make me believer
the joy bringer
the love giver

He is
the dough increaser
the pleasure releaser
the hard knocks knower without the scars to show ya
the night school teacher
the good life preacher
the caretaker
the kiss craver
he is

He is so
he is
so and so much more than
I thought it could be
so I, so I, so I gotta be the same for him
gotta be the same for him

The make it alrighter
the get you through the nighter
the soul defender of anything I fear
the pain remover
the bad times undoer
the joy bringer
the love giver
He is.......---Lyrics submitted by Lynetta.
