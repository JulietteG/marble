From Hank to Hendrix
I walk these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar
Doin what I do
I always expected
That you should see me through
I never believed in much
But I believed in you

[Chorus]
Can we get it together 
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make last
Like a musical ride

To Marilyn to Madonna
I always loved your smile
Now we're headed for the big divorce
California style
I found myself singing
Like a long lost friend
The same thing that makes you live
Can kill you in the end

[Chorus]
Can we get it together 
Can we still stand side by side 
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride

Sometimes it distorted
Not clear enough
Sometimes the beauty of love
Just comes ringin' through
New glass in the window
New leaf on the tree
New distance between us
You and me

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride---Lyrics submitted by Lexi Mellark.
