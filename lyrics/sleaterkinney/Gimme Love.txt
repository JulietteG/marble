Gimme love, gimme love
Never enough

My hands reach out to touch the earth
Born too small too weak too weird
I can't quite reach the thing I want
Out of touch, it's just a taunt

Patched together from some loose parts
Numb from the wicked this life imparts
Closed off from the seeing world
Inside my heart beats like a girl

All words, all wants, all needs, all time
All ways of life, all kinds, all types
The one thing we all hunger for
I wish there was a little more

Gimme love---
