There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!

Atomic tourist
A life in search of power
I found my test sight
I made a ritual of emptiness

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!

Wanna walk to, walk off
The edge of my own life
Doom Town, a bright flash
My body is a souvenir

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!

It took so long for me to see it
Hopes a burden or it sets you free
Wandered through the void of you
Wandered through the void of me
Ive grown afraid of everything that I love

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
It's not the city, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It's not the weather, it's the people we love!---
