Hey Darling
You're not home, this is your phone though, right?
Explanations are thin
But I feel it's time
You want to know where I've been for such a long time
Disappearing act right before your eyes

It seems to me the only thing
That comes from fame is mediocrity
How could you steal the thing I love
Then keep it from me, just out of touch?

Hey Darling the situation was justified
There were some things I saw before I realized
That I was meant to be infinitely by your side
Distractions always hit but we're good this time

Sometimes the heat of the crowd feels a little too close
Sometimes the shout of the room makes me feel so alone---
