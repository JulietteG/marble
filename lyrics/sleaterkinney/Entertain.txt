So you want to be entertained?
 Please look away (dont look away)
 We're not here 'cause we want to entertain
 Go away (don't go away)
 Reality is the new fiction, they say
 True is truer these days, truth is man-made
 If you're here cause you want to be entertained
 Go away (Please Go Away)

(wahh oh ohh)
If you're heart is done, Johnny get your gun 
Join the rank and file, on your TV dial

You come around looking 1984
 You're such a bore, 1984
 Nostalgia, well you're using it like a whore
 It's better than before, it's better than before
 You come around sounding 1972
 You did nothing new with 1972
 Where is the fuck you?
 Where's the black and blue
Where's the Black and Blue?!

(wahh oh ohh)
If you're heart is done, Johnny get your gun 
Join the rank and file, on your TV dial

Hey! Look around they are lying to you.
They are lying, they are lying and..
 Can't you see it is just a silly ruse?
 They are lying, and I am lying too.
 All you want is entertainment,
 Rip me open it's free

(wahh oh ohh)
If you're heart is done, Johnny get your gun 
Join the rank and file, on your TV dial

[Don't drag me down,
 I'm not falling down] x2

1, 2, 3! If you wanna take a shot at me,
 Well Get in line
 1, 2, 3! Baby I've had all my shots
 and I'm fine

1, 2, 3! If you haven't had enough of me,
 Well get in line, In line
 1, 2, 3! You too deserve it now,
 it's all right

1, 2, 3! We can drown in mediocrity
 It feels sublime, sublime
 1, 2, 3! It feels like someone pushed the rewind

1, 2, 3! Give it to me easily,
 my feeble mind needs time
 1, 2, 3! Make it sweet and syrupy with rhyme

[Don't drag me down,
 I'm not falling down]

(wahh oh ohh)
If you're heart is done, Johnny get your gun 
Join the rank and file, on your TV dial

The grip of fear is already here
 The lines are drawn,
 Whose side are you on?---Lyrics submitted by veronica ford.
