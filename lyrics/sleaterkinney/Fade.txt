When the last strip of light is dimming
When the spotlight starts to fade
If there's no tomorrow
You better live

All of the roles that we played
Hit your mark, push the walls, stretch the stage
Oh, what a price that we paid
My dearest nightmare, my conscience, the end

Unbelievable masquerade
Never revealing your truth
Deeper inside that mask you made
Losing the face of you

Tell me what do you see in the last script
Yeah it's a trip, what's it all for?
If we are truly dancing our swan song, darling
Shake it like never before

Oh what a price that we paid
My dearest nightmare, my conscience, the end---
