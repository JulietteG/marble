I loved with a closed fist, too tight,
Afraid it would fly away.
Try to be all I thought would work,
Too much shifting shade.

Change the way I deal with matters of the heart
And open my hand
To find from the shine, now I over-stand.

I can love you in a very deep and special way,
I can love you like that.
I can do it, you just say it, if you know you really want this.

Let this love flow free,
So we can see what love can be.

Caught in a web of external dreams,
Still soft and free soul
Time to change how I play this game,
Accept what I cant control.

Ill never give up loving from the heart,
Ill open my mind.
To find Im in my shrine, energy align.

I can love you in a very deep and special way,
I can love you like that.
I can do it, you just say it, if you know you really want this.

Let this love flow free,
So we can see what love can be.

Im not looking for a fairy tale, Im not looking for an answer,
Im not looking for a shortcut, they all lead to disaster.
Im not running away, no,
Im not holding on, either,
cause were bound into the ether.

I can love you in a very deep and special way,
I can love you like that.
I can do it, you just say it, if you know you really want this.

Let this love flow free,
So we can see what love can be.

I can love you in a very deep and special way,
I can do it, you just say it, if you know you really want this.

Let this love flow free,
So we can see what love can be.---Lyrics submitted by Sasha B.
