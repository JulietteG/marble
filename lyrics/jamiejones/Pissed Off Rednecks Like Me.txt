Mr. stick-head politician
I got some news for you
If you want to come
Tryin' to take my gun
Son you better be bulletproof
And don't try to tell my children
When and where to pray
We ain't that far gone
We're still standing on
The land of the free
And the home of the brave
No, I'm not your normal political society

This is coming from real America, son
And pissed off rednecks like me

No, I wont push one for English
I just as soon hang up the phone
If you wanna serve in a Muslim church
Go and take your ass back home
Get up and go to work if you're able
Instead of living off our dime
This give me a hand out generation
Is gonna bleed this country dry
Yeah, I think it's time that we change some policy

As for most of us
It's still in God we trust
Here on this side of the ground
Get up and give thanks in the morning
And we work till the sun goes down
Things have got to change
We can't sit back, got to lead

Old folks say can't afford medication
Still Obamacare is a joke
They've help you with your sickness
I saved mine up and take a toll
They need to lock down on the borders
Throw away the keys
In a cell bar on right here at home
Instead of sending it overseas
But right now raise your glasses
People breathe---
