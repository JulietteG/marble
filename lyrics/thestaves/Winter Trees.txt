White winter trees,
Covered in snow.
I dont mind,
I dont mind.
I think of you now,
Here in the cold.
You wont mind,
You wont know.

But I never meant to say,
Any of those things.
Oh, I never meant to tell you how,
To be or how to think.
Oh, I was wrong.

Heavy of heart,
Weary of soul.
You wont mind,
You wont mind.
I think of him now,
Fathoms below.
You wont mind,
You wont know.

But I never meant to say,
Any of those things.
Words can sound so cruel,
When you speak before you think.
Oh, I was wrong.

But you didn't understand,
That my heart was in your hands,
You were so blind.
Blind.

I promised you that Id never let you down.
Oh, but I couldn't love you any less than now.
And I promised you that Id never let you down,
Oh, but I couldn't love you any less than I do now.

And I lost myself on that November night.

White winter trees,
Covered in snow.
I dont mind...---Lyrics submitted by Cat Fitzgerald.
