but often it happens you know
that the things you dont trust are the ones you need most
so it's cautiously into the dark
but you see before long that your eyes will adjust
and under the night you can hear
the full moon rise like a psalm in the air
and the air goes into your lungs
and around in your heart and on through your blood
it goes cautiously into the dark
and you see before long that we all have a part
and under your skin you can feel
that the fear that you feel is what will set you free

and under the night you can hear
the full moon rise like a psalm in the air
and the air goes into your lungs---Lyrics submitted by shineon.
