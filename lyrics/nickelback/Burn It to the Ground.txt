Well it's Midnight, damn right
We're wound up too tight
I gotta fist full of whiskey
The bottle just bit me
Ooooo
That shit makes me bad shit crazy
We got no fear no doubt all in balls out

Were going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Take everything in sight (hey)
Were goin til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight (oohh) (oohh) (oohh)

We're screamin like demons
and swinging from the ceiling
I gotta fistful of Fifties
Tequila just hit me

Ooooohhh

We got no class, no taste
No shirt and shit faced
We got them lined up
Shot down firing back straight Crown

Were going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Take everything in sight (hey)
Were goin til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight (ohh) (oohh) (ooh)

Tickin like a time bomb
Drinkin damn the night's gone
Get your hands off of this glass
Last call my ass
No chain no lock and this train won't stop
We got no fear no doubt all in balls out

Were going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Take everything in sight (hey)
Were goin til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight (oohh) (oohh) (oohh)

Were going out tonight (hey)
To kick out every light (hey)
Take anything we want (hey)
Take everything in sight (hey)
Were goin til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight---Lyrics submitted by kassi.
