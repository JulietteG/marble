Before this hits the ground
Before this fades away
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around
And before I walk away
I want you to make me
Make me, make me

Make me believe again
It's some kind of fate
That we'll see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never that far away
Make me believe again
Make me believe again

I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend
Make me believe again
Believe again

If you could take the times
And wash it all away
Then you could say the words
And make me wanna stay
Just tell if there's a chance
To hell with all them lame
If you could take my hand
Then you could lead the way
I want you to make me
Make me, make me

Make me believe again
It's some kind of fate
That we'll see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never that far away
Make me believe again
Make me believe again

I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend
Make me believe again

Make me believe again
It's some kind of fate
That we'll see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never that far away
Make me believe again
Make me believe again

I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend
Make me believe again

I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend
Make me believe again---
