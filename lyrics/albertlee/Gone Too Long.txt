Wake up, reach out, youre gone, no doubt
Youve been gone too long
Youve been gone too long
Cant be more than a minute or two,
The way I feel about you,
Youve been gone too long
Gotta go, you say, gotta work, for your pay
But you wont be long
Dont you be too long
Dont be gone about a minute or so, as I heard you go
Youve been gone too long
Ohoo Whee, where did she go? Whered my baby go?
Ohoo Whee, I can hear that train comin back again
I dreamed about you, woke up, too soon
You been long gone, youve been gone too long
Broken dream left me so excited, we need to be reunited
Youve been gone too long
Instrumental break (modulate up)
Ohoo Whee, where did she go? Whered my baby go?
Ohoo Whee, I can hear that train comin back again
Each time we part, you take a part of my heart
So dont you be too long
So dont you be too long
Cant help the way I feel about you, 
Every minutes like an hour gone, when youre gone too long 
Cant help the way I feel about you, 
You know Im lost without you, when youre gone too long
When youre gone too long
When youre gone too long
