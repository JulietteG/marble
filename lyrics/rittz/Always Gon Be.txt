(feat. Mike Posner)

[Verse 1:]
Cameras flashing
Spot lights getting high on me like
Turn this antenna rashes
And you cannot match it
I'm a blew up
And call it a competition never can to ashes
Let us trend the fashion new clothes a plus
Yelawolf changed my life so much it chokes me up
You talk about me when I was broke and
He gave me the hope I lost
And now I'm gone on the road so much
And now you only bluff
I just wish we could touch to the phone but just
Stay focused and note that I'm trying to make a living for the both of us
And when the chuckle up
I might close enough to finally buy us a car
With her own apartment he embark a dream,
On stage in saw to rin
A shy town thinking that you'll get drunk and screams
I'm a feel like a sailor of a sicker submarine
Tryin to keep where the raw hits above the water
I know you want kids but we live with your mom
How the fuck am I supposed to become a father
When I'm spending hundred dollars on studio time
But you ain't ever gave a fuck about bread
I'm a give you the life you deserve one day
While you crying all on our bed
I'm on the bus and the bunk
Having dreams barbeque and then it come for the darker one
Been gone so long it feels weird talking on the phone
I freaking knew it I be coming home
Fuck what you my back on
When I'm at home with you it's like I'm really in my comfort zone
If I was a miles away looking at the sky and pray
Until God you ain't all alone

[Hook:]
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be

[Verse 2:]
Fights on facebook
All you see these pics they took with me
You can't believe the hype
Every night we fight about girls you see
On the internet, thinking I'm cheating
And I gotta defend myself from bullshit you accused me
You play gotta do music though
Think I'm all late tripping getting groupie love
Crying to me is unnecessary
Losing you is the last thing I want
If only you could trust, then I'd miss you as much as you miss me
And I wish we could be on the house together
But we ain't got no cheddar
No kind of crib that history can we deserve better
Can't accept the mysery I know you had a hard life
And it's harder when I'm gone
And I promise one day shit will make sense
It will be alright
I send flappers to you chop today
I put earphones on and I played our song
No I mean the bicycles I just got done
Sorry that you made a window blonde
So many nights when we get up on each other
Really fighting 'cause I can't come home
Got a whole tear room just to face time with you tonight
Don't put make up on
Because your face just looks so beautiful
And I promise that I'm always gonna be true to you
So many people travelling in pursue of true love
But never get the feeling that I do from you
So many human beings tryin live their whole life with their soulmate
But I found mine
While you laid up in the house crying
We both been counting on time

[Hook:]
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be ---Lyrics submitted by SaraB.
