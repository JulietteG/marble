The footprints over the snow
The fabric of all the lonely
C-Covering Only
The fables and hands
The rest is out in the cold
Holding the last of the season
F-F-F freezing (yeah)

My my my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My love like a voice

We're walking to the fields
We're walking to the forest
The moon is before us
Up above
We're holding hands in the rain
S-Saying words like I love you
D-D-Do you love (yeah)

My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my love like a voice

Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
Although we didn't make a sound

There's nothing like finding gold
Within the rocks hard and cold
I'm so surprised to find more
Always surprised to find more

I won't look back anymore
I left the people that do
It's not the chase that I love
It's me following you---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
