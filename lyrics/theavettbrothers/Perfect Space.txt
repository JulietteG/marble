I wanna have friends
That I can trust
That love me for the man I've become
Not the man that I was

And I wanna have friends
That let me be
All alone when being alone is all that I need

I want to fit in
To the perfect space
Feel natural and safe in volatile place

I wanna grow old
Without all of the pain
Give my body back to the earth and not complain

When will you understand
When I am to old of a man
When will you forget
When we have paid for our debt
Who did we borrow from
Who did we borrow from

Ok part two now clear the house
The party's over take the shouting and the people
Get out
I have some business and a promise that I have to hold to
I do not care what you assume or what the people
Tell you

When will you understand
When I am to old of a man
When will you forget
When we have paid for our debt
Who did we borrow from
Who did we borrow from

I wann have pride
Like my mother has
And not like the kind in the bible that turns you bad

I wanna have friends
That I can trust
That love me for the man I've become
Not the man that I was---Lyrics submitted by Todd.
