Love writes a letter and sends it to Hate
My vacation's ending I'm coming home late
The weather was fine and the ocean was great
and I can't wait to see you again

Hate reads the letter and throws it away
No one here cares if you go or you stay
I barely even noticed that you were away
I'll see you or I won't ...whatever

Love sings a song as she sails through the sky
The water looks bluer through our pretty eyes
And everyone knows it whenever she flies 
and also when she comes down

Hate keeps his head up and walks through the street
Every stranger and drifter he greets
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
with a serious look on his face

Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow
Carrying with her the good things we know
A reason to live and a reason to grow
to trust...to hold....to care

Hate sits alone on the hood of his car
without much regard to the moon or the stars
Lazily killing the last of a jar of the strongest stuff you can drink

Love takes a taxi...a young man drives
as soon as he sees her hope fills his eyes
but tears follow after the end of the ride  
cause he might never see her again

Hate gets home lucky to still be alive
He screams o'er the sidewalk and into the drive
The clock in the kitchen says two fifty-five
and the clock in the kitchen is slow

Love has been waiting patient and kind
just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign
that the one that she cares for who's of his mind
will make it back safe to her arms

Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door
weary head hung down eyes to the floor
He says Love I'm sorry and she says what for
I'm your and that's it...whatever
I should not have been gone for so long
I'm yours and that's it forever
Your mine and that's it forever---Lyrics submitted by scott.
