If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revenging in my name
One person dead from such is plenty
No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms
The things I think of
No need to get over alarmed
I'm coming home

I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They seemed to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eye
I wondered what my dad would say
He said, "I love you and I'm proud of you both,
In so many different ways"

If I get murdered in the city
Go read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings
Pay attention to the list
Make sure my sister knows I love her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name ---Lyrics submitted by Sydney Dexter.
