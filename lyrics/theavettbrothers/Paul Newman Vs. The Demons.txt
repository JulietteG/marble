You may have to drag me away from my demons
Kicking and screaming
It's been so long now, I've been with them
Don't know where they stop and I begin

We draw a line in the sand
Will you cross it? Oh, will you die for this?
Got nothing to tell you that you don't
Through your sadness below, already know

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live through the past again
How many times must I live through the past again?
No more

Truth beyond truth and by our design
It is very fine like Newman's wine
Oh, to be like him and walk a path
To lend a hand, do something worth a damn

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live through the past again
How many times must I live through the past again?
No more, wait

You may have to drag me away from my demons
Kicking and screaming

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Live through the past again
How many times must I live through the past again?
No more, wait---Lyrics submitted by Josie.
