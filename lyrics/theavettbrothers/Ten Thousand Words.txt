Ten thousand words swarm around my head
Ten million more in books written beneath my bed
I wrote or read them all when searchin in the swarms
Still cant find out how to hold my hands

And I know you need me in the next room over
But I am stuck in here all paralyzed
For months I got myself in ruts
Too much time spent in mirrors framed in yellow walls

Aint it like most people? Im no different
We love to talk on things we dont know about
Aint it like most people? Im no different
We love to talk on things we dont know about

And everyone around me shakes their head in disbelief
And says Im too caught up
They say young is good and old is fine
And truth is cool but all that matters
Is that you have your good times
But their good times come with prices
And I cant believe it when I hear the jokes they make
At anyones expense except their own
Would they laugh if they knew who paid?

Aint it like most people? Im no different
We love to talk on things we dont know about
Aint it like most people? Im no different
We love to talk on things we dont know about

And after we are through ten years
of making it to be the most of glorious debuts
Ill come back home without my things
Cause the clothes I wore out there I will not wear round you
And theyll be quick to point out our shortcomings
And how the experts all have had their doubts

Aint it like most people? Im no different
We love to talk on things we dont know about---Lyrics submitted by Krista.
