I lost my fear in your arms
I lost my tears in your car
I lost my will in your candle lit eyes
And all my love in your yard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
Violent is the motion in my heart and in my body and mind.
And silent is the feeling that I lost but Im determined to find.
And love is but an ocean, unrealistic notion, but I cling to her devotion, and I let it pull me down to the floor.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
I found my will in your car
I caught my tears in your arms
I found myself on that poor county trap
And found my love in your guard
Oh, Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.---Lyrics submitted by grace.
