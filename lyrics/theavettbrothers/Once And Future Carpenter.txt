I ain't from Texas, but I made my way from Dallas 
And I know the lonesome sound is following 
I ain't a gambler, but I can recognize a hand 
And when to hold, when the queens are staring back at me 
Once I was a carpenter, man my hands were calloused 
I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight 
But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry 
And I left the timbers where they lay 

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me 
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky 
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground 
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember 
Well we're all in this together 
If I live the life I'm given, I wont be scared to die 

And I don't come from Detroit, but her diesel motors pull me 
And I followed till I finally lost my way 
And now I spend my days in search of a woman we called purpose 
And if I ever pass back through her town I'll stay 

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me 
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky 
And when the black dress drags upon the ground 
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember 
Well we're all in this together 
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die 

And my life is but a coin, pulled from an empty pocket 
Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind 
And hope and fear go with it, and moon and the sun go spinning 
Like the numbers and fruits before my eyes 
Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind 
Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind 

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me 
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky 
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground 
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember 
Well we're all in this together 
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die---
