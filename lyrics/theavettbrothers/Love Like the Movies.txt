So you want to be in love like the movies 
But in the movies they're not in love at all 
And with a twinkle in their eyes 
They're just saying their lines 
And so we can't be in love like the movies 

Now in the movies they make it look so perfect 
And in the background they're always playing the right song 
And in the ending there's always a resolution 
But real life is more than just two hours long 

So you want to be in love like the movies 
But in the movies they're not in love at all 
And with a twinkle in their eyes 
They're just saying their lines 
And so we can't be in love like the movies 

Well you can freeze frame any moment from a movie 
Or run the whole damn thing backwards from reel to reel 
But I don't see one single solitary light technician 
Or one single camera in this moonlit field 

I don't want to be in love like the movies 
Cause in the movies they're not in love at all 
With a twinkle in their eyes 
They're just saying their lines 
So we can't be in love like the movies. 

And with a twinkle in their eyes 
They're just saying their lines 
And so we can't be in love like the movies. 
Nooooooo 
We can't be in love like movies---Lyrics submitted by Michel Lathrop.
