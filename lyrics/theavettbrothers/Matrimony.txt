things didn't work out like they should
far from what i thought they would

do you still want my hand
do you think i'm still your man
i'll change everything i can
matrimony

holy plans and holy gifts
holy shit what did we get
said you got plans of your own
you go to work and i'll stay home

do you still want my hand
do you think i'm still your man
i'll change everything i can
matrimony

my dog's loud and my dog's wild
we're to young to have a child
can you keep the dog next week
i'll be gone the next three

do you still want my hand
do you think i'm still your man
i'll change everything i can
matrimony

i aint through i aint walkin out
leavin' aint what i'm about
you may scream and i may shout 
but baby i love you---Lyrics submitted by nikki.
