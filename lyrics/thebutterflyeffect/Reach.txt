Last night I dreamt I held you with me,
Close enough to feel you breathe,
When i awoke I lay here empty,
Cought between the want and need,

Now in the drakness i am only,
Thoughtful hopes and peices mind,
These dreams are all I've ever wanted,
Found behind the closing eyes,

How long we've been trying to reach you,
We all fall down like this sometimes,
Trying to reach you,
I'm trying,

Last night I dreamt I had you with me,
Closer still to see you leave,
When i awoke the fear of lonley,
Gripped my heart in conscious sleep,

Now in the darkness I lay empty,
Hollow beaten like a drum,
Sill water cages I am hoping,
In these dreams to me you'll come,

How long we've been trying to reach you,
We all fall down like this sometimes,
Trying to reach you,
I'm trying,

These fields alive with fire and ashes,
Inside these fields we'll find oceans of ashes,
When all your dreams have died,
I don't want to die,

Just keeping holding my hand,
Because i'm trying to reach you,
I'm never letting you go,
Because i'm dying to keep you,

I'm trying...

I'm walking through your fields,
Of broken flowers,
They fall upon my face like tears for hours,
If all we are we are,
If all we are we are,
To wake and call your name,
In the tine hours,
We all fall down...---Lyrics submitted by iain.
