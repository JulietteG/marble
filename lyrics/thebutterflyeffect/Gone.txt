I'm all alone, I'm alone,
This high water tide underneath the flood,
Deserts of dust, if I must I will stand.

These are my promises,

I hope you're winning the war,
To make everything like it was before,
All that we were, we can still be again,
I swear.

I'm afraid you're gone...

I don't want you,
I don't want you to go,
I've got the sun in my eyes,
I didn't see you were passing me by.
I just want you,
I just want you to know,
Inside of me forever you'll go.

Now I just want to go home,
Carried by all that was ever known,
Held in these hands, if I must I will stand.

Given these promises,

Now I've been running too long,
These feet are too tired to carry on,
Weighing us down, if you're gone I will drown.

I'm afraid you're gone...

I don't want you,
I don't want you to go,
I've got the sun in my eyes,
I didn't see you were passing me by.
I just want you,
I just want you to know,

If forever exists,
Inside me forever you'll go,
If forever exists...

I've got the sun in my eyes,
I didn't see you were passing me by.
Now I've been running too long, yeah,
To carry on.

I don't want you,
I don't want you to go,
I've got the sun in my eyes, yeah.

I'm afraid you're gone...

If forever exists,
Inside me is where you belong.
If forever exists...---Lyrics submitted by Thomas.
