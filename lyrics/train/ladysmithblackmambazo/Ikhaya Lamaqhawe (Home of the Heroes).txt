Theres a home for triumphant heroes
Only the sanctified live there
There is no sin, pain and suffering
Mourning and filth have been locked out
(repeat)

The King of kings will return
(Amen, amen, amen)
Jesus will return to earth
Where will those without him hide
(Amen, amen, amen, hallelujah)

We are calling on all people
Everyone should come to Jesus 
Because where will you hide
If you do not have Jesus

So says the Lord of lords
I love those who love me
So says the Lord of lords
Those who seek me shall find me
So says the Lord of lords
(Amen, amen, amen, hallelujah)
We are calling on all people
Everyone should come to Jesus 
Because where will you hide
If you do not have Jesus 

So says the Lord of lords
I love those who love me
Those who seek me shall find me
So says the Lord of lords---Lyrics submitted by Stefan van Rhyn.
