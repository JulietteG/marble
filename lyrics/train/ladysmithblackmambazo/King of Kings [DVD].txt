Hey baby
Hey beautiful girl
Hey baby hey
Sing hey baby hey
Hey baby hey hey
Hey beautiful girl

Come along come along
To kiss me before I'm going
Come along come along
To kiss me before I'm going

Don't you kiss me nice nice
Before I'm going
Don't you kiss me nice nice
Before I'm going
Come along come along
Come along you you you ---Lyrics submitted by Fokwah Nelson.
