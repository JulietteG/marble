Six short months we went together
decided it should be forever
two paychecks were better than one
A diamond ring and it was done
Bought her a house like I said I would 
in a subdivided neighborhood
The fuse got short and the nights got long
It was over long gone, before I knew, where I was headed to

I'm goin' through the big 'D', I don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us.
I got the jeep, she got the palace.
I'm goin' through the big 'D', and don't mean Dallas.

Things like this are never final
I'm still paying on the vinyl flooring in the laundry room
it's multi-colored, and water-proof
It's a little bit tough to face my friends
the ones that said I jumped in
the river of love, a little too soon
that was August, this is June, and it's a different tune

I'm goin' through the big 'D', and don't mean Dallas.
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the jeep, she got the palace 
I'm goin' through the big 'D', and don't mean Dallas 

I'm goin' through the big 'D', and don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the jeep, she got the two bedroom,
mortgages due, siding like new, palace
I'm goin' through the big 'D', and don't mean Dallas

I'm goin' through the big 'D', and don't mean Dallas.---Lyrics submitted by Morgan Dawson.
