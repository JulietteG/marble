I can't sleep at night
The noise, the noise.
My eyes they open wider
The noise, the noise.
I came to relate
The noise, the noise.
Help me compensate for
The noise, the noise.

But I wouldn't do anything.
The thundering that throws me away.
I wouldn't do anything.

I won't go to church
The noise, the noise.
The preacher wouldn't care for
The noise, the noise.
I don't know what's real from
The noise, the noise.
I can't hear a thing for
The noise, the noise.
The noise.
The noise.
The noise.

I wouldn't do anything.
The thunder that throws me away.
I wouldn't do anything.
There's something that keeps me away.
I wouldn't do anything.
Something that begs me to stay.
I wouldn't do anything.
Something that throws me away.---Lyrics submitted by me you.
