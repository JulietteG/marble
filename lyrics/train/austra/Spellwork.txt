Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones, or anything grown.
I command post, and nobody shows.
In mornings I rest here, in evenings I work here. 
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left.
All I adore..

You must be the call, the evil at night
Speaking words of grace while spellwork delights.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire. 
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

I work alone saving my soul.
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse.
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned,
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face.
My pores are wide open and bleed for your potion.
Spellwork and lies...

You must be the call, the evil at night
Speaking words of grace while spellwork delights.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

You must be the call, the evil at night
Speaking words of grace while spellwork delights.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.---Lyrics submitted by Sunny Akane.
