Before you say you love me Joe
How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waves
What am I supposed to say?

I see people on the floor
Aspiring to the sea
Cant stay here anymore
Were turning into thieves

If I stay here trouble will find me
If I stay here Ill never leave
If I stay here trouble will find me
I believe

Joe Ill always think of you
As a kinder child who knew
This was never gonna last
Oh Joe you fell so fast

Hey Joe sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue
Dont they?
Hey Joe sorry I hurt you but
They say love is virtue
Dont they?
Hey Joe sorry I hurt you but
They say love is virtue
Dont they?
Hey Joe sorry I hurt you but
They say love is virtue
Dont they?
Hey Joe sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue
Dont they?

I see people on the floor
Aspiring to the sea
Cant stay here anymore
Were turning into thieves

I see you rushing now
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing now
Whatd Harvard teach you?
Whatd Harvard teach you?
Whatd Harvard teach you?
Whatd Harvard teach you?
Whatd Harvard teach you?
Whatd Harvard teach you?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
