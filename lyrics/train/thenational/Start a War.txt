We expected something, something better than before. We expected something more
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting, lock it up and leave
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting, lock it up and leave
Walk away now and youre gonna start a war

Whatever went away Ill get it over again. Ill get money, Ill get funny again
Whatever went away Ill get it over again. Ill get money, Ill get funny again
Walk away now and youre gonna start a war

We expected something, something better than before. We expected something more
You were always waiting but I never had to hold you by the edges like I do now
You were always waiting but I never had to hold you by the edges like I do now
Walk away now and youre gonna start a war

Whatever went away Ill get it over again. Ill get money, Ill get funny again
Whatever went away Ill get it over again. Ill get money, Ill get funny again
Walk away now and youre gonna start a war
Walk away now and youre gonna start a war---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
