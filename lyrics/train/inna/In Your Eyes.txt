I want your body
Wont live without it
So turn up the party
Im feeling naughty
Stay close to me, Ill be all that you need
Dont deny what you want baby
I want your body
All I desire, you relight the fire
Just come with me, come with me

Just gonna let it go tonight,
All I want is you, thousand shades of blue
Dancing in your eyes
Im just gonna let it go tonight,
I just wanna be, hold you close to me
Dancing in your eyes
I want your body

Its getting hotter, the beat is louder
I know you want me, and I want your body
Stay close to me, Ill be all that you need
Dont deny what you want baby
I want your body
All I desire, you relight the fire
Just come with me, come with me

Just gonna let ig go tonight,
All I want is you, thousand shades of blue
Dancing in your eyes
Im just gonna let it go tonight,
I just wanna be, hold you close to me
Dancing in your eyes
I want your body ---
