(feat. Pitbull)

Mr. Worldwide and International Sensation, Inna
Let's have a good time

Knick knack, patty whack
Give your boy a bone
Mister 305 but I'm globally known
I'm in the zone, I ain't talking 23
But when it comes to women,
You may bring 2,3
Oui oui, si si
Who we? You me, me her
Sounds like a good time, for sure

Say ayo ayo ayo ayo
Come on everybody
Ayo ayo ayo ayo
Let's get it started
Ayo ayo ayo ayo
Come on everybody
Everybody everybody everybody everybody
If you're feeling like good time
Good time good time
Come on up everybody
Body, everybody
Let's all have the good time
Good time good time
Come on up everybody
Body, everybody

Stay up for days like we got no where to go,
Don't wanna sleep cause tonight
Time is all we know
And there's only one thing left for me
To say: ayo ayo ayo ayo
We're gonna have good time
We gotta stay a little longer
When it all goes down,
Put your hands on me baby
You know it feels right,
A little private party is what I want right now
Everybody scream & shout
We're gonna o all night

Say ayo ayo ayo ayo
Come on everybody
Ayo ayo ayo ayo
Let's get it started
Ayo ayo ayo ayo
Come on everybody
Everybody everybody everybody everybody
If you're feeling like good time
Good time good time
Come on up everybody
