No more rain in this cloud
No more rain in this cloud

My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud

There's no hiding place
When someone has hurt you
It's written on your face and it reads
"Broken spirit, lost and confused
Empty, scared, used and abused, a fool"
Oh, ain't it funny that the way you feel?
Shows on your face
And the smile you used to wear
Seems a little bit out of place
People, ohh ohh, hold on
In time it gets a little better, whao ohh

My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud

So you want to live and to you I shall give
All the space that you requested
Hope you don't live to regret it
So you say, "You're in your prime"
Baby, don't waste your time
Remember my love, it's only a thin line
It's never too late

My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud

(No more rain)
Spring has come and winter's gone, my love
Don't look around for me child, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, gone gone gone gone gone
Not afraid because the seasons have changed
I'm gonna count my blessing then just follow the sun
Because you seen

My sunshine has come
(Now, I wanna take a minute to kick it like this)
(Y'all wit' me?)
And I'm all cried out
(Y'all know what I'm talkin' about?)
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(You know what to do)
(There's no hiding place)
My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
(When you're hurting)
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(No, no, no)

Baby, don't want teardrops drying up on my pillow
Only room for raindrops, don't belong on my smile
Yeah yeah and there's no more rain in this cloud
Baby, don't want teardrops drying up on my pillow
Only room for raindrops, don't belong on my smile
And there's no rain more in this cloud

My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud---
