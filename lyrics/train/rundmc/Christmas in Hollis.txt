It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
When I seen a man chilling with his dog at the park
I approached them very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, a illin' reindeer

But then I was chillin' because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he must of dropped his wallet smack dab on the lawn

I picket the wallet up and then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said Santa Claus
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat, matching car with ease

But I'd never steal from Santa, 'cause that ain't right
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, 'cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough is for me

It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa puttin' gifts under Christmas trees

Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink egg nog
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols

Rhymes so loud and proud to hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out,
And that's what Christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

My name's DMC with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us a ear, we want to say
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!---
