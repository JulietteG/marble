And when the time is right
 It's gonna change the world
 And with the darken sky
 There is nothing thru
 And there is no more love
 Or f*!#@ gates of pearl

I see the seven stars
 I see the seven stands
 I hear the deathly voice
 I count the sense we have
 I am the living one
 I am the first and last

The crowds
 The noise
 The change in the guard
 It's such a strange celebration
 Kids, they laugh
 As fire it eats up the world
 It's such a strange celebration
 All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth
 It's such a strange celebration

And they know who we are
 The seven angels sing
 And several billion die
 With the Earth shaking
 Yeah they know who we are
 And they will set us free

The crowds
 The noise
 The change in the guard
 It's such a strange celebration
 Kids, they laugh
 This fire it eats up the world
 It's such a strange celebration
 All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth
 It's such a strange celebration

The crowds
 The noise
 The change in the guard
 It's such a strange celebration
 Kids, they laugh
 This fire it eats up the world
 It's such a strange celebration
 All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth
 It's such a strange celebration

The crowds
 The noise
 The change in the guard
 It's such a strange celebration
 Kids, they laugh
 As fire it eats up the world
 It's such a strange celebration
 All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth
 It's such a strange celebration---Lyrics submitted by Rocco.
