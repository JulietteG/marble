The ash set in and blew away (blew away).
It's getting lost into the sea (into the sea)
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had, to leave forever.
I left the chilling voice, the sceams and kids, and ran for shelter

You know I won't say sorry (sorry).
You know I won't say sorry (sorry).
The pain has a bad reaction, a blend of fear and passion.
You know what it's like to believe, it makes me wanna scream.

I see a glow from far away (far away).
A faint reflection on the sea (on the sea).
I left some words by, far from here to be a sure reminder.
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever.

You know I won't say sorry (sorry).
You know I won't say sorry (sorry).
The pain has a bad reaction, a blend of fear and passion.
You know what it's like to believe, it makes me wanna scream.

I see the stars, they're in your eyes.
A playful kiss, can you tell I'm excited?
A fast escape in the nick of time.
Have you lost your wish? Can I help you find it?
I'm on a knee, just one to start.
A frest new start, don't be undecided.
If love's a word that you say, then say it, I will listen.

If love's a word that you say, then say it, I will listen.---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
