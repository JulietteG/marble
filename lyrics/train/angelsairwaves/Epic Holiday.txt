And that by design
It is full of holes
And it's full of pain, lost, violent criminals
With a little fate
And the worst of lies
With a love so deep
It's war with endless fire inside
Go right back to her line

Every single day
Every nine to five
Everybody works so hard and then we finally die
And there's no remorse
Or the slightest sound
We're forever cool with the way it all breaks up and down

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right, nobody's wrong
Life's just a game, it's just one epic holiday
And whether all of this takes us so long
Take us away, it's just one epic holday

And the Sunday rain
Like a lonely ghost
And the furthest point from here is right outside the door
Open up your eyes
Take a breath of will
And the sun is still alive, even though it's hard to tell

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right, nobody's wrong
Life's just a game, it's just one epic holiday
And whether all of this takes us so long
Take us away, it's just one epic holiday---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
