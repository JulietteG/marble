Eighteen and a wicker basket
Red cape and a open casket
Tied up to a broken lever
If I move it hurts forever
I am not that host ...
But I want her

Wolf in a winter playground
White snow to let the red out
I hear that alarms are better
Than a warning like a feather
I don't like my tone
But I want her

So here I am
I'm falling to my knees
I'm digging out the shadows of a ghost
When you come around
So here I am
I'm waiting for the tease
I'm sleeping in the gallows[?] that I chose
When you come around

Why sleep I can't forget it
Moonrise I'm now committed
Your move cause I am tethered ...
Like a slave I don't know better
I listen for your words
Yeah I want her

Lost boys in a haunted forest
Bright things in the maze before us
My life has now been severed
I can't bare to remember who I was before
The day I met her---
