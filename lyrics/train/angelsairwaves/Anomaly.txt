And you, what's with those eyes, what you been thinking?
Hey girl, spread your wings, the world is awaiting to let you in
That smile, a mile away, those colors collide
Hey you, pick up the reigns and come through my window and don't be shy

I never wanted to say how much I liked you
I never wanted to be one of your sad discoveries
We'll see

Hey there, since you've been gone, I've written about you
These words, you know Hemingway, they don't have any value to any line
My girl, you're scared to go home to a view of the city
Hey you, I can never relax that is never an option if you're not mine

I never wanted to live my life without you
I never wanted to coast, always wanted to be an anomaly
I never wanted to say how much I loved you
I never wanted to be one of your sad discoveries

Tell me, tell me
Don't let me die, I sense this is my end
I won't let you leave here without these violins

One day I followed your eyes to the top of the mountain
My girl, I think I'm in love, it's the scariest place to be alive

I never wanted to live my life without you
I never wanted to coast, always wanted to be an anomaly
I never wanted to say how much I loved you
I never wanted to be one of your sad discoveries---
