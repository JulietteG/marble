Stack o' money in my left hand
Yes I've got a stack o' money in my right hand
Yes you know I got the money cos'
I played the right games
Gonna shoot up like a star
And set the whole world in flames (oh yes!)

Little honey on my left hand
Yes I've got a little honey in my right hand
Then I see a real heart stopper
Wearin' instep shoes
She's got the fire in her black eyes
And a boyfriend too (oh no!)

Got no money in my left hand
No I don't I've got no money in my right hand
Sugar cos' I went on the corner
Where I met the wrong man
I gave him all my money for the magic in his hands (yes!)---
