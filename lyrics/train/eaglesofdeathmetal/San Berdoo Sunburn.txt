Tapping time with one good finger
I got this girlfriend and she's a swinger
We make plans and then we head out to
San Bernardino
We get gas at the local P & M
Buy a coke in a can made of tin
We drink fast because
We're headed out west to San Bernardino
And we shall miss Carolina
And the east coast as opposed to the west
We won't shed any tears though
Nor even be sad because we know
The western desert is the best!
I filled a bag with cigarettes and apple wine
We'll hit the road again at 10 mintues to 9
Me and this girl I think she's pregnant
And we're headed to San Bernardino
And then when we hit Texas
We'll stop in Amarillo for a bite to eat
We'll stop on over in Dallas
And visit my friend but we can't stay
For more than a week
I've got the south in my veins
But California in my mouth
And that's the simple reason
Why I'm leaving the south
Me and this girl and she's so foxy
And we're heading to San Bernardino
Whoo
That was close we crossed the Tennesse state border
They would've locked us up by the sheriffs order
Yes we're freaks
But they can't touch us out west
In San Bernardino---
