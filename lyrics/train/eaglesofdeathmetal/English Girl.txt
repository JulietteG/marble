My face is stuck in a Cheshire grin 
I met an English girl 
She's like the toast of my whole world 
We hit the gas just in order to get away 

Ooh ooh ooh 
And then we dance all through the whole night 

We'll storm the beaches 
Head to Mexico 
We'll cruise the streets all night 
And catch a rock and roll show 
We have to do this just in order to get away 

Let's keep dancing---
