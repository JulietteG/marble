Now don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's just a bad dream mama
So let's get ourselves together and roll
I'm just a mean machine so tight and skinny
And my hands are clean
If you want to come then you can spend my money
I've got a sixth sense you're a man-eating woman
So sophisticated
So LA
Don't try to be too smart
You might just find you'll miss the best part
I'm here right now
I want to be your monkey!---
