Tonight I'm without you
(tonight I'm without you)
The rain drops are falling
(the rain drops are falling)
With candlelight burning
(with candlelight burning)
For you I'll be waiting
(for you I'll be waiting)
Here.

Chorus:
If all of our days have no more light
And all of our dreams are lost tonight
The stars can all fall
And everything turn to gray
I will stay.

Graceful and loving
(graceful and loving)
And tearful and soothing
(and tearful and soothing)
Can't breathe without you
(can't breathe without you)
There's no life without you
(there's no life without you)
Here.

Chorus:
 If all of our days have no more light
And all of our dreams are lost tonight
The stars can all fall
And everything turn to gray
I will stay.

Repeat Chorus:
If all of our days have no more light
And all of our dreams are lost tonight 
The stars can all fall
And everything turn to gray

If all of our days have no more light 
And all of our dreams are lost tonight 
The stars can all fall
And everything turn to gray
I will stay.---Lyrics submitted by rachael.
