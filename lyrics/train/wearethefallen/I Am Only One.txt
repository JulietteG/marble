Memories fade into the silence,
Haunting me tonight,
With hopes and last breath, I take this moment in,
It will be the last,
The morning breaks, and sunlight takes
The pain away.

Ever after never came,
And I'm still waiting for a life that never was,
And all the dreams I lay to rest,
Are ghost that keep me, after all that I've become,
I am only one.
I am only one.

I close my eyes and plead this empty heart
Of all that longs to die,
When faces lie and love will falter,
I'm left with only time,
And time will break the dreams that take,
The pain away.

Ever after came,
And I'm still waiting for a love I'll never have,
And all the dreams I lay to rest,
Are ghosts that keep, after all that I've become,
I am only one.
I am only one.

I'm on my own here, and 
No-one's left to be the hero.
This fairy tale's gone wrong as
Night will fall, my heart will die alone.

Ever after never came,
And I'm still waiting for my heart to beat again.
And all the dreams I lay to rest,
Are ghosts that keep me, after all that I've become,
I am only one.
I am only one.

I am only one.---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
