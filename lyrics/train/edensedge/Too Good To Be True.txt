You walked in shining brighter than a headlight
Turning every head like a diamond in a coal mine
Packing more punch than a Mississippi fist fight
Oh oh my my

Walked my way, took my hand, said "Let's go"
Had more game than the Mandalay Casino
Thought I hit the jackpot, I was on a good roll
Shows you what I know

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling outta the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me 'bout boys like you
Too good to be true

Before I knew it my heartstrings unwound
I fell faster than a cannonball straight down
Everybody talking all over this town
"Look there he goes again"

Lie lie lied like a politician
Shoulda read the headlines, paid more attention
To my suspicions, my intuition
I shoulda listened

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling outta the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me 'bout boys like you
Too good to be true

I shoulda seen it from a mile away
I should have called a spade a spade
I shoulda known that you're...

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling outta the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me 'bout boys like you
Too good to be true
Too good to be true

You're just too good to be
You're just too good to be true
You're just too good to be true
Too good to be true ---
