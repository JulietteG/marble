[Intro:]
Whoa oh oh
Ooh hoo ooh
No No No

Whoa oh oh
Ooh hoo ooh
No No No

[Verse 1:]
See I don't, know why, I liked you so much
I gave you all, of my trust
I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain
You put me through pain, I wanna let you know how I feel

[Chorus:]
Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

[[Verse 2:]
You thought, you could
Keep this shit from me, yeah
You burnt bitch, I heard the story
You played me, you even gave him head
Now you asking for me back
You just another hag, look elsewhere
Cause you're done with me

[Chorus:]
Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw ''em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah

[Bridge:]
You questioned, did I care
You could ask anyone, I even said
You were my great one
Now its, over, but I do admit I'm sad
It hurts real bad, I cant sweat that, cause I loved a hoe

[Chorus:]
Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents might as well throw 'em out
Fuck all those kisses it didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back

[Outro:]
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
