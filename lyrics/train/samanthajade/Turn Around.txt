Is it me or did we agree to love?
Tell me why I don't feel we got enough
It's you but what about me?
It seems like you live a life without me

Everything seems to have your time but us
My space in your heart is closing up
And the place where your picture's hanging
Is the only time you're with me

Don't leave me out here all alone, oh no
I'm still right here, where'd you go?

Look around, don't you feel something missing?
I'm the one you promised you would love
But you got ahead so far away
While I'm holding on, please turn around

I see you but I don't feel you
Can't get your attention to save my love
Look back and see me now
Don't let me down, please turn around

I think I musta gave too much
'Cause I felt that the road was getting rough
Suddenly I felt lonely out here
I look beside me to find you're not there

Said you would love and protect me
All I have are the words you left me
Here I stand with the plans in my head

This can't be the kinda love that you said
Don't leave me out here all alone
I'm still right here, where'd you go?

Look around, don't you feel something missing?
I'm the one you promised you would love
But you got ahead so far away
While I'm holding on, please turn around

I see you but I don't feel you
Can't get your attention to save my love
Look back and see me now
Don't let me down, please turn around

If you only see the tears I'm crying on my pillow
That doesn't compare to what you're doing to my soul
Don't you even know that I'm in need of love
I'm calling you but you don't seem to hear a thing
I'm losing you now

Please just look around
Don't you feel something missing?
I'm the one you promised you would love
But you got ahead so far away
While I'm holding on, please turn around

I see you but I don't feel you
Can't get your attention to save my love
Look back and see me now
Don't let me down, please turn around

Don't you feel something missing?
I'm the one you promised you would love
But you got ahead so far away
While I'm holding on, please turn around

I see you but I don't feel you
Can't get your attention to save my love
Look back and see me now
Don't let me down, please turn around

Turn around, just turn around
Turn around, look around, baby
Look around, baby, look around, baby---
