There's a rebellion on ice and you'll pay the price
As your freedom fades away.
Dishonesty is high, so won't you even try
To stand up for your rights and say.

We don't want your laws. So take 'em back right now.
They're bullshit anyhow.
It's time we had our say. The injustice cannot stay.
They stabbed us in the back.
And you can feel it bleeding if your heart's beating now.

So let us hear your voice. They said we have a choice.
But I don't believe they really meant it so.
We're gonna call their bluff 'cause we have had enough.
Take the power back. The foundation's gonna crack.

I see the freedom at the end of the road.
I've heard so many lies and I've taken the blows.
Give it to me. Take it from me. Nobody knows.
Sick of being used and I'm gonna explode.
Total destruction all over the place.
There is so much hate it's a fuckin' disgrace.
Everyone is blind; can't see through the lies.
But they aren't even looking at the wolves in disguise.

So will you hear the call or let the judgements fall.
This is it so wake up let's go
And track the liars down and then remove their crowns
And lash 'em with the binds they hold.

We don't want your laws. So take 'em back right now.
They're bullshit anyhow.
It's time we had our say. The injustice cannot stay.
They stabbed us in the back.
And you can feel it bleeding if your heart's beating now.

So let us hear your voice. They said we have a choice.
But I don't believe they really meant it so.
We're gonna call their bluff 'cause we have had enough.
Take the power back. The foundation's gonna crack.

I see the freedom at the end of the road.
I've heard so many lies and I've taken the blows.
Give it to me. Take it from me. Nobody knows.
Sick of being used and I'm gonna explode.
Total destruction all over the place.
There is so much hate it's a fuckin' disgrace.
Everyone is blind; can't see through the lies.
But they aren't even looking at the wolves in disguise.

So let's hear your voice or we wont have a choice.
Haven't we had enough today?
Rebellion's on ice but we'll pay the price.
Don't let our freedoms fade away.---Lyrics submitted by Azra RoseMarie Heartin.
