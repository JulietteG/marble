A thousand times a day
i tell you i love the way you sing 
even though it makes cry 
its my favorite time to be alive
and all i know is i feel lost without you...
i miss you is not enough 

i know the storys old 
its been told a million times before
but to tell it feels so good
it reminds me that not all i do is write
and all i know is i feel so lost without you...

now i remember the day i was a kid in 8th grade
your friend tapped me on the shoulder and asked if i would be your boyfriend
oh yeah we were intense then
we would walk and hold hands you were taller than me
then i got a friend to tell you that i didnt want to be anymore
oh no not anymore

so then for 3 more years we would never talk 
and im not gonna lie though i couldnt stop thinking about you

then your bestfriends came over and i got them to call you to see if you wanted to watch the band play dude ranch
i knew that that would impress you
so we got to talkin and before we knew it we were always on the phone takin until 4 in the morning 
yeah there was only one problem
now i never knew your man never talked to him
and still until this day i feel bad for it
but i knew that i loved you and i knew that i had to do something

so i waited `till the day you broke up with him
we had a barbque at our friend jims
then we strolled to the backyard and thats where we shared our first kiss

then you watched the band play with all your friends and we played our set of melon colin and choking victum  
i guess that didnt impress you

then an hour later between you and your friends 
you told me that you didnt want to be anymore
oh no not anymore

but then a while later we got back together and we told eachother we would be forever
and since that day we had our share of problems and now we know that
its hard but better together
oh yeah its better together

so now we have a house and a couple pets 
were even gettin married 9 years after it
and everytime i see you 
i still hear trumpts---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
