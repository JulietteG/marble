Crawling through the basement
Seeing in the past all the life we erased in bins
Color coded for placement
Could be trash at what times replaced with
I know in time we all walk
Sifting through your clothes painting hung on the wall
Take me back to the places
Where time doesnt exist to break us
It breaks us down

With the forgotten smiles
The obnoxious laughs
The broken hearts
Down frame with my first kiss
The sweater I was wearing while laying down
Holding you for the first time, reminds me of the smell of your gorgeous hair
Every note that we wrote in a box with every ticket from every movie that I ever saw
Every picture I come across Im amazed with
Every moment I live, a moment replaces another one

unpacking boxes like Christmas
Obsessed on finding out who I really was
Turning all of the joists timelines
Reliving every second of my life
I know its hard to hold on
All my thoughts are really sad, how I wish we would just stay young
I guess thats why we let go
But Im not ready to let go

With the forgotten smiles
The obnoxious laughs
The broken hearts
Down frame with my first kiss
The sweater I was wearing while laying down
Holding you for the first time, reminds me of the smell of your gorgeous hair
Every note that we wrote in a box with every ticket from every movie that I ever saw
Every picture I come across Im amazed with
Every moment I live, a moment replaces another one

I wont be ready to let go
But how do you hold on?
I wont be ready to let go
So how do you hold on?

Crawling through the basement
Seeing in the past all the life we erased in bins
Color coded for placement
Could be trash at what times replaced with
I know in time we all walk
Sifting through your clothes painting hung on the wall
Take me back to the places
Where time doesnt exist to break us---
