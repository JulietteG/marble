 With every word of my perpetual definition
Im starting to think with enough time I just might get it
Been through the tolls, got my change and looked back
Swingin, were all negative souls
In every step of my combative emotion
the fight of my brain and my gut have been a nuisance
Ive given myself enough slack to be secluded
Were all negative souls
Practice what you know is wrong
Admit its hard to grow, when youre so small

Cause youre addicted to feeling sorry for yourself
A needle wove a thread between your body and guilt
You made a blanket of your scars
And you just wanna feel warm
So just admit that youre addicted
Its a reason for fall
because You want to be the one that everybody loves
You feel so sorry for yourself
And all you really want is guilt

Every day you wake up, and feel defeated
Listing your flaws is the church that you believe in
Just give it a break cause theres people who are not eating
Were all negative souls
Im done with the past
Being brakes to my achievements
Cutting the lines so the fluid runs out of me and,
Teaching my body that the negatives can be beaten
Practice what you know you want
Admit its hard to grow, when youre so small

Cause youre addicted to feeling sorry for yourself
A needle wove a thread between your body and guilt
You made a blanket of your scars
And you just wanna feel warm
So just admit that youre addicted
Its a reason for fall
because You want to be the one that everybody loves
You feel so sorry for yourself
And all you really want is guilt

Its like quicksand taking you home
What a rush I felt to be warm---
