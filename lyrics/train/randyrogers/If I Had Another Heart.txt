If I had another heart Id be just fine and then some.
Id break the glass in case of an emergency and just use that one
Take all that extra love I know just what Id do
Cuz if I had another heart Id let you break that one too.

Cuz the one I gots tore up
Its twisted inside out
It wants me to dial your number when Im 2 whiskeys down
With a little extra help I think I could start clean
And I just might get over you getting over me
But the truth is Id fall right back in love with you
Cuz if I had another heart Id let you break that one too.

Wish I knew a place or a way to escape your memory
Lay it down and forget all about it like some hotel key
If I had another heart I know better to let you in
Cuz knowing me Id fall for you all over again

Cuz the one Ive gots tore up
Its twisted inside out
It wants me to dial your number when Im 2 whiskeys down
With a little extra help I think I could start clean
I just might get over you getting over me

Cuz the one Ive gots tore up
Its twisted inside out
It wants me to dial your number when Im 2 whiskeys down
With a little extra help I think I could start clean
I just might get over you getting over me

But God dont give you a spare one to see you through
Even if he did Id give it away to you
Cuz if I had another heart Id let you break that one too.
Cuz if I had another heart Id let you break that one too.---Lyrics submitted by Shelly A.
