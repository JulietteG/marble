(feat. Willie Nelson)

One night in Kansas City after we had played the show
Shots rang out as I stumbled home
So I hid behind a dumpster in an alley down the street
I didn't want to know if they were shooting at me
Next morning in the paper read a man had lost his life
Twenty feet away from me but I got out alive

I learned more from these cities than I ever did in class
And I stand accused of living way to fast
Out here on this highway one thing stays the same
It's gonna find me trouble knows my name

At four in the morning in the city of New Orleans
The tables got my money even though my friends had warned me
So I hopped in the taxi, we headed down Canal
By the time we got back to the bus it had already gone down
It was a bucket full of concrete through our window
We were getting robbed but the cops they never showed

I learned more from these cities than I ever did in class
And I stand accused of living way to fast
Out here on this highway one thing stays the same
It's gonna find me trouble knows my name

No I wouldn't want it any other way
Not knowing what might happen today, ain't that a shame

In Missoula Montana we were out on tour
With country music's brightest star that we knew for sure
And I won't say what we did but one of us went too far
Got picked up by the police after we all left the bar
That next morning we looked everywhere
Bout the time we hit the stage he'd barely posted bail

I learned more from these cities than I ever did in class
And I've seen the world through the bottom of the glass
Out here on this highway one thing stays the same
It's gonna find me trouble knows my name
Yeah It's gonna find me trouble knows my name ---
