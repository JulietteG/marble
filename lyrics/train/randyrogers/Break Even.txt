this is pretty low, but it aint' the bottom
still long way to go, could I get you to follow
it all comes down to this, give me a reason
I know I'll never win, we could break even 

chorus
Cause I really dont' care, really don't care who's side I'm on
cause there's always room at the bottom, once the line's been drawn
I know I'll never win, just let me go on believin 
there's still a chance that we could break even

this is gonna hurt
I could ease your pain
cause once you felt the fire
don't mind the rain
if you go down, down, down 
out in the deep end
could you pull me up just enough
to break even

chorus

there's stil a chance, still a chance you could save me 
there's still a chance I'll just bring you down

chorus

I just wanna break even---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
