There comes a time eventually
When the cold black water goes under the bridge
So I say yes we can meet up
It's been too long and life goes on and I can do this

You wanna thank me for everything you've learned
For what went wrong and how I've paved the path
For the corner than you turned
And this is what you've learned

What you you lack from love is not a lack in someone else
And everyone has baggage to be carried
You learn that one plus one is one plus one is never more or less
And once you finally got it you got married

I guess I should be happy I'm the course that set you free
I just wish you hadn't learned it on me

I'm better now though you almost broke me
And at the time i couldn't see past my confusion
When I believed that love was real and not a bag of tricks
And you were always just more gifted at illusion (you wanna thank me for everything you've learned)

And you wanna thank me for everything I've learned
From the hard-knocks and the troubles
And the point of no return
All the bridges that you burn

What you you lack in love is not a lack in someone else
And everyone has baggage to be carried
You learn that one plus one is one plus one is never more or less
And once you finally got it you got married

I'm glad your education made you happy by degree
I just wish you hadn't learned it on me

I guess I'm glad that I've seen you face to face
It's just slightly more cathartic than a letter
But the line is pretty fine in fact it's pretty much erased
Between humility and making you feel better

And some is false and some is true and now i know
It's just me and it's just you
And it's just the way it goes
And now that book is closed

What you you lack in love is not a lack in someone else (what you lack in love)
And everyone has baggage to be carried
You learn that one plus one is one plus one is never more or less (one plus one is one plus one)
Best of luck to that girl you married

Smiling on her little learning tree
I wish you hadn't learned it on me---
