Transformation Bass

To all of you Bass defenders out there
Hear me
Feel me
And I will give you the bass

The Bass
That Leads
The Melody

The Bass that leads the melody

Th-th-th-the-the Bass
Th-the-that Leads
Th-th-th-the-the Melody

And finally I give you
The Beat

And Now
The Bassline---Lyrics submitted by Brian Hicks.
