There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful

Every morning she makes me
A cup of coffee with a smile on her face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful

Every morning I wake up
And I think of you with a smile on my face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

Oh baby, I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye, even if you cry
I'm still by your side

Oh baby, I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye, even if you cry
I'm still by your side

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful

Every morning I wake up
And I think of you with a smile on my face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful

Every morning I wake up
And I think of you with a smile on my face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

Oh baby, I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye even if you cry
I'm still by your side

Every morning---Lyrics submitted by aero.
