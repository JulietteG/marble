Mellan oss tv
Between the two of us=Between us

Det r oklart ute nu
It's gloomy outside now (misty, sad)
r det s svrt att frst
It's so hard to understand
Vad var det som gick s fel
What it was what has gone so bad
Mellan oss tv
Between us

Jag e s frusen nu
I'm so frosen now
Jag kan inte knna min sjl
I can't feel my soul
Mitt hjrta har blivit till is
My heart has became an ice
O nd s r det varmt
Oh, ( but) still it's so warm
Mellan oss tv
Between us

Mina krafter har tagit slut
My strength ( power) has reached the end
Fr jag lever i en vrld svart o vitt
Because I live in the 'black and white' world
Men att f ligga i din famn
But lying in your arms
r som solljus i tusen r
Is like sunlight within thousand years

Mina gon r stngda nu
My eyes are closed now

Jag kan inte ppna dom igen
I can't open them again
Jag vill sga hur det 
I want to say how it is
Men jag har ingen rst
But I found no voice
Mellan oss tv
Between us

Varfr lt vi detta g s lngt
Why did we let this last so long
Var det fr att visa att vi kan
Was it as wise as we could
Eller va de byggt p hat och sorg
Or what they (others) built on hate and sorrow
Som vi inte klarat av
We didn't take care of

Ditt hjrta vill jag ha
Your heart I want to have
kvar i vra liv
It ( is all what is) left in our lives
Som vi delade nr himmelen va bl
As we broke off when the sky was blue
Men vi leder inte lngre ngon vart
And we lead no further way
Nu r det slut mellan oss tv
Now when it's over between us
Mellan oss tv
Between us---Lyrics submitted by Felicia.
