I remember the days, you are my life
I remember the days, I'm sorry for everything

I remember the days when I had no hope
I remember the mornings when I didn't get up
There are so many things that I'd like to do
You are my life, it should have been you

I'm trying to do what I've been told
But I think too much of what I can hold
Baby, let me explain, I want you to stay
I'm sorry for everything, please don't walk away

Pump up the volume

I want to hold you, I want to touch your skin
Hearing you breathe
Those simple things are carrying me on

And now I know why you're leaving
Open my door tonight
Give me some time to set things right
Don't leave me tonight

I remember the days when I had no hope
I remember the mornings when I didn't get up
There are so many things that I'd like to do
You are my life, it should have been you

I'm trying to do what I've been told
But I think too much of what I can hold
Baby, let me explain, I want you to stay
I'm sorry for everything, please don't walk away

Pump up the volume

Don't walk away
Don't walk away---Lyrics submitted by Katrina.
