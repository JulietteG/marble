I Think Its Time That You Let Go
At The End Of The Day I Know You Know

[Were Is My DJ?]

I Know You Know 
Our Love Faded A Long Time Ago
Now Its Time TO Move On

[Now Go Insane]

I Know You Know 
The Time We Had
Felt Like Sunshine In Our Eyes
But Now Its Time For Me To Go 

[Like This.. Hit It]

[Are You Ready For This?]

[Were Is My DJ?]

I Think Its Time That You Let Go
At The End Of The Day I Know You Know
I Know You Know 
Our Love Faded A Long Time Ago
Now Its Time TO Move On

I Know You Know 
The Time We Had
Felt Like Sunshine In Our Eyes
But Now Its Time For Me To Go 

[Hit It]---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
