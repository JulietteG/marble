Now you're gone
I realize that my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone, with your pictures hanging on the wall
Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone, with your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone
There's an empty place in my heart
Without a warning it could break it apart
It won't heal and everything someday
I will think about you everyday

-Ready for take off

-Are you ready

Now you're gone.
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone, with your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone, with your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone
There's an empty place in my heart
Without a warning, could break apart
It won't heal and everything someday
I will think about you everyday---Lyrics submitted by Trichiesa.
