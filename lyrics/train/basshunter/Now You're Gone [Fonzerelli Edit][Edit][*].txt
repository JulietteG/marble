Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I've keep waiting here by the phone with your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I've keep waiting here by the phone with your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll be thinkin' 'bout you everyday

Ready for take-off! 

Are you Ready?

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I've keep waiting here by the phone with your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I've keep waiting here by the phone with your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone

There's an empty place in my heart
It won't alarm me it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll be thinkin' 'bout you everyday---Lyrics submitted by KYRATSO.
