All I ever wanted 
Was to see you smiling 
I know that I love you 
Oh baby, why don't you see ? 

All I ever wanted 
Was to see you smiling 
All I ever wanted 
Was to make you mine 
I know that I love you 
Oh baby, why don't you see ? 
That all I ever wanted 
Was you and me ... 

All I ever wanted 
Was to see you smiling 
All I ever wanted 
Was to make you mine 
I know that I love you 
Oh baby why don't you see 
That all I ever wanted 
Was you and me ... 

{Instrumental} 


I'm so alone 
Here on my own 
And I'm waiting for you to come 
I want to be 
A part of you 
Think of all the things we could do 

And everyday 
You're in my head 
I want to have you in my bed 
You are the one 
You're in my eyes 
All I ever wanted in my life 

All I ever wanted 
Was to see you smiling 
All I ever wanted 
Was to make you mine 
I know that I love you 
Oh baby, why don't you see ? 
That all I ever wanted 
Was you and me 

All I ever wanted 
Was to see you smiling 
All I ever wanted 
Was to make you mine 
I know that I love you 
Oh baby, why don't you see ? 
That all I ever wanted 
Was you and me ... 

{Instrumental} 

All I ever wanted 
Was to see you smiling 
All I ever wanted 
Was to make you mine 
I know that I love you 
Oh baby, why don't you see ? 
That all I ever wanted 
Was you and me ...
