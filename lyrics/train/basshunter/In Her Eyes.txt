Its a saturday night
nothing will go wrong
but if it does do i care
i just don't know how to run
Its a saturday  night
and i hope you believe 
my heart is calling your name
so hear me out when i say

I can feel it in her eyes
when she turns to me and smiles
everything feels so wright 
until the morning light
I can feel it in her eyes
when she turns to me and smiles
everything feels so right 
until the morning light

ARE YOU READY TO PARTY ?

Its a saturday night
nothing will go wrong
but if it does do i care
i just don't know how to run
Its a saturday  night
and i hope you believe 
my heart is calling your name
so hear me out when i say

I can feel it in her eyes
when she turns to me and smiles
everything feels so wright 
until the morning light
I can feel it in her eyes
when she turns to me and smiles
everything feels so right 
until the morning light

ARE YOU READY ?

I can feel it in her eyes---Lyrics submitted by jonathan.
