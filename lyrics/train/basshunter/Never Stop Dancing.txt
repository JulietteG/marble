There is some rhythm
On the dancefloor
I got to take the chance
But if I move my body
I cannot stop the dance
So I lay my trust in the DJ
That he will kick it up
I feel the rhythm in my body
I never wanna stop

There is some rhythm
On the dancefloor
I got to take the chance
But if I move my body
I cannot stop the dance
So I lay my trust in the DJ
That he will kick it up
I feel the rhythm in my body
I never wanna stop d-d-d-dancin'

Don't ever wanna stop dancin'
D-d-d-d-dancin'

Don't ever wanna stop dancin'

Don't ever wanna stop dancin'---Lyrics submitted by Brian Hicks.
