I still love when iam caught in every beat of your heart
i still love when its dark and you are not alone
i still want you i'll hold you every step of the way
iam still your til the end,i still love,i still love,i still love,i still love.

I still love when iam caught in every beat of your heart
i still love when its dark and you are not alone
i still want you i'll hold you every step of the way
iam still yours til the end.

 i still love when iam caught in every beat of your heart
i still love when its dark and you are not alone
i still want you i'll hold in every tear that i cry
iam still yours til the end.

my life is a mystery but i cannot run from my destiny
oh babe i just wanna let you you know.

I still love when iam caught in every beat of your heart
i still love when its dark and you are not alone
i still want you i'll hold you every step of the way
iam still yours til the end.

I still love when iam caught in every beat of your heart
i still love when its dark and you are not alone
i still want you i'll hold you every step of the way
iam still yours til the end.

i still love when iam caught in every beat of your heart
i still love when its dark and you are not alone
i still want you i'll hold in every tear that i cry
iam still yours til the end.
                I still love.---Lyrics submitted by saeed.
