It's not like I'm invisible, you still wear me under your skin
When we talk, we don't talk at all
Too weak to leave, too stubborn to give in
Who is gonna be the first to say a truce
It's not enough that we should part can't stop fighting too

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you, when you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery, free
Well oh can't you see, I wanna be, I want you to be, free

It's not like she isn't loving you
It's just that you can't be alone for too long
I'd like to wish you all the happiness
Maybe the truth is, it'll kill me if you move on
Who is gonna be the first to say enough
Who is gonna be the first one to find true love

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you, when you still need me
This tug of war can't go one anymore
Nobody wins from this misery, free
Well oh can't you see, I wanna be, I want you to be, free

Let it be, let it be just a beautiful memory
Anything that starts will have an ending
Let it go, let it go, yeah cause we both know this will only be over when we're free
Yeah, oh, when we're free
Oh, oh I know, oh

We don't let go, we can't get close
I still need you, when you still need me
This tug of war can't go on anymore
Nobody wins from this misery, free
Well oh can't you see, I wanna be, I want you to be, whoa, free
I wanna be, I want you to be, oh can we be, free
Oh I wanna be free---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
