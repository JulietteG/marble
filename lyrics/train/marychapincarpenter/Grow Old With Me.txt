Grow old a long with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God Bless our Love
God Bless our Love

Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
When the day is done
Face the setting sun
God Bless our Love
God Bless our Love

Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end
World without end

Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God Bless our Love 
God Bless our Love---Lyrics submitted by Tricia.
