[Verse 1]
I say you look good then you kiss your teeth,
You look me up and down as you flick your weave,
Rude girl body like the magazines,
Bum looking ripe like it dropped from an apple tree,
I was told i should never f*** a lady,
But ive never been a doormat thats the way mum raised me,
Katie, tracy they knew they couldnt keep me so they tried to keep my baby
aahh see them two were crazy, alee she was fiesty,
so i found me the best of both worlds thats aliegh,
Smada she excites me, the b**** turns jet lee when she fights me, 
my yin and yang wifey, my certified rider,
Thats what i provide her, she says i only love her properly when im aside her,
Damn right im a king when my sex is on fire,
So hush baby girl be quiet, you cool

[Hook]
Your nice, your nice livin in the fantasy life kaching,
Swipe, ask her who's shoes would you prefer,
Oh boy real life, its real talk,
Calm down i can hear them jimmy choos when you walk,
Your black, your white, best of both types my yin and yang wife,
Im lookin for for miss ride or die,
Another billion of them, i need one by my side,
Some one who's loving me for life,
I need an attitude girl that can handle my thing right,

[Verse 2]
Ooo oh oh oh oh oh, ooo oh oh oh oh so you say
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh, ooo oh oh oh oh so you say,
So you say, you da one, you da one, you da one,
But if my life was in danger, would stay or would you run,
Are you down if you are we can ride with the avalanche,
She blew my mind out this world like an avatar,
Look i got got an ego way bigger than your average man,
Why should i make the effort, if she don't understand,
Yeah i make the cheddar but she wants parmesan,
Talk trash, cut the crap i ain't a garbage man,
Cause anything i say you find a way to turn the table,
I ain't saying im a  sinner or any type of angel,
Im just saying you'll regret it, if your ever unfaithful,
Its just you and me G so i beg you just be grateful,
Cause anywhere i go, you know you got an invitation,
I wanna see you there at my final destination,
And you dont need a job cause i could be be your occupation,
But your f***ing round ill sack your ass without a resignation

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How do i slow it down, when im already in so deep,
And the position that your in's just right
Oo oh oh oh oh oh, look show me you can practice what you preach,
Hurry up, back it up, back it up and you'll be gone

[Hook]
