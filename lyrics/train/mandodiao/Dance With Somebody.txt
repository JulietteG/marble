Break your happy home
Learn to sing along
To the music, to the music
Clap your hands and shake
On a summer's day
To the music, to the music

[Chorus 2x]
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

I'm gonna dance with somebody
When you're all alone
We become your home
We're the music, we're the music
When your love's away
And you feel betrayed
We're the music, sweet music

[Chorus 2x]
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

[30x]
Dance... 

[Instrumental & Humming Part]

[Chorus 4x]
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
