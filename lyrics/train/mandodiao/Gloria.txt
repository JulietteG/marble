Well now
She don't need to see the sun ahead
Don't need that help from God above
If you're losing her don't be sad
Cause she will offer you heart attacks

She's tired of problems that you caused her mind
Tired of all those lies in your freak show
Tired of being alone at night
Being the lowest cat on earth

So Gloria steps out of the prison
Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl 
you've been dreaming about

Gloria alone now forever
Gloria away in the air now
Gloria she's no longer your slave, noo

Ooh ooh ooh

It's time for you to see yourself
All the misery you brought up
Gloria's one day ahead
Watching you from the heaven's gate

She's tired of problems that you caused her mind
Tired of all those lies in your freak show
Tired of being alone at night
Being the lowest cat on earth

So Gloria steps out of the prison
Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl 
you've been dreaming about

2x
Gloria alone now forever
Gloria away in the air now
Gloria she's no longer your slave

She's no, no longer your slave
No, no, not anymore 
She's no, no longer your slave
No, no, not anymore 
She's no, no longer your slave
No, no, not anymore 

So Gloria steps out of the prison
Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl 
you've been dreaming about

Gloria alone now forever
Gloria away in the air now
Gloria she's no longer your slave

No, not anymore
No, no, no, not anymore
No, no---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
