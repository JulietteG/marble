I'm a alone, together with sweet wet dreams
Don't let go never lose it, just holding on to sweet dreams
You were the one to open up me
Long time ago, so far away
Uh, no I don't want to get down on my knees
I'm letting my mind just drift away

I'm a alone, together with sweet wet dreams
Don't let go never lose it, just holding on to sweet dreams
Left you because you came too close to me
I just couldn't take the blame you give me
But I can forget how we held each other up
I want you but only for your style

I'm a alone, together with sweet wet dreams
I'm a alone, together with sweet sweet dreams

I'm alone, here I stay, just holding on to sweet dreams
Don't let go never lose it, just holding on to wet dreams

You'll be all alone, in the cold...
We can make it together but would please not roll
Give me back, all alone,
We can make it together but would please not roll
Too long in the night
Oh wet dreams
Holding on to sweet wet dreams---
