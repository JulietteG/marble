Since I met you baby, I feel that you somehow saved me
Your smile lets me know that your heart warmly glows
                              It took forever to find eternity
                              It took forever to find eternity

Time flew by me, now I understand you see
Time played a waiting game, it seems you felt the same, oh
                              It took forever to find eternity
                              It took forever to find eternity

When love passes by, no one really understands why
                               But time will help you see
Another wait, is not too late, to find eternity

Love is now set free, the waiting game was the key
And when I see you standing there, everything now seems fair
                                It took forever to find eternity
                                It took forever to find eternity

                                Yeah Yeah
                                It took forever to find eternity
                                It took forever to find eternity.---Lyrics submitted by june rogerson.
