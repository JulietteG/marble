He said he didnt even hear trains let alone the few words
The ladies maybe sayin about him
She freaks and tells her closest friend that shell never love again
But shell never, no not ever
Live without him

Chorus  Wouldnt believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah

She said he didnt mean a thing so she threw her diamond ring
Out the window of a black cab in Camden
He couldn't take it, what she did,
So he threw a hissy fit and he took it out on anyone at random

Chorus

Dinning sound, lights spinning round, some mothers son
Gotta fight or got to run run run run
Run run run run run 

Solo

Ten pints and then he starts a fight and he lands himself a night
In a cell wearing grey pants and bruises
Twelve mates bangin on the door, oh the back up vans galore
Never saw such a street full of losers

Chorus

Repeat mayhem---Lyrics submitted by Valentina.
