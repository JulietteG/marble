My thoughts are dark and empty
I'm not crying out loud
Don't know what am I asking for
If an answer can be found
The lonelieness is killing as
though there someone in my bed
There's only so much living
That I fear I could be dead

But then standing at my window when
The night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter
With the sign of the sun

And I said

Oh my god it's good to be alive
Oh my god it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah it's good to be alive

Lying in my bedroom
My eyes are wide awake
My body's tired and given up
Oh, for heavens sake
Won't you please send me a little sleep
To ease my worried mind
I'm losing rationality
That i won't know how to find

But then standing at my window when
The night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter
With the sign of the sun

And I said

Oh my god it's good to be alive
Oh my god it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah it's good to be alive

Things are looking up for me
When the clock keeps ticking on
Holding on to time gone by clinging to a song
To pull me through with every word
Rock me with a tune
and hold my hand with the shadow man
who's hiding in my room

But then standing at my window when
The night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter
With the sign of the sun

And I said

Oh my god it's good to be alive
Oh my god it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah it's good to be alive

Doo Doo Doo it's good to be alive---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
