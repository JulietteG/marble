Keep on takin' your medication,
Lock that temper behind those pills
Your brain is fryin' insanely flyin'
Just remember it's bad to kill

I go with a psycho, I go with a psycho

Stop your growlin', no more prowlin'
Leave those cars and people alone
You're an animal, a human cannibal
Snarlin' and a snappin' like a dog on a bone

I go with a psycho, I go with a psycho

You terrify the neighbours when you scream and shout
You look like it's contagious, you're foaming at the mouth
You're a freakin' nightmare when you're lying in my bed
You sleep with eyes wide open, like the livin' dead

I go with a psycho, I go with a psycho---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
