 Upsy daisy 'n make my blood flow

 Youre lookin amazinn' and I love you inside out

I love your eyes blue as the skies
 I love you lips to your fingertips
 I love your bones your old sticks and stones yeah

Oh dont you believe me
 Yeah, I know its kinda creepy
 Oh but oh youre lovin it deeply
 Admit it I did it you know youre gonna keep me

So
 Say you love me like a hobo
 Worn and grubby but you know though
 No one above me and you love me inside out

Oh yeah yeah

So dont you believe me
 Yeah I know its kinda creepy
 Oh but oh youre lovin it deeply
 Admit it I did it you know youre gonna keep me

Oh Say you love me like a hobo
 Worn and grubby but you know though
 No one above me and you love me inside out

I love your chin and the skin that you're in
 I love your nails even your entrails
 I love your soul even your little mole
 Yeah, I love you inside out

I love your arms and your laugh aloud charms
 I love your wits and all your wobbly bits
 I love your lungs and your talking tongue
 Yeah I love you inside out
 Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Fletch.
