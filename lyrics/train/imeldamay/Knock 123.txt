Knock one, two, three on the wall
That will be our secret call
You'll find me under your spell
Secret safe, I won't tell

Knock one, two... one, two
One, two, three

I see you move across the room
I can't keep still, you're my thrill
Can't you see, you belong to me

You have me trapped, I'm happy with that
I'll keep you warm, when others are gone
Look in my eyes, I'm your surprise

Knock one, two, three on the wall
That will be our secret call
You'll find me under your spell
Secret safe, I won't tell

Knock one, two... one, two
One, two, three

I won't tell a soul, oh no one will know
I'll keep all aside, keep away from the light
Just call and I'll appear, I'll always be near

Knock one, two, three on the wall
That will be our secret call
You'll find me under your spell
Secret safe, I won't tell

Knock one, two... one, two
One, two, three---Lyrics submitted by jaisfem.
