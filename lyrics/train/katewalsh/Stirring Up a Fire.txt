Days ago, I found this mess that I'm in.
Such a surprise, I don't know where to begin.
He caught the sunlight in the palm of his hand,
Never witnessed such a vision, never loved such a man.

He was wounded in a fire within his soul.
And she rescued him from pain, he'd never know.
He was crumbling inside when she brought him back to life,
but he is stirring up a fire in my soul.

I know her name, I can't imagine her face.
She must be something to have captured his grace.
I say my prayers cause they have done me so well,
But are they leading me to him or am I heading for hell?

He was wounded in a fire within his soul.
When she rescued him from pain, he'd never know.
He was crumbling inside when she brought him back to life,
but he is stirring up a fire in my soul.

Take him away from me now.
If I'm not supposed to be around.
Keep him close to her.
If he is destined for her.

But god, he is everything I know.
So please if it's written, tell him that I am smitten so.

He was wounded in a fire within his soul.
When she rescued him from pain he'd never know.
He was wounded in a fire within his soul.
When she rescued him from pain he'd never know.
He was crumbling inside when she brought him back to life,
but he is stirring up a fire in my soul.---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra Morin.
