You are my sunshine you brighten up my life
I know that I'm not right sometime oh I need you so
Your something special you prove it all the time
I know that you are mine all mine
You always let it flow
I just want to thank you Cause you've made it this way
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
You keep me smiling

The things you do for me
I know that you will be right here
Your always around
You make me happy the lovely things you do
I owe it all to you you never let me down
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
Cause you've made it this way
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by carla monroe.
