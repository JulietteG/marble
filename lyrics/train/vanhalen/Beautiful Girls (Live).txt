She was seaside sittin', just a smokin' and a drinkin' on ringside, on top of the world, oh, yeah.
She had her drink in her hand; she had her toes in the sand and whoa, what a beautiful girl, ah, yeah.
What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money can turn your head around.
Creatures from the sea with the look to me like she'd like to fool around.
What a snappy little mammy. Gonna keep her pappy happy and accompany me to the ends of the earth, ah, yeah.
Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no.
All I need is a beautiful girl.
Ah, yeah! Beautiful girls.
Well, I'm a bum in the sun and I'm having fun.
And I know you know I got no special plans.
All the bills are paid. I got it made in the shade, and all I nee, nee, need is the woman.
What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money can turn your head around.
Creatures from the sea with the looks to me like she'd like to fool around.
Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no.
All I need is a beautiful girl.
Ah, yeah! Beautiful girls.
Now, I'm a seaside sittin', just a smokin' and a drinkin';
I'm ringside, on top of the world.
I got a drink in my hand; I got my toes in the sand.
All I need is a beautiful girl.
Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no.
All I need is a beautiful girl.
Ah, yeah! Beautiful girls.
Ah, yeah! Beautiful girls.---
