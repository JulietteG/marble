You've got me captured, I'm under your spell.
I guess I'll never learn.
I have your picture, yes I know it well.
Another page is turned.
Are you for real ? 
It's so hard to tell,from just a magazine.
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells,look what that does to me.
Chorus:
I'll wait till your love comes down.
I'm coming straight for your heart.
No way you can stop me now,as fine as you are.
I wrote a letter and told her these words,that meant a lot to me.
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard,her eyes don't follow me.
And while she watches I can never be free,such good photography !
Chorus(guitar solo)
You can't imagine what your image means.
The pages come alive.
Your magic greets everyone who reads.
Heart-break in overdriveAre you for real, it's so hard to tell,from just a magazine.
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells,look what that does to me.
Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
