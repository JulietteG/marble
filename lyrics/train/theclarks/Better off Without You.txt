You are sultry, dirty, soft and hard
You are close to me and you're so far
And I'm thinking of the time we spent together
Now I'll bury this in my backyard
Sometimes I sit and wonder
But I'll never dial your number 'cause

I'm having fun looking out for number one
And I'm doing all the things I like to do
I'm having fun 'cause I knew it all along
I'd be better off without you

You are guilty, pretty, high and low
You're a place to stay and a time to go
And I'm searching through the things you left behind here
Now it's time for me to let it go
Sometimes I sit and wonder
But I'll never dial that number 'cause

I'm having fun looking out for number one
And I'm doing all the things I like to do
I'm having fun 'cause I knew it all along
I'd be better off without you
Better off without you


Late at night you pick up the telephone
Call me up and cry 'cause you're all alone I don't care
Apologize for taking my cigarettes
Now it's time to feel all the side effects
Missing the life you had 

I'm having fun looking out for number one
And I'm doing all the things I like to do
I'm having fun 'cause I knew it all along
I'd be better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you---Lyrics submitted by lynn.
