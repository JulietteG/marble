Fifty cities in a jet plane
you people get us so high
we blow the doors off 
then were up again
dreamin across the sky
        chorus
Well its allright
I'm on the night flight
'cause tonight
I'm comin through
yes its alright
I'll be home tonight
I'll be comin'home to you
     (Yes I will)
Turnin' it on along the hard road
I can't say where we've been
we're feelin' strong 
It's been a heavy load
but now we're comin' in
After the show 
there's a knock on the door
looks like a party tonight
the boys are for it 
but i've been there before
you know I turn out the light
          chorus
Comin' home,comin' home,
I'm comin' home to you
comin' home
          chorus x3---Lyrics submitted by William.
