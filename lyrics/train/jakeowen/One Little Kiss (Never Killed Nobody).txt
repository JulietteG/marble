(Verse)
I saw your number on my phone
I said yea Im here alone
I saw the lights, opened the door fore you rang my bell
Yea how youve been and you leaned in
And I just told myself

(Chorus)
One little kiss never killed nobody
One little drink never wrecked no party
Thought we were over baby
But you kept getting closer baby
One little touch never broke no heart girl
But I always wanna finish what you start girl
Now you dont understand me
I keep moving and its hard to breathe
One little kiss never killed nobody but me

(Verse)
Aint going out, aint getting drunk
Dont need a shot to get messed up
Im thumbing through pictures of you, replaying our last night
Thought Id be fine to see you one more time, yea right

(Chorus)
One little kiss never killed nobody
One little drink never wrecked no party
Thought we were over baby
But you kept getting closer baby
One little touch never broke no heart girl
But I always wanna finish what you start girl
Now you dont understand me
I keep moving and its hard to breathe
One little kiss never killed nobody but me

I mean
And shit I never wouldve listened when you whispered in my ear
Last night
When you said baby its alright

(Chorus)
One little kiss never killed nobody
One little drink never wrecked no party
Thought we were over baby
But you kept getting closer baby
One little touch never broke no heart girl
But I always wanna finish what you start girl
Now you dont understand me
I keep moving and its hard to breathe
One little kiss never killed nobody but me

Nobody but me (x4)---
