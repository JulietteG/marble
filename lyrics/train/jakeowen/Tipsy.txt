(Verse)
You got your hands all over me
You sure making this room spin
Moving your body to the beat
Sure got me feeling like Im losing it
Oh but girl keep doing it

(Chorus)
Jack in my cokes got me dizzy dizzy
Radio rockin with maybe Freddy daddy
Oh oh its the Saturday night
She shake it so sweet you got me on a sugar high
And I dont know if its you or the whiskey
Thats got me feeling all tipsy tipsy
I can feel myself about to fall
Every time you kiss me, kiss me

(Verse)
The way you rock that miniskirt
Yea, you turn me right side down
Girl youre making my vision blurry
It aint what Im sippin got me trippin
Now, girl youre looking so fine tonight
I couldnt walk a straight line tonight cus

(Chorus)
Jack in my cokes got me dizzy dizzy
Radio rockin with maybe Freddy daddy
Oh oh its the Saturday night
She shake it so sweet you got me on a sugar high
And I dont know if its you or the whiskey
Thats got me feeling all tipsy tipsy
I can feel myself about to fall
Every time you kiss me, kiss me

(Bridge)
Yea, the rooms going round and round
I was thinking we should just lay down

(Chorus)
Jack in my cokes got me dizzy dizzy
Radio rockin with maybe Freddy daddy
Oh oh its the Saturday night
She shake it so sweet you got me on a sugar high
And I dont know if its you or the whiskey
Thats got me feeling all tipsy tipsy
I can feel myself about to fall
Every time you kiss me, kiss me
I better lean you up against the wall
Oh Im tipsy, tipsy---
