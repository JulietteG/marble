Long truck bed, hop in it, 
painted fire engine red like her lipstick
Out here we can let it go, just me and my good friends 
Jug of wine, a little sip out here, baby, you just never know 
Yeah these are the day's of gold

Well it's a southern summer, whiskey's in the air
Dog's on the burner, beer's ice cold
Got a pretty little layin' low...oh-oh-oh
Southern summer, that sun's shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road through the days of gold 

(hey) (hey) (hey)

A little July sky so high, moonshine by the riverside
Stealin' hearts and runnin' wild
Yeah, our own world, Tennesse boys and girls
Runnin' free
Out here, it's good times for miles
Yeah these are the days of gold

Well it's a southern summer, whiskey's in the air
Dog's on the burner, beer's ice cold
Got a pretty little layin' low...oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Southern summer, that sun's shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road through the days of gold oh-oh-oh

Instrumental 

A little bit of you, a little bit me
What ya wanna do, what's it gonna be
We can get wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine
Slice of water melon and you spit the seeds
Sweat on your back stickin' to the seat
We can be gone to beat the heat 
Or buzzin' on ya honey like a bumble bee

(hah hah)

Well it's a southern summer, whiskey's in the air
Dog's on the burner, beer's ice cold
Got a pretty little layin' low...oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Southern summer, that sun's shinin' down like daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road through the days of gold...

(hey) (hey) (hey)
(hey) (hey) (hey)
