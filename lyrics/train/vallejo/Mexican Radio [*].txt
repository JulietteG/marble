I feel the hot wind on my shoulder
with a touch of a world that is over
i turn the switch and check the number
i feel the rhythm of the music
buy a product and never use it
I hear the talking of the dj
i turn it up and what does he say

CHORUS: im on a mexican radio
im on a mexican whoa-oh radio

I dial it in and tune the station 
they talk about the u.s. invasion
I understand just a little
no comprehend and its a riddle

CHORUS x2

I wish i was in Tijuana 
eatin barbequed iguana
I take requests on the telephone
im on a wavelength far from home 
i feel the hot wind on my shoulder
i dial it in from south of the border
I hear the talking of the dj
I turn it up and what does he say

CHORUS x3

radio radio radio radio 
vallejo radio vallejo radio
radio radio vallejo radio
radio radio radio radio
