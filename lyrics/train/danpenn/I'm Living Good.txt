Well my rent sure cost a lot
And one little room is all I got
But in my eyes is a castle that I live in

Oh because Im living good
Oh Im living good
Ive got your sweet love 
Darling Im living mighty good

Sometime my old car fails to start 
Seems like it always fallin apart
But when youre in it 
That old car is my limmozine

Oh yes Im living good
Oh Im living good
Ive got your sweet love 
Darling Im living mighty good

Yes Im living high 
With you by my side
Im living so good darling
Im so satisfied

If I could wish upon a star
Id wish things would stay as theyre
I wouldnt change this paradise Im living in

Oh because Im living good
Oh Im living good
Ive got your sweet love 
Darling Im living mighty good

Yes Im living high
With you by my side
Im living so good darling
Im so satisfied

If I could wish upon a star
Wish things could stay as theyre
I wouldnt change this paradise Im living in

Oh because Im living good
Oh Im living good
Ive got your sweet love 
Darling Im living mighty good
Im living mighty good
Im living real good---Lyrics submitted by Thulani Maphumu.
