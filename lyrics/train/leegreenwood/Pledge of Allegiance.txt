The pledge of Allegience to the flag is a pledge to the ideals of our forefathers; The men who fought and died in the building of this great nation.

Its a pledge to fulfill our duties and obligations as citizens of the United States, and to uphold the principles of our constitution.

And last but not least, its a pledge to maintain the four great freedoms cherished by all Americans; Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, Freedom from want, and Freedom from Fear.---Lyrics submitted by Denise.
