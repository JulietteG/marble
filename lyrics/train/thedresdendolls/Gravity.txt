Gravity plays favorites, I know it 'cause I saw
Honest to God, officer, it's awful (awful)
Down at work I'm getting too familiar with the floor
Trading in my talents by the mouthful

Hate to break it to you but it's out of my control
Forces go to work while we are sleeping (sleeping)
If I could attack with a more sensible approach
Obviously that's what I'd be doing

Right?
Someone tell her, someone get her up

Now
Necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the white side
You are on the black side
Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my good side
If you got a straight line
This'd be a good time

Gravity works slowly if you notice it at all
Some of us are getting mighty lucky (aren't we?)
If you had to live with this you'd rather lie than fall
You think I can't fly? Well, you just watch me, watch me

Someone tell her, someone get her up
You can do it!
Good girl!

Break for it!
Break for it!
Break for it!
This is just the way we should be
Break it and kill her!
Posture
Posture
Wait- I think it's gone-
Poke her with something and see if she's moving, okay?
I think we've lost her

Necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the thin side
You are on the fat side
Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my bad side
If you want a straight line
This'd be a good time

The sky is always falling down on me
The sky is always falling, falling
The sky is always dalling down on me
So, officer, forgive me please---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
