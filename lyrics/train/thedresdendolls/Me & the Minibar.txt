Bring two prefix dinners up
I'll unwrap the plastic cups
It's just us, my love
It's just us, my love

I will make the room up nice
Put your insides all on ice
It was real true love
It was real true love

Close all the windows
Put signs on the handles
And strip down to my dun-dun-duns
You have gone so far
You have gone so far

And tonight
It's just me and the minibar

Candles from the Walmart that
Every city's got to have
That I bought last night
That I bought last night

I was so excited to
Do such normal things with you
When you left last night
With your toothbrush dry

No such details will spoil my plans
That is the kind of girl I am
Ha ha ha

Can you hear room 318?
Man, they're really happening
They're a wild bunch
They're a wild bunch
But if they just knew
What my night was coming to
God, would they vomit and run
You have gone so far
You have gone too far
So tonight
It's just me and the minibar
Nobody else
And I sing at the top of my lungs
Happy birthday us
Happy birthday us---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
