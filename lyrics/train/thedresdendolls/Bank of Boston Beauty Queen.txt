I've tried dolls that were guaranteed sixteen and under
None were very exciting
Sort of like a laugh track or whacking off, it gets you off
But its just not the real thing
Its been decades since my pit days
But I haven't shaken it, I sit there like an idiot
Still wrapped up in the old punk protocol
And dreaming that the teenagers will think that Im a radical

And I still wait for the bus to come
Where high school got torn down
Still expecting to find true love
Among the skateboarders hanging out
In back of the bank in my hometown

All this talk and no actions got me stiff from the tit to the bone
So I'm living in lala land, but at least I'm not living at home
Same old catcalls, the same old chemicals
Same old thrills, stealing stockings from the shopping mall
It's simple enough to grow the fuck-up happy with the rough cut
Nobody's in the market for a diamond in the rough

But I still wait for my mom to come 
And pick me up at Hollys house
Ten years after they cashed it in
To make a multi-level parking lot
For a 7-11 and Burger King

And I've got cryptographs, Ive got all the phones tapped
It's just proof enough, it is indisputable
Loves not good enough, I want photographs
Something that will teach me my arithmetic at last

Better get your kids in -- I'm on the loose again
And getting more ridiculous the more I think
I ought to get my mind out of the gutter
(Its getting dangerous, Amanda, 
You are old enough to be the poor kid's)
My own private highway from the cradle to the grave
I save a bundle skipping middle age and Saturdays

And I still wait for the cops to come
Where the station since burned down
Still expecting that theyll pick me up 
For all the sins I committed in the 
Back of the banged-up pickup truck

Ive got autographs, backstage passes 
And leather jacket back patches up the
Ask me anything, I want evidence
Single serving saccharine packets dripping black with lipstick kisses

I still wait for the bus to come
Where the high school got torn down
Still expecting to find true love among 
The skateboarders hanging out
In back of the bank in my home

Im no pederast, but just out of interest
Thank you, but I'm capable of getting up and getting dressed
Loves not good enough, I want photographs
Something that will teach me coming
Time and time again
I think I'll down my half again
Oh, God
Sixteen, no, I'm ten
Im seventeen
And a Bank of Boston Beauty Queen---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
