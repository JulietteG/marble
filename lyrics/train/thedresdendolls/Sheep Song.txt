Wash up
Bowl of mush
Look, I made America
Hush, hush
Don't, don't rush
Time for quiet
Time to brush

Brown wine
Turpentine
Everything will be just fine
Sleep now
Never fear
All your animals are here

Counting sheep, I lay me down to sleep
But I see a sheep who will not leave
From the back they catch him in a trap
Hit his head and send him off to bed

Cutting by numbers is kinder
Invest in one with the silencer
All of the studies say if they're
Calm when they die then they taste better

Cutting by numbers is kinder
Invest in one with the silencer
All of the studies say if they're
Calm when they die then they taste better

Goodbye
Olive sky
I am crying all the time
There, there
Don't despair
We will find 
Your sheep somewhere---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
