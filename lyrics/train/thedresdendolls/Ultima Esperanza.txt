Downloading doves on your fancy computer
You're shooting for love in the dark
Hey, foks, you've found her; now go instant message
Her name is a pretty good start

Ultima sits in her bedroom in Texas and
Waits for her hamsters to touch
She lost her legs in a car crash three years ago
She doesn't get around much

But she is hoping someday
Somebody will take her away

Now that you got her a dress you can send her
A matching attachment and face
Slick rhododendrons you make out of paper
With flowers that never lose shape

You have a video camera strapped to
Your forehead in case she is true
Smiling, rewind as we die in slow motion
As if it's not happening to you

Don't be afraid of the dark ages, darling
You may have to wait but a letter is coming
With mixes of Marilyn songs
And pictures she took at the prom
Knowing her name is enough
Ultima

Foks trotting, globes rotting under your fingertips
Tappng for oil in veins
Surely you won't think to hold that against me
It's such an unusual name

Some one hoping to find
Her limbs in an auction online
Knowing her name is enough
Ultima Esperanza
