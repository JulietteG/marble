Its so funny running into you
it has to be three years since we last seen each other
many flash backs come to mind 
of the wild and crazy times 
we use to have with one another
we absolutely didnt, care we would do it anywhere
eye contact and it was over
thats when I was wilding out
I could care less about someone getting hurt
Ive done my share of dirt, Ive wised up

Chorus:
Seeing you reminds me of all the times I use to beat it up
I will do it again but I cant
Ooh wee, everythings different now
I finally done settled down
I became a one womans man 

There were many others after you
quite a few one night stands, some of their names I cant remember
imaging waking up to someone new, you barely even knew
time and time again
but there is someone for everyone; Ive been blessed to find that one
who makes me feel like no other
you are looking good as hell
but I cant go home with you
because Im going home to her

Chorus:
Seeing you reminds me of all the times I use to beat it up
I will do it again but I cant
Ooh wee, everythings different now
I finally done settled down
I became a one womans man 
Long gone, Holidays, when I ran the streets 
trying to get paid ooh and I, see now that Ive found the love of my life
I dont have to trick no more
it was nice seeing you but I gotta go home to my baby
