[chorus]
Poppin' bottles in the ice,
like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right,
gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride (in my ride)
like  three 6
now im feelin so fly like a G6
like a G6, like a G6
now im feelin so fly like a G6
like a G6, like a G6
now im feelin so fly like a G6

Gimme that Mo-Moet
Gimme that Cry-Crystal
Ladies love my style, at
my table gettin wild
Get those botlles poppin, we
get that drip and that drop
now give me 2 more bottles
cuz you know it dont stop

Hell yeaa!
drink it up, drink-drink it up
when sober girls around me,
they be actin like they drunk
they be actin like they drunk
actin-actin like they drunk
when sober girls around me,
they be actin like they drunnkk

[chorus]

Sippin on, sippin on sizz,
Imma ma-make it fizz
girl i keep it gangsta, poppin
bottles at the crib (crib)
this is how we live,
every single night
take that bottle to the head,
and let me see you fly

Hell yeaa!
drink it up, drink-drink it up
when sober girls around me,
they be actin like they drunk
they be actin like they drunk
actin-actin like they drunk
when sober girls around me,
they be actin like they drunnkk

[chorus]

(you cant touch this)
its that 808 bump, make
you put yo hands up
make you put yo hands up,

(you cant touch this)

Hell yeaaa

(you cant touch this)
Hell yeaaa

make you put yo hands up,
put yo, put yo hands up
(you cant touch this)
