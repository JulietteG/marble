[Intro - Justin Bieber]
I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight

[Far East Movement]
Yo, hell yeah, dirty bass
Ghetto girl, you drive me cray
Hell yeah, dirty bass

This beat make me go wow
This drink make me fall down
I party hard like carnival
Let's burn this motha down
This bass make me go ache (go ache)

Oh my, dirty bass
Oh you got that small

[Far East Movement]
Yo, hell yeah, dirty bass

No matter where we be at VIP, or in the ceiling
All we need to start it is the speakers in my chit-chat
I spot a couple hotties

Girl move it like pilates
Put your head where you knee at

Oh my, dirty bass

I know that we gon' be alright

[Bridge]
This is my moment tonight
Hell yeah we doing it right
So get your hands up in the air
Like we living your life
This is my moment tonight
Hell yeah we doing it right
So get your hands up in the air
Like we living your life

[Justin Bieber - Chorus]

I know that we gon' be alright

I'm gonna live my life
No matter what, we party tonight
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
I know that we gon' be alright---
