She's a sunset stripper, a hollywood freak
She ain't comin' to yo' party 'less she walk in fo' free
She got friends spendin' ends and a mercedes benz
Hike her skirt up to her ass so she can show off her legs

Watch out now there she go go
Table dance queen, showin' off her no nos
Dip it down low, she can go in slow mo
But bring it back down, hopin' no for no no (?)
The bo don't know, don't hurt nobody (?)
Let her wild out, livin' up the party
The way that she shakes, good lord almighty

She got it right with her bad attitude
She got the time but it ain't for you
She got big sunglasses and her hair in a do
She's on the move, move, move, move, move

It's in the way that she walks and the way that she talks
It's in the way that she struts and the way that she flaunts
It's in the way that she do all the things that she do
She's something, she's something, she's something

She makes the guy say daym, ladies say ow
People say wow, check the profile
Nice cheekbones with an ass to match 
And a pricetag more than an average man
She's built in a lab in an insitution
Triple XG she's super human
Too hot to top, might melt the movement
And in the crib she's home improvement
But, the cat got claws, drop them jaws
Make the boys in the hall spring in falls
Nothin' but a hound dog on yo trail
You got what it takes, don't break a nail
Don't need a sex tape to make sex sale
She does what she does, and she does it well
From the front to the back she's fly as hell
That girl will send you to jail

She got it right with her bad attitude
She got the time but it ain't for you
She got big sunglasses and her hair in a do
She's on the move, move, move, move, move---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
