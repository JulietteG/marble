Dirty bass
I love that
Dirty bass
I love that!

Deep low when I feel loco
Dont trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I roll on, roll on
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that

Dirty bass
I love that

Yo, I make girls jiggle, right down the middle
My girl's from Assadena, she aint that ghetto
She likes to zip the puff, VIP at the club
But when it comes to bass my girl got a banging trunk

Think the way that you roll (think the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (Leave your shoes at the door)
You know what youre here for (You know what youre here for)
Girl, shake that dirty bass, real girls get down on the floor

Deep low when I feel loco
Dont trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I roll on, roll on
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that

Im going ahead when the beat drop
Got beef, eat it like a pork chop
And the bass go pump pump like a reebok
sitting so high [?]
[?]
Your girl icky
I shake [?]

Dont trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I roll on, roll on
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that

Dirty bass
I love that

I'll bang that woofer, if she's a loca
I'll cruise that hollywood [?], I don't want no hooka
I need a 5'4 free for the [?]
Let's take it back to the motel [?]

Think the way that you roll (think the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (Leave your shoes at the door)
You know what youre here for (you know what youre here for)
Girl, shake that dirty bass, real girls get down on the floor

I love that, the way we make it shake
I love that, the way we make it shake
I love that, the way we make it shake
I love that, the way we make it shake
I love that

Deep low when I feel loco
Dont trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I roll on, roll on
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that ---
