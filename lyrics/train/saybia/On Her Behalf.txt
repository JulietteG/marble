On her behalf
I sat in the sun one day
I sat in the sun one day
Daydreaming my way out of here
On her behalf

It's time to illuminate
I need to illuminate
People get killed on our behalf
I can't cope with that!!!

Though some put their faith
Before the whole human race
Leaving us hanging by a thread
I was born with just one book in my hand
Pages blank
I take a stand

Someone's in my arms now
Got heaven in my arms now
Slowly I rise from the abyss
On her behalf

If you put your race
Before her heavenly face
I'll leave you hanging by a thread
She is born with just one book in her hand
Pages blank
I take a stand

If you put your faith
Before her innocent face...

I take a stand
Take a stand!!!

I sat in the sun one day---Lyrics submitted by Mar.
