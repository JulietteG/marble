I've seen gypsies who made it all the way
And kept going, kept rolling with nowhere to go
Nowhere to go.

As far as I've seen, from the bush
In the wilderness, to every known city
I've been to Saudi Arabia, dug up Calcutta
So I went to Mozambique, Istanbul, Rio, Rome
Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Taiwan, Great Britain
Belfast, to the desert, Spain
Some little bitty island in the middle of the acific
All the way back home, to my town
To my town
Bitching, complaining, yet some people who ain't got sh*t to eat
Bitching, moaning, so many people you know what they got

What are we doing?
We're sitting on a ruin
What are we doing?
We're sitting on a ruin
