It started out like any other friday night
a couple of drinks out on the town
a bunch of friends just livin' it up
we'd order 'em up and drink 'em down
a few shots later and a few sheets to the wind
some girl said she wanted to take me home
my friends were laughing when they told me to go
i should have known right then and there something was wrong

(chorus)
'cause i went to bed at 2 with a 10
i woke up at 10 with a 2
Jose Cuervo you're not a friend of mine
look what you make me do
'ol jack and Jim, yeah you're also to blame
you talked me into talking to Oh, whats her name?
and now I'm just laying here scared and confused
just another sad case
of the beer goggle blues
i got the beer goggle blues

when i woke up and realized whose bed i was in
i thought it had to be a dream
a handle bar mustache and a lazy eye
that girl was missing her front teeth
well she was 6'4" about a deuce and a half
yeah she looked funny but i was too scared to laugh
she said "i love you baby, baby please dont go"
she locked the door, i jumped right out the window

(Chorus)
cause i went to bed at 2 with a 10
i woke up at 10 with a 2
Jose Cuervo you're not a friend of mine
look what you made me do
 'ol jack and Jim, yeah you're also to blame
you talked me into talking to Oh, whats her name?
and now I'm just laying here scared and confused
just another sad case
of the beer goggle blues
i got the beer goggle blues

The moral of this story yeah its sad but its true
if you drink too much, this could happen to you
and dont believe your friends if they say that shes cute
or you might end up....
with the beer goggle blues
i got the beer goggle blues---Lyrics submitted by Mickey Wragg.
