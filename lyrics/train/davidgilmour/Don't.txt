Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way,
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you,
Baby, don't say don't.

Don't, don't, leave me this way,
For here in my arms you must stay
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't.
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't.

If you think that this is just a game
I'm playin'
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't, don't
Don't feel that way---Lyrics submitted by Edy Warman.
