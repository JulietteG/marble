We sent them all across the ocean
many lives were taken
well i didn't cry, i didn't know them
and i just looked on with no expression

this land was once a home
of friends and family
we used to know
they are all gone now
they are now gone
and for what i cannot tell

put down your banners and flowers
this war you've made won't last
your country, just lines on a map
they're drawn up, they don't last

the paper cities burning
the ashes fell like rain
but when the fire was over
everything had changed

the people come together
reminds us we're the same

put down banners and flowers
this war you've made won't last
your country, just lines on a map
theyre' drawn up, but they don't last---Lyrics submitted by Doctor.
