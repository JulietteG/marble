I am on a bridge
And down below
People passing by
The ones we used to know
Id like to say goodbye

And I had called her name
But no one heard
Sounds just like the noise
Of people talking words

Id love to say a prayer
For all those that flew
And all who wish to

Golden Gates look far from here
A peaceful view from up above
And can you hear their voices calling your name?

And I am on the ground
And now Ive seen
The choice to stay or go
Does not belong to me
Id love to say hello---Lyrics submitted by Doctor.
