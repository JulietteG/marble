You with the sad eyes, dont be discouraged. Oh I realize its hard to take courage. In a world full of people you can lose sight of it and the darkness inside you makes you feel so small but I see 

Your true colors shining through, I see your true colors and thats why I love you. So dont be afraid to let them show your true colors, true colors are beautiful ooh like a rainbow

Show me your smile then dont be unhappy cant remember when I last saw you laughing if this world makes you crazy when youve taken all you can bare just call me because you know Ill be there  and ill see

Your true colors shining through, I see your true colors and thats why I love you. So dont be afraid to let them show your true colors, true colors are beautiful ooh like a rainbow

Such sad eyes take courage now realize when this world makes you crazy and youve taken  all you can bare just call me up because you know Ill be there and ill see

Your true colors shining through, I see your true colors and thats why I love you. So dont be afraid to let them show your true colors, true colors, true colors are shining through.

Your true colors shining through, I see your true colors and thats why I love you. So dont be afraid to let them show your true colors, true colors, true colors are beautiful  ooh like a rainbow

Show me your colors, show me your rainbow---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
