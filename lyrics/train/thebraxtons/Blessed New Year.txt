Father, Father
Our God
We thank you and give you praise

We love you, Father
Your son, Jesus
As we celebrate Christmas day

Thanks for life, and health, and strength.
And we say a prayer for those we lost along the way

Merry Christmas
To all our family and all of our friends
Come let's take the time to bow our heads and remember why we're here

Have a very merry Christmas and a blessed New Year

Happy Holidays---
