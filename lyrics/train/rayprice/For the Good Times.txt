Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time
To spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

Chorus
Lay your head
Upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Falling softly against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
But I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There 'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Chorus
Lay your head
Upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Falling softly against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times---Lyrics submitted by Jo.
