You're like my shadow 
You're a borderline stalker 
But you've never kissed a girl 
You're just a big talker 

You look like a runaway doll 
High fashion know it all 
Your favorite phrase 
Is OMG that's so hot 

Every time I see you 
You look pretty 
Better than the girls in 
New York city 
But you are a boy 
So pity pity 
OH OH 
Perfect little hands that 
Are always kept nice 
Porcelain skin with charming 
Blue eyes 
But you're much too fine 
Every to be mine 
OH OH 

Such a prissy preppy 
Too long to get ready 
Pretty boy 
OH OH 
Yeah a deli delicately 
Packaged precious toy you 
Pretty boy 

You get mistaken for 
A girl cause you rock girlie jeans 
You wear so much guyliner 
People think your Bon Jovi 

I've changed my number thrice 
But you still can't see the sings 
Only want guys 
That aren't more beautiful than me 

Every time I see you 
You look pretty 
Better than the girls in 
New York city 
But you are a boy 
So pity pity 
OH OH 
Perfect little hands that 
Are always kept nice 
Porcelain skin with charming 
Blue eyes 
But you're much too fine 
Every to be mine 
OH OH 

Such a prissy preppy 
Too long to get ready 
Pretty boy 
OH OH 
Yeah a deli delicately 
Packaged precious toy you 
Pretty boy 

Flowers grow 
And flowers fade 
But beauty of 
The soul remains 

Every time I see you 
You look pretty 
Better than the girls in 
New York city 
But you are a boy 
So pity pity 
OH OH 
Perfect little hands that 
Are always kept nice 
Porcelain skin with charming 
Blue eyes 
But you're much too fine 
Every to be mine 
OH OH 

Such a prissy preppy 
Too long to get ready 
Pretty boy 
OH OH 
Yeah a deli delicately 
Packaged precious toy you 
Pretty boy---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
