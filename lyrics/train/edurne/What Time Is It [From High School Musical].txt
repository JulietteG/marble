[Chorus]
What time is it? 
Summertime! 
It's our vacation.
What time is it? 
Party time! 
That's right, say it loud.
What time is it? 
Time of our lives. Anticipation.
What time is it? 
Summertime! 
School's out. Scream and shout.

[Troy]
Finally summer's here.
Good to be chillin' out.
I'm off the clock. The pressure's off.
Now my girl's what it's all about.

[Gabriella]
Ready for some sunshine.
For my heart to take a chance.
I'm here to stay, and I'm moving away.
Ready for a summer romance.

[Troy & Gabriella]
Everybody ready, going crazy, yeah we're out.
Come on and let me hear you say it now. Right now.

[Chorus]
What time is it? 
Summertime! 
It's our vacation.
What time is it? 
Party time! 
That's right, say it loud.
What time is it? 
Time of our lives. Anticipation.
What time is it? 
Summertime! 
School's out. Scream and shout.

[Sharpay]
Play by the rules.
No summer school.
I'm free to shop til I drop.

[Ryan]
It's an education vacation.

[Ryan & Sharpay]

Time of our lives. Anticipation.
What time is it? 
Summertime! 
School's out. Scream and shout.

[Troy & Gabriella]
No more waking up at 6 AM.
Cuz now our time is all our own.

[Ryan & Sharpay]
Enough already. We're waiting.
Come on, let's go.

Go out of control! 

Alright.
Everybody.
Yeah.

School pride. Let's show it.
We're champions, and we know it.
Wildcats! We are the best! Red, white, and gold.

When it's time to win, we do it.
We're number one. We proved it.

Let's live it up. Get the party down.
That's what the summer's all about.

What time is it? 

[Gabriella]
Summertime is finally here.

Let's celebrate.

[Troy & Gabriella]
Wanna hear you loud and clear now.

School's out.

[Chad & Taylor]
We can sleep as late as we want to... 

It's our time! 

[Ryan & Sharpay]
Now we can do whatever we wanna do.

What time is it? 
It's summertime.

We're lovin' it.
Come on and sing it loud now! 

What time is it? 
It's party time.

Let's go have the time of our lives.---Lyrics submitted by Randelle.
