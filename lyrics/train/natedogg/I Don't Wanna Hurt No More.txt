jail cell is all thats waiting look at all the progress your makin i really hope your
kind of patient your facin 25 on probation-hey-2 for 1 is multiplication your freedom is all

how can i concentrate with all the problems that i face i often ask my self 
is ther a place where i can get away(a place where i can get away)
i keep my head to the sky and try to maintain my pace cuz if i dnt then i hope 
somebody dnt take my place-hey-dnt need to go to fast a little time is all it
takes but my situation dam i'll be jackin soon at this rate-hey-i aint trynna
make you mad it's just the simple facts that you face if your broke you hurt 
most from all the bullshit you face-hey-
