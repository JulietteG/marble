Right from the start i was stabbed in the heart
Didn't know i wasn't breathing
Didn't know i had been bleeding
Open my door thought i was alone but
Someone was hiding
In the dark room in my home

Hum it, you will remember some of it
But if you solve it
You will remember all of it

Creeper in my home
Crawled in through the window
I grabbed the kitchen knife
Couldn't stick it in
No, Creeper had his own
Shining in the moonlight
My home was very cold
And something didn't feel right

Right from the start i was stabbed in the heart
Didn't know i wasn't breathing
Didn't know i had been bleeding
open my door thought I was alone but
Someone was hiding
In the dark room in my home

Right from the start i was stabbed in the heart
Didn't know i wasn't breathing
Didn't know i had been bleeding
Open my door thought I was alone but
Someone was hiding
In the dark room in my home

Right from the start i was stabbed in the heart
Didn't know i wasn't breathing
Didn't know i had been bleeding
Open my door thought I was alone but
Someone was hiding
In the dark room in my home---Lyrics submitted by Katt.
