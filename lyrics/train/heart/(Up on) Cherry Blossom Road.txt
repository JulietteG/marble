Now the summer's come and gone
I feel September comin' on
You're still burnin' on my skin
Lord I want those, sweet rain drops to begin
Cool this fever and keep me home
Up on Cherrry Blossom Road

Now you're as mean as I am good
And I'd stop comin' if I could
You laugh at all my school girl fears
And you tell me "When you want me, babe I'll be here"
I'd trade my body for my soul
Up on Cherry Blossom Road
Ooh yeah

So blow cruel wind
Take me back to his door
He'll take me in, yeah
I walk away a woman
(walk away)
I walk away a woman
(walk away)
Walk away
(walk away)
Walk away
(walk away)
Just walk away
(walk away)
Walk away
(walk away)

In my virgin bed alone
Like a hostage to the phone
I know that he ain't far away
Lord, I know that he don't feel this kind of pain
I hate him Lord, I want him soon
Up on Cherry Blossom Road
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

So blow cruel wind
Take me back to his door
He'll take me in, yeah yeah
I walk away a woman
(walk away)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(walk away)
Hey
(walk away)
Walk away
(walk away)
Walk away
(walk away)
Away, away
(walk away)
Hey---Lyrics submitted by Janine.
