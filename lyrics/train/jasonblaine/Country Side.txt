You'll know her when you see her
She'll be the one in the scuff up boots
Whoa ball cap, pony tail through the back
Grooving to a Garth Brooks tune
Her first car was a truck
She ain't afraid to sling it in the mud

Ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the thing about my baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You can blame it on her raising
She get a little unwell on a Friday night
With the Coke and the Crown
The moon and the shine
But I love how she ain't shy
Showing off her country side

She meet her friends out
Get a little laugh
'Round about Friday night
My shotgun, a couple of cold ones
Out where the star shine bright
Favorite blues jeans, fade and torn
Out there with the crickets and the catte in the barn

It gets rake that look in her eyes
Said she wanna get lost, take a little ride
Ain't no telling what we might find
She scoots over and the dashboard light
She's a little more that country side

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh---
