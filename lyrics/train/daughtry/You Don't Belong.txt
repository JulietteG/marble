With time to kill and an empty tomb
I always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smokey rooms
I can hardly stand the fumes
Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place
I never will forget the disgrace on
Your face so full of love
Will it ever be enough
Ten feet tall and bullet proof
I never thought that I had a thing to lose
Well it looks like after all, I'm gonna have to choose

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You help pass the time, but i'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why
To live such a lie, tell me have I been gone away too long

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone---Lyrics submitted by sacha.
