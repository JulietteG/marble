I'm ten miles from town
And I just broke down
Spittin out smoke on the side of the road

I'm out here alone
Just tryin to get home
to tell you I was wrong but you already know

Believe me I won't stop at nothing 
to see you so I started running

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you.
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters
Is love ever after
After the life we've been through.
'Cause I know theres no life after you.


The last time we talked
the night that I walked
burns like an iron in the back of my mind.

I must have been high
to say you and I
weren't meant to be and  just wastin my time

Oh why did I ever doubt you
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughin with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know theres no life after you

You and I, right or wrong
There's no other one
after this time I've spent alone
I do believe that
a man with sight could be so blind 
think about the better times
must've been out of my mind
so I'm runnin back to tell you
all that I'm after is a life full of laughter
without you god knows what i'd do

(Yeah) All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughin with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
(yeah) you know theres no life after you

No theres no life after you
No theres no life after you
No theres no life after you
No theres no life after you yeah---Lyrics submitted by ene onazi.
