Well I was born
The year that disco died
And U2 was in high school
Thank the lord that they survived
Got my first taste, on a Segar 45
And since that kiss
I rocked out all day, and partied every night

We still argue about who's better
Elton John or Billy Joel
We still wonder if Kurt really wrote the song she's sang in Hole
No we'll never stopped believing
it's the journey of our lives
So won't you help me pour some sugar on these memories tonight?

Sing it

Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Summer of '96, I got my first guitar
I played it till fingers said, "you're gonna be a star"
Grunge was everything, at least, it was to me
A marshall in my Chevy sprint
Just running down a dream

We still argue about who's better
Motley Crue  or G.R
We still can't believe Van Halen, turned into Van Hagar
Now the record shops are gone for good
And no one seems to care
But me and you, and all our friends
Keep living on that prayer

Sing it

Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Went to bed in Cleveland
Woke up in Tennessee
No matter where I roam tonight
I'm chasing history

We still argue about who's better
The Beatles or the Stones
They're forever 27
Jimmy, Janice, Ride and Jones
And we're standing in that memory
'Cause their songs, they still survive
So throw your lighters up
And darling sing with me tonight

Come on

Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold
Long live rock and roll

Long live rock
Long live roll
Long live big guitars and music for the soul
Sing it
Don't give up, don't grow old
Long live crazy nights and records made of gold

Long live rock and roll---Lyrics submitted by Joe Urbauer.
