Oh my God 
Please help me 
Knee deep in the river 
Tryin' to get clean. 

He says "Wash your hands 
Get out the stains 
But you best believe
Boy there's hell to pay" 

Yeah you best believe 
Boy there's hell to pay sayin'

Oh my God 
Please help me 
Waist deep in the river
Can you hear my plee! 

He says "Son, you come
Like a begger in the streets 
You might make it boy
But by the skin of your teeth" 

You might make it boy
But by the skin of your teeth sayin' 

I rambled with the worst of them, 
Fell in love with the harlequin
Saw the darkest hearts of men

And I saw myself starin' back again
And I saw myself starin' back again

Oh my God 
Please help me 
Neck deep in the river 
Screamin' for relief. 

He says "It's mine to give 
But it's yours to choose
You gonna sink or swim 
You gonna learn the truth"

No matter what you do you gonna learn the truth sayin'

Ate the bread that once was stone
Fell from a cliff never broke a bone
Bowed down to get the kings over thrown

Now I'm all alone
And the fire's grown
Now I'm all alone
And the fire's grown

(background vocalists with guitar)

Sing sweet charity
Take whats left of me
A new beginning or is this the end
Sing sweet seraphim
Take me back again
Or watch me make the messes of men---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
