I tried to reach you 'til I thought your phone would ring off the wall
All I've been doing is thinking about you wishing you we're here
I'm so glad you called

(Chorus)
There's a slow rain falling tonight
If you're in the mood I'd really love to see you
Oh, it couldn't be more right 
Just you and me and this slow rain falling tonight

Weekends, a bonus, and the weatherman says there's no letups at all
I'll come and get you there's no need to dress up
Just come as you are

(Chorus)
There's a slow rain falling tonight
If you're in the mood I'd really love to see you
Oh, it couldn't be more right
Just you and me and this slow rain falling tonight

Distant thunder taking me dreaming
Make it perfect baby 
All I need is the pleasure of your company

(Chorus)
There's a slow rain falling tonight
Coming down like that first time we made love
Oh, it couldn't be more right
Just you and me and this slow rain falling tonight

There's a slow rain falling tonight
If you're in the mood I'd really love to see you
Oh, it couldn't be more right
Just you and me and this slow rain falling tonight---Lyrics submitted by B Gillis.
