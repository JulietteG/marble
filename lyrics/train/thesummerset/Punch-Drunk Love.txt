Funny, cute and kissable
I've found a girl that makes me lose control
Every night's like the first night
Never gettin' old

Passed out on her bathroom floor
Still drunk from the night before
But when this party ends,
Wake up and do it again

Knock me out
Hit me with your punch-drunk love
Got me figured out, girl
It's not a enough, it's not enough

Knock me out
Hit me 'till you just can't stop
What you're all about
Girl, just hit me with your punch-drunk love

I like a girl that can take control
Funny, cute and kissable
I had it figured out
Now my room is spinning 'round

I'm not looking to settle down
Just want to mess around
She walks like she knows
What she's doing to me
I said, "All my friends think I'm going crazy"

Knock me out
Hit me with your punch-drunk love
Got me figured out, girl
It's not enough, it's not enough

Knock me out
Hit me 'till you just can't stop
What you're all about
Girl, just hit me with your punch
Hit me with your punch-drunk love

When the weekend ends, we'll do this again
Yeah, keep putting dirty thoughts in my head

Funny, cute and kissable
I've found a girl that makes me lose control
Every night's like the first night
Never gettin' old

Knock me out
Hit me with your punch-drunk love
Got me figured out, girl
It's not a enough, it's not enough

Knock me out
Hit me 'till you just can't stop
What you're all about
Girl, just hit me with your punch-drunk love

Knock me out
Hit me with your punch-drunk love
Just hit me with your punch
Hit me with your punch-drunk love
Punch-drunk love
Just hit me with your punch-drunk love---
