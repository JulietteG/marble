let's take this back to 2005
Drinks are poured and girls so fine
So many dimes got dollars signs
And there she goes
Right on the spot
Gotta taste so sweet I swear this beat will make you want to drop

She wears a new dress everyday
No she won't stop
Makin' the crowd scream
(I can't hear anything)
But Hey (Hey)
It's Miss L.A. Again, Again

Chelsea, Chelsea
Tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea
Are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea
I think it's about time we get down, get down

I Wan't more

I wrote her a song
Not Delilah, not Kelsey

Got them both in my palm
But I'd drop them for chelsea

Hey hey What'd you say
Youve been looking good today
Lets go around town and tell those girls that I'm taken

Chelsea, Chelsea
Tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea
Are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea
I think it's about time we get down, get down

If its worth your time
Ive got 10 digits
I'd like you to find,
But oh, I won't give that call-
You've got so much to give
Ive got nothing at all

Chelsea, Chelsea tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea are you feeling me now?---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
