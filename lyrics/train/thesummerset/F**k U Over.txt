Let me set it straight
Ive done some shit
And maybe I aint too proud of it
The monster in your bed
You were beggin me please dont stop
Said that Im a douche bag
Wont call back
The worst hangover youve ever had
Felt so good at first
You knew that it could never last

Wanna wash the dirt off my hands
Wanna get this all off my chest
But Im no good at saying sorry

Oh oh

I didnt mean to fuck you over
I just wanna have some fun
We can rock the world tonight
But no it doesnt have to be love

I didnt wanna hurt nobody
Ima throw my white flag up
We can rock the world tonight
But no it doesnt have to be love

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh
It doesnt have to be love

Climbing out your window
Gypsy fade
Just another typical Saturday
Wrong name, my mistake
I didnt mean to break your heart
We were on a joy ride
Bonnie and Clyde
Never ever been so satisfied
Heart beats, blinding lights
Yeah you kept me up all night

Oh oh

I didnt mean to fuck you over
I just wanna have some fun
We can rock the world tonight
But no it doesnt have to be love

I didnt wanna hurt nobody
Ima throw my white flag up
We can rock the world tonight
But no it doesnt have to be love

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh
It doesnt have to be love

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh
It doesnt have to be love

You may never wanna see me again
Go on and tell all your friends
That Im no good, Im no good
Dont wanna put up a fight
Ive had the time of my life
And Im no good at saying sorry

Oh oh

I didnt mean to fuck you over
I just wanna have some fun
We can rock the world tonight
But no it doesnt have to be love

I didnt wanna hurt nobody
Ima throw my white flag up
We can rock the world tonight
But no it doesnt have to be love

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh
It doesnt have to be love

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh
It doesnt have to be love

I didnt mean to fuck you
I didnt mean to fuck you over

It doesnt have to be love---
