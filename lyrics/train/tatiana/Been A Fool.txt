I've been a fool
I've stood around and acted oh so cool
I've been unfaithful and betrayed so cruel
Trust that's not easily given...

I've been a fool
I had a temper that was not so cool
I lost my mind and broke the golden rule
Things that just can't be forgiven

If I hadn't been this way
Who knows where I might be today
Please make an example of me or
Do you wanna be alone?

I've been such a fool
I've been such a fool

I've been a fool
Back in my face is where my bad deeds came
I know I've only got myself to blame
Not that it makes me feel better

If I hadn't been this way
Who knows where I might be today
Please make an example of me or
Do you wanna be alone?

I've been such a fool

If I hadn't been this way
Who knows where I might be today
Please make an example of me or
Do you wanna be alone?

I've been such a fool---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
