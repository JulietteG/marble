La la la la, La la la la, La la la la, La la la 
La la la la, La la la la, La la la la, La la la la la

Eat, sleep, breathe that your full of the stuff
Go bag it, tie it up tight
Wheat, meat, dairy free, t-total happy-clappy
High on life you should try it you know

Go on while no one's looking

Aha! Gotcha now!
Caught red handed in the biscuit tin
Cost you to keep me quiet

Golden boy boots, pocket pedal stool
Picking sharp smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper separator
Busy bee wave, wave save the planet flag

But sneaky in suburbia

Aha! Candid camera!
Hook, line and sinker for the 4 wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet

Nicest,  sweetest, utmost in everythingest
So charming, very charming
Well read, can play the fool
No one's ill at ease and put their
Deepest Swiss bank trust in you

No one saw it coming

Aaaha! Aaaaaaha! Aaaaaaaaaha!
You killed a man
Cost you to keep me quiet

Oi!---Lyrics submitted by Castor.
