Here's the day you hoped would never come
Don't ffed me violence, just run with me
Through rows of speeding cars
The paper cuts, the cheating lovers
The coffee's never strong enough
I know you think it's more than just bad luck.

There , there baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now darlin'
Oh, don't lose your head
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you, yeah.

Sleeping pills, no sleeping dogs lie never
Far enough away
Glistening in the cold sweat of guilt
I've watched you slowly winding down for years
You can't keep on like this
Now is as bad of time as any.

There, there baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now darlin'
Oh, don't lose your head
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you , Yeah .

It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It's okay by me
Itr was a long time ago

It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It was a long time ago

There , there baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now darlin'
Oh, Don't lose your head
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you , Yeah

There , there baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now darlin'
Oh, don't lose your haed
'Cauise none of us were angles
And you know I love you , Yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
