I've met so many people who look the same
Most were forgotten but you still remain
Most of the time I don't care
but London's so far away when you're there
And so it saddens me to say 
I'm only happy when I move away

I am and young and I am lost
every sentence has its cost
I am and young and I am lost
You react to my repost

We look out upon the sea
We look out upon the sea
The coast is always changing
I'll bring my camera out to sea
The coast is always changing

Age makes no difference til you open your mouth
Use your time just to work things out
I know that you can't understand 
When I tell you that this wasn't planned
And so it saddens me to say
I'm only happy when I move away

I am young and I am lost
Every sentence has its cost
I am young and I'm lost
You react to my repuste

We look out upon the sea
We look out upon the sea
The coast is always changing
We'll take the train out to the sea
My heart is always changing

It won't be long before you've gone
I can't imagine leaving
It won't be long before you've gone
I can't imagine leaving
It won't be long before you've gone
I can't imagine leaving

We look out upon the sea
We look out upon the sea 
the coast is always changing 
I'll bring my camera out to sea
My heart is always changing
We'll take the train out to the sea 
My pulse was always racing
As we look out upon the sea
The coast is always changing

I know it saddens me to say
I'm still waiting for that day---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
