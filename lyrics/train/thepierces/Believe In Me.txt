Hoo hoo hoo hoo

All I got to hold is a telephone
Feel the dead here
Rising from the dirty ground
Summer nights make you feel alone
Got em me some new kids in this town

Hoo hoo hoo hoo

Just when I was thinking Ive been moving on
Laid my eyes on a baby with a broken heart
Said I think were gonna get along
Said I wanna find out who you are

Hoo hoo hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Hey believe in me
cause I believe in you
I need some company
What do you want to do?
Electricity, do you feel it too?
Hey believe in me
cause I believe in you

Heads playing tricks cause you feel like mine
Never been so easy with a girl like you
Wanna love you cause you look so fine
Who knows maybe one day it could be true

Hoo hoo hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Hey believe in me
cause I believe in you
I need some company
What do you want to do?
Electricity, do you feel it too?
Hey believe in me
cause I believe in you

Listen to me baby
Lie awaken
Count all the things you make this crazy
Well never know know what could be
If we dont take this chance
Looking at me wanting just to touch you
Feel when Im leaving. Read my mind
Fall asleep kiss, wake up making love
Its so divine

[Chorus]
Hey believe in me
cause I believe in you
I need some company
What do you want to do?
Electricity, do you feel it too?
Hey believe in me
cause I believe in you

Hoo hoo hoo hoo---
