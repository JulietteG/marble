Give me traces of your lifeblood flowing in a loving cup
And tell me I'm dream dream dream dreaming and I'll never wake up
A keepsake in a dresser drawer from who-knows-where
A symbol of your exegesis and a full-length mirror

I'll never never never never never never refuse you
I'll never never never never never never refuse you
My blackbird chain, my blackbird chain
My blackbird chain, my blackbird chain

An SOS from an outpost there on a common air
I could read you a brief account of a last frontier
We could come to understand what's wrong as right as rain
At rock bottom of a hollowed ground, we stake your claim

I'll never never never never never never refuse you
I'll never never never never never never refuse you
A blackbird chain, blackbird chain
A blackbird chain, a blackbird chain

I'll never never never never never never refuse you
I'll never never never never never never refuse you
My blackbird chain, a blackbird chain
A blackbird chain, a blackbird chain ---
