You better save yourself
From something you can't see
Follow it where it goes
Follow it back to me
I'll keep it here

Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
You don't have to let it go away

These are some faults we found
Hollowed out from the years
Don't let them wear you out
Don't let them turn your mind inside out

Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
You don't have to let it go away

In the crossfire there's a story
And how it ends, I do not know

Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
Don't let it go
Don't let it go away

Don't you see how far it's gone away?
Don't you see how far it's gone away?
Don't you see how far it's gone away?
Don't you see how far it's gone away?
You don't have to let it go away---
