Why we are so so surprised every time we buy the lie, whoa
Why we pursue the truth even when its hard to do, whoa

And all we want is to believe
Its ok if were slightly deceived
Maybe were missing the point that were listening
To liars and fakes

Whoa, bend but you just wont break
Whoa, some things will never change

Why are we so slow to say well figure out another way, whoa
Why are we so quick to judge anyone whos not like us, whoa

And all we want is to believe
Its ok if were slightly deceived
Maybe were missing the point that were listening
To liars and fakes

Whoa, bend but you just wont break
Whoa, some things will never change

You said that you would never be a monster walking with the rest of them
Id barely recognize if there was anything left of you, well I want something more

Whoa, bend but you just wont break
Whoa, some things will never change

Whoa, bend but you just wont break
Whoa, some things will never change---
