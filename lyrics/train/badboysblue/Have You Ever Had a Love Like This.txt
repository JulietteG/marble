You light my life, when you're with me 
You're like a sun rise deep down in the night
For you can touch my heart with sensuality 
I'm in paradise, must be in paradise 

Have you ever had a love like this 
It's so heavenly when we kiss 
Have you ever had a love like this 
Such a feeling that you have missed 
We are two in a million 
We are two in a million 

You need no strings to bind my hands 
For you have chained my heart so close to you I pray that our love will last for all my life 
Till the end of time, until the end of time 

Have you ever had a love like this 
It's so heavenly when we kiss 
Have you ever had a love like this 
Such a feeling that you have missed 
We are two in a million 
We are two in a million 

Have you ever had a love like this 
It's so heavenly when we kiss 
Have you ever had a love like this 
Such a feeling that you have missed 
We are two in a million 
We are two in a million 

Have you ever had a love like this 
It's so heavenly when we kiss 
Have you ever had a love like this 
Such a feeling that you have missed 
We are two in a million 
We are two in a million 

Have you ever had a love like this
It's so heavenly when we kiss 
Have you ever had a love like this 
Such a feeling that you have missed.---Lyrics submitted by Susan Gil.
