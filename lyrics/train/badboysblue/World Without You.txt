The bright light of the boulevard
Is shining in your tender eyes
Your perfume is exciting me
It's still the same

Michelle, how I love when we love
And I love when you whisper je t'aime
Michelle, mon amour. Is it true'
Do you feel the way I do'

A world without you, a world on my own
Without your love my heart will turn to stone
A world without you, a day without light
Without your touch I couldn't stand one night
Oh Michelle

I know there'll be no better heart
No better heart to hold on to
If you should ever let me down
I can't survive

Michelle, how I love when we love
And I love when you whisper je t'aime
Michelle, mon amour. Is it true'
Do you feel the way I do'

A world without you, a world on my own
Without your love my heart will turn to stone
A world without you, a day without light
Without your touch I couldn't stand one night
Oh Michelle

Girl: C'est toi. Et ce soir je te veux faire l'amour avec toi. Je t'aime. Je
sais mon amour que tu es que tout, le seul pour moi.
(It's you. I want to make love to you tonight.I love you.I
know my love that you're everything, the only one for me)

The bright light of the boulevard
Your perfume is exciting me
I know there'll be no better heart
If you should ever let me down
Michelle
Michelle

A world without you, a world on my own
Without your love my heart will turn to stone
A world without you, a day without light
Without your touch I couldn't stand one night

A world without you, a world on my own
Without your love my heart will turn to stone
A world without you, a day without light
Without your touch I couldn't stand one night

A world without you
A world without you
Oh Michelle ---Lyrics submitted by biowizards.
