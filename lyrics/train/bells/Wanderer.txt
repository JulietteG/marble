We will not pretend,
This forest was forever.
We will not pretend,
to mind the raining cinder.

Empires rise again,
We will not pretend,
The whisper in your ear,
was nothing just remember.

We will not pretend,
To let the lantern dim.

Empires Rise again.
Empires Rise again.---Lyrics submitted by Bob Henderson.
