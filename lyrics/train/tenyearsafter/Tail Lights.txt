raining morning early light
not a word to say goodbye
I grab my keys slammed the door and hit the road
no sense looking back nothing gained doing that

but I can't help thinking about you
you're everywhere I go

Now I'm wondering what I'm doing with my life
yes, I'm wonderin' what I'm doing with my life
stuck here counting all the tail lights
on the highway tonigh

weather man on the radio says if you're driving take it slow
but I ain't got no place to go so I don't really care
life's a river with no return no chance to build those bridges burned
I'm sorry that I hurted you but that was so long ago

every mile and every turn
every hurt's a lesson learned
now I'm wonderin' what I'm doing with my life
stuck couting all the tail lights 
counting all the tail lights
counting all the tail lights
on the highway tonight

[SOLO]

I'm wonderin' what I'm doing with my life
yes I'm wonderin' what I'm doing with my life
stuck counting all the tail lights
counting all the tail lights
counting all the tail lights
counting all the tail lights

and I'm wondering what I'm doing
yes I'm wonderring what I'm doing 

I'm wondering what I'm doing
yes I'm wonderring what I'm doing 
and I'm wondering what I'm doing with my life
on the highway tonight---Lyrics submitted by Mateus Herculan.
