Hoo oo oo oo oo
Said you want yourself a real woman,
Want to hold you down and understand
Oh, is that right?
Ya, is that right? Mm
Said you're ready to be my man,
Maybe even take my hand,
Oh, is that right?
Ya, is that right? Mm
Said you'll never leave me all alone
Hurt me and treat me wrong,
Tell me you're not lying
Cause I'm tired of cryin'.
For I'm a good girl,
Sure enough, ride or die, woman!
Boy you better do me right, ya.
Do me right.
Said I'm a good girl,
Sure enough, by your side, woman!
Boy you better do me right, ya.
Do me right, ya.
And if I give you all me,
Would you promise to be there for me?
And treat me right, ya
treat me right.
And never forsake my heart,
Even when we're apart
Oh, would you treat me right, ya.
Treat me right
So treat me like you wanna be treated
And don't give me nothing less.
I deserve the best,
Nothing less,
Ahhh!
Oh I'm a good girl,
Sure enough, ride or die, woman!
Boy you better do me right, ya.
Do me right, ya.

Sure enough, by your side, woman!

You know I'm a real good woman.
Ahhh, you got to be real good man.
Uh oh, I had enough pain in my life.
Oooo, Ohhh
You know you gotta treat me right.
I'm a good girl,
Sure enough, ride or die, woman!
Boy you better do me right, ya.
Do me right, ya.
