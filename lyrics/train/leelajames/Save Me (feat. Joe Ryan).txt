He used to love me,
The way you love me.
But now things ain't the same,
I don't know, why he changed.
He gave me flowers,
We talk for hours.
But now all that we do,
Is argue, and I'm so through.
Even when he loved me,
He didn't love me like you do.
Now.
He's tearing up my heart
Is there anything you can do?
It's an emergency.
I need you to save me,
Rescue me baby,
Cause I'm going crazy
Goin' crazy
I need you save me,
Rescue me baby,
Cause I'm going crazy,
Goin' crazy.
And I don't wanna drown (drown),
You got me going down (down)
Save me (save me)
Oh baby (oh baby)
And I don't wanna drown (drown),
You got me going down (down)
Save me
Oh baby, save me.
I'm sinking,
I'm drowning,
Please help move this mountain,
Oh save me now,
Now, now, now, now.
Cause I'm running,
Running outta time,
And my heart is on the line
Oh, help me now,
Now, now.
Cause even when she loved me,
She didn't love me like you do.
I can love you better.
It's true.
So much better.
She's tearing up my heart,
Is there anything you can do?
Baby I can love you
It's an emergency!
I need you to save me
I'll save you. [Joe:] Rescue me baby.
Cause I'm going crazy
Goin' crazy
I need you save me,
I'll be there.
Rescue me baby,
 I'll be there.
Cause I'm going crazy,
Goin' crazy.
And I don't wanna drown (drown),
And I don't wanna drown,
You got me going down (down)
You got me going down
Save me, [Leela:] save me.
Oh baby, [Leela:] baby.
I don't wanna drown (drown)
I don't wanna drown,
You got me going down (down)
You got me going down
Save me
Oh baby, save me.
I'll save you
I'll save you, Mmm
