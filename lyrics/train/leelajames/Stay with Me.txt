Stay with me, stay
The moon light, the strong I breath, is so sexy and crazy and baby uuh I want you
Tonight it feels so right my body is ready, I'm yearning, I've got to have you
Now, so just stay with me, stay with me
And I just wanna stay wherever you are
And I just wanna stay wherever you are
Baby stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, with me
Stay with me
Don't leave me I need you
To hold me and touch me, kiss me
Never leave my side, I swing and you're not here
I'm just not the same,
And I just wanna there wherever you are
And I just wanna there wherever you are
Baby stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay stay with me
Stay, stay stay with me
As long as I have you I don't care about nothing
You here with me is how it should be always
And I just wanna there wherever you are
And I just wanna there wherever you are
Baby stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me stay, stay with me
Stay, stay, stay with me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay with me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
I need you
I need you---
