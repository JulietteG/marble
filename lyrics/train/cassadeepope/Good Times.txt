Somebody get me a guitar
Cause I got something to sing to you
Picked up a groove in my car
It's gonna get in the soles of your shoes
It ain't about lonely heart, did you wrong
Broken promise, leaving song
This ain't one of those nights
We've all had enough of those nights

It's time to sing about the good times
Come on, let's rock it 'til the sun shines
Now that you got it, don't you waste it
Oh, can't you feel it? Can't you taste it?
Oh yeah, I really wanna put a smile on your lips
Like an eight grade kiss
Put a swing in your hips, come on move like this
Let's sing about the good times, good times, yeah

I need some crowd participation
I wanna see you going wall to wall
A revolution celebration
'Til we're all shining like a disco ball
Somebody grab a megaphone
Shout it out, tell 'em that we're all about
Leaving our worries behind
Come on and put your hand in mine

It's time to sing about the good times
Come on, let's rock it 'til the sun shines
Now that you got it, don't you waste it
Oh, can't you feel it? Can't you taste it?
Oh yeah, I really wanna put a smile on your lips
Like an eight grade kiss
Put a swing in your hips, come on move like this
Let's sing about the good times, good times, yeah

(Good times, good times)
You know it's all about the good
(Good times, good times)
Yeah you know it's all about the
(Good times, good times)
I wanna sing about the good times

I wanna scream about the good times
Come on, let's rock it 'til the sun shines
Now that you got it don't you waste it
Oh, can't you feel it? Can't you taste it?
Oh yeah, I really wanna put a smile on your lips
Like an eight grade kiss
Put a swing in your hips, come on move like this
Let's sing about the good times, good times
Yeah
(Good times, good times)
I wanna sing about the good times
(Good times, good times)
I wanna sing about the good times ---
