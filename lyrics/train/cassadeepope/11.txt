At 7 years old everything was right
Table for four on a Friday night
Didnt see any signs of a dead end road

By the time I was 10 everything was changing
Fell asleep every night prayin
Didnt know which way to go

(Pre-Chorus)
Mama did her best to hide her anger
And I did my best to try and save her

(Chorus)
I was a little too young and a little too dumb
To ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away
And take his love with him

So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now  innocent and 7
I wish I had never turned 11

We moved into a smaller house
How mama did it oh I dont know how
Never went to bed without eating

At 13 I finally realized
What it means to get on with your life
But daddy sure did and he made it look easy

(Pre-Chorus)
Mama did her best to hide the struggle
And I did my best to stay out of trouble

(Chorus)
I was a little too young and a little too dumb
To ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away
And take his love with him

So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now  innocent and 7
I wish I had never turned 11

(Bridge)
I wish that I could turn back time
And tell myself itll be alright
Youre never gonna lose a lot in your eyes

(Chorus)
I was a little too young and a little too dumb
To ever think the day would come

So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now  innocent and 7
I wish I had never turned 11
I wish I had never turned 11

I wish I had never turned 11---
