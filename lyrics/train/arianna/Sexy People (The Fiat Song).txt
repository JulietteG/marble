When I hear the ocean calling 
and I feel my spirit falling 
I remember old 
where I'd fall in love with you. 

Lovin' romance in the garden 

Yes! 
It's the immigrants, 
taking over. 
Mister World Wide, 
fly yo Arianna, salute 
Let's have some fun! 

When I hear the ocean calling 
Sexy people,.. 
Sexy people,.. 
Sexy people,.. 
Sexy people,.. 
Sexy people,.. 

I was born in Miami, my blood is from Cuba 
Cuba and America don't let me fool ya 
..dejala huya 
any doubts, has corulla, 
I've been around the globe, ripping and ride it, 
deeping and diving, running and gunnin, 
sleeping and slide em, go ahead tryin' 
you can't, it works too hard to deny it. 

Can't beat to surrender, keep me undone 
Sexy people all around the world 
the night is young, let's have some fun. 
Sexy people all around the world 
the night is young, let's have some fun. 
Sexy people all around the world 
the night is young, let's have some fun. 

When I hear the ocean calling 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun! 

I live for the freedom, rap for the freedom, 
die for the freedom, family left Cuba 
all for the freedom 
that's why all the opportunities, me lo como, I eat 'em 
Global dominance, known through all, 
7 continents I flirt with the earth 
she loves when I whisper in her ear and pull up a skirt, 
what a dirty girl.. 

Take me to surrender, keep me undone. 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun, let's have some fun! 

When I hear the ocean calling 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun! 

When I hear the ocean calling 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Sexy people, all around the world 
The night is young, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun, let's have some fun! 
Let's have some fun!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
