You gave me that look across the table
At dinnertime
Your toes caress my ankle
And I notice your breathing getting heavy
Your speech short of steady
It's obvious you're ready

Skip the elevator
Head straight toward the stairs
Lipstick shades on pillowcases
Love and lust together here

But you know
I don't have to tell you
It's not just about that, not just about that

And you know
We don't have to prove it
Was never about that, never about that

We'll turn the lights back on and straighten up the room
I'm buttoning my shirt, I watch you as you fix your hair
We stumble downstairs
Content on what has just occurred
Never feeling awkward

But you know
I don't have to tell you
It's not just about that, not just about that

You know
We don't have to prove it
Was never about that, never about that

But you know
I don't have to tell you
It's not just about that, not just about that

And you know
We don't have to prove it
Was never about that, never about that

And you know
I don't have to tell you
It's not just about that, not just about that

You know
We don't have to prove it
Was never about that, never about that

Never about that, never about that
Never about that, never about that---Lyrics submitted by victoria.
