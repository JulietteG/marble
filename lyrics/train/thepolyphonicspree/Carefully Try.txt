It's so like the god who makes an ordinary find
We're too much a lot alike while all we do is try

Carefully
Carefully try

Over and done
Over and by

It's so like the god who makes an unrelated find
The two of us prepare to trust while all we do is sigh

Carefully 

Carefully try
Over and done
Over and by 

Carefully waiting

Carefully try
Over and done
Over and by

I'm so far away 
I cant seem to hide my mistakes
I fell on the way
It seems I'm much too late
both of us fade away

And so in life we gotta say 
all we do is try
The two of us are born again 
and all we do is fight
to overcome and start again 
all we can do now
The two of us can pain away 
but all we do is try

Carefully

Carefully try
Over and done
Over and by

Carefully waiting 

Carefully try
Over and done
Over and by

Carefully
