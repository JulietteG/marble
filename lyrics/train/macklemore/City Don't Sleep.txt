Now everyday that I walk out of my building 
I see homeless people sleeping 
and chillin on the steps to the apartment that I live in
I'm not sayin that everyone is a victim
but the people that I live 
would treat em more like villains than actual citizens 
I walk past a man laying in his own vomit 
who gets his food and garments 
by digging in the garbage
I beg your pardon Mr.President 
but I'm a resident
and since you've been in office 
I haven't seen any evidence of things changing
we go into Iraq and attack 
but we got people in the streets
without a roof over their back
we gotta accept the homeless
as part of our landscape
the money the government wastes 
could provide them with the same place to eat and sleep
but we cease to see
that our country is based around
war, power and greed
we got families on the street
with no where to go 
and the concretes the only place they have to call home

No where to call your own 
out here in the cold
wishin' you had a home 
feelin' you're all alone 
No where to call you're own
out here in the cold
wishin' you had a home
feelin' all alone

Now every face tells a different story
a different message
Now how can we judge the book
when we don't know the beginnings
we don't know what turned em to the bottle
or started injection 
we just see dirty clothes and another bum beggin
Whatta about the boy who was an addict
the second his mom was pregnant
Or the young girl who was raped 
and stripped up everything sacred
Who now stands downtown walkin 
on the block pacin cause the only 
way she knows how to make it is gettin naked
We don't want to face it
And it bein the fact that the government
created the ghetto and gave it crack
To oppress immigrants and blacks 
and give em more of a set back
Like the last 500 years wasn't enough 
to accomplish that
Now look at the homeless rate 
and tell me to my face that race
doesn't play an intricate part 
in your fate in the united states 
Now think about your home 
and the place that you sleep
and the homeless who only have the concrete

No where to call your own 
out here in the cold
wishin' you had a home
feelin' you're all alone
no where to call your own 
out here in the cold 
wishin' you had a home
feelin' all alone

Now if you wanna see change 
then throw your ones in the air 
you think the system that we livin in is not fair
you wanna see change
then put your ones in the air
Now point it to the ground
cause the change starts right there
you wanna see change 
then put your ones in the air 
you think the system that we livin in is not fair
you wanna see change 
then put your ones in the air
now point them to yourself
cause change starts right there
cause change starts right there---Lyrics submitted by LalaTurnUp.
