bring my drums in
nod your head
im gona do me

we all know that life can get hectic
but if you live in the second 
you exist in the present
and that's how you stay connected
the good times and the hardships 
if you learn to just accept it and 
know that every struggle in life is gunna teach you a lesson

it's times like this that make you
it's always the darkest part of the night
right before the sun has its break through 
the spirit's there to knock you down
but if you make that the end you'll never 
know the beauty of being able to stand up again
and face it with patience,
the basis is dealin with judgements and hatred,
depressed hopeless feelings
but ive been told you only create your own ceilin 
and life is limitless and knowin this is what the spirit is..

thats why i try to inhale deep
so i can find peace, in essence find me
that's why i try to lose myself in these beats 
as i become one with the drums and set myself free

whatever direction life leads me
theres a purpose behind it 
thats the way it was supposed to be 
anytime you can turn over a new leaf
we all know the truth, it's up to us to use the key
it's been three years since my first album dropped
and it's been fear that's really got me stuck in this spot
not wantin to put out anything wack 
so instead of putting my licks on tracks 
i put my lips to a sack
cuz it's easier to spend your life drunk and high on drugs
then put everything into recording, put it out and then get judged
we look for the audience to put their hands up and show love
but when their hands go down our confidence really takes the plunge
so instead of makin music that people might not like 
i went into isolation, traded in my mic for the pipe
started livin the college life: drinkin and smokin everyday
rationalizin to myself that i was goin through a phase
then i'd stop, thinkin my music would take its place
but when you live in fog, inspiration's hard to create
it takes more to connected then to quit smokin  from the day
and when i get frustrated i get a swish and get blown away
then all of a sudden it hit me, these kids are listenin
if im not makin music why the fuck am i existing?
how can i talk about the problems or something else
when i dont have the motivation and confidence to change myself
it's been so long since ive really truly felt
what its like to live life without substances to help
massive struggle thats natural to ones health
but with addiction in my blood i play the cards i was dealt
knowin its the most calm right before the storm
and when you least expect it, it doesnt rain it poors
i swear to god, you can never be warned 
with or without umbrella
 natures still gunna still gonna take its course 

thats why i try to inhale deep 
so i can find peace, in essence  find me
thats why i lose myself in these beats
put away the weed, and turn to my mpc---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
