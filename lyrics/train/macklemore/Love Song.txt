Yo, 
I'm gettin older now
23 years old and half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other half's like, "Hell no, you better mess around. Don't let me down, especially when you got an album comin out"
When I first saw you, I'm like "Aw shit, goddamit look what God did. Hail Mary Jesus!"
Three years later I'm sittin in our apartment thinkin about all the places that my heart's been
I mean its crazy right?
This is maybe wife (?) - the one that found me in a drought, pulled me out and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leavin town
Another couple thousand miles south, which leads to crazy fights
*Phew*
And I don't know how to deal with it, I gotta be real with ya 
Uh,
Each day I get filled with the - feelin of realer love, wanna continue, what
But, 
This ain't the same old love song cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
What, 

You know what makes it worth it?
To watch someone progress
To have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry too
It's something so comforting cause it could bring so much truth 
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesn't move
The commitments to yourself
And that you're always learning, to acknowledge you're both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person but as an individual entity and then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary but it's so complex, it's the most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it could work
I'm attempted,
Nah, we're livin it 
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that, come on

Every time I can't ignore you
Every time I come around I see your face always movin

Yo,
Just workin on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does, it doesn't work we both know that it was meant to breath
Can't hide from experiences
And there's so many people out there in this world were gonna find interestin
It's only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away, whatchu expect?
You see I'm wonderin where are you?
Tearin the label off of a beer as I'm sittin at this barstool
You would tell me not to call you, to never use you as a fall through
To sit with my emotion, but the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feelin lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you, when you die just know the best time of my life has been lovin you
I love you, you know
Lets get em, cmon 

We been together but in my head,
We would break apart; I would hold my heart, tied inside
But you knew that my soul could not be given to anybody easily 
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
(Ohhhhhhh yeah)
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

It's a beautiful thing isn't it?
One more time Ev, 

Every time I can't ignore you
(Feels good don't it?)
Every time I come around I see your face always movin---Lyrics submitted by luis.
