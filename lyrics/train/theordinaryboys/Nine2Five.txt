I wake up late every mornin,
managers callin i'm still yawnin,
get up wake hair and make up's,waiting 4 you don't be stallin,
this proformence is important;
i don't think i can put my all in,
hold on i was drunk last night now its all kickin in and i don't feel right,
gave my number to a (guy/girl) that wasn't my type,
now my phones on silent i'm bein polite,
private callers gettin no luv from me,
just let me be.

oh my gosh my days are gettin longer and theirs no turnin back i'm workin the 9-5,
just to keep my contract did i say 9 i mean 1:30 i ain't no early birdy i'm workin the 9-5,
see you gotta do some idents for channel U channel who?
OH channel U't the one the huge like KATIE PRICES BOOBS!!
Whoops i'm bein rude,
where's my redbull and sandwich,
I NEED FOOD!!!!!!!
i can't handle this i'm gettin pissed like pampers throwin a tantrum.

oh my gosh my days are gettin longer and theirs no turnin back i'm workin the 9-5,
just to keep my contract did i say 9 i mean 1:30.

i'm not sure what day just started since my workin week departed,
ever since our single charted this persuits been ever lastin,
i looked in bout a year ago and i ahven't clocked out from the studio and videos and tv shows and starin out the windows on the road,
although sometimes we don't get paid for these rampages i know i wouln't get too jaded,
I woun't go back to the minimum wage.---Lyrics submitted by Soffia-Rose.
