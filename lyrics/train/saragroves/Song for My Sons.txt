This is a song for my sons for when they understand it
you know how life is full you know we couldn't plan it
your dad and i prayed for strength and understanding
for things we couldn't see or comprehend

this is a song from my heart a small refrain to hold you
for times when we're apart and i cannot console you
i can't say your life will always go like it should
but i can say that God is always good

and when the cold wind blows like i know it will
and when you feel alone like i know you will
and when the cold wind blows like i know it will

don't let your love grow
don't let your love grow
don't let your love grow cold

this is a song for my sons for when they understand it
you know how life is full you know we couldn't plan it
your dad and i prayed for strength and understanding
for things we couldn't see or comprehend

this is a song for you to carry in your pocket
take all our love with you in all the paths you walk in
be honest with yourself and don't forget to pray
and read your bible everyday

and when the cold wind blows like i know it will
and when you feel alone like i know you will
and when the cold wind blows like i know it will

don't let your love grow
don't let your love grow
don't let your love grow cold

don't let your love grow
don't let your love grow
don't let your love grow cold

This is a song for my sons for when they understand it
you know how life is full you know we couldn't plan it
your dad and i prayed for your strength and understanding
for things you cannot see or comprehend---Lyrics submitted by reannen.
