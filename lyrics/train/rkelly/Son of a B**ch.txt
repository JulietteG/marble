(R. Kelly talking)
Listen, I dont even want to sing this song.
Matter of fact, Im just gone talk through this.
But, Im gonna talk on notes.
But, what Imma gone be saying is the realist! Listen

[Verse 1]
(First, Ill) pop open a can of Red bull,
(Then, Ill) mix some Bev and pour it all over you.
Once I got your body tweaking,
Girl ill, drop to my knees and then Ill
(Then Ill) proceed on this mission to drive you wild,
Break out all the candles, oils, and hot towels.
I can feel you scratching my back while Im on top
Damn girl

[Chorus]
Said you know the sex is good when you making those faces,
And you know the sex is good when you going aw baby,
And you know the sex is good when your bodys having fits
Toes curling, screaming out son-of-a bitch!
Said you know the sex is good when were coming for the fourth time,
And you know the sex is good when cant get it off of your mind,
And you know the sex is good when you tell your best friend...
The room was steaming; I was screaming son-of-a-bitch!

[Verse 2]
Now two hours later were still going at it
Girl from the basement all the way to the attic.
Tease you up until you tell me Kell I wanna grab it,
And thats when Im gonna bend you over girl and let you have it!

[Chorus]
Said you know the sex is good when you making those faces,
And you know the sex is good when you going aw baby,
And you know the sex is good when your bodys having fits,
Toes curling, screaming out son-of-a bitch!
Said you know the six is good when were coming for the fourth time,
And you know the sex is good when cant get it off of your mind,
And you know the sex is good when you tell your best friend...
The room was steaming; I was screaming son-of-a-bitch!---Lyrics submitted by Monique.
