We always used to talk
real late after midnight
now the only thing we do on the phone is fight

Is there a way to
make this go away
i dont think that were gonna be okay

You were my hero and I was your sidekick
now you're gonna be the tear that cry when we split

Baby, I dont think that I can do this 
It seems so wrong makin up with only one kiss

Dont think that i could ever be 
able to stay with you now be
Cuz in time i know that well both see
we're not meant to be

Cuz you're the one who makes me cry
You would never ever save me

All your words are full of lies 
youre not the one i wanna marry

Cuz baby cant you see?
We're just a fantasy?
There's nothing we can do
were not the perfect two

We're not the perfect two
We're not the perfect two
Baby me and you
We're not the perfect two

I thought you were my prince
and i was your princess
Now that we're here
all of this is meaningless

I think i was a fool
for letting you fill the spaces
between my hands
and my diary pages

You used to be the one who made me happy
you used to tell me you were lucky
Now youre as cold as the winter weather
But i dont are cuz were no longer together

Dont think that could ever be able to stay with you know baby cuz in time i know that well both see
were not meant to be

Cuz you're the one who makes me cry
You would never ever save me



All your words are full of lies 
youre not the one i wanna marry

Cuz baby cant you see?
We're just a fantasy?
There's nothing we can do
were not the perfect two

We're not the perfect two
We're not the perfect two
Baby me and you
We're not the perfect twooooo ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhhhho

You know ill never never love you
Like the way i ever use to to
But you i will remember you

Now that im gonna smile 
It took me quite awhile 
to see wont walk down the aisle

Cuz you're the one who makes me cry
You would never ever save me

All your words are full of lies 
youre not the one i wanna marry

Cuz baby cant you see?
We're just a fantasy?
There's nothing we can do
were not the perfect two

We're not the perfect two
We're not the perfect two
Baby me and you
We're not the perfect two---Lyrics submitted by shenia.
