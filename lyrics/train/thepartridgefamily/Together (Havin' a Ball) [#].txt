Everybody's going places, (Seeing people doing things)
doing things (And showing off their smiling faces)
Look at all the smiling faces (Taking care of big and small)
Sing (And no business at all)

[Chorus:]
Havin' a ball
Doing their number
Having a ball
Getting it on
Together, Together, Together
Havin' a ball
Yeah we're havin' a ball
Havin' a ball
Yeah we're havin' a ball

People comin' people goin' (Everybody's going places)
Gettin' nowhere (Seeing people doing things)
People needin' people who can (And taking care of big and small)
Share (And no business at all)

[Chorus]

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Together, Together, Together, Together

Town to town we've found the sound that's
Happening (Seeing people doing things)
And what we've found is what we play (And taking care of big and
small)
And sing (And no business at all)

[Chorus]
