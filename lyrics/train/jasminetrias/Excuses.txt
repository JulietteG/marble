This I gotta tell ya so you can't even act surprised 
I'll be gone tomorrow 
It's too late to apologize 
I don't wanna beg you to treat me like you need to 
It's gonna hurt me but I gotta go 
I thought I could change ya 
But I really had to check myself 
I can't seem to change ya and I'm just going through hell 
I refuse to do it anymore 
What am I still here for if your heart ain't in it no more 

I can't make you love me 
Make you want me 
Ain't no excuses boy 
I'm about to lose it boy 
You're leaving me no choice 
There's no excuse at all 
I can't make you need me 
Make you happy 
Cuz you make excuses boy 
I'm about to lose it boy 
You're leaving me no choice 
And there's no excuse at all 

Why you want to play me like I don't know what's going on 
Calling you all day and you're not picking up your phone 
I don't have the patience to keep on waiting when I know its going nowhere 
You promised you would tell me if ever something might've changed 
You can keep your word because I know that it's just not the same 
So just be a man about it 
And tell me if your heart ain't in it no more 

I can't make you love me 
Make you want me 
Aint no excuses boy 
I'm about to lose it boy 
You're leaving me no choice 
There's no excuse at all 
I can't make you need me 
Make you happy 
Cuz you make excuses boy 
I'm about to lose it boy 
You're leaving me no choice 
And there's no excuse at all 

I can try to deny and that you're still mine 
Say one day that you'll come around 
But babe we can get it back 
Maybe we'll make it right 
But the love we've lost can't be found 
And all these excuses that are making so much time that I've wasted 
Tomorrow it'll all be over 
And all your days will be a little bit colder without me 

I can't make you love me 
Make you want me 
Ain't no excuses boy 
I'm about to lose it boy 
You're leaving me no choice 
There's no excuse at all 
Make you need me 
Make you happy 
Cuz you make excuses boy 
I'm about to lose it boy 
You're leaving me no choice 
And there's no excuse at all---Lyrics submitted by Whitney.
