Been getting tired of my motor running.
Feeling over heated cause my life keeps coming.
My hearts been troubled by the speed of love.

Searching the streets for a soul committee.
Talking ideas on lust and pity.
The fables I've found have no place at home.

[Chorus]
Well I, need you.
To want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth.
Say I, need you.
To want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth.
Yeah!

Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.
Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.

Well roll the dice.
Pay the price.
Dance with wolves in a pack of lies.
The blood we crave shall drive us all insane.

Yeah outerspace, it's a lovely place.
A long lost love in a flower vase.
Laying on the floor shattered, battered and bruised.

[Chorus]
Well I, need you.
To want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth.
Say I, need you.
To want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth.
Yeah!

Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.
Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.
Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.

I need you, to want me to hold me to tell me the truth.
Say I, need you. 
To want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth.
Yeah!

Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.
Ain't no party in a sad, sad city.
Hey!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
