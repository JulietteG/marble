All the sailors go
The best is yet to come
Rollin' in my fuego
I do my own stunts
I see guilty people
Angels blowing horns

Somedays it's just not worth gnawing through the straps
Freak out and throw stuff
World's greatest dad
I read a little book about Vlad the Impaler
Vlad the Impaler, Vlad the Impaler

WOAAAAAH

Inside your fuego
We keep it rolling

I asked Diego
If it was stolen

Rollin' (fuego)

Diego (stolen)---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
