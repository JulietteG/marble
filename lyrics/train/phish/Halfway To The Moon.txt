I close my eyes as the curtain draws
Ear toward the tracks
Ever after the rhythm soars
Flying right past the facts
Hold the times that are brought to light
Keep the pattern 'till June
Make the other side right
Half the way to the moon

I'm old enough to repeat myself
Not trying to defend
I'm holding onto the thoughts I have
Back to circles again
Holding back the emotions now
Help me carry this tune
All aboard for the tour
Riding next to the truth

I found a place that can't exlain
In my state of mind
I move myself as I search the stone
For any lines to unwind
I grabbed my change when I thought I could
And left my compass behind
Did my best to define
The reason inside the rhyme

A little star that reveals  itself 
Little matter of time
Holding onto the wheel I know
Back to circles I'll find
Takes me back to some days gone by and
Keep the pattern 'till June
Make the other side right
Half the way to the moon---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
