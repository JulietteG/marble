Happy happy oh my friend 
Blow out candles once again 
Leave the presents all inside 
Take my hand and let's take a ride 

Backwards down the number line 
You were eight and I was nine 
Do you know what happened then 
Do you know why we're still friends 

Laughing all these many years 
We've pushed through hardships tasted tears 
We made a promise one to keep 
I can still recite it in my sleep 

Every time a birthday comes 
Call your friend and sing a song 
Or whisper it in to his ears 
Or write it down just don't miss a year 

You decide what it contains 
How long it goes 
But this remains 
The only rule is it begins 
Happy happy oh my friend 

You decide what it contains 
How long it goes 
But this remains 
The only rule is it begins

And when I see you coming
Down the line with eyes wide open
Somewhere in between the past and future
Where you drift in time and you can't see a different point of view

And all my friends come 
Backwards down the number line 

All my friends come 
Backwards down the number line 

All my friends come 
Backwards down the number line 

All my friends 

You decide what it contains 
How long it goes 
But this remains 
The only rule is it begins 
Happy happy oh my friend 

You decide what it contains 
How long it goes 
But this remains 
The only rule is it begins 

And all my friends come 
Backwards down the number line---Lyrics submitted by Diver City.
