Ooh, oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, 
Ooh, oh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, (Give it to me) 
Ooh, oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, 
Ooh, oh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, (Give it to me) 

I'm so addicted 
To the lovin that you're feeding to me 
Can't do without it 
This feeling's got me weak in the knees 
Body's in withdrawal 
Everytime you take it away 
Can't you hear me callin' 
Begging you to come out and play? 

Chorus: 
So baby come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
I'm cravin' for you 
I'm missin' you like candy 

Sweet, sweet lovin' 
Got me going to the extreme 
Won't go without it 
This vibe has got a hold on me 
Satisfying, baby 
Let me show you what I'm made of 
No doubt about it boy 
Got me feeling crazy 
Can't get enough 

Baby, baby, baby, won't you come to me 
Show me who you are 
Sweet to me 
Like sugar to my heart 
I'm cravin' for you 
I'm missin' you like candy 

CHORUS 1x 

Spoken: 
You know who you are 
Your love's as sweet as candy 
I'll be forever yours 
Love always, Mandy 

Boy I'm cravin' 
Missin' you like candy 


CHORUS 2x---Lyrics submitted by maai.
