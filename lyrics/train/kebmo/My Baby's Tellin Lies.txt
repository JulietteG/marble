My baby's telling lies again
That's the way it's always been
She got a body that was built for sin
My baby's telling lies again

I knew she was more that I could handle
All I ever hope is to...
But in the night at the light candle
She loves me right out of my mind
And in the morning she's as meansst as she can be
Sais she wich that she had never, ever met me

My baby's telling lies again
That's the way it's always been
She got a body that was built for sin
My baby's telling lies again

So turned, she's not a lady
And I knew that camming in
I've been happy, all I wanna do is love
She's crazy, but she's my best friend
She thinks that money growes on a tree
Sais she never, ever been in love with me

My baby's telling lies again
That's the way it's always been
She got a body that was built for sin
My baby's telling lies again

She loves me, but she never let's me know
She's mean, but she's not evil
And I just can' let het go

My baby's telling lies again
That's the way it's always been
Got a body that was built for sin
My baby's telling lies again

She's mean, she's not evil
My baby's telling lies again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
