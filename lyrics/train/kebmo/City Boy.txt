 I hear a voice, I hear the sound
The sound of my shoes, shuffling on out of town
Too many people, too many cars
Take me to Memphis, Mercury, or Mars

'Cause I wanna go
Where the buffalo roam
Just a city boy
Looking for a home

I can't breathe, can't see
The city's no place for me
I can't seem to find my way
Just existing from day to day

But I want to be
Where my soul can run free
I'm just a city boy
Looking for a home

Now, I don't wanna be no prisoner
And l sure don't wanna be no slave
Want look out at night and see stars in the sky
The Little Dipper and the milky way

I can't sleep, it's too loud
Everywhere, where l go, you know there seems to be a crowd
Tired of all these concrete streets
I want to feel the dirt up under my feet

I wanna go
Where where the buffalo roam
I'm just a city boy
Looking for a home

I wanna go
Where where the buffalo roam
I'm just a city boy
Looking for a home

I'm just a city boy
Looking for a home
City boy
Looking for---
