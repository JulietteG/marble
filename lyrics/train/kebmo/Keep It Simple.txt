Two cars, three kids, six phones
A whole lot of confusion up here in my home
Five-hundred stations on the TV screen
Five-hundred versions of the same ol' thing

Y'all know it's crazy
And it's drivin' me insane
Well, I don't wanna be a superman
I just wanna go somewhere, use my hands
And keep it simple
Oh real simple

You know I called my doctor on the telephone
The lines were open, but there was nobody home
Press one, press two, press pound, press three
Why can't somebody just pick up the phone and talk to me?

Y'all know it's crazy
You know it's driving me insane 
I don't wanna be a superman
I just wanna go somewhere, use my hands
And keep it simple
(Yes I do)
Real simple

(Play the blues)

Well I went down to the local coffee store
The menu went from the ceiling all the way down to the floor
Decaf, cappuccino, or latte said the cashier
I said gimme a small cup of coffee and let me get the hell up outta here

Y'all know it's crazy
Oh it's driving me insane
Well, I don't wanna be a superman
I just wanna go somewhere, use my hands 
And keep it simple
Oh lord, real simple

Well now I don't wanna be a superman
I just wanna go somewhere, use my hands
And keep it simple
Real simple
Real simple---
