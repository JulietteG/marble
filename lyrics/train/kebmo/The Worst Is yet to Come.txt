Nobody really thinks about it
When they hear the words
For better or worse
For better or worse

It's something that the preacher says
On your wedding day
For better or worse
For better or worse

So what do we do now?
It's getting harder every day
Do we try and work it out?
Or just turn and walk away?

I'm willing, if you're willing
Dig deep and stay up all night
I listen, if you listen
No matter how hard it hurts
For better or worse
For better or worse

Thought about leaving
But how's to say
It would be better or worse
Better or worse

But even if I took the chance
I'll just be looking for you
Would it be better or worse?
Better or worse?

So what do you think
That we really gonna find?
I bet we gonna lose
If we leave it all behind

I'm willing, if you're willing
Dig deep and stay up all night
I listen, if you listen
No matter how hard it hurts
For better or worse
For better or worse

I admit I've been stubborn
And I've been stupid
And I've shut you out
But baby I'm here now

I'm willing, if you're willing
Dig deep and stay up all night
I listen, if you listen
No matter how hard it hurts
Oh yeah

I'm willing, if you're willing
Dig deep and stay up all night
I listen, if you listen
No matter how hard it hurts
For better or worse
For better or worse
For better or worse
For better or worse---
