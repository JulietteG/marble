In the mornin', I get the fever
And when you touch me, sweet and tender
There's one thing, I remember
That your love, means everythin to me
And your love, is all I'll ever need

Like a flower, you look pretty
You take a sunshine, and you turn it into lovely
You're the best thing, in the world
That's right, your love means everything to me
Your love, is all I'll ever need

Got the vapours, every hour
Cuz when I see you, I got to take a cold shower
You're like chocolate, you make me crazy
Ooh your love, means everything to me, ooh girl
Your love, is all I'll ever need

Your love, is everything to me
Your love, your love, your love, is all I'll ever need
