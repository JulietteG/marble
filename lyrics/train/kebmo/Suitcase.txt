I got a suitcase, I take it everywhere I go
I got a suitcase baby, I take it everywhere I go
It's just a big old bag of trouble, trouble all I know

I met a girl, fell in love
And our love was true
I met a girl, fell in love
Ooh, our love was true

Well and I found out, Lord she had a big old suitcase
too
Lord, so we put our bags together, made a home for two
People we put our bags together, you know made a home
for two
Then along came the children, gave them all a suitcase
too

Well the house got too small, the bags got too big
We was holdin'on to everythin', whatever said or did
Well I complained about the salt, in the black eyed
peas
Then she put her hand on her hip and she told me to
leave
And take my suitcase, and get on out that door
You gonna hear from my lawyer, I can't take it no more

I had to get down on my knees, beg her to let me stay
I had to get down on my knees and beg her to let me
stay
I said baby, we got a whole lot of baggage
Let's call somebody and have it hauled all away

I got a suitcase, I take it everywhere I go
People I got a suitcase, I take it everywhere I go
It's a big old bag of trouble, I don't need no more---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
