You been wishin' 
All of your life 
For a woman that'll love you 
Tell the truth and treat you right 
And you been lonely 
Cryin' yourself to sleep 
Now you got a girl who can rock your world 
Put a smile on your face 
And a love you're gonna keep it, now 

This is the beginning 
Are you ready to learn? 
To love somebody for a lifetime 
Wake up, it's your turn 

So tell me now that you got her 
The whole enchilada 
Now that you got her 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
Are you gonna be any better 
Than the man you had to be to get her 
Oh, now that you got her 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
Oh, yeah 

Are you ready? 
To get involved 
Where your participation is needed 
To get things resolved 
We all get used to livin' by ourselves 
But now you're dealing with a situation 
That involves someone else 

But it's about to get different 
You're gonna need a new device 
'Cause she's gonna open up your mind 
And open up your life 

So tell me now that you got her 
The whole enchilada 
Now that you got her 
What you gonna do? 
Are you gonna be any better 
Than the man you had to be to get her 
Oh, now that you got her 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do? 

This is the beginning 
Are you ready to learn? 
To love somebody for a lifetime 
Wake up, it's your turn 
It's all you, babe 

Tell me now that you got her 
The whole enchilada 
Now that you got her 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
Are you gonna be any better 
Than the man you had to be to get her 
Oh, now that you got her 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do? 

Now, now that you got her 
The whole enchilada (What you gonna do?) 
Now that you got her 
What you gonna, what you gonna do? 
Are you gonna be any better 
Than the man you had to be to get her 
Oh, now that you got her 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
(Now that you got her, the whole enchilada) 
Whole enchilada 
Tell me, now (now that you got her) 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
Are you gonna be any better 
Than the man you had to be to get her...---
