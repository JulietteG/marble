You say, 
You want to get over.
What are you gonna do?
Watch the world go by
In a corner of the room?
I know,
None of my business.
But there's something I need to say,
If you could see you
The way I see you
You'd start flying on your own.
Step aside and . . .
Refrain:
Let your light shine.
Let your love show
It's a short ride
Down the long road.
When the rains come 
And the winds blow
Let your light shine
Wherever you go.
This world is ready and waiting
For you to break on through.
It's time to recognize,
To realize, 
You're the only one like you.
Step on up,
Step into your greatness. 
Don't be afraid.
There's a place where you will rise up to;
No one else could do what you do.
Get out of the way
Refrain
Get out of the way---Lyrics submitted by Mindy.
