I don't care much about cocaine
And you'll never see me jumpin' out no airplane
Wine and whisky don't give me no thrill
And I don't care nothin' about them nasty little pills
But women, now that's a whole nutha thang

You won't see me wastin' all the money I made
And you ain't gon' ever see me drivin' no escalade
If you're lookin' for a handout, you're wastin' your time
I wouldn't give a crutch to a cripple
I wouldn't give a bum a dime
But women, ooh that's a whole nutha thang

Now when you talk about the women, that's a whole nutha thang
I like them big, tall, short, fat, thin and in between
I like'em when they ??? oh and I like'em when they're mean
I like'em when they whisper, but I love'em when they scream oooh

I don't buy stock, I don't place no bets
I won't be smokin' none of them stinky cigarettes
Only one thing make me throw my money away
And that's a little TLC and a little T&A;
But women, yeah that's a whole nutha thang
Women, women, women, that's a whole nutha thing
(play the blues somebody...)

Yeah, cause women, that's a whole nutha thang---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
