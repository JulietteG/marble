Not too long ago you were somebody there
I didnt know i wanted to run away
I wanted so much to stay ah ha
I remember wondering if this was real or fantasy
Its some how it sparks to me
Everything ill ever meet

Cause in your eyes i see such magic
Its all about magic
Ill be Missing you

I can see you smiling in the Darkness of our room
Even though youre miles away
You are far from me

I can hear your laughter in my dreams at night
And in my dreams your are close to me
And we dont need anything

And in my dreams we live for magic
All about magic
Ill be Missing you

And we are gone away
Ive got your photograph for company
Telephone rings every night
Making sure that im away

And we can dream like enough magic
And when im waiting
Ill be Missing  you
Cause in your eyes i see such magic
Its all about magic
Ill be Missing you
tonight

Ill be Missing you
Ill be Missing you---Lyrics submitted by juan.
