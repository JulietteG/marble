It started with the hayloft a-creakin'.
Yeah, it just started in the hayloft.
With his long johns on, Pop went a-creepin'
Out to the barn, out to the hay.

Young lovers and they are not sleeping.
Young lovers in the hayloft.
With his gun turned on, Pop went a-creepin'
Out to the barn up to the hay.

With his long tall gun, Pop went a-creepin'.
