The boy only wanted to give mother something and all of her roses had bloomed. Looking at him as he came rushing in with them knowing her roses were doomed. All she could see were some thorns buried deep and tears that he cried as she tended his wounds. And she knew it was love, it was one she could understand, he was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands.

He still remembers that night as a child on his mother's knee. She held him close as she opened her bible and quietly started to read. Seeing a picture of Jesus he cried out "Mama he's got some scars just like me." And he knew it was love, it was one he could understand, he was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands.

Now the boys grown and moved out on his own. When Uncle Sam comes along. A foreign affair but our young men are there, and look at his number drawn. It wasn't that long till our hero was gone. He gave to a friend what he learned from the cross. But they knew it was love, it was one they could understand, he was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands.---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
