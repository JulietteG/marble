It's time to bid this whole world goodbye.
Oh, glory, time to fly away.
We'll meet our savior in the sky.
Hallelujah, the 21st of May.

Sinner, heed these words of mine
'Bout the coming Judgment Day.
Yes, the end is drawing nigh.
Hallelujah, the 21st of May.

They laughed while Noah built his boat,
Then cried when came the rain.
They mock me now, but I will float
On the 21st of May.

Well, I've never been so sure
And I've never led no one astray.
'Cept in the fall of '94.
But Hallelujah, the 21st of May.

They laughed while Noah built his boat,
Then cried when came the rain.
They mock me now, but I will float
On the 21st of May.
They mock me now, but I will float
On the 21st of May.

Hallelujah, the 21st of May.---
