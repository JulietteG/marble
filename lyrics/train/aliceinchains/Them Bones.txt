I, I, I
I believe, them bones are me
Some say, were born into the grave

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol 
Pile of them bones

I, I, I
Dust rise, right on over my time
Empty, fossil of the new scene

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol 
Pile of them bones

Dont do, bad dream come true
I lied, dear God under red sky

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol 
Pile of them
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol 
Pile of them
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol 
Pile of them bones---Lyrics submitted by mike.
