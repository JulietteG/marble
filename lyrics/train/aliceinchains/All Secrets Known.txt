Hope,
A new beginning,
Time,
Time to start living

Like just before we died

(Chorus)
There's no going back
To the place
We started from

Hurt,
Falling through fingers
Trust,
Trust in the feeling

There's something left inside

(Chorus)

All secrets known...

Calm,
All wounds are healing
Strong,
Truth is worth saving

I want to feel alive

(Chorus)

All secrets known...---Lyrics submitted by Travis.
