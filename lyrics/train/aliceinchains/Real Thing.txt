I messed around as a little boy
I grew up and made the blade my new toy
Friends said boy with what you're screwin' around
I said don't concern yourselves
And just gimme another blast

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more

Even if you said just one more
I won't leave you alone, ooh...

I grew up, went into rehab
You know the doctors never did me no good
They said son, you're gonna be a new man
I said thank you very much
And can I borrow fifty bucks?

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more

Even if you said just one more
I won't leave you alone

'Cause I'm goin' down the steps on a white line
Goin' down the steps on a white line
Goin' down the steps on a white line straight to nowhere

I messed around as a little boy
I grew up and made the blade my new toy
Friends said boy with what you're fuckin' around
I said oh my god
And here we go again

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more, no more

Even if you said just one more
I won't leave you alone

'Cause I'm goin' down the steps on a white line
Goin' down the steps on a white line
Goin' down the steps on a white line straight to nowhere

Follow me down!
