Sat Sufferin 
I knew him when 
Fair weather friends of mine 

Try not to think 
I merely blink 
Hope to wish away the lies... ayeayeayeaye

Can you protect me when I'm a wrecked 
I pretend you're still alive 
ayeayeayeaye 
Yeah Yeah

(2x... oooo... denied...all insideall the lies...) 

I choose the  day
One damp and gray
Thick fog that hide our smiles 

Clear all your sins 
Get born again 
Just repeat a couple lies 

Ayeayeayeaye
Lies
Yeah Yeah

(oooo... denied...all insideall the lies...) 

Can you protect me when I'm a wrecked 
I pretend youre still alive 

I choose the  day
One damp and gray 
thick fog that hide our smiles 

Sat Suffferin 
(oooo... denied...all insideall the lies...) 
Get born again 
(oooo... denied...all insideall the lies...)---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
