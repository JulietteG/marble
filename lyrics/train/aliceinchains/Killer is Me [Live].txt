Don't need a gun
Pointed at me
No need to run
The killer is me
The killer is me

So the sun
Shines upon me
I'm havin fun
The killer is me

Insane the mind
In the name of me
Can't find the time
To let things be

Insane the mind
In the name of me
Can't find the time
To let things be
Let things be

Oh yeah... can I start over
Oh yeah... can I start over
And get over it

So the sun
Shines upon me
I'm havin fun
The killer is me
The killer is me
The killer is me

Oh yeah... can I start over
Oh yeah... can I start over
And get over it

Let things be---Lyrics submitted by Joe Valenzuela.
