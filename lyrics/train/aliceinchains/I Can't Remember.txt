Turn...

Turn around, you say
'Scuse the 'tude but I haven't eaten today
And my eyes are turnin' grey 
(What's your name?)

I can't remember
I can't remember...

Bring me down, you try
Feel the pain and keep it all in 'til you die
Without eyes, you cannot cry
(Who's to blame?)

I can't remember
I can't

Remember identity
The pictures in my mind from screamin' at me
And mama, mama, ooh
My angry brains of infancy!

Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe
Down your throat and steal your energy
Took everything but my will to be
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed!

I...
I am alive!---Lyrics submitted by Thanatos.
