I dont wanna feel no more
its easier to keep falling
in my tensions of pain

emptiness all tomorrows haunted by your ghost
lay down, black gives way to blue
lay down, i'll remember you

fading out by design
consciously avoiding changes
curtains drawn now its done

silence sing all tomorrows forcing i got back
lay down, black gives way to blue
lay down, i"ll remember you---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlyn.
