I've been a desperate man
I've been sheltered by a lonely dream
There's a stranger here
Looking back above the bathroom sink

Every night I throw you out
Leave you stranded on the boulevard
You know that I use you up
I used you like I used a mop

Well, the band's singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're all gone, yeah, you're all gone

If I could have a simple love
How would it feel and what would it mean?
I'd only trade you away
For Mary Magdalene

Oh, it wouldn't make me insane
And it would make me the king
And I wouldn't have to wait
Wait around for the real thing

Well, the band's singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're all gone, yeah, you're all gone

Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're all gone, oh yeah yeah, hey

Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah---
