I cant talk
My mind is so blank
So going for a walk
Ive got nothing left to say

I cant see
The darkness on the rise
Ill be waiting here
Until the under tide

All my life
Been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good

I was playing dead
Doesnt make a sound
Holding my breath
Going underground
So I cant talk
I got nothing to say
Its like theres no tomorrow
Barely yesterday

All my life
Been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good

All my life
Been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everybody back
Round and round
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good

Gimme something good
Gimme something good
till---
