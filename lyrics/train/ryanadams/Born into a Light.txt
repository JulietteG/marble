For everything that's wrong there is a worry, man
There is a reason why
We just don't understand but will, you got to keep the faith
Be patient oh the past is just a memory and heal.
Heal,you evangel,heal inside eventually


We Were born into a light
We were born a light
We were born into a light

For everyone alone I wish you faith and hope
And all the strength to cope
To be your own best friend have confidence and keep the faith
Be patient oh the past is just a memory and heal
Heal,you evangel,heal inside eventually

We were born into a light
We were born into a light
We were born a light
We were born into a light
The Lights, The Lights....
Not the lights---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
