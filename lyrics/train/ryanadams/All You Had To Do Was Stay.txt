People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say that you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
Stay, hey
Now you say you want it back
Now it's just too late
Well, it could have been easy
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
People like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

Stay, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
Stay, hey
Now you say you want it back
It's just too late
Well, it could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
Well, it could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
Could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
Stay, all you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay---
