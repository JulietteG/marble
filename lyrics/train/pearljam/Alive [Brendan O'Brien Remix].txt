Stop, she says.  Have I got a little story for you,
What you thought was your daddy was nothing but.
While you were sitting home alone at age thirteen,
Your real daddy was dying.
Sorry you didn't see him, but i'm glad we talked.

Oh I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive.
Hey oh...

Lost she walks slowly across a young man's room,
She said i'm ready for you.
Why I can't remember anything to this very day, 
Except blood, blood oh you know when,
Now I can't see, I just stay.

Oh I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive.

Is something wrong she said, of course there is.
Your still alive she said, but do I deserve to be.
Is that the question, and if so, if so,
Who answers,  who answers...

I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive. 
Hey I, i'm still alive.
Hey I, i'm still alive, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Billy.
