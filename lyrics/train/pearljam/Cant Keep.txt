I wanna shake, I wanna wind out
I wanna leave this mind and shout
I've lived all this life like an ocean in disguise
I dont live forever, you Cant Keep me here

I wanna race with the sundown
I wanna last breath I dont let out
Forgive every being, the bad feeling, its just me
I wont wait for answers, you Cant Keep me here

I wanna rise and say a goodnight
I wanna take a look on the other side
I've lived all these lives, its been wonderful tonight
I will live forever, you Cant Keep me here---Lyrics submitted by William.
