Got All Night, plenty of time
Take these chains from my eyes
So alive, gettin it prime
Take 'em there before you die
Why be satisfied, we've got All Night

Please be here, top of the stairs
No place for the president
Build some fears, left outside
Fuck, be content to just get by
Why be satisfied, we've got All Night

You scream and wail, you see who cares
Scream and wail, see who cares

Life has nothing to do with killing time
So why be satisfied, we've got All Night
We've got All Night
We've got All Night---Lyrics submitted by William.
