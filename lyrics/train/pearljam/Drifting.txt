Driftin, driftin, driftin away
I got myself a mansion then I gave it away
Its not the world thats heavy, just the things that you save
And I'm driftin, driftin away

Driftin, driftin, driftin along
I rid myself of worries and my worries went on
I only run when I want to and I sleep like a dog
I'm drifitn, driftin along

Oh, the suitcoats say there is money to be made
They get so excited nothing gets in their way
My road it may be lonely just because its not paved
Its good for driftin, driftin away
Alright

Oh, the suitcoats say there is money to be made
They get so excited nothing gets in their way
My road it may be lonely just because its not paved
Its good for driftin, driftin away

Driftin, driftin, driftin oh 
I feel like goin back there but never for long
I sometimes wonder if they know that I'm gone
I'm driftin, driftin along

Driftin, driftin along
Driftin, driftin along---Lyrics submitted by William.
