If I keep holdin out will the light shine through
Under this broken roof its only rain that I feel
I've been wishin out the days, oh, oh, oh 
Come Back

I have been plannin out all that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away know that I still remain true
I've been wishin out the days
Please say if you hadn't a gone now, I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are, oh, oh, Come Back

And these days, they linger on, yeah
And in the night I've been waitin for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep

If I dont fall apart, will my memory stay clear
So you had to go, and I had to remain here
But the strangest thing today, so far away
And yet you feel so close, and I'm not gonna question it any other way
There must be an open door for you, oh, oh, oh to Come Back

And the days, linger on, yeah
And every night, what I'm waitin for
Is the real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
And sometimes you're there and you're talkin back to me
And come the mornin I could swear that you're next to me and its ok
Its ok, its ok

I'll be here, Come Back, Come Back
I, I'll be here, Come Back, Come Back
Oh, I'll be here, Come Back, Come Back---Lyrics submitted by William.
