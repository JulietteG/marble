Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what you done?'
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one
You like cutting up and carrying on you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one that gets it right
You'd better know when you're swinging 'round the room
Looks like magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin' no sir no dancin' today

I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothing better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when i'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn with you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors it'd make a blind man so confused
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose?

I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around i'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin' no sir no dancin' today

I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothing better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when i'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn with you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer lights

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin' no sir no dancin' today

I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothing better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when i'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn with you---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
