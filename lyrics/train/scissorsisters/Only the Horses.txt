I know you didnt realize
That the city was gone
You thought there would be advertisements
To give you something to go on

So we search the sky
For any flashing signs
Weve gone too far beyond
The border its just you and I
And if this is the end
Its the best place Ive ever been
It feels so good to just
Get lost sometimes

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
Theyll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Tonight
Tonight

We cant escape the basic facts
How cold it can get
Theres nothing to protect ourselves
When the rain gets us wet

So Ill just tell you now
This is our final bow
If you dont know the way to
Hold me let me show you how
And if this is the end
Its the best place Ive ever been
It feels so good to just
Get lost sometimes

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
Theyll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Tonight
Tonight

Only the horses
Can find us tonight
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Our tracks they will follow
Theyll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses
Can bring us back home
Tonight---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
