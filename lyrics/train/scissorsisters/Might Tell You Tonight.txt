When you're quiet, but your eyes
Are saying everything I need to know
I want to burrow like a sparrow
Dodging alley cats and whiskers
Why do we talk in whispers?
Is it painful hearing voices ring
So early in the morning?

I've been waiting for the day
Where I can throw away these numbers
That line my dresser drawers and cupboards
Start me over
Life seems so much slower
With your toothbrush by the mirror
Can I make it any clearer?

And I just might say it tonight
I just might say it tonight
And I just might tell you tonight
That I love you
And you should stay all my life

They'll tell you that you'll maybe make it
If you just cut your clothes and change your hair
But I wont fuss and moan
About what you wear
I feel so much better
When I read your dirty letters
Just wear your sweaters in the winter
Cause I wouldn't want you to get cold
I hope that we're together when we're old
I would have sold all my possessions
Never took piano lessons
But baby you're a grand
And I will learn to play the good notes
And tune you up the best I can

And I might just say it tonight
I might just say it tonight
And I just might tell you tonight
That I love you
And you should stay all my life

And I just might say it tonight
I might just say it tonight
And I just might tell you tonight
That I love you
And you should stay all my life---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
