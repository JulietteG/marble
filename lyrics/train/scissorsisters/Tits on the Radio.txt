Creamsicle sky
While the sun sets in the west
Where are the queers on the piers?
Heard they gave it their best
Now they got jobs at a local fast food chain
Flippin' tricks for the burger
Since Lady M jacked their fame
Flippin' tricks for the burger
Since Lady M jacked their fame

Cause you can't see tits on the radio
I'll give you five fingers 
For a one man show
Fasten those pants for the lap dance
Take a shot now this may be your last chance

There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no
There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no
There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no
There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no

Dark room Danny can't see
With the lights turned out
Black haired tranny counts sheep
With her bed turned down
But the bed's in Jersey
And the sheep's on a farm
Dark room Danny hears police alarm
Dark room Danny can't see
With the lights turned out
Dark room Danny can't see
With the lights turned out

Cause you can't see tits on the radio
I'll give you five fingers 
For a one man show
Fasten those pants for the lap dance
Take a shot now this may be your last chance

There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no
There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no
There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no
There ain't no tits on the radio Oh no

Cause you can't see tits on the radio
I'll give you five fingers
For a one man show
Fasten those pants for the lap dance
Take a shot now this may be your last chance---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
