There's an urgency I'm feeling for the first time
It's all mine
Do we dream about each other at the same time?
All night
This might be the only way to talk to you
That's right
It's your ears with the sound that I walk into
Your mind

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly blown a fuse?
Is it a chemical that makes this moment true?
Is it the music that connects me to you?

There's a way to get together then I'm gone away
One day
It's a place that all that matters are the notes you play
I say
Simple pleasures when I'm listening it gets me by
Won't lie
When you're singing I'll be with you 'til the exit time
We shine

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly blown a fuse?
Is it a chemical that makes this moment true?
Is it the music that connects me to you?

Here I was awaiting
Praying for the muse
I'm finally awake and you have
Left me less confused
Maybe now
You will hear me now
I'm just in love
In love with your sound

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly blown a fuse?
Is it a chemical that makes this moment true?
Is it the music that connects me to you?

Your song it gets me by
When you're singing I'll be with you 'til the exit time---Lyrics submitted by Joann.
