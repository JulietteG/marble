It's obvious that my heart beats for you.
GO!
Lets Go! Go!

I need you here but your always so far away.
I call you up but you know its just never the same
cuz being closer to you is my sweetest escape
it's all i needed
I need you here but your always so far away.

This is our night 
the look in your eyes says we can go all the way
Been losin my mind 
broken inside
i want you to take my breath away
Its obvious that my heart beats for you
beats for you, beats for you
just let go tonite
were so close tonite.

I need you here but your out there on your own
Do you still look like the pictures in my telephone?
Hiding out in your room we can be alone
laughin out loud
you need me here but im always so far away

This is our night 
the look in your eyes says we can go all the way
Been losin my mind 
broken inside
i want you to take my breath away
Its obvious that my heart beats for you
beats for you beats for you
Its obvious that my heart beats for you
just let go tonite
we're so close tonite.
just let go tonite
we're so close tonite.

This is our night 
look in my eyes we can go all the way
Been losin my mind 
broken inside
Take my breath away

This is our night 
the look in your eyes says we can go all the way
been losin my mind 
broken inside
i want you to take my breath away
Its obvious that my heart beats for you
beats for you beats for you
Its obvious that my heart beats for you
beats for you beats for you
Its obvious (Go) that my heart beats for you(Go, lets go go)
so obvious that my heart beats for you(Go, lets go go)

This is our night 
the look in your eyes says we can go all the way
been losin my mind 
broken inside
I want you to take my breath away
Its obvious that my heart beats for you
(Go) beats for you (Lets Go Go) beats for you
its obvious that my heart beats for you---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
