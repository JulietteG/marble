Somethings different
Something I can't explain
Can you feel it? Can you hear it?
The sound of heaven
Is pouring on us like rain.
Nothing is the same

[Chorus:]
Fresh anointing fall
Let it overflow
On every heart and soul
Holy Spirit come
Come and make us new
All we want is You, only You
You are all
Fresh anointing fall

Hands are lifted
We are singing Your name
Can you feel it? Can you hear it?
The song of freedom
Is spreading just like a flame
It can't be contained

[Repeat Chorus:]

Throw away the old
We are on our knees
Let the new unfold
God, we want to see Your fresh anointing fall

[Repeat Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by liz.
