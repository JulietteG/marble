Oh go
Possession of the mind is a terrible thing
It's a transformation with an urge to kill
Not the body of a man from earth
Not the face of the one you love, 'cause
Well, I turned into a Martian
Woah oh oh
I can't even recall my name
Woah oh oh
Times I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Well, I turned into a Martian today
I walk down city streets
On an unsuspecting human world
Inhuman in your midst
This world is mine to own, 'cause
Well, I turned into a Martian
Woah oh oh
Well, I believe that it's ok
Woah oh oh
Times I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Well, I turned into a Martian today
Go go
Well, I turned into a Martian
Woah oh oh
Well, I can't even recall my name
Woah oh oh
Times I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Turned into a Martian
Woah oh oh
Can't even recall my name
Oh, won't you tell me what the fuck is my name, Martian
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
