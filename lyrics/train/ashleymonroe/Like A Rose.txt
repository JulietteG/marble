I was only 13
When Daddy Died
Momma started drinking
And my brother just quit tryin
I'm still bouncing back
Heaven only knows
How I came out like a rose
Ran off with whats his name
When I turned 18
Got me out North Dakota
But it did not change a thing
I left it in the yard
All covered up with snow
And i came out like a rose

Sitting in this dinner
With a coffee in my hand
Waiting on a bus
To some promise land
I got a one way ticket
As far as it goes
And I came out like a Rose

So I'm headed south to anywhere
That aint so damn cold
Where i can warm my heart
And shake the chill from my bones
It took a while to get here
Its been a long hard road
And I came out like A ROSE

Sitting in this dinner
With a coffee in my hand
Waiting on a bus
To some promise land
I got a one way ticket
As far as it goes
And I came out like a Rose

It took a while to get here
Its been a long hard road
And i came out like a rose
ooooooooo---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Bell.
