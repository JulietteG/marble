You ain't Dolly 
And you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
And your a whole lot shorter
Let's dance all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
'Cause you ain't Dolly 
No, and you ain' t Porter

Well, I noticed you right off the bat in those cowboy boots
Who couldn't help but see you in that rhinestone suit
That's 'cause I'm the reigning queen of karaoke night
Well, if I get drunk enough to sing, hell I just might
Hey now don't you worry cowboy 'cause I'll get you through
We'll sing the cheating song just like they used to do

'Cause you ain't dolly 
And you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah, but your a whole lot shorter
Let's drink all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
'Cause you ain't Dolly 
And you ain't Porter

You'll probably see me country singing on The Voice someday
Yeah and I'm the guy they wrote about in 50 Shades Of Grey
Why don't you come on back to my place and you can have your way
Oh, baby that sounds tempting but I just can't stay
Oh, we won first prize cowboy, let's just split the dough
Honey, I will always love you, but we'll never know

'Cause you ain't Dolly 
Oh, and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller 
Yeah, but your a whole lot shorter
We danced all night 
And filled the jukebox full of quarters
'Cause you ain't Dolly 
And you ain't Porter

No, you ain't Dolly 
And you ain't Porter---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
