Wheels are gonna rust If they dont turn enough,
And so the story goes
Yeah, Ive been one of those worn and faded by the rain
Days are gonna fly
Draw lines around your eyes
Itll make you bitter, itll make you wise
its coming either way

Lost and found, Im better dancing when I dont look down
Hard times roll up but they dont hang around
I feel like Im on to something good
Im better moving on than going back
Ill ride this train till it runs out of track
I feel like Im on to something, something, something

I cant tell you how or where Im heading now
But, the winding of the road is steadying my soul
Feels like Im coming home
Oh yeah
Its in the wind thats blowing, its in the red wine
Lifes got its way of showing when its the right time

Lost and found, Im better dancing when I dont look down
Hard times roll up but they dont hang around
I feel like Im on to something good
Im better moving on than going back
Ill ride this train till it runs out of track
I feel like Im on to something, something, something

Oooh something, something
Oooh something, something

Lost and found, Im better dancing when I dont look down
Hard times roll up but they dont hang around
I feel like Im on to something good
Im better moving on than going back
Yeah, Ill ride this train till it runs out of track
I feel like Im on to something, something, something

Oh I feel like Im on
Oooh something, something
Feel like im onto something
Oooh something, something---
