[Verse 1:]
When I'm out on the road
Going from show to show
Told my homie Romeo 
How much I miss you so
I don't know how much longer it will be
I'm missing you, wanting you
And I really want to talk to you
Oh no I left my 2-way at home
Still sitting on the charger
Oh no my battery is dead on my cell phone
And I really want to call ya
J-Boog let me use your phone
Gotta call my baby girl back home
Let her know what she means to me
Cause we gotta be

[Chorus 2x:]
Your my (your my) angel (angel)
Your my (your my) heart girl
Cause your my everything (your everything I want in a woman)
Girl your my everything (your everything I need in a woman)

[Verse 2:]
I got cha on the phone
You're sayin you wish I was home
But then you flip the script
To put me in the wrong
And you think I'm lying when I been trying all day to talk to you
Juggling videos and photo shoots
Baby girl don't think that one minute goes by and I don't really want to call ya
Don't think that I'm screenin my calls or checkin my caller ID tryna dodge you girl
I'm tryna be all I can be
A young man in this industry
You mean the world to me
You are my everything, my...

[Chorus 2x:]
Your my (your my) angel (angel)
Your my (your my) heart girl
Cause your my everything (your everything I want in a woman)
Girl your my everything (your everything I need in a woman)

[Hook:]
Girl 
I want you to know
Nothing will come between you and me
Girl I want you to know
That you will always be 
My everything

[Rap:]
Baby girl I'm missing
Can't wait to get home so I can hold you
Pain is love when it comes to you
Faithful and true is what I stay to you
Your my homie when I chill with you
Throw on some sweats with some Nike shoes
Or get siddity for me
Louie skirt with a mini tee
See times has been hard for me
Being on the road without my wifey
Lookin at my watch the time goes by
Lookin at the skies the days goes by
Wishing on these days you could fly
Til the next time to be by my side
For you I ride
For you I lie
Me and you girl Bonnie and Clyde

[Chorus 2x:]
Your my (your my) angel (angel)
Your my (your my) heart girl
Cause your my everything (your everything I want in a woman)
Girl your my everything (your everything I need in a woman)---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
