[Chorus]
Let it rain, let it snow
Let it rain, let it snow 
All the problems let 'em go
Cause it's Christmas
Let it rain, let it snow
Let it rain, let it snow
All the problems let 'em go
Cause it's Christmas

[Verse 1]
It's Christmas Eve
I got my presents under the tree
I'm chillin' with my family
And that's all I need
Love everywhere
Mistletoe's under the stairway
It's raining, it's pouring 
My Christmas is snowing

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's time to eat
Got Grandmama cookin' them greens
Don't forget the macaroni and cheese
Cause this day is special to me
Little kids playing out in the snow
Homies at the table slappin' them bones
It's raining, it's pouring 
My Christmas is snowing 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Raz-B's Talk]
Man, it's finally Christmas 
It's been a good year ya' know 
Yeah
Feels good being with your family and everything
Havin' fun

[Repeat Chorus (2x)]---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
