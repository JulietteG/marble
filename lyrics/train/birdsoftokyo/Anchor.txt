We stayed afloat for just a while
We dared to swim alone
Dark water left your sinking heart to drown

I know it's much too late to try
You're never coming home
When the tide came in you left without a sound

We don't say, what we should say
We get lost beyond the answer we find loneliness
We pretend but in the end
We get lost beyond the answer we find loneliness

I never thought to hold you
I never thought that you might need an anchor
I never thought I'd lose you
I never thought that you might need an anchor

I've seen your face so many times
You've stood in front of me
It was all so real
It was all so hard to see

I'm chasing ghosts and alibis
Who speak so quietly
I can almost hear you say
Don't cry for me

Now This is all on me
Take my apology
I never though it would end
Like it did here

Now this is all on me
Take apology
It's all on me
This is all on me---
