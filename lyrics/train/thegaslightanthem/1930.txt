Give me mercy and a minute now,
I'm a bleed a little poison out,
I'm a cry a little river down
And then I'm setting this whole thing on fire,
And I'm burning up the night she died
And I'm putting every last picture aside
I'm gonna say what I need to say,
In my very last letter to you,
Cuz you always made it clear,
Said that you'd never be my pain.
So here's to you when you cried baby blues
And just paused a cool to refrain
And you said she was satisfied
And now this body's just waiting to die
And I could listen sometimes
But you said it's alright
It's just a whole lot harder alone.
But I wish you knew her now,
She's a better side of me now,
And I'm doing the best I can,
It's what you wanted,
And I sing like you were there
And I knew it was just how you would smile
Mary you looked just like
It was 1930 that night.
But hear the nights they will eat you alive,
But I won't give in tonight,
You said it's not worth my time
And not to record them,
And not to settle just a piece of mind
But I can wait it out all night,
And we keep on breathing [sigh]
But Mary I found a sound
And this heart keeps pouring it out
And the glory has come,
But it's probably gonna fade like the tattoo
That hides this shame and the reasons always fade
And the pain gets out some day
And I'm saying my goodbyes deeply wise
Cuz I don't know how to say
Stay still in the pain
But I wish you knew her now,
She's a better side of me now,
And I'm doing the best I can,
It's what you wanted,
And I sing like you were there
And I knew it was just how you smile
Mary you looked just like
It was 1930 that night
If I recall the last thing you said to me,
Before we broke up, before it took you from me,
And you said I love you more than the stars in the sky
But your aliveness just gets me tonight---
