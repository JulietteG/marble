And how much time do you think that we have?
If I wanted to, I could start over again
Let the good Light decide who she wants me to find
And I'll never let you drop another tear in my eye

Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man
Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man

And all my life, I've never had a chance
Don't you think I knew about all your pretty girlfriends?
But I waited for you, gave you time to decide
But you never saw it from anybody else's side

So I packed up my things and I faced up my doubts
You might think I will blow my head or back out
Never mind what you did, never mind what you like
I'll take it out to the streets for someone else to admire

Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man
Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man

Maybe time will tell you 
Why I got so much Hell to sell you
Please, please, understand me
Oh, you can't just dance around me

Baby, your work will love you
When I'm just not there to hold you
Baby, your boss can be your companion
But I just won't be there to stand for it
Not one moment will I stand for it

You found me singin'
oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man
Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man

Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man
Singin' oh-sha-la-la, oh-sha-la-la
Listen, Honey, here comes my man

Here comes my man  (x5)---Lyrics submitted by Angie Ritter.
