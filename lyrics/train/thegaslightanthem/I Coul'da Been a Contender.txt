I'm broke and I'm hungry, hard up and I'm lonely
I've been dancing on this killing floor for years
Of the few things I am certain, the captain of my burden
I'm sorry doll, you can never stop the rain

Once you said I was your hero, you would dance with me on a dime
We could spin the would right right right round,
And catch back up on the flip side
I was gonna get this real big engine,
I was gonna get them Broadway Stars
You were gonna be my Judy Garland,
We were gonna share your Tin Man heart

There's a dirty wind blowing, there's a storm front coming in
There's an S.O.S. on the seas tonight
Steady now, Steady now, solder hold fast now
It's heads or tails and heart attacks and broken dreams tonight

We used to drive all night, all over town
We'd go waltzing Matilda when Matilda came around
And I'd sing them blues to you

There's a dirty wind blowing, there's a storm front coming in
There's an S.O.S. on the seas tonight
Steady now, Steady now, solder hold fast now
It's heads or tails and heart attacks and broken dreams
And heart attacks and broken dreams
Atlantis is my only dream tonight---
