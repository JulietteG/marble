I see you try to pick a fight with me 
But I pack of bigger punch than you think 
Always thinking Im a deer in the headlights 
What I got for you will leave you blind 

You got your war
Awe-struck or nothing at all 
Keep wanting more and more and more 

You wont break me 
Nothin shaking me 
You can try 
But I wont fail 
Indestructible, Im invincible 
Standing strong like a force field 
Oh oh 
I am strong like a force field 
Oh oh 
I am strong like a force field 

Though your words 
Are like daggers in the dark 
Not close enough to pierce my heart 
Keep on, keep on trying to chase 
I'm not the mouse, see its okay 

You wont break me 
Nothin shaking me 
You can try 
But I wont fail 
Indestructible, Im invincible 
Standing strong like a force field 
Oh oh 
I am strong like a force field 
Oh oh 
I am strong like a force field---
