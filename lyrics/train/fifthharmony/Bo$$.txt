Everyday is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the nae nae
You're talkin' to a lady
I want a Kanye, not a Ray J
So that's a no-no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo beat like Dre-eh
I already know whatcha tryna say

You say that you're a baller
And I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up
Next

Working for the money
'Cause that's how my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect (boss)

Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy gettin' Oprah dollars (boss)

C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T
That's me, I'm confident
Don't want yo compliments
Use common sense
I'm on my Michelle Obama
Shh... Shut your mouth
Boy I think you know who run this house
I ain't thirsty for no bae
'Cause I already know whatcha tryna say

You say that you're a baller
And I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up
Next

Working for the money
'Cause that's how my mom taught me
So your ass better show me some respect (boss)

I pledge allegiance
To my independent girls in here
Ooh ooh baby
So if you is with us
Come on let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah yeaah

Uhum Uhum
Hey hey
UUh uuh
Uhum uhum
Hey hey
I see you

You say that you're a baller
And I see you tryna hola
But that ain't how I was brought up
Next

Working for the money
'Cause that's how my mom taught me
So your ass better show me some respect (boss)
