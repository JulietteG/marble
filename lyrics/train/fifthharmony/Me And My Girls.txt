And we play our favorite songs 
And we scream out all night long 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 

All the lights, turn them off 
It's too loud in here to talk 
I don't understand a word you say 

Gotta sleep but instead 
Karaoke on the bed 
Taking duck face selfies right and left 

We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it 
We don't care if people stare 
And when we wobble with it 

We get diva on it 
We get queen bee on it yeah 
We get Brittney, Demi, One Direction, Bieber on it 

And we play our favorite songs 
And we scream out all night long 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 
And we dance like no one's watching 
We crack up, booty poppin' 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 
Watch me now 
Me and my girls 

My voice is gone, got my favorite PJ's on 
Times like this don't always come along 
You're all I need, there's nowhere I'd rather be 
Then to have you crazy freaks with me 

We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it 
We don't care if people stare 
And when we wobble with it 

We get diva on it 
We get queen bee on it yeah 
We get britney, demi, one direction, bieber on it 

And we play our favorite songs 
And we scream out all night long 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 
And we dance like no one's watching 
We crack up, booty poppin' 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 
Watch me now 
Me and my girls 

Break it down 
Now break it down 
Now break it down 
Now break it down 

(repeat once) 

And we play our favorite songs 
And we scream out all night long 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 
And we dance like no one's watching 
We crack up, booty poppin' 
Like ooh ooh ooh 
When it's just me and my girls 
Watch me now.---Lyrics submitted by bridget savage.
