Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine we'll be cruisin' watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down
My top down

Camila:
From a small town cruisin' thru the big city
Where the fellas are cute and the girls are pretty
It's our world so you know it's going down
I ain't got a lotta money but I got a lotta style
what what

Ally:
Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine we'll be cruisin' watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down
My top down
