Lauren:
Always looking over my shoulder, 'cause I don't ever wanna miss you
I been thinking about you daily, I can't wait to see your face
I don't even know you, but I know that I can't wait to kiss you
Some I know when we finally lock eyes that you'll feel the same way

Baby you are the one I'm waiting for
