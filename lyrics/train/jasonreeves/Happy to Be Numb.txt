You can say what you like to me, 
But I might just sit and smile.
You can talk about anything,
And stay here for a while.
You can talk like poetry,
And whisper in my ear.
You can say the prettiest thing,
I could ever hear.

And I could be on, the surface of the sun.
I could be on, the barrel of a gun.
I could be on, the bottom of a ton.
I still think,
I wouldn't feel a thing without you.

So you are looking so honest
The wind all in your hair,
Just smiling at the ceiling,
You innocently stare.
I can say that you're everything I conjoured in my dreams,
Cause nothing in reality can be this real, it seems.

And I could be on, the surface of the sun.
I could be on, the barrel of a gun.
I could be on, the bottom of a ton.
I still think,
I wouldn't feel a thing without you.

I'm so happy to be numb,
To everything but your feelings and touch.
Baby, I'm so perfectly undone.
So don't you wise me up.
Yeah, yeah.

So you can say what you like to me,
But i might just sit and smile.
You can do about everything,
And stay here for a while.
We can watch the clouds gently drift across the sky.
Seeing all those elephants and turtles pass us by.

And I could be on, the sun.
Seeing your the one.
And you know I need you here.
You know I need you here.
My love, I'm so happy to be numb.
To everything but your feelings and touch.
