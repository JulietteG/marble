If I told you I wanted to talk to you
You know, you think I'm tryna holla at you
And maybe I am but
You wouldn't hear me out anyways would you?

Rather lose love than to move on
Never knowing what it feel like
Short days, long nights by the phone, no call

Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind
Got me goin' down that road
Heart made of stone, far away from home
Black woman you cold

Every problem that you ever had with
Another man I gotta face
Started off on thin ice
I'm still here but I can't skate

Slow sink, can't breath
No remorse, don't think
Listen to your friend, get another man
For a minute then repeat

Queen, you deserve the title
But she rejects what I give
While she nurse the wounds by them
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards
Nothing I'mma do's works, diary of a black girl

I wonder why I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
I'm down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out

I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
Wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out somehow

Raised by a momma who? Who?
Hate her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with, with
Saying, "Fuck a nigga quick, quick"

I'm just tryna be the one who never run
But you run away from me
Your girlfriends man cheat, cheat
Why not me the same thing
She can't see in me what I see in her
This pain she inherit can't be reversed

I can't even stay living in the shade
Of all the motherfuckers that played you
The irony in that is that I ain't even that
But you coulda been those pages

Wife, you deserve the label
But you been hurt before so you don't feel you're able
Tried them, didn't work, got impossible standards
Nothing that I ever do work, diary of a black girl

I wonder why I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
I'm down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out

I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
Wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out somehow

See all I wanna do is be relevant
Just tell me that I ever meant anything more
That you could ever see me and you in another light
But it's like the dark women indoors
In the darkest nights by the wrong man

See all of them have made you
Incapable of a first impression
What I do is I channel my aggression
With no cable or antenna

Just intentions to impress you if capable
Hoping that the material possessions
Can materialize to a better you

Cars, nothing I drive
Can drive you out of this state of mind
For such an ugly picture and
Money, nothing I buy
Can buy more time for your ears
To tell your heart to listen to it

Diamonds, a girls best friend is what they say
But believe me with the right allegiance
Shorty you gonna shine anyways
And everyday that goes by is
A couple more lines in her diary

The day before is better than the present
So anyone presented in her presence
Endorse these life sentences
No key for release, no reason to be around
Her minds in the clouds, she writes it all down in her diary

I wonder why I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all my tears
I'm down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out

I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
Wish I could live with no fear
I'm so down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out somehow
Somehow---Lyrics submitted by Amanda Alba.
