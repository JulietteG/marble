Now that the east winds chase my blues away
And the sun tries to bawl out tears 
Wont you come with me now 
There aint no time to lose
No more time to be running from our fears

The half moon shines
On the streets liquid rain
And a blanket of fog settles down

Yes the best sort of love 
Can wash away your pain 
And the best kind of answer 
Has no sound

No ringing bells, no thunder clapping 
No voices sweetly ringing down

Yes the best sort of love 
Will wash away our pain 
And the best kind of answer 
Has no sound.

Dont let this moment pass, without taking note
Its a dream that just falls to the ground
If I tried to explain 
The words would stick in my throat 
Yes the best kind of answer has no sound

No ringing bells, no thunder clapping 
No voices sweetly ringing down
Yes the best sort of love 
Will wash away our pain 
And the best kind of answer 
Has no sound.

Now the world is in spin it dont stop for no one
It just goes on endlessly round and round
I will tell you the truth before the rising of the sun
With an answer that has no sound---Lyrics submitted by Maria Lobo Martyris.
