We are rich nigger is a lot of money on the table
Hold up please let me roll up
You are the hoes that chose us
The nasty guys that knows her
Real nigger don't know her
But G hoes know her
Hold up when we roll up
... back when we roll up
I ain't worried about no nigger taking my bricks
But you sure worried about a nigga taking your bitch
Hold up please let me roll up
You are the hoes that chose us
The nasty guys that knows her

And all these niggers acting like they know me
I won't stop... check it out where can you show me...
Before throw me out let money control the nigger
But I control it and tell it go get
More they don't let me in the dope
And I know that shit fucked up cause I am coming at your door
And they like cash slow down but I don't see... ia m always on the go
And I keep relapsing niggers ain't no limit I won't...
Hold up these niggers ain't believing me... bitch this ain't no move with you
I know the reason they hate me
Then I wait
Hold up please let me roll up
You are the hoes that chose us
The nasty guys that knows her
Real nigger don't know her
But G hoes know her
Hold up when we roll up
... back when we roll up
I am like wait
I haven't heard about no nigger taking my bricks
With a... about my taking your bitch
Hold up please let me roll up
You are the hoes that chose us
The nasty guys that knows her

... back when we roll up
I am like wait
I haven't heard about no nigger taking my bricks
With a... about my taking your bitch
Hold up please let me roll up
You are the hoes that chose us
The nasty guys that knows her
