Never thought the day would come but here it is
Never thought I'd end like this but here I sit
Listening, listen in, listening
Static on the radio
How long have I been asleep?
All my dreams are buried deep
Beside my head there is a nose/Now there is so much to do
Reading the words I never spoke/Working hard for number two

Turn off the sound

They're at my door
Kicking down the door

Where were you when number two knocked off number one
I don't know---Lyrics submitted by Larry Marciano.
