She was seventeen
He was seventeen too
A couple kids in love
What could anybody do

But ten years down the road
Look at them now
They made it through some hard times 
Somehow

Love is ageless
Love is timeless
Love is always 
Deep inside us
Love is magic
And sometimes tragic
A gift that heaven 
Gladly gave us
Love is ageless

She was forty-one
He was forty-eight
Second time around
Makin up for some mistakes
But is touch is still a touch
And a kiss is still a kiss
They held each other close and sang
You must remember this

Love is ageless
Love is timeless
Love is always 
Gonna find us
Love is magic
And sometimes tragic
A gift that heaven 
Gladly gave us
Love is ageless

She was ninety-four
He was five years gone
But she felt the earth move
When she played their favorite song

Love is ageless
Love is timeless
Love is always 
Gonna find us
Love is magic
And sometimes tragic
Its a gift that heaven 
Gladly gave us
Love is ageless
Love is timeless
Love is always 
Deep inside us---Lyrics submitted by Saffron.
