First it comes on quiet creeping slow
Clever words and phrases only stain
I remain so lost and buried under everything that I need
When all I want is you

I've been here so very long and
Every word is calculated
Never questioned or debated

All these practiced poses
I could wreck it if I had to
But I'm the wreck so what would that do

My masterpiece will fall apart
It was over before the start

[Chorus]
If I burn out and slip away
This is just a part I portray
And this is just a part I portray

You're beautiful Can I hide in you a while
If this is just a part I portray
And this is just a part I portray

[Interlude]

They keep mostly to themselves
Don't make a sound in case they hear you
It only hurts me to be near you

Keep those tired eyes closed
Careful follow my instruction
And I will show you self destruction

This masterpiece is only mine
Entirely guilty by design

[Chorus]

Ahhhhhhh
Woahhhh

I just can't let it let it out
Oh I just can't let it out (x5)

Woahhh

[Guitar riff]
(Ohhhh)

If this is just a part I portray

You're beautiful 
Can I hide in you a while
You're beautiful

If this is just a part I portray
I don't kow how it got this way

Ahhhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
