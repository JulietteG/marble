You never really wanted it
You'll settle for a bit of it
We started with a big bang
And now it's comming back again

Hey, don't you feel it now?
My shiny side down
Hey, burning brighter still
And you're getting sick
And you're feeling it

It'll wear you down and wear you down
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong about it
Push

It started with a handgun
Loaded with excuses
I started faking it
And then we started breaking it
All the pieces used to fit
Using like it's going out of style
Maybe just a little while
And This will be the last time
Every time's the last time

Hey, don't you feel it now?
My shiny side down
Hey, burning brighter still
And you're getting stuck
And you fucked it up

It'll wear you down and wear you down
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong about it

Push

I regreted it
I regret a lot of things
I regreted it
I regret a lot of things

It'll wear you down and wear you down
(I regreted it)
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
(I regret a lot of things)
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
(I regreted it)
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong
(I regret a lot of things)
About it

(I regret a lot of things)
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
(I regreted it)
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong
(I regret a lot of things)

And you're feeling it
It'll wear you down and wear you down
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong about it
