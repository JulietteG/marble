this place is a hole but i don't want to go.
i wish we could stay here forever alone.
this time that we waste, but i still love your taste.
don't let him take me place don't just sit there.
sometimes i wish you would leave me.

i'm not sick of you yet, is that as good as it gets?
i'll just hide it, or i could slip into you
it's so easy to come back into you

i stared for awhile and waited for words.
seen but not heard and struggle to try.
my tongue's turning black but i'll take you back.
you're still the best more or less, i guess.
i guess
don't you leave me

i'm not sick of you yet, is that as good as it gets?
i'll just hide it, or i could slip into you
it's so easy to come back into you

it hurts me to say that it hurts me to stay
and it might be alright if you go
it hurts me to say that i want you to stay,
but it might be alright if you go
so leave me

i'm not sick of you yet, is that as good as it gets?
i'll just hide it, or i could slip into you
it's so easy to come
back into you

sometimes i think that the bitter in you and the quitter in me
is the better in you and the quitter in me.
the bitter in you and the quitter in me
is the better in you and the quitter in me.
the bitter in you and the quitter in me is bigger
than the both of us.---Lyrics submitted by Maggie.
