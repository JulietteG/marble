I lock the door, turn all the water on.
Bury that sound so no one hears anything anymore.
Mirror lie to me, tell me you can see.
Maybe you won't be able to recognize me now.
I know you can feel all the things you steal, and you're taking it.
You're taking it.

Feeling so easy makes me skin and bones.
I'm always on my knees for you.
Break like it's even, when you're leaving it.
Thin, where the hell have you been?

Sometimes it burns, baby I'll wash it out.
It all looks so big, nevermind I don't feel anything.
It only hurt a bit, and I still feel like shit.
And I think you won't be able to recognize me now. 
It's easier to quit, harder to admit.
And you're pushing me, you're fucking pushing me!

Feeling so easy makes me skin and bones.
I'm always on my knees for you.
Break like it's even, when you're leaving it.
Thin, where the hell have you been?

Cause you always win...
You always......

Laughin' like it works, bleedin' like it don't hurt.
Knock you off your feet, even if you need me.
Tear you apart, and I hate how I need you.

Feelin' too easy makes me skin and bones.
I'm always on my knees for you. 
Break like it's even, when you're leavin it.
Thin, where the hell have you been?

Cause you always win.
You always....
Always...

I will burn all this. I'll burn all this. I'll burn all this.
I will burn all this. I'll burn all this. I'll burn all this.
I will burn all this. I'll burn all this. I'll burn all this...---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
