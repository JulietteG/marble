All the concrete words around here 
I'm the bad seed, I think I swallowed it whole 
You're the compromise that never falls through 
Never left behind on the break down 

A thousand promises that never seemed to help me before 
A hundred less and I would stumble till I found the back door 
With nothing left to think I'll probably sit around and ignore 
The apathy that always leads me 

All the broken hearts that hang around here 
All the sick things that make you pull out your hair 
All the bad dreams, all the nightmares 
All the apathy that's always sticking it in 

A thousand promises that never seemed to help me before 
A hundred less and I would stumble till I found the back door 
With nothing left to think I'll probably sit around and ignore 
The apathy that always leads me 
And always finds a way to break me down 
down, down, down, down ,down 

A thousand promises that never seemed to help me before 
A hundred less and I would stumble till I found the back door 
With nothing left to think I'll probably sit around and ignore 
A hundred less and I would stumble till I found the back door 
A thousand promises that never seemed to help me before 
A hundred less and I would stumble till I found the back door 
With nothing left to think I'll probably sit around and ignore 

A thousand promises that never seemed to help me before 
A hundred less and I would stumble till I found the back door 
With nothing left to think I'll probably sit around and ignore 
The apathy that always leads me 
And always finds a way to break me down 

And thats when I decided to break it.---Lyrics submitted by Winter.
