Stop dragging around,
I think that somebody knows.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)
I think that somebody knows.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)

So they can watch me explode,
Another piece of me is gone again.
I don't want you to go,
But I already know.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)
But I already know.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)
It's probably better to go,
And you can leave if it's easier.

Lost and useless,
No more bruises.
I'll burn this place down,
Don't make no sound.

September, won't you bring me some rain again?
This sun is melting my skin.
And I would give you anything to feel something.
September falls away till Im broken,
And I just hate the sound.
And I can feel the water changing me,
Its changing me for good.

I wont see you a while,
But I guess it depends.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)
Yeah, I guess it depends.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)

And maybe if I pretend
That if its out of sight,
Its out of mind.
Nobody is wrong,
And nobody is right.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)
Nobody is right.
(Turn it up, turn it up.)
Then how come tonight,
Another piece of me is gone again?

Lost and useless,
No more bruises.
Ill burn this place down,
Dont make no sound.

September, won't you bring me some rain again?
This sun is melting my skin.
And I would give you anything to feel something.
September falls away till Im broken,
And I just hate the sound.
And I can feel the water changing me,
Its changing me for good.

Bite down hard,
Bite down.

September, won't you bring me some rain again?
This sun is melting my skin.
And I would give you anything to feel something.
September falls away till Im broken,
And I just hate the sound.
And I can feel the water changing me,
Its changing me for good.

September wont you bring me some rain again?
I'm melting here and I,
And I can feel the water changing me,
Its changing me for good.

Bite down hard,
Bite down.---Lyrics submitted by alice.
