How have you been 
Can I come in
Just came to get my things and then I guess im leaving
If I could say what you'd like to hear
I'd whisper in your ear its only temporary
But Ive been taking you for granted

Chorus
And i thought youd feel the same as me
Its time that i come clean but
But for now can we just both pretend to sleep
Sometimes the one you want is not the one you need
What goes around dont come around
You should know me by now
Better than, better then, better than, you should know me X3
I should know you as well 
Better than, better then,  you should know me x3
You should know me by now

Our talk is small and Im seven inches tall
And you should keep the apartment
So heres my keys, change all the bills
We're only built to spill and wonder where the heart went
And you've been takin me for granted

Chorus

I know that I remember you
And I think that you remember me too
So how can one of us still feel plus when the other one's lost
I know you got to feel the change
It just gets worse when it stays the same
How can one of us still feel plus when the other one's so lost
Right now
Sometimes the one you want is not the one you need 
What goes around dont come around
