I never took you for a trick but sometimes,
I don't know what you want.
I can take it if you need to take this out on someone.

That little thing with her head held so high,
Talkin shit when I,
Cut myself so I could feel something I,
Know is not a lie.

That one stings a little,
I'm always in the middle.
I don't expect, but try me,
And you will always find me here.
This is where I scream from.

Ya, You can take it all away and I'll miss,
There's a little bit of you in all this,
And you can say you only think you know, Ya.
Please, There's a better bit of me to see yet,
Cause you haven't seen any of my best.
You know I hate myself without you now, Ya.

Hurts the same when nobody knows,
Guess that's just how it goes,
And I, I won't say anything at all.

I was talkin on a dollar sign,
Anxious, scared of what you need.
Everybody wants a piece of you,
Everyone takes a piece of me.

That one stings a little,
I'm always in the middle.
I don't expect, But try me,
And you will always find me here.
This is where I scream from.

 Ya, You can take it all away and I'll miss,
There's a little bit of you in all of this,
And you can say you only think you know, Ya.
Please, There's a better bit of me to see yet,
Cause you haven't seen any of my best.
You know I hate myself without you now, Ya.

Hurts the same when nobody knows,
Guess that's just how it goes,
And I, I won't say anything at all.

This is the hook,
Take it like I took,
I'm shaking like I shook before,
Maybe I'm a little better off,
And I can only watch.
This is where I stopped before,
And now you have a piece of me.
I always slip away from,
I always slip away from.

I won't say anything, but--

Ya, You can take it all away and I'll miss,
There's a little bit of you in all this,
And you can say you only think you know, Ya.
Please, there's a better bit of me to see yet,
Cause you haven't seen any of my best.
You know I hate myself

Hurts the same when nobody knows,
Guess that's just how it goes,
And I, I won't say anything at all,
I won't say anything at all,
And I won't say anything at all.---Lyrics submitted by maddy.
