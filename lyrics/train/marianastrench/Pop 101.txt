(feat. Anami Vice)

Pop music 101
Some simple instructions, for good a first impression
Now lets start with verse one
A minor chord tensions grow, fade in the bass like so
Now with momentum go
Stop
And bring the beat back

It's call four on the floor
A beat you can't ignore
Bring sexy back once more, they love that for sho
The chords are 1, 4, 6, 4
Now I'm talking familiar
Harmony in 3rd's not 4th's
We'll take you into the pre-chorus

Real quick now don't you bore us
Hurry up and get to the chorus
Dumbed down, they won't ignore us

Get to the floor
And here's the words you should know
Like "DJ never let me go"
Or "shots and then we'll lose control"
Or "baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"

How 'bout one more last word like:
"Hey girl we've only got tonight"
Some things just go together like
Higher, desire, and fire
Higher, desire, and fire

Guitar and strings like these
To sound like Black Eyed Peas
This one's a filter sweep
This one's Imogene Heap
Hipster music on cassette
But you probably don't know that yet
808's
Hell yeah

Heartfelt pop anthems
From Mumford and his sons
Gang vocals here we come
Thinkin' "I will always wait"

Real quick now don't you bore us
Hurry up and get to the chorus
Dumbed down, they won't ignore us
Can't slow down
Get 'em to the chorus

Whoa, and here's the words you should know
Like "DJ never let me go"
Or "shots and then we'll lose control"
Or "baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"

How 'bout one more last word like:
"Hey girl we've only got tonight"
Some things just go together like:
Higher, desire, and fire
Higher, desire, and fire

(I can pitch shift my voice if I want
I can pitch shift my voice if I want
I can make my voice low)

The bridge is the part when you bring in a rapper friend
You simplify, and slow the beat
Abbreviate "feature" to "feat"

Quick now, fill in the gap
Right up and down, eliminate that which
You really would rap and give 'em a classic like

G-G-G-Get to the floor (CASH MONEY)
And here's the words you should know
Like "DJ never let me go"
Or "shots and then we'll lose control"
Or "baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"

How 'bout one more last word like:
"Hey girl we've only got tonight"
Some things just go together like:
Higher, desire, and fire
Higher, desire, and fire

Boots n cats n'
Boots n cats n'

Boots n' cats n'
Boots n' cats n'
Boots n' cats
