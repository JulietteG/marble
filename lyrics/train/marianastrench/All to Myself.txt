I don't patronize 
I realize I'm losing and this is my real life
I'm half asleep 
And I am wide-awake this habit is always so hard to break
I don't want to be the bad guy
I've been blaming myself and I think you know why
I'm killing time (I'm killin time), and time's killing you every way that I do

Chorus:
Did you say 
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up 
But just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else
Did you say 
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up 
But just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else

I'm under the gun 
Feel like the only one just can't decide what I'm running from
This isn't what I wanted but 
I can't keep my filthy ****ing mouth shut
It's not enough (It's not enough) it's never enough 
And I wish I could breath without it getting stuck
Can't focus it (Can't focus it) but I try it over and over again

Did you say 
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up 
But just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up 
But just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else

Na-na na-na...na
Na-na na-na...na-na
Na-na na-na...na
Na-na na-na...na-na

(Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up 
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like...)

Did you say
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I can't stay with someone else
I'll try and suck it up 
But just keep ****ing up
I want you all to myself

Did you say 
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me 
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up 
But just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else

Na-na na-na...na!---Lyrics submitted by Alexandria.
