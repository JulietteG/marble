Who'll be my Montague now, 
To this broken Capulet.
How, how, how if not for you.
And you'll be my local hero.
Be my role model,
And don't, don't, don't fail me now.

(My Love)

Don't you want love, don't you want love.
I'm your biggest fan,
It's so good to finally meet ya.
I deserve a little more,
would you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh.

(My Love)

Don't you want love, 
Don't you want too
Don't you think I deserve better after all that we've been through (love)
Don't you want love (love)
Now what you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh

[CHORUS]
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers

I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers

Toy soldiers

I will love you like goodbye
I will love you like you died, died
Martyred for me

(My love)

Don't you want love
Don't you want this
Don't you look so shocked
This was not the way I planned it
I deserve a little more
Wouldn't you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh

(My love)
Don't you want love, 
Don't you fight back
Know this will hurt less if you just submit so (love)
How bout a little gratitude
For what I say-oh, a-oh, a-oh

To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers

To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
I'll follow you like
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers

They don't know you
Not like I do
Only you and I were meant to be
Understand you
Just like I do
Just like you and I were meant to be forever

One day you will
Learn to love me
One day you will
Thank me, you'll see
If I can't have you
No one can

Follow you like (toys)

To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers

To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers

I'll follow

Understand you
Just like I do
Just like you and I were meant to be
Don't know you
Not like I do
Only you and I were meant to be

Understand you
Just like I do
Just like you and I were meant to be forever---Lyrics submitted by Shaelyn Miller.
