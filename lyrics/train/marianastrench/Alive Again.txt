I felt it turn to come and go
Don't worry no one ever knows
I don't know why it just won't die
It breaks me in to stay alive
I know it hurt a lot like you
C'mon I know that you felt it too

It hurts the same and that's ok
I never liked him anyway
I know, i know, i know, i..

It seems so long since I've been gone
I got so used to just hanging on
I feel so wrong
I don't belong
I got so used to just hanging on

I'm used to starving out instead
It's easier than faking it
Sometimes it hurts but
That's no worse than all those times
I guess it works

I know they walked away with a piece of me
the more i know, than i won't go
The more I bruise from laying low
i know, i know, i know, i...

it seems so long since i've been gone 
i got so used to just hanging on 
i feel so wrong
i don't belong
and i know, and i know, i..

i walk around like i'm alive again; but i know it's just not the same. i'd walk around like i'm alive again, shut up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(x2)Shut up!!!!!!!!!!!

and i'd walk around like i'm alive again, but i know it's not the same. and i'd walk around like i'm alive again, it's not the same.

i broke it all, i'm sorry, i broke it, i broke it all, i'm sorry i broke it all, i'm sorry, i broke it, i broke it all.

i'm sorry (x14)

i'm sorry, i broke it, i broke it all, i'm sorry, i broke it, i broke it all---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
