I won't pull the trigger, just to see you die
No remittee to make me come alive
I'm ticking like a time bomb, no fuse just guts and gore
Initiate the burning of the core

I count down to zero, pull the trigger, no parole
no mercy, no mercy - no mercy on your soul

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am not judgmental
A sinner nor a saint
Cause either you're my best friend or you ain't

Come gather here around me
feel my breath under your skin
I'm deadly only when I'm getting caught

I count down to zero, I'm a soldier without soul
no mercy, no mercy - no mercy on your soul

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am born to kill, judge and condemn
I am born to win, slay and maim 'em
I am born to live, fight for glory
I am born to die

kill
win
live
die

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am born to kill, judge and condemn
I am born to win, slay and maim 'em
I am born to live, fight for glory
I am born to die, memento mori

I am born to kill, judge and condemn
I am born to win, slay and maim 'em
I am born to live, fight for glory
I am born to die, memento mori---Lyrics submitted by Calle.
