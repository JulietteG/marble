On a dusty shelf, burried over ground
In the corner of the attic
Where the bats come and play

Oh, they linger on
Preserved, embraced in silence
A script, a tale, kept from the light of day

The fear of god
A recital of a story only for the strong to find

As you kneel down, you feel the cold wind blow
Kill the switch, lock all the exits
The curse, the spell the words begin to glow

The sun is silent
Nice circles, the passage into the abyss

Ex Inferis, remember my name
Ex Inferis, demon from Hell

Abandon hope as you step inside
The rebellion of angels
Who reside these darkened shores

Oh, waist deep in ice
Surrounded by the fire
The purgatory gate, nowhere to go

This is your calling
Malicious and violent, the circles of hell

Limbo, lust and gluttony
Rage out of control
Greed and anger, heresy
The price to clense thy soul

Ex Inferis, remember my name
Ex Inferis, demon from Hell
Ex Inferis, remember my name
Ex Inferis, demon from Hell

All for one, but none for all
Enslaved, we will succumbe
Violence, fraud, no Kingdome Come
Reborn in treachery

Ex Inferis, remember my name
Ex Inferis, demon from Hell
Ex Inferis, remember my name
Ex Inferis, demon from Hell

Ex Inferis---
