(I)i am the one (the one) Who lost control (control) but in the end i'd be the last man standing
(I)i am the one (the one) who sold his soul(his soul)forever gone to be the last man standing
Glorious noble in my mind everything a fight to win
taking all and giving whatever my pride would let me
not backing down not giving in
I WOULDN'T LOSE,I COULDN'T DIE
(I)i am the one (the one) Who lost control (control) but in the end i'd be the last man standing
(I)i am the one(the one)who sold his soul (his soul) forever gone to be the last man standing
i walk alone with my head held high
never felt that i belonged
stand my ground at all costs
runing through life with blindfolds
just for the right-right to be wrong
NOTHING WOULD RULE MY WORD BUT...
(I)i am the one (the one) Who lost control (control) but in the end i'd be the last man standing
(I)i am the one (the one) who sold his soul (his soul) forever gone to be the last man standing
guitar SOLO
NOTHING WOULD RULE MY WORD BUT...
(I)i am the one (the one) Who lost control (control) but in the end i'd be the last man standing
(I)i am the one (the one) who sold his soul (his soul) forever gone to be the last man standing
(I)i am the one (the one) Who lost control (control) but in the end i'd be the last man standing
(I)i am the one (the one) who sold his soul (his soul) forever gone to be the last man standing
seeing clearer what i've done
i'd refuse to let things go
i could never once admit i am rong
and what do i have to show?
seeing clearer what's at stake
and the things i have to change
i just hope i can,it's not too late
to get a change to end this pain---Lyrics submitted by christos.
