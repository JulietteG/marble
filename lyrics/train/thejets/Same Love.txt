You and me we had a love that was forever
That was I thought and I can still remember
Words you said, you said wed always be together 
Then why am I alone tonight?

Somethin changed now you just dont feel the same
Ill never understand

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I dont understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughin, cry in the night?
It doesnt seem right at all

Rememberin the nights we held onto each other
The times you told me, youll never love another
Rememberin when I was all you ever needed
Where are you when I need you now?

Summer days have left me standin in the rain
Somebody tell me how

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I dont understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughin, cry in the night?
It doesnt seem right at all

Was my heart so blind, I couldnt see?
Was I a fool to believe promises you made to me?
What went wrong, what went wrong?

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I dont understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughin, cry in the night?
It doesnt seem right at all
It doesnt seem right at all---Lyrics submitted by theye.
