Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 

Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 

The shepherds kept their watching 
Over silent flocks by night 
Behold through out the Heavens 
There shown a Holy light 

So go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 

Oh, down in a lowly manger 
The humble Christ was born 
God sent to us salvation 
That blessed Christmas morn' 

So go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born 
(Yeah) 

Oh, tell everybody, everywhere 
Go tell the world 
That Jesus Christ is born 
Jesus Christ is born 
(Yeah) 

Oh, Christ is born 
(Yeah) 
Hallelujah, oh 
Oh, Christ is born 
(Yeah) 
Oh, tell the world---
