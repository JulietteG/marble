Forging to begin
Smoke and flame
Can fire burn through sin?
Darkening is denied
Over and over again

Keep me down from all things private
Expose this failed creation

What is done is dead
What is done is dead

To be content
Beyond abomination
Are you satisfied?
Are you done with this?

The ultimate rebellion
The sacrifice is endless
The ultimate rebellion
Mean nothing to no one

What's in a true life,
Beyond the crumbling walls?
I'll dream an infant illusion
Action without movement
Desire without heart

It is over and done
It is over and done

To cleave our judgment subjects
What fathom without eyes
The fall of all things personal
That no one sees

The ultimate rebellion
The sacrifice is endless
The ultimate rebellion
Mean nothing to no one

Awaken to the screams of unresolve
Demands and accusations of the free
No
These are the outer centers
Of bitter detonation
That will force us to inaction
Glitters of resolve
Take the burden off me
Leave me to the grave

The ultimate rebellion
The sacrifice is endless
The ultimate rebellion
Mean nothing to no one---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
