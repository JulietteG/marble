There is this face in the still water
I can't remember ever wearing
Like fingerprints on your heart
Reading out the last lines of code
To the untrained eye a secret
I bled away the last of you

Sought trust in shapes of combined results
That trickles from a less than solid case
Fought off attacks of resurfaced lust
Burn the grazing grounds

What will give in first?
The body or the lash?
Monochromatic stains
Who will cave in first?
The leader or the fake?
Monochromatic stains

This pile of ashes of a soul
Informant pokes about
These sickly little fingers
Get away from me

Tread not the path of least restraint
Each piece of evidence a lie, a lie
The body, the face, all items in place
I don't remember a thing

What will give in first?
The body or the lash?
Monochromatic stains
Who will cave in first?
The leader or the fake?
Monochromatic stains

A sacrifice made to the loss of a mind
Folly, a man's demise

But now the stains that allow my fall
Sickening, the sight of it all
Never shall I claim my innocence
I just wasn't there

What will give in first?
The body or the lash?
Monochromatic stains
Who will cave in first?
The leader or the fake?
Monochromatic stains---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
