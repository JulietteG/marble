It hurts
To know that you don't dress me
And when you try to impress me
It only makes me trust you less
To know
That I don't get respect
When I've given you my word and you go with what you heard
And still, you go
You send me through the night
Then we end up in a fight
And it's such a waste of time
Now I, know,
You're feeding me a line when you say that you're in love,
But just doing all the time.

I know, you've got a lot to question,
That made a big impression,
I know that you've been hurt,
Oh why, I, you do apologise when it was before my time,
Is an answer I won't give you,
And, so
When you call me on the phone,
And you hear I'm not alone,
No, it doesn't mean that things have gone,
wrong,
There was a you before me,
There was a me before you,
And that's the way it goes.

You don't (you don't)
Need to worry on my half,
It was written when we new more,
Give her life from this, forget her,
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe

You don't (you don't)
Need to worry on my half,
It was written when we new more,
Give her life from this, forget her,
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe
With me your love's safe---
