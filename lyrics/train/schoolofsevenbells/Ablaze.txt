How could I have known
the god of my youth
would come crashing down on my heart?
I thought that I knew love
that love was a scornful thing
that fed on a fading flame that held
the world together for me
and when it died I fell apart

The day we met
there was a new fire
whose heart had been drowning for so long
When I was dark
you found a glowing ember
and set my world into a blaze again

How could I forget?
You saw the stars in me when I
had sunk into the black
you never thought to leave
you were the drug to bring me out
from a crushing sleep
you told me all you saw was diamonds
you told me that till I believed

The day we met
there was a new fire
whose heart had been drowning for so long
When I was dark
you found a glowing ember
and set my world into a blaze again

And set it all ablaze
and set it all ablaze again
you set it all ablaze
you set it all ablaze again

You set my heart ablaze
you set it all ablaze again (when I was dark)
you set my heart ablaze
you set my heart ablaze again

The day we met
there was a new fire
whose heart had been drowning for so long
When I was dark
you found a glowing ember
and set my world into a blaze again---
