I'm a son of the soil
I'm a son of the land
I'm a son of my father
And I know, I can never be a happy man

I'm tired of the dust and decay
I'm weary of flinging my heart's wealth away
I'm bitter at sowing for others to reap
All I need is rest

I'm tired of prayers and singing hymns
I'm weary of waiting to take a place with him
I, a choirboy Know
That means is as ugly as sin

I'm a son of the soil
I'm a son of the land
I'm a son of my father
And I know, I can never be a happy man

I'm tired of the dust and decay
I'm weary of flinging my heart's wealth away
I'm bitter, when I look around and see what's happening
All I need is rest

I'm a son of the soil
I'm a son of the land
I'm a son of the soil
I'm a son of the land
I'm a son of my father
And I know, 
I can never be a happy man

I'm a son of the soil, a son of the land
Son of the soil, son of the land
Son of the soil, 
Son of my father and I know
I can never be happy
Happy

I have been faithful
I have been faithful
I have been faithful---Lyrics submitted by aidan trimble.
