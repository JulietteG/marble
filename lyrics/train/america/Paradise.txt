Paradise
caught between the fire and the ice
no need to think twice
that's where I want to be

Like a weather vain
following the wind the sun and rain
the entity of pain
and all that comes between

'cause in the morrnig summer breezes will be coming my way
then in the evening, unbelieving, I'll be ready to say
that I am livn' here in paradice
balencing the darkness with the light
silencing the fight
ahead is all I see

Like a golden chain
wraped around the laughter and the pain
silenceing the blame
let it all brake free

Then in the morring summer breezes will be coming my way
and in the evening unbelieving I'll be ready to say
that we're all livn' here in paradice

and thou the sun will fade away they say
there's so much more to fill a day
so be a weather vain
following the wind the sun and rain
the entity of pain
and all that comes between

'cause in the morring summer breezes will be coming your way
then in the evening unbelieving you'll be ready to say
that we're all livn' here in paradise

in paradise
paradise
livn' here in paradice
between the fire and the ice---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
