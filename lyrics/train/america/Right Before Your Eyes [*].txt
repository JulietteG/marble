Every day I sit beside you
On the bus to madison avenue
Work in the big gray store
With the revolving doors

You dont even know my name
I guess that Im to blame
Dont know the right things to say
So I pretend away

That Im rudolph valentino
Pull up in my limousine
Oh, wont you come in out of the rain
Thingsll never be the same

And then just like greta garbo
You stare like theres no tomorrow
And youll know what Im thinking of
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you

Do, do, do ...

Today Im done with games (today Im done with games)
Gonna ask you for your name
Say Ive been watching you
I even know what you do

Maybe today Ill tell you (maybe today Ill tell you)
Ive found the nerve to sell you
On a guy like me
Who wishes that he could be

Your rudolph valentino
Pull up in my limousine
Oh, wont you come in out of the rain
Thingsll never be the same

And then just like greta garbo
You stare like theres no tomorrow
And youll know what Im thinking of
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you

Do, do, do ...

Right before your eyes I fall in love with you
Right before my eyes youll say you love me to

Rudolph valentino
I pull up in my limousine
Oh, wont you come in out of the rain
Thingsll never be the same

And then just like greta garbo
You stare like theres no tomorrow
And youll know what Im thinking of, oo

Do, do, do ...---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
