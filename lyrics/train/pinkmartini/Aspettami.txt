Aspettami, Wait fro me
I've been lost, Adrift at sea
In your dreams, dream my way
Someday I'll find my heart
And come back to stay

mmm...
do you miss me, my darling
mmm...
as I miss you
take my hand and pull me near
and never let me go again, my dear

There was a time
when I was safe in your arms
and the stars fell away
like diamonds
then, we were young 
and our love was younger still
was it just an illusion

Aspettami, wait for me
close your eyes, and you will see
I'm coming home
every sky in the heart will be blue
on the day I come back to you

I'm coming home
every sky in the heart will be blue
on the day I come back to you---Lyrics submitted by Milca.
