Feel me sneaking around again
Am I hangin' around again?
Can't you see?
That my heart lies, my heart lies to you

I followed the waves to you,
I cannot see it through
But my heart lies to you
You'll never have me true

(I lie)

Please don't, please don't make amends
(Please don't, please don't make amends)
See me, see me slip again
(See me, see me slip again)

Break my heart
The cards of fate
Seal the deal
My heart lies, my heart lies to you

I followed the waves to you,
I cannot see it through
But my heart lies to you
You'll never have me true

I followed the waves to you,
I cannot see it through
But my heart lies to you
I'll never stay with you

I followed the waves to you,
I cannot see it through
But my heart lies to you
You'll Never have me true

Between my fire sighs and my burning eyes
My heart burns wildly in his eyes
He's just a drunken, gambling man
Dealing with the hand of desire's thing

I'm gonna shuffle his deck clean
I'm gonna shuffle his deck clean---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
