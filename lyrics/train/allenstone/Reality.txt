And love is hard,
Either it flourishes or it starves,
And I would love to give my heart,
I just can't pull the trigger in the dark,

Well, now we've come to this,
We both agree that this love ain't bliss,
Oh, but before we cut these ties,
There's something I just need to emphasize,

Well, I pray all your wishes come true,
And if you're in need, help is offered to you,
And I pray for peace, love and prosperity,
And may all your dreams become reality,

And love needs pain,
Just like the sunshine needs the rain,
Without the love shining,
All of this water falls in vain,

Well, now we've come to this,
We both agree that this love ain't bliss,
Oh, but before we cut these ties,
There's something I just need to emphasize,

Well, I pray all your wishes come true,
And if you're in need, help is offered to you,
And I pray for peace, love and prosperity,
And may all your dreams become reality, oh,

I pray all your wishes come true,
And if you're in need, help is offered to you,
And I pray for peace, love and prosperity,
And may all your dreams become reality,

Now we've come to this,
Now we've come to this. ---
