I am a sick one 
From what I heard today
I had a companion
I had a Companion
Now she's gone 
Gone away

Who's gonna kiss her
Get on a plane today
I had a reason
I had a reason
And now it's gone
Gone away

You see a rich man came
With his troubling way
He had a friend in me
He had a friend in me
But the troubled
Me away

I've got a flower in my hair
And it took so long to grow there
Put the stem between his teeth
Smiled once at me and he was gone

The sky's on my side
Will it rain for me
Yes it cried today
Sure it cried today
Now the snow is
Coming your way

I've got a flower in my hair
And it took so long to grow there
Put the stem between his teeth
Smiled once at me and he was gone

I am a hustlers son
And I get what I want
Got her on the phone today
Just to hear what she'd say
And she didn't
Mention you none---Lyrics submitted by Steve Drake.
