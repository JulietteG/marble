I don't need to ever exchange (you know I)
I don't need to ever replace (you know I)
I'm not going any damn place (you know I)
You should know that I - I - I ohh - I

I know no other one, I know no other one
I know-oh-oh
I know no other one, I know no other one
All I need is you
Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh
All I need is you
Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh

Baby can't you see, Baby can't you see
Oh - oh - Oh
You're the one I need, Only one I need
Oh - Oh - oh
That I can't believe, No I can't believe
Oh - Oh - oh
Would ever think, I would ever leave
Oh - Oh - oh oh
I'm staying here, I ain't going no where
You should know I - I - oh I

I don't need to ever exchange (you know I)
I don't need to ever replace (you know I)
I'm not going any damn place (you know I)
You should know that I - I - I ohh - I

I know no other one, I know no other one
I know-oh-oh
I know no other one, I know no other one
All I need is you
Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh
All I need is you
Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh

Baby one more thing, Baby one more thing
Oh - oh - Oh
You should hold this ring, You should hold this ring
Oh - oh - oh
Cause it needs my heart, Cause it needs my heart
Oh - Oh - oh
It'll never part, It'll never part
Oh - Oh - oh - oh oh

I'm staying here, I ain't going no where
You should know I - I - I

I don't need to ever exchange (you know I)
I don't need to ever replace (you know I)
I'm not going any damn place (you know I)
You should know that I - I - I ohh - I

I know no other one, I know no other one

[Rap:]
Look
I don't need change but you know what that's funny
Can't you see the time who's got money, money
Cash out and leave with a ten dollar, ten dollar bill won't change on my honey
Rockstar shades and you looking so stunning, stunning
That's how it looks when we be hand in hand
And walking the streets when nobody else can match our flavor
How could you ever think that I was ever gonna change ya
I ain't never gonna change ya

I don't need to ever exchange (you know I)
I don't need to ever replace (you know I)
I'm not going any damn place (you know I)
You should know that I - I - I ohh - I

I know no other one, I know no other one
I know-oh-oh
I know no other one, I know no other one
All I need is you
Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh
All I need is you
Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh - oh - Oh - oh oh
