Think about what you're doing baby 
Think about faith 
Think of the blood that's running 
'Round in your veins 
You're soft and naked 
You're young and strong 
My heartbeat races 
As you aim the gun 
And these prison walls 
Can't hold me anymore 

Run silent, run deep 
You've taken over me 
And even when I sleep 
Run silent, run deep 

When you talk of reconstruction 
Do you want it to last 
Don't talk of revolution 
As a thing of the past 
I need a hero are you on my side?
Or just a temple for my sacrifice 
And these prison walls 
Will have to let me go 

Run silent, run deep 
You've taken over me 
And even when I sleep 
Run silent, run deep 

From my soul to your fears 
From my lips to your ears 
One heartbeat 
In this world tonight 
And in these prison walls 
I see an open door 

Run silent, run deep 
You've taken over me 
And even when I sleep 
Run silent, run deep---Lyrics submitted by Tami.
