Do you remember the late morning
When we went back to bed,
When we found the first position
And every muscle are resting

I do remember that I already knew
It was the last time,
The last time for first positions
The last time you'll be mine

Aaaaoo aoo aoo ao
Aaaaoo aoo aoo ao

Do you remember the scars I showed you
The stories I told you
How I always said forever
When you aksed me to stay true
Do you remember when we forgot
How to smile at each other
To believe that the other
Want only what's good for you

Aaaaoo aoo aoo ao
Aaaaoo aoo aoo ao

Aaaaoo aoo aoo ao
Aaaaoo aoo aoo ao

Do you remember the late morning
When we went back to bed,
When we found the first position
And every muscle are resting

I do remember that I already knew
It was the last time,
The last time for first positions
The last time you'll be mine---Lyrics submitted by carola.
