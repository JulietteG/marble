Dont ever leave
That is what you asked of me
do you know what it means
when you plead?

Dont you ever leave
that is what you said to me
do you know what that can do
to someone like me?

It wont do us no good
it wont do us no good

I have no plan to be
anywhere else to but here
or to become someone that leaves
I didnt even know there was an exit here
darling, dont you try
to capture me

it wont do us no good
it wont do us no good

I am here now
Im right here by your side
Ill lay my hand on the couch next to you
you can hold it if you would like to

it will do you good---
