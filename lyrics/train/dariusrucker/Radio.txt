Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my Momma off where she needed to go

It had four bald tires
With the ceiling falling and the windows stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio

We turned it on, turned it up to 10
And everybody would jump on in

Drivin down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
Ill find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
Not knowing where it comes from
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio

Grabbed my girl
We looked for somewhere to watch the stars
A perfect place to put it park and take it slow

She sang along
To even the ones that she barely knew
Still sounded good, a little louder too
But we didnt care

I looked at her, she looked at me
Ill never forget that melody

Drivin down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
Ill find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
No matter where it comes from
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio

Hey yall be quiet, thats my favorite song
Hey man, turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

Drivin down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
Ill find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
No matter where it comes from
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio---
