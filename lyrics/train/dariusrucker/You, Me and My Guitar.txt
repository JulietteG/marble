Tonight, let's let party people do
Whatever party people do
Just wanna be somewhere with you
Without the crowd
Tonight, let's go hit our favorite spot
Let our feet swing off that dock
This old six string's all I brought
And that's all we need

Make a list of your favorite songs
I can play and you can sing along
Don't matter if we get 'em wrong
Ain't nobody listenin' but the moon
And all the stars
Baby, we don't need no bar
All we need is this old jar
You and me and my guitar

I wanna feel
That sweet, sweet southern breeze
Blowin' through those live oak trees
Feel that grass under our feet
While we're walkin' down
I can't wait
To see the smile there on your face
When I open up that case
Yeah, tune it up and play
With the crickets keepin' time

Make a list of your favorite songs
I can play and you can sing along
Don't matter if we get 'em wrong
Ain't nobody listenin' but the moon
And all the stars
Baby, we don't need no bar
All we need is this old jar
You and me and my guitar

Girl, you know, I love to show you off
Underneath the lights downtown
But now and then, I like slippin' off
Where there ain't nobody around
But you and me
Just you and me and my guitar
And the moon and the stars and you and me, now baby---
