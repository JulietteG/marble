O come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
come and behold him born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ The Lord

Sing choirs of angels sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ The Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning
Jesus, to thee be glory given
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ The Lord

O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ The Lord

O come, let us adore him
Christ The Lord.---
