Hear footsteps creeping and the
Clock says it's four am
Ain't gonna let it slide again
This time, this time
No more pretending that
I don't know where you're at
I can't ignore the fact

It's all over your face
The lipstick and the lies
The truth you try to hide
But you just can't, just can't fake
The feelings you don't feel
Try to hide it but it's still
All over, all over your face

Hotel's been whispering
But I wasn't listening
Like a fool i was blinded, blinded
By the alibis you gave
And all the games you played
This time you can't be saved

It's all over your face
The lipstick and the lies
The truth you try to hide
But you just can't, just can't fake
The feelings you don't feel
Try to hide it but it's still
All over, all over your face

So don't even start your pleading and crying
Cause what you're selling baby I ain't buying
It's all over your face yeah

It's all over your face
The lipstick and the lies
The truth you try to hide
But you just can't, just can't fake
These feelings you don't feel
Try to hide it but it's still
All over, all over your face
Oh yeah, oh it's all over your face
The lipstick and the lies
Lipstick and the lies---
