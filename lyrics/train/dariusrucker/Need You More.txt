Kinda like eighteen wheels need a blacktop
A bad part of town needs a good cop
Kinda like a romantic night and a sunset
Candlelight and a silhouette in the door
But I need you more
Kinda like a cup of coffee needs the a.m.
Hard times need a good friend
Kinda like a sinners prayer when hopes gone
From a midnight drunk kneeling on a jailhouse floor

I need you more
Every touch, every kiss, every time
Your lips hit mine
I need you more
Every look my way
Every second of the day that goes by
Even holding you tight in the middle of the night
You say, how much you need me
Baby, believe me
I need you more

Kinda like a country road needs a old church
Carolina needs a red dirt
Kinda like daybreak needs a sunrise
Bulldogs and rocking chairs need the porch

I need you more
Every touch, every kiss, every time
Your lips hit mine
I need you more
Every look my way
Every second of the day that goes by
Even holding you tight in the middle of the night
You say, how much you need me
Baby, believe me
I need you more

Kinda like a stormy night needs a lighthouse
Tall ships and driftwood need a shore

I need you more
Every touch, every kiss, every time
Your lips hit mine
I need you more
Every look my way
Every second of the day that goes by
Even holding you tight in the middle of the night
You say, how much you need me
Baby, believe me
I need you more

I need you more
I need you more
I need you more---
