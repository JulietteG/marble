Every friend has got a friend in mind
'Cause I've had more than a little time
So it's on your mark, get ready, set
But I know my heart's not ready yet

I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you

She don't have to look just like you
No her eyes don't have to be that blue
It's hard to give someone a chance
When you can't get past that second dance

I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you

Sometimes the pain is dulled to numb
And I can't believe how far I've come

I can walk into a room without you
(I can breathe without you)
And I, I don't get drunk and talk about you no more, no more
(And I can sleep without you)
So I, I guess I've learned to live without you
(I can be without, I can be without you)
I just don't know how to love without you
(I don't know how, I don't know how)
See, see I, I had to learn to live without you
(I had to learn to live without you)
Oh but I just don't know how to, how to love, how to love without you
(Oh I just don't know, how to love, how to love without you)

Every friend has got a friend in mind
'Cause I've had more than a little time---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
