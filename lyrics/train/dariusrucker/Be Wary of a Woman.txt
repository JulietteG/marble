If your a man like me you was good at leaving
If you like your space and you love your freedom
Don't see yourself as ever settling down  or your whole world being tossed around

(chorus)
Be weary of a woman, a woman so fine don't want to change you love you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing you're out of control forget about leaving your heart won't go
If you don't like that you better run and hide and be wearry of a woman like mine


She'll make you laugh when you feel like crying  Make you want to live when you feel like dying
So if you like living in the dark  Just walk away your gonna loose your heart

(bridge)
Be weary of a woman a woman so fine don't want to change you love you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing your out of control forget about leaving your heart wont go
If you don't like that you better run and hide and be weary of a woman be weary of a woman like mine then you stand a chance don't even try be weary of a woman like mine


Be weary of a woman a woman so fine don't want to change you love you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing you're out of control forget about leaving your heart  won't go
If you don't like that you better run and hide and be weary of a woman like mine 
A woman like mine  be weary of a woman like mine  oh  a woman like mine---Lyrics submitted by Brianna.
