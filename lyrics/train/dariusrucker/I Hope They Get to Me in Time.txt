I'm eight years daddy's cuttin my hair Aqua Velva on his hands
Mama's in the kitchen got fried green tomatoes poppin in the pan
I see a home run a goal line holding my breath gettin baptized
I see a beautiful face under that veil as she's walking down the Isle

(Chorus)
I can hear the sirens comming  smell the gasoline and smoke
I'm pinned against this steering wheel when it's sure my arm is broke
I can see the flames and my life flashing right before my eyes
I hope they get to me in time


I can see the headlights swerve so I cut the wheel to the right
Last thing I saw was that bottle turned up as he crossed that center line
I see tiny hands  brown eyes falling asleep to that lulabye
and you slide over next to me as I turned out the lights

(chorus)

(Bridge)
Please lord I'm begging you don't let me go like this
There's so much left that I want to do so much I don't want to miss


I can see the flames and my life flashing right before my eyes
I hope they get to me in time
Just get to me in time
Please get to me in ------in time---Lyrics submitted by Barry.
