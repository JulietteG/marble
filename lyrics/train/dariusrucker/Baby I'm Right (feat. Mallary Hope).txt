Heaven knows that I'm usually wrong
And you're the first one to point it out
Don't even try to act like you don't know
What it is I'm talking 'bout
You know that I'm no know-it-all
But when I first saw you I thought

This could be
The start of something beautiful
This could be
The start of something magical
The kind of thing you look for all of your life
This could be
The start of something so unreal
This could be
Finally the real deal
I guess now and then
Baby, I'm right

Don't wanna really put you right on the spot
But I love the look you're giving me
I'm no genius but I know what we've got
That special kind of chemistry
Go on and roll those hazel brown eyes
Let's see where we're going tonight

This could be
The start of something beautiful
This could be
The start of something magical
The kind of thing you look for all of your life
This could be
The start of something so unreal
This could be
Finally the real deal
I guess now and then
Baby, I'm right

Just admit it
I ain't always wrong
Me being right kinda turns you on

This could be
The start of something beautiful
This could be
The start of something magical
The kind of thing you look for all of your life
This could be
The start of something so unreal
This could be
Finally the real deal
I guess now and then
Baby, I'm right

Yeah, I guess now and then
You let me be right---
