Spring break, tan skin
Lord I can't remember when
I fell, so fast
Knowing it could never last

[Chorus:]
I got lost in the rhythm of the waves of the ocean
Lost in the sunset too
I got lost in your eyes and the time
Don't you know it
Baby, I got lost in you

Five days, four night
A smile I will remember
For the rest of my life
How sweet was your kiss
I still taste it on my lips

[Repeat Chorus]

Packed car, your tears
I said girl I hate to leave you here
I'll be back, I lied
It's been all these years
I still hear your goodbye

[Repeat Chorus]

I got lost in the rhythm of the waves of the ocean
Lost in the sunset too, yeah
I got lost in your eyes and the time
Don't you know it
Baby I got lost in you, yeah
Baby I got lost in you
Oh baby, I got lost in you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
