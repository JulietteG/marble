I remember that long line
Camping out there all night
Just for a chance to see that hair band

Got tickets for my first show
Didn't care about the back row
The day finally came
It was all worth the wait

Never heard nothing so loud
As the roar of the crowd
When the lights went down
And we all pulled 'em all out

Lighter up
Feel the love
Everybody swaying
Ridin' that wave
So alive
With the fire
We raised them high
And burned the night
Lighter up
Lighter up

Hit the stage with that first song
Never felt a groove so strong
Lights were so bright
We were coming alive

The words we didn't know-oh-oh
We all just said who-oh-oh
Then she grabbed my hand
We started to dance

Never seen nothing like the roar of the flames
She gave me a kiss before she gave me her name

Lighter up
Feel the love
Everybody swaying
Ridin' that wave
So alive
With the fire
We raised them high
And burned the night
Lighter up
Lighter up

And just like the show-oh-oh
We didn't take it slow-oh-oh
I bathed in her eyes
Even watched the sunrise

Lighter up
Feel the love
Everybody swaying
Ridin' that wave
So alive
With the fire
We raised them high
And burned the night
Lighter up
Lighter up

Lighter up---
