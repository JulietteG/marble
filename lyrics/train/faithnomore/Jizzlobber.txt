Smiles
Bruises
Smiles
Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time
Is split milk
My skin is a layer of soot
I'm spending my days scrubbing
I'm trying so hard to act like nothing happened (no one left to blame)
I'm trying so hard to find that fresh, clean smell (no one left to blame)
Smiles
Bruises
Smiles
Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time
Is split milk
Cruel words sleep above me
Mounting and teasing
I AM WHAT I'VE DONE
I AM WHAT I'VE DONE
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Sorry
Sorry
Sorry---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
