They all know me by my car
They all know I'm gone, but not how far
I'm heading straight down 101
I'm going to go and get me some
My lips are movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
Gonna get to run down
Eo non posso dirigir
E agora a pares
Neo dedu indehado
No neo naris
My lips anr movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
Gonna get to run down---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
