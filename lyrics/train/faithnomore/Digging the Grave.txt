It would be wrong to ask you why
Because I know what goes inside
Is only half of what comes out
Isnt that what its about?
Its about to remind us were alive
To remind us were not blind
In that big, black hole
Comfortable ooohooohohhohohh

Digging the grave, I got it made
Let something in, throw something out
You left the door open wide

I know you have a reason why
That knot is better left undied
I just went and undid mine
It takes some time
And the shadows so bigIt takes the sun out of the day
And the feeling goes away
When you close the door
Comfortable oooohohhoooohhooh

Digging the grave, I got it made
Let something in, throw something out
You left the door open wide

Digging the grave, I got it made

SOLO

Go out Go out Go out 1x Pause

Comfortable oohohohohohhhhoooo

Digging the grave, I got it made
Let something in, throw something out
You left the door open wide

ooohoooooohooo
ooohoooohhoooho

And its
Out of this world	Comfortable
Out of this world	Comfortable
Out of this world	Comfortable
Out of this world	Comfortable---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
