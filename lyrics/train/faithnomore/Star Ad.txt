Star A.D.(2)

See tomorrow dreamin'
You don't need your freedom

Star A.D.

A little joke that's understood
All over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over
over

And dying is dry -
Like a fact of history
And when you die, you'll become something worse
Than dead -
You'll become
A legend

See tomorrow dreamin'
You don't need your freedom

A little joke that's understood
All over the world

We are forever

A little joke that's understood
All over the world 

A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over
over---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
