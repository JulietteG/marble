Im big bully, no bike gear
I told you b-tches last year
I'm a rap b-tch nightmare
That's why I call you buzz lightyear
Cause by the time you start buzzin
B-tch you gon have white hair
Paparazzi was a fright scare
When I landed out in London
It was looking like Mike Dare, Mike Jack
Who's bad, ain't know my period
But I got a new pad
Channel 5, news flash
P-ssy clean, who smash
None of y'all, canary yellow ball
These b-tches should be worshipping me in the synagogue

Hum, hum, done the prayer
B-b-b-b-tch I ball, underwear
Hum, hum, done the prayer
Did I tell them that I ball, underwear
Okay roman,
Y'all want the full roman?
Y'all want the full roman?
Y'all want the full roman?

B-tches is insane, these b-tches ain't in my lane
Only b-tches in the plane, is b-tches that give me brain

Herro this sh-t is lethal,
Roman, This is the sequel,
Moscow, that's where I came from
Under, he's fully charge,
Your favorite rapper probably suck,
As for me icy hockey puck,
Anyway i'm on that new sh-t,
Every trend I introduce it,
Muthaf-ck you with a big d-ck
I'm a racist, i'm a bigot
B-tch, i'm thicker than a midget
Yeah i'm crazy, just a smidgen
Motherf-ck make it my wumble
That's okay me am from moscow

Hold on
F-ck you
Brace yourself
Bucktooth, Yeah I golf but too
Swallow balls

Camel toe, Roman
Y'all want the full roman?
Y'all want the full roman?
Y'all want the full roman?
Ya'll want the full?
B-tches is insane, these b-tches ain't in my lane
Only b-tches in the plane, is b-tches that give me brain

Yeah, ain't no mothaf-ckin bridge b-tch,
Ain't no mothaf-ckin hook,
Ain't no mothaf-ckin' third mothaf-ckin verse
Roman's back b-tch
I f-cked up your life last year this time
Remember that? Remember that b-tch?
Remember that b-tch?
I'm baaaaaack

I double dog dare you

I double dog dare any one of ya b-tches to come out

I triple dog dare ya
