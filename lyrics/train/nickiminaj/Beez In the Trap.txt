Yo, Man, Man, Uhh

[Chorus]
Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothin
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

[Nicki Minaj]
Man I been did that, man I been popped off
And if she aint tryna give it up she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ey, Bitch bust that open
Might spend a couple thou just to bust that open
Rip it off, no jokin
Like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight and sell but live in Houbouken
Bitch, I spit that crack like Im in that trap
So if you need a hit then Im with that bat

[Chorus]
Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothin
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

[2 Chainz]
Okay now Nicki Nicki Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, aint no keys in this do-hicky
If I werent rappin I be trappin
If I werent trappin I be pimpin
If I werent pimpin I be gettin it, period
I dont smoke no Bobby, but my denim be from Ricky
Got your girl Amalie and we smoke loud and drinkin
Got my talk back so you can see what I been thinkin
If you know me then you know Ive been think Franklin
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers
Got a private home, started from the public houses
Hair weave killer, causing her arousal
Audi A8, told them Audi 5000, uh

[Chorus]
Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothin
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Damn, damn what they say about me?
I unno man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hits swingin on a big bitch
I unno man, Im shittin on your whole life

Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothin
A hundred mothafuckaz cant tell me nothin
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

[Nicki Minaj]
Man, Im out in Texas
Man, Im out in A-Town
Then Im up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin it down
This that New Orleans, its LA or the Bay
Its New York, Philly
And the whole DMV
Im a Detroit playa, man its north south cats
Ohio Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck
Its Delaware, Connecticut, its New Jersey got hella bricks
Its Queens, Brooklyn and yeah they wildin
Bronx, Harlem, and Staten Island

[Hook]
Bitches aint shit and they aint saying nothin
A hundred mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Damn, damn what they say about me?
Iunno man, fuckers on your biscuit
If I get hits swingin on a big bitch
Iunno man, Im shittin on your whole life

Damn, damn what they say about me?
Iunno man, fuckers on your biscuit
If I get hits swingin on a big bitch
Iunno man, Im shittin on your whole life---Lyrics submitted by jasmine molett.
