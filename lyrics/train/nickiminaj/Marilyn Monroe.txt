I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes I feel like Marilyn Monroe
Im insecure yeah I make mistakes
Sometimes I feel like Im at the end of the road

I can get low I can get low
Dont know which way is up
Yeah I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you cant handle my worst
You aint getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt

Its like all the good things
They fall apart like
Like Marilyn Monroe

Truth is we mess up
Till we get it right
I don't want to end up losing my soul

I can get low, I can get low
Dont know which way is up
Yea I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you cant handle my worst
You aint getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt

Take me or leave me
Ill never be perfect
Believe me Im worth it
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)

Call it a curse or just call
Me blessed if you can't handle
My worst you ain't getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt
Felt, felt? Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt,
Felt, felt, felt

Is this how Marilyn Monroe
Felt, felt, felt, felt must be how
Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?---Lyrics submitted by Storm BIeber.
