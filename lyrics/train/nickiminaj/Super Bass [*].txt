[Nicki Minaj - Verse 1]
This one is for the boys with the booming system
Top down, AC with the cooler system
When he come up in the club, he be blazin up
Got stacks on deck like he savin up
And he ill, he real, he might gotta deal
He pop bottles and he got the right kind of bill
He cold, he dope, he might sell coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach
He a muthafuckin trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When he make it drip, drip kiss him on the lip, lip
Thats the kind of dude I was lookin for
And yes youll get slapped if youre lookin hoe
I said, excuse me youre a hell of a guy
I mean my, my, my, my youre like pelican fly
I mean, youre so shy and Im loving your tie
Youre like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell him who the F I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up, back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up

[Chorus - Ester Dean & Nicki Minaj]
Boy you got my heartbeat runnin away
Beating like a drum and its coming your way
Cant you hear that boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass
Yeah thats that super bass
Got that super bass boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass
Yeah thats that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, he got that super bass
boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, he got that super bass

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]
This one is for the boys in the polos
Entrepeneur niggas and them moguls
He could ball with the crew, he could solo
But I think I like him better when he dolo
And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He aint even gotta try to put the mac on
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look
Then the panties comin off, off, uh
Excuse me, youre a hell of a guy you know I really got a thing for American guys
I mean, sigh, sickenin eyes I can tell that youre in touch with your feminine side
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell him who the eff I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up, back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up

[Chorus - Ester Dean & Nicki Minaj]

[Hook]
See I need you in my life for me to stay
No, no, no, no, no I know youll stay
No, no, no, no, no dont go away
Boy you got my heartbeat runnin away
Dont you hear that heartbeat comin your way
Oh it be like, boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass
Cant you hear that boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass

[Chorus - Ester Dean & Nicki Minaj]
Boy you got my heartbeat runnin away
Beating like a drum and its coming your way
Cant you hear that boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass
