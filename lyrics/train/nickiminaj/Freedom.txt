[Verse 1]
Don't ever thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful
I remain a staple
My career's been the pink print
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine
Baby & Slim came
Tez & E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing
I could've went insane
And even now I think do I really want this fame
Let me get up and go, 700 to go
Overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man I'm birthing these artists
And I'm starting to show

[Hook (x2)]
I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn a L
Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

[Verse 2]
Who I wanna work with? Nobody
99% of dem, is nobody
bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get ya approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on dem Ramen Noodles
B-b-b-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital
I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's
Thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? Cause I must've missed it)
12 milli to kick me feet up
Get ready this is the RE-UP

[Hook (x2)]
I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn a L
Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What you hiding from?
What you hiding from?

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What you hiding from?
What you hiding from?
Hiding baby

Would you, would you
Give ya
Would you, would you
Give ya
Would you, would you
Give ya all for you
[x2]

[Hook (x2)]
I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn a L
Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here ---Lyrics submitted by Dianna Eliseaeja Arthurton.
