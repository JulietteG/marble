Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Im angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

Hey yo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doing wasnt tasteful
Even though you out here looking so ungrateful
Imma keep it moving, be classy and graceful
I told em it's no friends in the game
You aint learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, dont burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas aint earned that yet
Self-righteous, and entitled
But they swearing on the Bible that they love you
When really theyre no different from all your rivals
But I still dont wish death on them, I just reflect on them

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Im angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

Yo, people will love you and support when its beneficial
Imma forgive, I wont forget, but Imma dead the issue
Soon as you out the nigga's lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they cant come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when Im causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for them, cop cribs in the Hills on 'em

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Im angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time, we'll be fine
In due time...

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love ---
