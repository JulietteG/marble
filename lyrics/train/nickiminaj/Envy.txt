[Chorus:]
Envy
All they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that envy?
Why would they offend me?
Why they go against me don't they no I'm comin back swinging for that ass?

Swingin for sw-sw-sw-swingin fo sw-swingin for
Sw-sw-sw-swingin for [x2]



[Verse 1:]
Now every club promoter wanna they bid like auctions
Cause I pack shows sells ticks like boston
Pat yaour back hoe, why the fuck they coughing?
Oh I got them sick better get that coffin
I say coffin you can say caskett
They're so trash but wheres my waste basket
Wheres my hat and wheres my straight jacket
Yep they jacking back to maybachin'
Everything I do bitches wanna do it too
I guess, guess you just skip to my loo
I just came through I flew to St.Lou
Back to kill you they blow like HQ
Why is it that they make nicki a target
Just cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps they marketed sex
M-market with an x, they talkin' them checks now

[Chorus:]
Envy
All they do is envy
Don't they kno it's in me?
Don't dey kno I'm comin back, swinging for that envy
Why would they offend me
Why they go against me dnt they no I'm comin back swingin for that ass

Swingin fo sw-sw-sw-swingin fo sw-swingin fo
Sw-sw-sw-swingin fo [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Yo, why did you envy? why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why when I needed it why you could'nt lend me?
Why you were secretive? frontin' like you friendly
Why did you fear that? held my career back
Kick it like air max I don't wanna hear that
Cause now I see, see, see, see all ya run down
Niggas bettah have my money by sun down
Cause now when I come thru I'm stlyin on em
It's like I got hotta then islands on em
They say she got colder than igloos. did she?
I'm in a GT she in a mitshubishi
Just left mr. miogi tell dat bytch jump if that bytch feel froggy
Cause I got one leg up in da middle of the ring
And da bytch betta duck when da bell go DING!

[Chorus:]
