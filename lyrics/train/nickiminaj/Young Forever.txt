[Verse One]
I used to think that we'd run away.
one lovely, pretty summer day.
i remember when you would say
"we'd be ok, come one may".
I never knew you would lie to me
take everything from inside of me.
your silhouette in the door way.
but before you wake away.

(bridge)

just say goodbye look in my eyes.
so that i always will remember.
frozen in time, always be mine.
baby boy you'll be young forever.
I'll be over here, you'll be over there.
Im'a shed a tear but i really don't care.
Frozen in time, always be mine.
 baby boy you'll be young forever.

[Verse Two]

I used to think that we'd reunite.
I'd be your wife, in the real life.
I thought that you'd come back for me.
and you would take me away.
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dreams.
your silhouette in the door way.
but before you wake away.


(bridge)

just say goodbye look in my eyes.
so that i always will remember.
frozen in time, always be mine.
baby boy you'll be young forever.
I'll be over here, you'll be over there.
Im'a shed a tear but i really don't care.
Frozen in time, always be mine.
 baby boy you'll be young forever.

[Verse Three]

This is my last cry.
Is this the only way?
this is my own prison.
i'm frozen in in time, in time, in time.

(bridge)

Don't say goodbye look in my eyes.
so that i always will remember.
frozen in time, always be mine.
baby boy you'll be young forever.
I'll be over here, you'll be over there.
Im'a shed a tear but i really don't care.
Frozen in time, always be mine.
 baby boy you'll be young forever.

You'll always be mine.
Frozen in time
Young Forever.---Lyrics submitted by Justyce Santos.
