[Verse 1]
Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

[Chorus]
(And now the people)
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

[Verse 2]
Am I being a fool?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I keep thinking you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

[Chorus + Violin Solo]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
