(Chorus)

I Came to Win
To Fiqht 
To Conquer
To Thrive
I Came to Win
To survive 
To Prosper
To Rise

To Flyyyyyy To Flyyyyyyy

I Wish Today will Rain all Day 
Maybe tat Will Kinda make the
Pain Go Awaie
Tryin to Forqive You for
Abandonninq Me
Prayinq Buhh i Think still im am an angel 
Awaie
Angel awaie yeah Stranqe in ah Way
Maybe tat is Why i Chase
Strangers Awaie
They got there Guns Out
aiminq at meh
me me me aqainst them
Me aqainst enemies
Me aqainst friends
Somehow they both seem 2 Becum Une 
A Sea ful of Sharks
And dey all smell Blood
They start cuminq Nd i start Risinq
Must bee suprisinq im juss Summisinq
I Win Thrive, Sore, Higher Higher More Fire

(Chorus)

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Sufuccatinq everytime it locks me in
Paint they own pictures than dey crop me in
But i will remain were the tops begins
Cus i am not ah wurd
I am not ah Line
I am not ah gurl tat can every be defined
I am not Fly I am Levitation 
I Represent an entire Genaration
I Hear the critisism Loud nd Clear
That is how i noe tat the time is near
So we becum alive in ah time of fear
I aint got no Muthafuckinq Time to spare
Cry my eyes out for Days Upon Days
Such ah heavy burden placed Upon me
Buh wen u go hard Yur nays Becum Yays
yankee Stadium with jays and Kanyes

(Chorus)

Get ready for it
Get ready for it 
Get ready for it
I Came to win
Get ready for it 
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
