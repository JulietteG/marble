You must be thinking something 
But you aint saying nothing 
You remember me, I used to be your boyfriend 
There aint no point in reason 
It only gets defensive 
And why should we ruin the purity of the moment 
Its a Laugh 
What a laugh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh 
And the funny thing is that everyone thought we were special 
Maybe I should feel guilty 
Is that the American way 
But I just look at myself 
As if I were above me 
You must be thinking something 
But you aint saying nothing 
You remember me, I have been here always 
I am here forever---
