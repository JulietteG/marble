You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness
Like before in your finger tips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

There's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And girl you're starting to
Criticize little things I do
Ooh, it makes me just feel like cryin' (baby)
'Cause baby something beautiful's dyin'

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Baby baby I get down on my knees for you
(Get down on my knees)
If you would only love me
Like you used to
(If you would only love me, love me)
We had a love, a love, a love
You don't find everyday
(A love you don't find)
So don't, don't, don't
Let it slip away (away)

I said baby
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
(I'm beggin you please)
I'm begging you please
I need your love
(I need your love)
I need your love
So bring it on back
(Bring it on back)
Ah, bring it on back
Now bring it on back

You've got to
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone

Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone---
