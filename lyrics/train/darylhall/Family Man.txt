She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose
As she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain
That she was his for a price

But he said, leave me alone
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said, leave me alone
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her make-up
To protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear
That she was his for a night

But he said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

She gave him her look
It would've worked
On any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide
If he should hold his ground

But he said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

She turned, tossed her head
Unlike her opening move
Her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up
She was gone

Then he screamed (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
And my bark
Is much worse than my bite
He said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

He said (leave me alone)
I'm a (family man)
And I don't think I want tonight
And he said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might
He said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
If you push me too far
I just might
He said (leave me alone)
I'm a family man
Leave me alone
'Cause I've got to go home---
