"Differently" (LEO Acoustic Live)

You got me looking at things
a little different
Changing all the meanings
Breaking all the ceilings and windows
got me looking at things
you got me looking at things a little different
got me looking past my life conditions
Letting go of wishful thinking
Letting go of all that happened to me
got me looking at things
you got me looking at things a little different

you can say my mind has changed my bit
you can say my mind has changed from being counterfeit
i wanna be real, i wanna be one hundred with you

that means i gotta start
opening my heart
shutting down perceptions that makes it so hard

damn nearly impossible to fall in love 
when constantly on gaurd

but the walls keep coming down
you keep shining a light when you're around 
so now i see things differently 

You got me looking at things
a little different
Changing all the meanings
Breaking all the ceilings and windows
got me looking at things
you got me looking at things a little different
got me looking past my life conditions
Letting go of wishful thinking
Letting go of all that happened to me
got me looking at things
you got me looking at things a little different

yeah, yeah nothings the same
i used to spend my time strolling down memory lane
but since you came around
things are different now
your presence brought me back to the present
the greatest present's right now

so right now is where i live
and my heart is what i give
to you, i give my heart to you 

cause the walls keep coming down
you keep shining a light when you're around 
so now i see things differently 

You got me looking at things
a little different
Changing all the meanings
Breaking all the ceilings and windows
got me looking at things
you got me looking at things a little different
got me looking past my life conditions
Letting go of wishful thinking
Letting go of all that happened to me
got me looking at things
got me looking at things a little different

i held an idea in my head
who id spend the rest of my life with
so i felt stuck 
until your love changed things up

i held an idea in my head
who id spend the rest of my life with
so i felt stuck 
until your love changed things up

so now i'm free
free to love
so now i'm free yeah
free to love
so now that i'm free
i'm free to love
so now that i'm free
I'm free to love you---Lyrics submitted by LEO.
