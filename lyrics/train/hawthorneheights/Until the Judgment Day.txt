your hallow 
and shallow
all the cowards sat in silence
its so hard
to swallow
when your someone that nobody wants
im the one asking questions here
about all the devils and tyrants
i hope you hear me loud and clear
i'll be the only one speaking out

just call my name out loud

just call my name
when it feels like your slippin away
dont look back dont you ever look back
until we meet again 

just call my name 
when it feels like your slippin away
dont look back dont you ever look back
until the judgement day

we're battered
and broken
all the members sat in frustration
we're not gettin any younger here
so how about a declaration

just call my name out loud

just call my name 
when it feels like your slippin away
dont look back dont you ever look back
until we meet again

just call my name
when it feels like your slippin away
dont look back dont you ever look back 
until the judgement day

battered
and broken 
these words
are spoken in despair

we're battered and broken 
these words are spoken in despair
and you dont even care
(repeat 3x)

just call my name
when it feels like your slippin away
dont look back dont you ever look back
until the judgement day

just call my name
when it feels like your slippin away
(when it feels like your slippin away)
dont look back done you ever look back
until we meet again

just call my name
when it feels like your slippin away 
(when it feels like your slippin away)
dont look back dont you ever look back
until the judgement day---Lyrics submitted by Alesha.
