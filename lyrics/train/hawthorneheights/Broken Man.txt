Doctor, doctor, can you please check my pulse? 
It's beating slower, you told me I should expect the worst
I know my days are numbered now, just a few more months to go
I'll say my last goodbyes, farewell, kiss the one I love the most

Pick up the pieces of myself, pull me back together now

I'm just a man who was meant to be broken
A lost soul whose life is winding down
My time is running out
Just a man whose dream had been stolen
A lost soul whose pulse is winding down
My time is running out

Doctor, doctor, can I have the good news first?
I'm not feeling well and I can tell you just don't have the cure

Pick up the pieces of myself, pull me back together now

I'm just a man who was meant to be broken
A lost soul whose life is winding down
My time is running out
Just a man whose dream had been stolen
A lost soul whose pulse is winding down
My time is running out

Now I know the end is near, I'll call you off to face my fears alone
And I'm dying dear, so let me go, just let me go

Pick up the pieces of myself, pull me back together now

I'm just a man who was meant to be broken
A lost soul whose life is winding down
My time is running out
Just a man whose dream had been stolen
A lost soul whose pulse is winding down
My time is running out.---Lyrics submitted by thomas sands.
