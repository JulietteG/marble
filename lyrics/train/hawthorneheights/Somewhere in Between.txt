You're an angel, I'm a devil
But we'll meet somewhere in between.
Heaven, Hell, or the bedroom,
I'll take you away from everything.
You're a dream and I'm a nightmare
But we'll meet somewhere in between.
Your sheets, your covers, and the headboard.
I'll be a king if you are a queen.

I just fell in love for the first time,
Watch as I move myself up off the ground.
In the dark I'm so far from the spotlight,
Can You see me now?

I turn my back 
And walk away, away from the pain.
Screaming loud, 
Drowning out from the sound of the rain
Listen up, 
I've had enough of all this waiting.
I need you more right now than I ever did.

You're the minutes, I'm the hours.
But we'll meet somewhere in between.
Never, now, or too soon,
I say we meet at a quarter till three.

I just fell in love for the first time,
Watch as I move myself up off the ground.
In the dark I'm so far from the spotlight,
Can You see me now?

I turn my back 
And walk away, away from the pain.
Screaming loud, 
Drowning out from the sound of the rain
Listen up, 
I've had enough of all this waiting.
I need you more right now than I ever did.

I turn my back 
And walk away, away from the pain.
Screaming loud, 
Drowning out from the sound of the rain
Listen up, 
I've had enough of all this waiting.
I need you more right now than I ever did.---Lyrics submitted by Mikayla.
