Breathing in the same sequence
while trying to make sense of your situation
that we got ourselves in
two more weeks of one way conversation
she says she's losing interest
i swear we are best friends till the end

this could be the plans for revenge
but these words lead to dead ends

so close your eyes and kiss me like its our last time
these lips need medication, these days are dripping poison, girl
days turn to nights, i wish on the star in the sky
be careful of the brightest, beauty is on the inside

i wish i could but i know i can't take it back
it's serious just like heart attacks
my personality, avoid the scenery
i hate playing games with the industry
that fuels these dreams and turns them down
when my heart break it makes a sound

this could be the plans for revenge
but these words lead to dead ends

so close your eyes and kiss me like it's our last time
these lips need medication, these days are dripping poison, girl
days turn to nights i wish on the star in the sky
be careful of the brightest, beauty is on the inside

so close your eyes and kiss me like it's our last time
these lips need medication, these days are dripping poison, girl
days turn to nights i wish on the star in the sky
beauty is on the inside, beauty is on the inside---Lyrics submitted by Shelby Tahy.
