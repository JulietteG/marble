Swim through these waters
my lungs collapse as I'm gasping for air
I'll breathe you in (I'll breathe you in)
you are my oxygen alone

ALONEEE

Through arteries untold
your skin is pale
my body's cold
Way down deep down
in my lungs
I can hear our sweet decay

So spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
midnight skies turn scarlet red

say "so long,"
say "goodnight,"
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if I fall into the night

say "so long,"
say "goodnight,"
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall

Everyone and everythings
feels like it slipped away
way down deep down in my lungs
i can hear you as you fade

so spill my blood (SO SPILL MY BLOOD)
midnight skies turn scarlet red

say "so long,"
say "goodnight,"
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall into the night

say "so long,"
say "goodnight,"
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall

wake me up, from this nightmare
wake me up, i know that i am drowning
in the blood

wake me up, from this nightmare
wake me up, i know (say so long) i am drowning (say goodbye)
in (say so long) the blood from a pitch black heart

CUT MY THROAT
SPILL MY BLOOD
CUT MY THROAT
SPILL MY BLOOD
PITCH BLACK HEART

say "so long,"
say "goodnight,"
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall into the night

say "so long,"
say "goodnight,"
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
