So here we are,
 back to the start again,
trying hard to wait till morning.
Hey rise and shine and open up your eyes
to give this world some color!
Shine on diamond eyes,
seperate the space between love and lies.

[chorus]
And as days go by, the memories remain.
I'll wait for you.
And as days go by, the memories remain.
I won't let go.
These days remain the same, pictures fade away. (I hope you never fade)

Please don't ever change-
please dont change your mind.
No matter what they say-
I'll always wait.
And as days go by, memories remain.
I'll wait for you.


As you drift through my veins.
Shine on, shine on, shine on diamond eyes (X3)

And as days go by, the memories remain,
I'll wait for you.
As days go by, I swear I'll try.
(I'll wait for you) until I die,
anything for you.
As days go by, I swear I'll try.---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
