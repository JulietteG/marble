Sleep, sleep little darling
I swear I'm not trying to wear you out
I'm not trying to drag you down

When you fall asleep tonight
They'll be waiting for you
When you try and close your eyes
They'll try not to hate you
Sleep sleep the night away
Act like nothing's wrong
You know we're going down

You are such a light sleeper
Count to ten and you're already up
We fall, we're in deeper
The night's gone as we open up our eyes

nine ten (nine,ten)
We'll never sleep again
We try.(we try)
We know we'll never win.
At least(at least)
we know we'll make it out alive.
At least 
we know we'll make it out this time.

You are such a light sleeper
Count to ten and you're already up
We fall, we're in deeper
The night's gone as we open up our eyes

We fall (We fall)
We know that we can make it now
We fall (We fall)
We know that we can break this down
(We can break this down)

We hear what you're saying (saying)
Not enough so we keep playing
This game is what you make it (make it)
One chance so why not take it?

You are such a light sleeper
Count to ten and you're already up
We fall, we're in deeper
The night's gone as we open up our eyes

Such a light sleeper

Sleep sleep little darling
I swear I'm not trying to wear you out
I'm not trying to drag you down---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
