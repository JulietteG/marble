Got my heart made up on you
Oooh, oooh, oooh

You said what you said
When would you not just try not to forget
But something in my head my wouldn't set
Can't kill up on a shed
No, wo-oh
Your love was so real
It pulled me in just like a magnetic field
I'd let you go but something's taking my wheel
Yeah it's taking the wheel
Oh, wo-oh

My mind says, no you're not good for me
You're not good but my heart's made up on you
My heart you can't take what you get to me
What you get, got my heart made up on you
Wo-ooh, Wo-ooh
Got my heart made up on you

'Cause you'll be making it rain
Upon they're thinking I'm planning my escape
But this is something I ain't going nowhere
And I want back at your place
Oh, no

My mind says, no you're not good for me
You're not good but my heart's made up on you
My heart you can't take what you get to me
What you get, got my heart made up on you
Wo-ooh, Wo-ooh
Got my heart made up on you

Look what you did, what you did
What you're doing to me
You got me searching for the worst, like a silent movie
Love can be, love can see you as someone I can trust
But baby you only see my eyes are up on medical

Got my heart made up on you

My mind says, no you're not good for me
You're not good but my heart's made up on you
My heart you can't take what you get to me
What you get, got my heart made up on you
Wo-ooh, Wo-ooh
Got my heart made up on you

My mind says no
Got my heart made up on you
Up on you, up on you---
