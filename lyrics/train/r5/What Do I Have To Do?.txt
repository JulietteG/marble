Listen,
You've got them all hynotized
Dragging them round by the eyes
They line up shoulder to shoulder
Like dominoes, you keep knocking them over
And all them fools got diamond rings just waiting for you
And I can't fool myself but we both know it's true

'Cause you walk into the room, girl you know you got it
Baby look around, you got a lot of options
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?
You're looking like a queen, walking through the palace
Falling on my knees, baby, losing balance
What do I have to do? O-ooh

To be the lady's choice
Oh, oh yeah
Your lips got me wondering why
I'm tangled in lame pick up lines
Something is taking over (Something is taking over)
You got my heart set on roller coaster
I'm chasing you around
You got your leash on me too
I wish I could pull myself but we both know it's true

'Cause you walk into the room, girl you know you got it
Baby look around, you got a lot of options
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?
You're looking like a queen, walking through the palace
Falling on my knees, baby, losing balance
What do I have to do? O-ooh

See I will fly you to Paris, I'll even learn the language
Vous avez de trs beux yeaux
Ooh, so beautiful
Climb the Eiffel Tower
Touch the moon and call it ours, yeah

'Cause it never shines as bright as you
When you walk into the room, I never had a chance
Tell me, what do I have to do? (What do I have to do?)
What do I have to do?
'Cause you walk into the room, girl you know you got it
Baby look around, you got a lot of options
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?

You're looking like a queen, walking through the palace
Falling on my knees, baby, losing balance
What do I have to do? O-ooh
To be the lady's choice
Hoooo---Lyrics submitted by Heidi Moore.
