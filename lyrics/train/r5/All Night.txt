We're staying all night
Got blue jean baby playing in my mind
She gets me so high
Giving me faith I gotta testify
And the way that she walks I cant hide it
If I said I don't like it I'm lying

Hold tight
A little bit of love will change your life
She said I'm outta my head I'm going outta my mind
And when I'm out on the edge will you save me, save me
Can we live for the moment?
Can you live for tonight?
Can we forget what was broken?
And say, say, say, we'll be

All right
'Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night

And now its midnight
and I can feel your electricity
Give me that skin tight
Good girls ain't ever making history, nope
And we'll dance in the streets till the morning
Never sleep when the city is calling

Hold tight
A little bit of love will change your life
She said I'm outta my head I'm going outta my mind
And when I'm out on the edge will you save me
Save me
Can we live for the moment
Can we live for tonight
Can we forget what was broken and say, say, say we'll be

All right
'Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night

We'll be all right
We'll be all right
We'll be all right
We'll be all right

And we got nothing but time
(we'll be all right)
To make the most of this life
(we'll be all right)
Take on the wrongs and the rights
(we'll be all right)
Forget them all and just say, say, say
oh, won't you say it now
We'll be all right

All right
'Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All right
'Cause even if we change we'll always be the same
All night
I promise if you stay we'll never fade away
All night

All night---
