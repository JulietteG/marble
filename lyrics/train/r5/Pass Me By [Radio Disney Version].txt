Remember that trip we took in Mexico, yeah,
Hanging with the boys and all your seoritas,
I never spoke up, yeah, I never said hello,
But I keep on trying to find a way to meet ya,
Yeah,

I was chillin, you were with him,
ed up by the fire,
Now he's long gone, I'm like "so long",
Now I got my chance, now I, now I got my chance

Like damn, you could be the one that could mess me up,
You could be the one that'll break me down,
All them other girls said they had enough,
You could be the one that'll take me,
I was solo, livin' yolo,
'Till you blew my mind
Like damn, you could be the one that could mess me up,
I can't let you, can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!

I was tryna play too cool to get caught up,
Like, too fun, too young, to fall to pieces
I know a girl like you can't ever get enough
So I'm addicted, trippin, tryna get you to see this

The way I need you, like I'm see-through,
Dancin' out my pants,
Got you shooken, got you lookin',
Now I got my chance, now I, now I got my chance!

Like damn, you could be the one that could mess me up,
You could be the one that'll break me down,
All them other girls said they had enough,
You could be the one that'll take me,
I was solo, living yolo,
'Till you blew my mind
Like damn, you could be the one that could mess me up,
I can't let you, can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!

It's like everywhere I'm lookin', everywhere I go,
A million other guys keep staring and I know that
I could be yours, and you could be mine,
I just can't let you pass me by, by, by
Everywhere I'm lookin, everywhere I go
A million other guys keep staring and I know that
I could be yours, and you could be mine,
I just can't let you pass me by, by, by

Like damn, you could be the one that could mess me up,
You could be the one that'll break me down,
All them other girls said they had enough,
You could be the one that'll take me,
I was solo, living yolo,
'Till you blew my mind
Like damn, you could be the one that could mess me up,
I can't let you, can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh (yeah girl)
I can't let you pass me by!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I can't let you pass me by!---Lyrics submitted by lennon nicole herron.
