Remember that trip we took in Mexico
Yeah
Hanging with the boys and all your senoritas
I never spoke up yeah never said hello
But I keep on trying to find a way to meet ya
Yeah
I was chilling you were with him
Hooked up by fire
Now his long gone
Now I'm solo
Now I've got my chance
Now I now got my chance

Like damn
You can be the one I can mess me up
You can be the one that can break me
Damn
All them other girls said they had enough
You can be the one that take me
I was solo
Living YOLO
Till you blew my mind
Like damn
You can be the one I can mess me up
I can't let you
Can't let you pass me by
Oh oh oh
I can't let you pass me by
Oh oh oh
I can't let you pass me by

I was trying to play too cool to get cup up
Like, to fun to young to fall in pieces
I know what girls like you can never get enough
So I'm addicted, drippin', trying to get you to see this
The way I need you like I see through
Dancing out my pants
Got you shooking, got your looking
Now I've got my chance
Now I now got my chance

Like damn
You can be the one I can mess me up
You can be the one that can break me
Damn
All them other girls said they had enough
You can be the one that take me
I was solo
Living YOLO
Till you blew my mind
Like damn
You can be the one I can mess me up
I can't let you
Can't let you pass me by
Oh oh oh
I can't let you pass me by
Oh oh oh
I can't let you pass me by

Everywhere I'm looking, everywhere I go
A million other guys be staring and I know that
I can be yours and you can be mine
I just can't let you pass me by.. by.. by
