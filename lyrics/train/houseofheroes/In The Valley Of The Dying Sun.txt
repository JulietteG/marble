in the valley of the dying sun
i walk a crooked path alone
i came across a shadow of a man
with an angel's breath

"oh boy" he said to me
"i see your future
though you long for peace
the sword is your father"

i'm thinkin' of you
i'm thinkin' of you when i kill a good man
(to keep myself from being killed from him)
i'm thinkin' of you
i'm thinkin' of you when i hold my girl
(and wonder if she'll ever love again)

i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin of you
(wash the blood off my hands)
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of you

bathed in the powder of a thousand guns
i am the king of sorrows
watered by the tears of the innocent ones
the river grows
it moves
it swells

'son' it calls to me
'your days are numbered
sow the seeds you will
but i am the reaper'

i'm thinkin' of you
i'm thinkin' of you when you kill a good man
(to keep yourself from being killed from him)
i'm thinkin' of you
i'm thinkin' of you when you hold your girl
(and wonder if she'll ever love again)

i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin of you
(wash the blood off your hands)
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of
i'm thinkin' of you

i howled at the moon like a wolf in the night
you wanna finish it
we're gonna finish it right

and then i felt it with a chill up my spine
there are no words to use that truly describe
the glory of the angel or the terror in me
tonight will my ending or tonight my new beginning

all through the night
i wrestled the angel
to undo the curse
that's burdened me all of my life

and for the first time i could see
that God was not my enemy
i'm thinkin' of you
(for the first time i could see)
i'm thinkin' of you
i'm thinkin' of you
(that God was not my enemy)
i'm thinkin' of you

like pieces of the sun
our life burns on and on and on
like stars in the night sky
we shine

i'm living to shine on
i'm living to shine on
i'm living to shine on
i'm living to shine on
i'm living to shine on
i'm living to shine on

i'm shinin' on---Lyrics submitted by chrissy.
