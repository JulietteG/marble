Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

Whale swim with me whale
we will go far into the sea
you will take me, onto your back
never look back
never look back

Whale sing to me whale
sing me a song
tell me that thing will never go wrong
hide me away
don't let them stay
don't let them stay

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

Whale come with me whale
we will go far into the blue
I will take you
listen to me
then you will see
then you will see

Whale don't worry whale
just do as you please 
I will accept if you'd rather leave
open my heart to 
open your heart
open your heart

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

I've been swimming for a thousand years and I
have seen more than you can realize
I accept that you will never understand
so I will gladly take your hand

Whale come with me.. whale
we will go far
into the sea
you will take me onto your back
never look back
never look back
never look back
never look back

Whale come with me whale
we will go far into the blue
I will take you
listen to me
then you will see
then you will see

Whale don't worry whale
just do as you please 
I will accept if you'd rather leave
open my heart to 
open your heart
open your heart

...whale

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...---Lyrics submitted by Emery Butler.
