My latest sun is setting fast,
My race is nearly run.
My strongest trials now are past,
My triumph has begun.
       *chorus*
Oh come,Angel band,
Come and around me stand,
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings,
To my immortal home.
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings,
To my immortal home.

Oh bear my longing heart to Him,
who bled and died for me.
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin,
And gives me victory.
    *repeat chorus*---Lyrics submitted by Sandi.
