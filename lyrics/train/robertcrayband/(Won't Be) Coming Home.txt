As her car pulls out the driveway 
And she dont wave goodbye 
Her last words echo in my mind 
Listen honey, i gotta get away 

Im standing here watching her tail lights 
As if theyre some kind of sign 
Fading into a memory 
I just got tired of trying 

So long, i hate to see you go 
So i save my tears for later on down the road 
How come i keep i holding on 
Knowing you wont be coming home 

Two days later i get a letter 
A picture of a room in some hotel 
Sitting framed up on the table, 
A picture i know so well 
Youve painted yourself in to a corner 
Now youre trying to paint something new 
And your lipstick on the letter 
Is a goodbye kiss from you 

So long, i hate to see you go 
So i save my tears for later on down the road 
How come i keep i holding on 
Knowing you wont be coming home 

I still set the table 
Still set it for you and me 
Its become a habit 
My own personal make believe 

So long, i hate to see you go 
So i save my tears for later on down the road 
How come i keeW i holding on 
Knowing you wont be coming home
