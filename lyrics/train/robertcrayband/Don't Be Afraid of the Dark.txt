Dead of the night baby
We're finally alone
I'll pull up the shades
If you'll unplug the phone

Put on some music
Marvin Gaye's real nice
Once we get settled
I'll turn off the lights

Don't be afraid of the dark
Don't be afraid of the dark
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark

It might be scary
Til your eyes adjust
Don't fear the shadows
Me you can trust

I'm at my best
In a pitch black room
Hold on tight baby
You'll feel the power soon

Don't be afraid of the dark
Don't be afraid of the dark
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark

You might tremble
You might shake
Scream out loud
You may even pray

I know which moves
Suit you right
You'll beg for more
You'll forget about the night

Don't be afraid of the dark
Baby, no, no
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark
Don't be afraid of the dark
Baby, no, no
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark
Hey, baby, no, no, no
I'll be there to hold you
Don't be afraid of the dark---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
