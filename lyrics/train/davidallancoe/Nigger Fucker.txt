She said someday I'd understand what love was all about. She said I could have the keys she was movin out. She said she finally found a man whose dick was so much bigger. Then that scumbag motherfucker ran off with a nigger and to think I licked that pussy where that big black dick had been and kissed the lips where that sucked him off time and time again. It's enough to make a man to throw up. Sure is hard to figure how any decent white girl would ever fuck a greasy nigger.
He treated her just like a queen. She gave him all my money. It looks like the jokes on me but I don't think it's funny. That pussy ain't worth payin foras far as I can figure cause there's nothin quite as worthless as a white girl with a nigger. And to think I licked the pussy where that big black dick had been and kissed the lips that sucked him off time and time again. It's enough to make a man throw up sure is hard to figure how any decent girl would ever fuck a god damn nigger. So for all you nigger lovin whores this song is just for you.---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
