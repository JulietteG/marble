The City lights, the pretty lights
They can warm the coldest nights
All the people going places,
Smiling with electric faces
what they find the glow erases,
what they lose the glow replaces,
and life is love.

In a Neon rainbow,
a neon rainbow

Moving lights, flashing signs,
blinking faster than your mind.
leading people with suggestions,
leaving no unanswered questions.
you can live without direction,
and it don't have to be perfection,
and life is love

In a neon rainbow
a neon rainbow

But in the daytime everything changes
nothing remains the same, no one smiles anymore
and no one will open his door
until the night time comes, and then the ...
City lights, the pretty lights
they can warm the coldest nights
all the people going places
smiling with the electric faces
what they find the glow erases
and what they lose the glow replaces,
and life is love.

In a neon rainbow
 a neon rainbow,
 a neon rainbow---Lyrics submitted by Max.
