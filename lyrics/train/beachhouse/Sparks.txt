We drive around this town
Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark

Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark

You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up
(Just like a spark)
It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again

Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it
Wave it
Alive---
