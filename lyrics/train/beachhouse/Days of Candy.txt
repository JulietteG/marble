No one could find you
Out on your own
All things I loved
But do not know

Our hope will rule
These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lights
Wide, fenced and wise

Across my eyes
A world inside you
No faltered ground
My natural one
The rising sun
Live in your mind

Just like that, it's gone
Just like that, it's gone
Just like that

I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
I hope, I feel, I know
A little bit of you will keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for nobody
I want to know you there
The universe is riding off with you---
