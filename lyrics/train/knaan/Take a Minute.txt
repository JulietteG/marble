Any man who knows a thing
He knows He knows not a damn damn thing at all
And everytime i felt the hurt
i felt the givin gettin me up off the wall
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it bre,e,ez.

How did Mendell get the will to surpass the everyday
When injustice had incaged and entrapped him every way
how did Ghandi withstand the hunger strikes in all?
he didnt do it to gain power or money if I recall.
It's a gift.
I guess I'll pass it on mother left the stress of Babaloyn.
Mother knows,
My mother she suffered blows,
i dont know how we survived such violent episodes.
i was so worried it hurt to see you bleed,
but as soon as you came out the hospital you gave me sweets, YEAHHH!
They tried to take you from me,
but you still only gave them some prayers and sympathy.
Dear mama,
You helped my write this by showing me to give is priceless.

And Any man who knows a thing
He knows He knows not a damn damn thing at all
And everytime i felt the hurt
i felt the givin gettin me up off the wall
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute bre,e,ez.

All i can say is the worse is over now,
We can serve the hard times divorce its over now.
They try to keep us out, but they doors is open now,
My man Akon is getting awards and covers now,
This is K'naan and still reppin the S
coming out mok-disha and still draped in the mess,
And no matter how we strung homie, it ain't easy coming out of where we from homie.
And its the reason why I can never play phonie,
Tell em' the truth is when my dead homies told me OOOO-YEAH!
I take inspiration from the most haters of situations
Creatin' medication out my own tripilation,
Dear Africa,
You helped me write this, by showing me to give is priceless.

And Any man who knows a thing
He knows He knows not a damn damn thing at all
And everytime i felt the hurt
i felt the givin gettin me up off the wall
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it bre,e,ez.

(nothing is perfect man,
that's what the world is, 
all i know is
im enjoying today,  you know,
cuz it ain't everday you get to give.)

And any man who knows a thing 
he knows he knows, not a damn damn thing at all.
And everytime i felt the hurt and I felt the givin' gettin' me up off the wall.
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it bre,e,ez.
(yea, yea, yea...)

(i ain't got nothing to complain about 
you know where im from
you know wher im at, 
you know im flying high)


And any man who knows a thing 
he knows he knows, not a damn damn thing at all.
And everytime i felt the hurt and I felt the givin' gettin' me up off the wall.
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
(Peace)
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it bre,e,ez.---Lyrics submitted by jelli.
