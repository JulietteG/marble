There's nothing like a trail of blood to find your way back home...

You can't quit until you try
You can't live until you die
You can't learn to tell the truth 
Until you learn to lie

You can't breathe until you choke
You gotta laugh when you're the joke
There's nothing like a funeral
To make you feel alive

Just open your eyes, just open your eyes
And see that Life is Beautiful
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?

I know some things that you don't
I've done things that you won't
There's nothing like a trail of blood
Till you find your way back home

I was waiting for my hearse
What came next was so much worse
It took a funeral to make me feel alive

Just open your eyes, just open your eyes
And see that Life is Beautiful
Will you swear on your life 
That no one will cry at my funeral?

Alive, just open your eyes, just open your eyes
And you see that Life is Beautiful
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?

Just open your eyes, just open your eyes
And see that Life is Beautiful
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?

When you've lost it all 
That's when you finally realize 
That Life is Beautiful!---Lyrics submitted by Jenn.
