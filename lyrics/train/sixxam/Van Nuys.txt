I don't want to die out here in the valley
Waiting for my luck to change
And I just want my dad to know
That I finally made it 

Everybody gets high
Everybody gets low
Everybody gets bruised
Everybody gets sold

I don't want to die out here in the valley
You don't have to lie,
I know that's what I'll do
I don't want my mom to know
That I never loved my life
And I sold my soul

Everybody gets high
Everybody gets low
Everybody gets bruised
Everybody gets sold
Everybody gets dark
Everybody unfolds
Everybody gets high
Everybody gets so low

And everyone's eyes are blue
And everyone's mouth is dry
And nobody wants to die
In Van Nuys
Van Nuys

Everybody gets high
Everybody gets low
Everybody gets bruised
Everybody gets sold
Everybody gets dark
Everybody unfolds
Everybody gets high
Everybody gets so low

Well you don't know how to get back to your crawlspace
Underneath the dirt and the rust and the waste
But the sun sets fast these days.

Everyone's eyes are blue
And everyone's mouth is dry
And nobody wants to die
In Van Nuys
Van Nuys

Everyone's eyes are blue
And everyone's mouth is dry
And nobody wants to die
In Van Nuys
Van--

Everyone's eyes are blue
And everyone's mouth is dry
And nobody wants to die
In Van Nuys, oh

Everyone's eyes are blue
And everyone's mouth is dry
And nobody wants to die
In Van Nuys
Van Nuys---Lyrics submitted by shelby.
