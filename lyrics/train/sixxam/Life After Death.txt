So were at the end and at the same time were at the beginning of this misadventure.

Why I had to go down a dead end street at 200 miles an hour screaming for vengence,and

embracing death. Thats something im still trying to figure out.You know part of me thinks this is

 all some big master plan to expose the raw nerve endings of disfunction so i can heal, but you 

know addicts we think everything is about us..dont we?




Man it got so convaluted, polluted,and distorted I ran with the only information I was given. I 

turned it into my armor, my defense mechicnism, and my weapon of self destruction.Yeah I had 

a fucked up child hood and I was a troubled teen. Those are facts. How i got there thats a story 

told by many voices.Its not my job to blame anybody anymore. I just need to except the path i 

was given.This is without a doubt my life after death.

life comes after death comes after 
life comes after death comes after
