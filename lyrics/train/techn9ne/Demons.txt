[**feat. Three 6 Mafia:]

[Chorus:]
When I was 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plotting, rotten to the core
It was nothin but an itty bitty demon
There's a demon inside a me can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)
There's a demon inside a me can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)

[Verse 1: ~Tech N9ne~]
Yo
It make me wanna drink a lot (ehr)
Go up in the pink wit not (ehr)
This the reason I ain't at ease and currently on the brink of pot (ehr)
This the reason I sit at the window with the milla wishin a nigga gon come break in (chaa)
It is the reason I be freakin the women deeper lovin makin her silly because I done they friend (chaa)
It is the reason I bang (chaa)
It is definately the reason I slang
DIstributed the caine
The reason I'm super soakin in the pain (ehr)
And startin to love it (ehr)
It's wantin to give me way more of it
They want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people I'm disgusted (chaa)
I'm talkin about those thangs that make you do bad things (chaa)
Livin the evil up in the fast lane (chaa)
Makin me wanna have? beatin the hell outta people makin me mad mayne (chaa)
Gave me the gun when I ran up in?dealins? in 9th grade
With a sligh rage I was ice age (chaa)
Another reason Tecca Nina won't have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness (ehr)
Voted me to be really heartless (ehr)
All up in my spirt they march they makin me start sparkin at the targets (ehr)
Woke up today I was steamin
Cuz when I found out I was not dreamin
Because the host that afloats me the most was a goddam demon (Demon, demon)

[Chorus:]
When I was 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plottin, rotten to the core
It was nothin but an itty bitty demon
There's a demon inside a me can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)
There's a demon inside a me can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)
Can I kill it (hell naw)

[DJ Paul:]
See it's a demon inside'a me n I'm thinkin its that dope
It's got me doin shit a nigga never'a never even done befoe
It got me kickin the doo'
Of folks I don't even know
Straight wildin
9-11 time a fuckin' thousand
Buck like burkly housin, my glock is so erousin
Make you stand a'ten hut the way that bitch be shoutin'
Somethin' like a scary movie, nigga but I'm scarier
Bury ya, Memphis Tenn black Heaven area
Buck nigga, get buck bitch, get wit' mey
'N I'mma show ya how this Tripple 6'll get sillay
Psycho, like no, other individual
Glock with the red beam to keep you in my visual
Three 6, n Tech Ninna, would'a like an Aquafina? Desert Eagle, 50 cal,
Tell me have ya seen'a - pussy juice, still on my shit
From this hoe I just raped

In a fuckin' hustla face, shot him in his fuckin face

When I was one, and a two, and a three, and a four
I knew, I was special one who a little more
And they, wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothin but an itty bitty demon

There's a demon inside'a me can I kill it?
Hell naw!
Can I kill it?
Hell naw!
Can I kill it?
Hell naw!
There's a demon inside'a me can I kill it?
Hell naw!
Can I kill it?
Hell naw!
Can I kill it?
Hell naw!

When I was one, and a two, and a three, and a four
I knew, I was special one who a little more
And they, wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothin but an itty bitty demon/
