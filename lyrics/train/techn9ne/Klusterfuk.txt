[Intro]
I was born in november, 8th day 1971st y'all
9 oclock in the mornin, a christian girl in kansas city gave birth y'all
She taught the kid how to love and give all praises to our maker till the earth fall
Then mama married a muslim when I was 12 and that transition was the worst y'all
I converted to Islam but every once in awhile I read a bible verse y'all
How am I to refrain from eatin pork and havin christmas when I thirst all
All of this it was blended many religions plenty women got my shirt y'all
At home no longer attended when I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball

[Verse]
Yeeeeah
Spit it big quick
My day, I slay, pie may, trick don't get a bitch hit (questionable)
I'm mastering it, I'm flyin around with equipment
Really big time and now I'm not fittin this bitch
I'm ridin around and I'm grittin it
To the people the people that want the evil I'm givin you, that and a couple others a KLUS-TER-FUK
Of a brother which you discover to KRUSH-MUCKS-UP
In the gutter cause I'm a thug and they TOUGH-JUST-STRUCK
On you MUUHFUCKAS I'll be the BLOOD BROTHA givin you LOVE FROM the SLUG if you BUG on a NIGGA
TUG on a trigger no HUGS I'm a kiss her with GRUNGES and PLUG her with DRUGS when I give her
DICK
Fatherly, when I spit on these kiddies don't bother me
In the brown and red dickies, Mahogany
Red all over me like I hit an artery
Fuck all of these, hypocrites, lick a dick, Just swallow me
If you follow me and wanted to abolish me
When I'm honestly, a straight oddity
I'm just twisted, non-fictitious, on this wicked, shit spit it big quick
Ready whenever machete will sever the head or be dead up in the lake or in the metal and big thick bricks
Pucker up, suck this nutter butter gutter slut
If you wonder what is uttered this is KLUSTERFUK
Ever seen a nigga with hella followers and they love a nigga so much he be wantin to tell them to kill
HA HA HA HA HAAAA, and they will
So ya better watch that, no this ain't a shock tactic got that bit down to the grill
Heheheheheheheeeeh, WAY REAL
I got the shit that get the crowd jumpin
My shit a lotta thumpin silly just like a DRUNKEN MONKEY
Nigga we PUNKIN FLUNKIES
Killa we KRUNK N FUNKY
Uhh... PUMPING CHUNKY
Uhh... BOOTY BITCHES IN THE BUNK WITH A DONKEY EH!

[Bridge]
Crazy, I might be way in my psyche laid as a bright p.a
Playin, they wanna fight me, they don't really like me, they gonna not replay
Yeah I'm good and a little bit of evil
Inside of me, they about equal
Call it a bust, when I'm all in a rut
I'm a Klusterfuk, nigga y'all are just
FECAL
Growin up low enough, musta sucked
PEOPLE
Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk
FECAL
Growin up low enough, musta sucked
PEOPLE
Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk

[Interlude]
Talk about growin up fucked up, I grew up with a mentally I'll mother, so it's no wonder that I'm slightly askew
Her fanatical religious views had me sittin in pews 8 days a week, and because of that me and God didn't speak for a while
Now I crack a smile when asked my religious preference
I utter a Tech N9ne reference replyin, I'm a KLUSTERFUK
I mixed up all the stuff religion that had to offer, boiled it in my cauldron till the bullshit burned off it
All that was left was love, I can't say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life cause I don't
Sometimes my ego won't allow me to walk away, if you know what I'm sayin
I've done a lot of drugs, shit, I've done a lot of thugs, but in the end
As long as I'm aligned with love, I KNOW I'm livin righteous

[Outro]
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy, (Growin up low enough, musta sucked)
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically, (Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk)
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy, (Growin up low enough, musta sucked)
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically, (Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk)
Love it when the fans buy my memories ---
