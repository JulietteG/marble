A lot of talent a chemical imbalance and MDMA (MDMA) I can't reroute it so people they hear bout it and ten to turn away (tend to turn away) 

[Verse 1:]
Kinetic you bet it's somethin' movin' your head its prophetic so get it embedded let it control your bodily, close to lettuce my head is far from synthetic, you credit this vet is poetic that is merely a part of me 

The other part it be wicked similar to psychotic we kick it we frolic sickness neurotic fought at the God in me, mixed with erotic on top of Hennessy and hypnotic you got it a solid super savage knowing no of comradery 

Don't won kill ya (somethin' in my head) is makin' me done deal ya (somethin' in my head) is making the gun fill ya (somethin' in my head) is makin' me won drill ya can we get familiar 

Check, always fantasizing on getting' sex, wettin' that and settin' Tech up on you carressin' breast, sweatin' that you'd get me vexed and not get your second breath, stressed you would've been left where you was beaconed at we neck and neck 

[Chorus:]
Everyone want go heaven, (yeah dem want go heaven) but nobody want dead, the place where I have no relaxation, is in my head 

Everyone want go heaven, (yeah dem want go heaven) but nobody want dead, liberate me Lord devastation, is in my head 

[Verse 2:]
I keep that one that'll heat ya, so you better like run better seat ya, might get found under the bleachers no one'll reach ya come 2 the creature cause in my head is a hole, dark and deep and it grows, actually capial G.O.D. have mercy on my soul 

I'm sick as I wanna be get the hell up from front of me when I spit at everybody yeah they gonna be feeling this 4 eternity, boss many thoughts pretty lost but I cost plenty sauce, soft killa crossed me tossed put 'em off in the moss 

Respect my mind everyone (somethin' in my head) says if he disrespect N9NE then he done (somethin' in my head) wishes I could put the 9 on his tongue, (somethin' in my head) says ignoramus you 2 famous 4 that 2 be done son 

Stuck cause I can't trust his bluff must clutch bust (hush hold up enough) WUSA GOOSE FRABA makes you holla sometimes you gotta do what you gotta 

[Verse 3:]
Some people joke and say me loco, throw evil quotes but yo they don't know, doctor don't know, so he won't go, in my head it's like I said I mean I'm oh so 

Full of decay and MDMA, sin we in way deep off in the end like many men say slaughter you pay, he told me that you gotta today, Allah hu A.K.B.A.R. with a Auda Dufe' 

In my head am I brain dead am I? Will I shed a cry when they red nina you might red nina but never dead nina, but if you bled nina then you's a dead nigga 

Yo, I feel it you feel it can we heal it the devil's encephal we rebels get it level no matter what it becomes, with the heavy metal impatiently wait with a shovel for the weto's who hate the negros I think I'm losing my Lithium 

[Bridge:]
Super savage eratic you don't say such an attic combative you don't say sick his status so there's no beyonces there's no hope 4 Dontez---Lyrics submitted by randee.
