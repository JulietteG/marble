Damn, my brand new Benz.
Thinkin of my so-called friends.
Why should I make amends ,when they crossed the nina and Sin again and again and again.
I love them dearly but hear me they burn severely I'm weary to the point that I really don't want not one one of them none of them near me.
Did, trust you, but what's new for real? Yeah I love you, but fuck you for real.

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.

Met you at a rock show, November No. Octo,
Took pictures then locked yo, numbers and then got low,
Called you up a lot though, found out that you not a hoe.
Several trips to my show, shot me with your crossbow.
We used to kick it at pats-whites-and blacks, triple stacks and fat sacks we matched we relaxed, the kiss, but I never twist her she wish, for the better mister I mixed the lady with my kid but then miss she became my sister for a minute.
But then my lady started receiving that snitch, by that nigga on tour you wanna be the reason that split, you started believing that bitch in San Jose, you grip to what the damn ho say, you flip like a maam who stayed, no trips, never send your pay. We dipped.
Used to play for you, even used to pray for you. Never that cause you wanted to spit in my face and that was up up up and away for you. I hate this, I was real so why fake shit? You lost us so go fuck them bitches on myspaces.

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.

Everyshow was a different face, but these two were from a different place,
Follow my tour gotta quick-embrace, never would've thought I'd have to give them space.
Father and daughter, loved me to death, Never cared their blood be the sin,
Just lovin the tech. Shrugged the regret. Then found out papa couldn't have the husband effect.
Everybody seened it but didn't believe, everybody got it but never did I receive it.
His dream was for me to fuck miss thing. But she looked 15, baby girl was 19.
But Instead of givin the dick I'd rather give her ice cream. Now I'm trippin, cause her pop's just tryin to auction her off,
But it turns out he was knockin her off. I had to stop and I coughed, cause that, baby, turned out to be the boyfriend. Guess he was givin him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in.
Ya'll lied to me did it fuck with the Nina, sho it did.
Ya'll made me question what your motive is.
Don't cry Ali but my temper is flared and scared off,
So to see you I guess I'll see you in the crowd like where's waldo.

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.

I wrote this carefully...
I love you cause you married me, when I needed therapy,
Let me move in with you be my wife you wasn't scared of me,
But fuck you because you say, if you don't get a job today,
Better kick rock wasn't hard to say, when you knew I'd rap my heart away.
I love you cause you sexy, love you cause you're beautiful.
Love you cause way back in the day you thought that I was suitable,
But fuck you treated me, stupid and conceitedly,
I wasn't very smart but a genius you wanted me to be.
I love you cause you strong, I love you cause you real.
Because you forgave me when I cheated and poppin pills,
But fuck you for bringin up, shit that happened years ago.
Chances of us getting back is gunna take a miracle.
You live in the past, I'm givin the gas and cash,
How many niggas did that without you givin the ass?
And I ask you what other nigga, would step up with the love to give her,
G's in the house for you and the kids and even for your other nigga.
Enjoy the dough you get, cause I don't owe you shit.
You was unhappy with me so you split.
You need to show me some love ma, and I don't mean that I wanna fuck you.
Just acknowledge me taking care of you because Ill... Ill...

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
