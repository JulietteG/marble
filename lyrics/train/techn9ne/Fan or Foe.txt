Back up wait a minute
Why you looking at me like that
Do you really wanna trip, are you flipping the script?
Do you wanna rap with a nigga?
Are we bangin' so whoop in a rip?
I don't ever want us to come the bustin' off shots, nigga misery can't produce enough cops and
Don't know if you willin' or what?
All you wanna do is freestyle in the cut
Fan or foe I don't really know
Off at the show niggas they know
what I look like, was a good night
now it's looking like a motherfucker wanna jack all me doe
Come up to me
My kids would be chillin'
Better think twice I'm a 5-6 villain
All they wanna talk about
I did it
When I did it
Man I thought I was gonna get a bullet in a minute
You should be careful how you walk upon us
Got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it
I know they wait for Tecca Ninna moments
Till the opponent be poppin' up and he's you don't it
We don't if they be tripin' or not (no)
Probably 'cause all of them live on the block
When you're rapping niggas know what you got
Toughest ever, when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me
Don't you be mugging me?
Might have that drug in me
Plugging a nigga, for nearly shrugging me
Ain't nothing wrong with people peeping, geeking
Whether man or hoe
But the grandma so bama, stama
I don't know if you fan or foe

[Chorus]

If he trippin', we can go
Peeping like he's seeking doe
Want to throw or want to poe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
Easy, how you're speakin' bro'
I don't know if you fan or foe

If he trippin' trippin' go
Peepin', seekin' seekin' doe
Want to throw or poe, poe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
Easy speakin, speakin bro'
I don't know if you fan or foe

Now be easy how you're speakin' bro'
T-Nutty, a young flow heathin', don't be chokin'
So your ass and you'll be walkin' off with it broken
Run up on motherfuckers in the open
Making them shut up
Woofing with that cold shit
Cut the shinanigans
Nigga you think this is with manikans
Thinking you're slicker than lotion
Back up wait a minute why you're looking at me like that
I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame but if you get the tripping' than I'm giving up my game
Never catch me slippin'
You can get it out your brain
Maine Fan or Foe!
Some kinda nigga tryin' to get his hands on my doe
But if you really want come on
And try to get on, you can be the opponent chokin' with hands on your throat
Man I'm a low
Wantin' a background for Sac Town
Better watch out from the Blao Blao
Black out, black out, black out, black out (braararararaa ttataaaaa)
Stay with my killers that be knockin' noodles
Wakin' the game the blood at goca doodle
Thinkin' you're gonna catch me slippin' at a show
Fear factor click is like a shaker Zulu
I see through you
With all that fake shit
You've filled with hatrid
Hoping and wishin' you was my replacement
Coming so vicious you're gonna have to face it
And try to taste it
'cause I laced it like a tennis shoe when I've been a fool
Like Zeepo bitch and X-Raided
But this is a different interview

[Chorus Repeat]

It might not be a bad idea
If I never go home again
'cause niggas be lookin' at me
Like I'm a chicken dinner
Like like I'm ?? Henderson?
You a foe (foe), so I gotta carry the fo' (four)
And did they recognize me, I don't really know though
'cause they walkin' up fast
And givin' me doubt
When they pass me asking
When your new shit come out (me and my dogs)
At the picture house
And the be huddled up and got me I think I'm gonna pick one out, and get the nigga bigger than me
For the trigger to see
If he tough enough
Make it what he trying to be
But he's a fan though
Don't know how to approach you, vulture
Get to close, how I'm supposed to...
(...supposed to know the difference between fan or foe when you're muggin' on me...)

Can't even live in peace
And when I eat with my peeps In the place
You in my face with your mix-tapes
And if I ain't tryin' to listen to it
We get in to it
If I'm off on the fluid
Then it's time to do it (do it)

Uhhhh... 'cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
Your girl be loving me giving me mouth to mouth (yeah)
And it ain't fair that the music got her doing what she wanna do when you ain't there

And you're too softy, softy when you see me you better get up off me

[Chorus Repeat]---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
