I hate you
Can't stand you
Despise you
Detest you

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I can't stand yo persona, the drama, yo marijuana, or yo momma
I really despise yo am a so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G, I wanna sought ya, caught ya and then offed ya

I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em, how I see 'em, when I see scum, I free from the legions
Cerebrum, I see none, see your just really dumb

Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your awards
Funk bein' your whore, hunks bein' of course, you punks being endorsed Chumps being assured, dumped being divorced

To test you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
 From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate, it would be great for you to skate off in a lake
A beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

We're livin' in the cold age, road rage
Dark no sole, no way
Jose Cuearvo, there goes yo day
Every scare, everywhere, knows bogay

This life is too soft, haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you when you blew off
You coofa, your crueler, so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off

So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my farm, I slam you
Sammain', champaign your family and you

I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for, decor
'Cause your state will create race wars

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I hate you when you destroy buildings and kill millions of children
From black white Chinese Sicilian, I thrill
When you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your death, miserable until then

I wanna put my Rebox and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus, doggin' is, you're botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus

I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your life's baned for, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample

Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and crips and bloods and drugs
Not see show no love, never we be equal
My name is The Grinch, this song is dedicated to the evil people

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise---Lyrics submitted by irin archuleta.
