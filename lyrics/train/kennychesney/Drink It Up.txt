Drink it up, don't waste a drop
Squeeze every second out of that old clock
Kick it back man, enjoy the ride
Keep living every day like it's Saturday night

Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
And you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup, drink it up
Oh, drink it up

Let it roll, let the big wheels turn
Sling a little gravel going through those curves
You and me, we've gotta soak it in
Keep it cranking like this party's gonna never end

Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
And you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup, drink it up
Oh, drink it up

Get it while you can, take it to the limit
Live out every single minute while you're in it

Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
And you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup

Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
And you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup, drink it up
Oh, drink it up
Come one and drink it up---
