Preacher told me last Sunday morning, Son, you better start living right;
Need to quit the women and whiskey and carrying on all night.
Dont you wanna hear em call your name when youre standing at the Pearly Gates?
I told the preacher, Yes, I do, but I hope they dont call today (I aint ready!) 

Everybody wants to go to Heaven, have a mansion high above the clouds,
Everybody want to go to Heaven, but nobody want to go now.

Said, Preacher, maybe you didnt see me throw an extra twenty in the plate,
One for everything I did last night, and one to get me through today.
Heres a ten to help you remember, next time you got the good Lords ear,
Say Im comin, but there aint no hurry, Im having fun down here. Dont you know that:

Everybody wants to go to Heaven, get their wings and fly around,
Everybody want to go to Heaven, but nobody want to go now.

Someday I want to see those streets of gold with my halo,
But I wouldnt mind waitin at least a hundred years or so

Everybody wants to go to Heaven, it beats the other place, there aint no doubt,
Everybody want to go to Heaven, but nobody want to go now.

Everybody wants to go to Heaven, Hallelujah, let me hear you shout,
Everybody want to go to Heaven, but nobody want to go now.
Think I speak for the crowdnobody want to go now.---Lyrics submitted by Allen.
