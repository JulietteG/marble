There's something sacred when your 17
About a football jacket and a high school ring
And it sure looked nice when you wore mine

That late October at the homecoming dance
We slipped outside and we took a chance
In the middle of the night it sure felt right

We let go right then and there
We were loved and we were scared

For the first time lovin' blind we dove right in
For the first time we gave everything and then
Graduation came and our dreams called our names
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives
For the first time

Well, I heard the other day
You're a Sunday school teacher, got the PTA
Got a real good life, you're a real good wife

I'm living in this circus world
No, I ain't married but I got a girl
And I'm her man, we're making plans

But I still smile when I think of us
Together we learned how to love

For the first time lovin' blind we dove right in
For the first time we gave everything and then
Graduation came and our dreams called our names
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives
For the first time

Now, graduation came and our dreams called our names
Broken hearts we moved on with our lives
For the first time

For the first time lovin' blind we dove right in
For the first time we gave everything and then
For the first time we moved on with our lives
For the first time---
