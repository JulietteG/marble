Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
In the same night

There's ball caps, photographs, dollar bills and bronze
License plates from every state nailed up to the wall
Spring breakers, heart breakers, already getting loud
Talladega's on the big screen, don't it make you proud?

Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama

There's hot time, low tide, years of history
Hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
The sign that says "live your life" just for inspiration
Gonna raise a lot of hell tonight in the, in the no shoes nation

Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the red neck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama

Got your who died, go Vols, roll tide and the Seminoles
Old dogs, war eagle, green eyed gator, that's barely legal

Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the red neck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama

Don't it feel good?
Don't it feel good?
Yeah, don't it feel good?
At the Flora-Bama
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama---
