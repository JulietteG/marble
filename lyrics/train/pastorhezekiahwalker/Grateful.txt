I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE
YES IM GRATEFUL FOR THE VICTORIES WE'VE WON, I COULD GO ON & ON & ON ABOUT YOUR WORKS
BECAUSE IM GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL, SO GRATEFUL JUST TO PRAISE YOU LORD 
FLOWING FROM MY HEART ARE THE ISSUES OF MY HEART IS GRATEFULNESS. (1 TIMES)
                                                REPHRASE
GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL, GREATFUL,GRATEFUL,GRATEFUL, GRATEFULNESS IS FLOWING FROM MY HEART

REPHRASE(4 TIMES)

FLOWING FROM MY HEART 
ARE THE ISSUES OF MY HEART 
IS GRATEFULNESS---Lyrics submitted by jaleesa.
