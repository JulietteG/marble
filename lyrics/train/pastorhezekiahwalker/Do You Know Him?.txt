I know a man from Galilee
If your in sin he'll set you free
He's the one that will save your soul
Heal your body and make you whole
Oh, do you know Him?

(Bridge)
I know a man from Galilee
If your in sin he'll set you free
He's the one that will save your soul
Heal your body and make you whole
Heal your body and make you whole
He's the one that delivered me
Loosed my shackles and set me free
Loosed my shackles and set me free
Oh, do you know Him?

(Vamp)
Do you know Him, do you know my Jesus?
Oh, do you know Him?---Lyrics submitted by meeppweetyme.
