[Chorus:]
I'm going to hold out,
gonna hold out 'til He comes,
God has just begun to make a way,
make a way for me.

I'm going to hold out,
gonna hold out 'til He comes,
God has just begun to make a way, way.

[Verse:]
Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow,
but I know the Lord will take me through it all;
(He'll make a way, way).

Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow,
but I know the Lord will take me through it all;
(He'll make a way, make a way for me).

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow,
I know the Lord will take me through it all;
He'll make a way, way.

Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow,
I know the Lord will take me through it all;
He'll make a way, make a way for me.

[Vamp 1:]
I'm going to hold out,
gonna hold out 'til He comes.

[Vamp 2:]
Hold out 'til He comes.
Hold out 'til He comes.

[Vamp 3:]
Don't give up, don't give in,
hold out 'til He comes.

[Ending:]
I'm going to hold out,
gonna hold out 'til He comes,
God has just begun to make a way,
make a way for me.---Lyrics submitted by Ricky Reza.
