Verse
So you say that you're not ready,
you'll be coming in just a little while;
day by day you ask Him for forgiveness,
for you know you are really His child.
You say that you'll be there tomorrow,
you take a chance and you gamble with faith;
because when you come back tomorrow,
it just may already be too late;
come home.

Chorus 1
How can you refuse,
your Father's calling you into a better life within.
How can you refuse,
your Father's at the door waiting for you to come in,
and He is standing there with out-stretched hands
to embrace you as His own;
how can you refuse,
your Father wants you to come home.
How can you refuse,
your Father wants you to come home.

Chorus 2
How can you refuse,
your Father wants you to come home.

Bridge
Others have left you all alone,
but He'll never leave on your own.
In His word, that is shown,
oh the Father, He wants you to come home.

Friends may forsake as time goes by,
others may reject you, you don't know why;
but the Father, He'll still be there to dry your eyes;
why, because your Father,
He wants you to come home, oh.
