Chorus
Not going back Im moving ahead
Im here to declare to you my past is over in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
Im moving, moving forward

What a moment You have brought me to
Such a freedom I have found in You
Youre the Healer who makes all things new
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Not going back Im moving ahead
Im here to declare to you my past is over in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
Im moving, moving forward

You have risen with all power in Your hands
You have given me a second chance
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Not going back moving ahead
Im here to declare to you my past is over Im in You
Things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
Im moving
Not going back moving ahead
Im here to declare to you my past is over in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
Im moving, moving forward

Forward (5x)

You make all things new
Yes You make all things new
And I will follow You forward ---Lyrics submitted by Terra MzGolden Nichole.
