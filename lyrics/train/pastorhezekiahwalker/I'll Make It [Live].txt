I was down to my last time dime
But Jesus stepped in right on time
I sure been sick and i couldn't get well
When he healed my body and i can tell
That it's

Alright now
(think I'll make it) think I'll make it
(anyhow) anyhow
(it's alright) alright now
(think I'll make it) think I'll make it
(anyhow) anyhow

I was lost without a friend
Then i met Jesus and he took me in
In all of your temptation, just keep the faith
He already planned a way for you to escape

Alright now
(said i know I'll make it) think I'll make it
(anyhow) anyhow
(it's gonna be) alright now
(said I'm gonna make it) think I'll make it
(anyhow) anyhow

(through your trouble and through your pain you better believe)
You can believe that it's alright
(don't you stop shouting, don't you stop praying you better believe)
You can believe that it's alright
Everything's gonna be

Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Ad lib
Said I'm gonna be alright- think I'll make it  come on say- come on say- alright now- anyhow

I'll make it
I'll make it
I'll make it
I'll make it
Ad lib
I'm gonna make it- yes i will- oh- I'll make it- won't let trials hold me down- true victory- I've found- said I'm gonna make it- said I'm gonna make it- I'll make it- I'll make it- said i will will- said i will will- I'm gonna make it- I'm gonna make it- get out of my way- get out of my way- I'm on a mission- I'm on a mission- I'm on purpose- I'm on purpose- with my vision- with my vision- haters can't stand you- haters can't stand you- happy when you fall- they pray you fall - they don't know- they don't know- you can make it when you're called- everything's gonna be

Alright now
(think I'll make it) think i'll make it
