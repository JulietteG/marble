It's late in the night, dancing is done 
The music has died, you're ready to run
But you don't have a clue 
This party hasn't ended yet 
not for me and you 
Now you're just pretending

You're hiding from yourself Yes you are, yes you are
Like golden rays of sun in the cloud

We're meant to be one, I know we are
 If I am the sky then you are my star
Hey, you don't have a clue 
This party never ended 
not for me and you
I know you're just pretending

You're hiding from yourself 
Yes you are, yes you are
 Like golden rays of sun in the cloud

I will make you see 
Haven't you got, haven't you got it yet? 
Just lay down for a while next to me
Didn't mean to make you panic 
I didn't mean to put you off
Baby it's the way that you've got me
I listen to my heart and it takes you high
And you ask me how, can I show you how?
I need your love right now, now, now---Lyrics submitted by lau.
