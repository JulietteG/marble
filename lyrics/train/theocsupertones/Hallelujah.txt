As I was B O U N D, bound
By the name of J E S U S
To V I C T O R Y, I am F R double E

You are mine, I call upon you
Because you look so very strong
Through C H R I S T
Through Christ we are bound to win

Hallelujah
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Yeah, hallelujah, I am saved
Through Christ we are bound to win---Lyrics submitted by jerry abarquez.
