Tonight we celebrate the sadness
Tonight we dwell in our misery
I'm giving in to all the things that haunt me
Surrendering to things that I should not be

King of the liars
The son of thorns
A house for thieves
And a church for whores

Tonight we serenade the madness
Tonight we embrace insanity
I'm tired of being tortured by my memory
And all the things that they say I should not be
A judge for the rich
A torch for the poor
A man of hate
And a god of war

Don't need forgiveness
There's nothing left to lose
So now it's time to see how much damage I can do

Tonight we laugh alone in the darkness
Tonight there is no sympathy

Damage I can do
Damage I can do---
