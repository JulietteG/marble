I dont want to blink, I cant close my eyes
These are the best years of our lives
I dont wanna sleep while Im alive
I dont wanna miss a thing tonight

For once in my life I realized
What Ive been given, in an instant
I dont need this to end to understand
That Im gonna miss it, gonna miss it
I cant believe how the minutes keep passing us by
Better live my life
Here in the moment just own it and dont think twice
Lets go

I dont want to blink, I cant close my eyes
These are the best years of our lives
I dont wanna to sleep while Im alive
I dont wanna miss a thing tonight
I don't wanna blink, blink,
I dont wanna blink, blink
I dont wanna blink
No, I dont wanna blink

There used to be a time when I was blind
I had no vision, wouldnt listen
Now every heartbeat is tellin me
That Im on a mission to make a difference
I cant believe how the seconds keep passing us by
Better live my life
Here in the moment just own it and dont think twice
Lets go

I dont want to blink, I cant close my eyes
These are the best years of our lives
I dont wanna to sleep while Im alive
I dont wanna miss a thing tonight
I don't wanna blink, blink,
I dont wanna blink, blink
I dont wanna blink
No, I dont wanna blink

Cant stop, wont stop
Give me some more
So many things that I wanna explore
Years ahead, more, we were put in for
Now I now
Lets go

I dont want to blink, I cant close my eyes
These are the best years of our lives
I dont wanna to sleep while Im alive
I dont wanna miss a thing tonight
I don't wanna blink, blink,
I dont wanna blink, blink
I dont wanna blink
No, I dont wanna blink---
