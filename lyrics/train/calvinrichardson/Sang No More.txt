I don't wanna sang no more
promised myself I wasn't gonna do this no more
So sad I don't wanna sang no more no more

Let me tell you why
When we started out we were so damn happy girl
Wouldn't change what I have with you for nothing in the world
Then it changed, things changed
I got a lil money bought me a car
Bought that big house that we made love in
Next thing you know I'm sexing your friend
But if it's gonna make me change
Make me do stupid things
And cause my life to change

Hook
Call the radio
All the record stores
Tell them to stop my records
All the studios let them know
They can stop my sessions

Chorus
Cause I don't wanna sing no more
Promised myself I wouldn't do this no more
So sad I
Don't wanna sing no more no more

You don't have to cook and clean
Use your time for you
That will make your day
A big bank account
Did you see my face 
At the news stands 
They say slow music days are gone away
I had nothing to say cause you know the deal
Common sense 
Tell you shit aint real
Money makes people change 
Do some stupid thangs 
And because I'd like to change 

Call the radio
Call the record store
And tell em to stop my records 
Call the studio
Let em know
They can cancel my sessions
Cause I aint wanna sang no more

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sang no more
Promise myself I won't do this no more
So sad
I I I don't wanna sang no more
No more!

All I ever wanted to do
Was make momma happy 
Then you came along
And it took a lil more to make you smile
Took a lil more to please the crowd
Now let me explain this to you girl 
Nothing else matters to me in this world 
But if its gon make me change 
Make me do stupid thangs 
That cause my life to change

Call the radio
Call the record store
And tell them to stop my records 
Call the studio
Let em know
They can cancel my sessions
Cause I aint gonna sang no more

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sang no more
Promise myself I won't do this no more
So sad
I don't wanna sang no more
No more!---Lyrics submitted by Dina.
