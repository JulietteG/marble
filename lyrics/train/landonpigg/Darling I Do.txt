Golden leaves looked brown to me
The world had less color without you
Shapes in the sky looked plain to me eye
The world had less color without you

I know plenty of people with eyes closed
They don't see like I do
Darling, I do

Notes on the keys meant nothing to me
The world didn't sing without you
Birds in the tress fell silent for me
The world didn't sing without you
without you

I know plenty of people with eyes closed 
They don't see you like I do
Darling I do
Darling I do see you

I know plenty of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I
I know plenty of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like 

I know plenty of people with eyes closed
They don't see you like I do
Darling I do

Darling I do
Darling I do I do 
Darling I do 
Darling I do see you---Lyrics submitted by ashni pabley.
