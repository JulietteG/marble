You leave your home for days and days
and I know I said I know
You gotta another woman somewhere around

Hey! I'm a good woman
I'm a good woman
I'm not a bad woman
So don't treat me like dirt

I'm not going nowhere
you don't take me out
If I put on a nice dress baby
You wanna start a fight

Even my next door neighbours
notice the shape I'm in
They're all out talking
Even my so called friends

Now I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna move away from here
away from here
Everyday that I know happiness
ooh
A change gonna come
A change gonna come baby
and I don't mean maybe
I'm a good woman
Ooohh
I'm a good woman

You leave your home for days and days
and I know that you;ve gotta another woman somewhere around

You leave your home for days and days
and I know that you;ve gotta another woman somewhere around

Im a good woman
Im a good woman
I'm not a bad woman
Don't wanna leave you
A change gonna come
A change gonna come baby
and I don't mean maybe
I'm a good woman

Don't wanna leave you lonely
See, I'm a good woman
ahhhhhhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by ruth mccormack.
