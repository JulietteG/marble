Welcome to the Real World

Where people die and pain is real
No one gives a fuck about how you feel
Everything has a price and a consequence
No one has the time or the time to rest
To listen to you while your crying boo hoo
I don't know what to do 
My rent is over due
Pay it pay it
And if you don't have the cash
Than your out on your ass

Welcome to the Real World

Wow I must admit I'm here doing myself
But I can understand how everyone else
Has their own way to feel and their own way to deal
With the same shit I do
But it just keeping coming over and over and over again
I'm sure I'll wake up really thinking that's funny
Having their luck and their friends and their money

Welcome to the Real World

And I know your running away
And I know you'll be okay
So there's no need to be afraid

Welcome to the Real World (X5)---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
