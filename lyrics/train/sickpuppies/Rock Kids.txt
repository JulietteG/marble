Well maybe I'm wrong but it seems to me
That today's music's all about ME ME ME!
Just show me your money give me the honeys
And I'll give you what I feel like buddy
Pastel images are still giving us
Everything we've heard before with some more
Sex appeal that isn't really real
But everybody seems to fall FOR IT!

All the pop groups are raking it in
While other demo tapes are chucked in the bin
Meanwhile all the real struggling bands
That never had a clue...Never had a chance!

(chorus) X2
We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

It gives me the shits
that we're jumping through hoops
While its handed out like candy
to the girl and boy groups
You know the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears
Where they gonna be in the next few years
We got bullshit songs written by old farts
In the hopes that one of them will maybe climb up the charts
People are aching for something new
Something simple, honest true...

AND NOT THIS FUCKED UP MONEY MAKING BULLSHIT!!!

(chorus) X2
We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune

It's all become subliminal
It's no longer traditional
It's just compromising and advertising
So they can see their numbers rising

It's all become subliminal
It's no longer traditional
It's just compromising and advertising
Can you see those numbers rising?

Are you gonna fall for it?
Are you gonna be a sheep?
You know it's already started
Are you a statistic?
Are you going to conform?
Or fight against the norm
Or are you gonna stand up and say
FUCK YOU ALL I'LL GO MY OWN WAY!

(chorus) X3
We are the rock kids
We don't want your pop shit
We want something hard to rock to
Not some fucked up programmed pop tune---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
