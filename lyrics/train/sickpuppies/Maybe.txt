maybe im a dreamer 
maybe im misunderstood 
maybe your not seeing the side of me you should 
maybe im crazy 
maybe im the only one
maybe im just out of touch 
maybe iv just had enough 

maybe its time to change 
and leave it all behind 
iv never been one to walk alone 
iv always been scared to try
so why does it feel so wrong 
to reach for something more
to want to live a better life 
what am i waiting for 
cause nothing stays the same
maybe its time to change


maybe its hopeless
maybe i shoud just give up 
what if i cant trust myself 
what if i just need some help 

chorus

maybe its time to change
and leave it all behind
iv never been one to walk alone
iv always been scared to try

chorus

cause nothing stays the same
maybe its time to change 
cause nothing stays the same 
maybe its time to change---Lyrics submitted by jackie.
