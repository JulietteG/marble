everytime i end up breaking you
you change into
something worth keeping
everytime im close to saving you
you grow into
a sin worth believing
you're everything i ever wanted but
its never enough
youre never enough

ill take whatever i can taken
whenever i can take
if it ever comes

(chorus)
i hate you when you're gone
i hate you turn me on
i hate the way i need you when i don't know where you are
i love it even more when i'll find you on the floor
i know you think you hate me but i will always hate you more


i never knew until i got a taste
what a waste
of what i have been through
cause nothing ever makes that change
im so ashamed
of what i did to you
i had to let you in to feel that rush
you were too much
way too much

ill take whatever i can take 
whenever i can take it 
if it ever comes

(chorus)

i never knew until i got a taste
im so ashamed
of what i did to you
