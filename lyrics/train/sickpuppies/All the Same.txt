I don't mind where you come from
As long as you come to me
But i don't like illusions I can't see
Them clearly 
I don't care, no I wouldn't dare 
To fix the twist in you
You've shown me eventually what you'll do
I don't mind
I don't care 
As long as your here

[Chorus]

Go ahead and tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand 
It's all the same 
And I'll take you for who you are 
If you take me for everything
And do it all over again
It's all the same


Hours slide and days go by
Till you decide to come 
And in between it always seems
Too All, of a sudden
I have the skill
Yeah I have the will, to breath you in while I can
However long you stay is all that I am 

I don't mind, I don't care 
As long as you're here 

Go ahead and tell me you'll leave agian 
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are 
If you take me for everything 
And do it all over again 
It's always the same

Go ahead and say it 
You're leaving 
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same 
And I'll take you for who you are 
If you take me for everything 
Do it all over again 
It's all the same---Lyrics submitted by Cameron.
