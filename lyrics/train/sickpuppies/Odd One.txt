Odd one you're never alone
I'm here and I will reflect you
Both of us basically unattached to anything or anyone
Unless we're pretending
You live you're life in your head
Some call it imagination
I'd rather focus on anything except what I'm feeling
What I'm feeling Odd One

(chorus)
Ay it's gonna be ok---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
