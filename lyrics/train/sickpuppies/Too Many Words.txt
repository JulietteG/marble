Ive tried to balance these
Lives that we are living
You always feel justified
But you never feel forgiving
I woke up one morning to find myself wrapped in the things I swore Id never touch
And here I am again
Tryin to save whats left of you and I
So why arent you satisfied?

Chorus

I reached out
Fell short
Now Youre hurt
Too many words
Breaking the silence
I felt it, bled it, screamed it
It only gets worse
And it kills me whats in mes too angry for us to survive
I used too many words tonight

Verse 2

I tried to get it right,
But I was just wasting my time
Cause you never compromised,
When it came to our lives
We struggle and fall apart
We build it back to stutter start
The endless accusations
I cant believe we made it this far

Chorus

Bridge

Waking alone tomorrow has got to be better than this.

Chorus

Too many words (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
