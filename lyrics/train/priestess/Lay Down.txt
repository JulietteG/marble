Lay down, sleep my little darling
I'll be nothing when your gone
Lay down, just like in a coffin
Then all I'll have is a song

I'll leave you in a coffin for real
And leave you in a church

Lay down, leave you'll be lonely 
I know I wont go
Lay down, sleep you'll be lonely 
I know I wont go, its not my turn

Lay down, this pain will be long gone
With the absence of your breath
I know, I know that you love me
I can love you when your dead

I'll leave you in a coffin for god
And leave in the dirt

Lay down leave youll be lonely
I know I wont go
Lay down sleep you'll be lonely 
I know I won't go, its not my turn

Lay down leave you'll be lonely
I know I won't go
Lay down sleep you'll be lonely 
I know I wont go 

Lay down, before me
I know I wont go
It's not my turn---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
