Talk to her, don't leave her behind 
You shut her out for too long
I know, 'cause I've seen her cry
If you keep her down she'll get up and move on 
Wake up it's time
Open your eyes
You've got to let her know
Stop wasting time
Make up your mind 
Love her or let her go
Talk to her, you've done something wrong
We've all got something to hide 
But don't turn your back for too long
There'll always be somebody waiting in line
I could be all that she wants 
Got a heart, got a home, got a hand for her to hold
Talk to her, there's something you'll find 
With all this pain that you caused
You'll be the loser this time
And I'll be the one with the girl that you lost 
Believe me she's leaving
And I'll be the one, look what you lost---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
