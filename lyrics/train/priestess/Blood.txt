You wanted to take your time with him
You wanted to suck his blood
But before you can rip into his veins 
You'd better take the reins
'Cause he's riding into the sun
Since it's been going on 
You know there's something wrong
It all started because
She wants to drain his blood
It's far too late to hesitate 
To hard to part
Just drive it through her heart
'Cause if you can't
She's got you in her hand 
'Cause he's riding into the sun---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
