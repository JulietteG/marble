And tonight
We're coming alive
The dead are arising
The night is coming to life

I'm kicking around day by day
I'm losing my mind every Sunday
I try to look back in my shade
I'm over my head in the moon

I feel it coming in
The storm coming out
The temperature within
Is cooling me down
I hear them creeping in
They're calling me out
The colder warning is freaking me out

And tonight
We're coming alive
The dead are arising
The night is coming to life

I'm tripping up walls, over bones
The look in my eyes everyone knows
A quivering light, a distant glow
Taking my breath, and it goes

I feel it coming in
The storm coming out
The temperature within
Is cooling me down
I hear them creeping in
They're calling me out
The colder warning is freaking me out
Is freaking me out

And tonight
We're coming alive
The dead are arising
The night is coming to life---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
