Not by power
Not by might
But by My Spirit
Says the Lord

The weapons of our warfare
Are not of this world
They are mighty through God
Mighty through God
The power of His mercy
And the power of His love
They are stronger than all
Stronger than all
As we worship in unity
Jesus the Lord
Victory comes in His name
By His Word

By My Spirit says the Lord
By My Spirit says the Lord
By My Spirit says the Lord---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
