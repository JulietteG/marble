If My people
Who are called
By My Name
Would humble themselves
And pray
And turn from their wicked ways

If My people (If My people)
Who are called by My Name
Whould humble themselves and pray
And purpose to seek My face

If My people
Who are called by My Name
Would humble themselves
And pray
And turn from their wicked ways

I will hear from Heaven
I will hear from Heaven
Yes I will hear from Heaven
I'll hear and I'll heal their land

If God's people
Who are called by His Name
If they will humble themselves
And pray
And purpose to seek His face

If God's people
Who are called by His Name
If they will humble themselves
And pray
And turn from their wicked ways

He will hear from Heaven
God said He will hear from Heaven
I believe
He will hear from Heaven
He'll hear and He'll heal their land
He said and I believe it
He will hear from Heaven
He will hear from Heaven
My God will hear from Heaven
Yes He'll hear and He'll heal their land
He said it I believe it
That He will hear from Heaven
He will hear from Heaven
He will hear from Heaven
Yes He will hear
And heal their land
He will hear from Heaven
I believe He will hear from Heaven
He will hear from Heaven
He'll hear from Heven
He'll hear and He'll heal their land
He will hear from Heaven
He'll hear and He'll heal our land
He will hear from Heaven
He''ll hear and He'll heal our land---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
