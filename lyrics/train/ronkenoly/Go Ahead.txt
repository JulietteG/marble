If you catch hell
Don't hold it
If you're going through hell
Don't stop
Remember no weapon
Formed against you
Shall prosper
And every tongue
That rises against you
You shall condemn

Now the Bible says this
You need to lean this
For greater is He that is in you
Than he that is in the world
Greater than

Now this is what you do when
You're going through hell
You go ahead
'Cause you have authority
Over the enemy
You have authority
As a believer
You have authority
Over the enemy
You have authority
In the Name of Jesus

Listen folks go ahead
Go ahead
I'm goin' through
If you catch hell
Don't hold it
If you're going through hell
Don't stop---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
