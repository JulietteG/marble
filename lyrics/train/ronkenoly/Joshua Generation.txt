We are ready for Jericho
And the walls of Jericho
Are coming down
By the Spirit of the Lord
We are marching forward
Till every battle is won
We're the Joshua generation
A chosen and anointed nation
And Jericho knows we are coming
And the walls of Jericho
Are coming down

They heard about the plagues in Egypt
And how the people of the Lord were set free
They heard about Pharaoh's army
And how they drowned in the Red Sea
They heard about the cloud that led by day
And the fire in the sky each night
They know that our God is with us
And they know that we know how to fight

(Chorus)

They heard about our wilderness experience
And how the old and fearful passed away
They heard that we crossed over Jordan
We're getting closer and closer every day
With the high praises of God in our mouth
And a two edged sword in our hand
They know that our God is with us
And we're coming to possess the land

(Chorus)

Down down down
The walls of Jericho are coming down
Down down down
Every stronghold will be leveled to the ground
We're the Joshua generation
A chosen and anointed nation
Jericho knows we are coming
And the walls of Jericho are coming down

(Repeat Bridge)

Yes the walls of Jericho are coming down
Yes the walls of Jericho are coming down

Yes the walls....The walls of Jericho!.......THEY'RE COMING DOOOOOOOWN!!!---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
