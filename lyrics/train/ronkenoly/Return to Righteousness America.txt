Return to righteousness America
Return to the truth you once believed
Return to righteousness America
Return to love
Return to truth
Return to your King
Return to your King

Stop the war against the unbord child
Return to moral responsibility
Stop sprending the inheritance of your children
And return to living your life within your means

Stop writing laws
Inspired by lust and convenience
Return to the laws
That God has written in your hearts
Stop the hate and violence
In your nation
And learn to love each other
Before you fall apart

Pray for the leaders of your nation
Renew respect for their authority
This land was dedicated
A nation under God
And God has declared
That Jesus is the King

Return to your King---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
