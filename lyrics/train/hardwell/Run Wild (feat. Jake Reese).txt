I remember how we used to be free
Listen to nothing but our fears
Hop to the sound of our own run speed
Oh we locked ourselves away and tied up the beast
But we're only waiting for the moment to break free

Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside
I've been holding back but tonight
Tonight we run wild!
Tonight we run wild!
Tonight we run wild!

There is no deny in what we're made of
See how your eyes reflect the moon
Feel how your instincts become blurred to love
Oh cause you can try your best to keep in the crown
But it's only waiting for the moment to break out

Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside
I've been holding back but tonight
Tonight we run wild!
Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside
I've been holding back but tonight
Tonight we run wild!
Tonight we run wild!
Tonight we run wild!---
