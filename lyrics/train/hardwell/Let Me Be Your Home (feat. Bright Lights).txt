I'm on the outside looking in
I don't mind all the time know where I am
All this time I waited for you
We don't gotta wait no more
All you gotta do is meet you anywhere you are

Let me be your home
Wherever you go
Wherever you go
Yeah, let me be your home
A hundred million miles away you know
Going up to Mars
I roam the ocean floor
I'm running circles around the world for you

So let me be your home
Wherever you go
Wherever you go
I'll be your home---
