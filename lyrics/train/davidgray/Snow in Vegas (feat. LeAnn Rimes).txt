Lying here with you on top of me
There's nowhere on this earth that I'd rather be
And just when I was thinking
We'd come about as far
As this old road could take us
Time to pull on over baby
Yeah just stop the car
Then it falls like snow in Vegas

So we'll hang that sign up
On the door
So the hotel maid don't wake us
Now pigs can fly
And I'll command these breakers

Ah now baby
Where you been so long
I've missed you like a river that's
Deep and strong
And just when I was thinking
We'd come about as far
As this old road could take us
Time to pull on over baby
Yeah just stop the car
And it falls like snow in Vegas

We'll leave that sign up
On the door
So the hotel maid don't wake us
Now pigs can fly
I'll command these breakers

And anything you want yeah
Anything at all
Any little thing you're needing
All you do is call
Got my money where my mouth is
The sugar's in the cane
If I had a million dollars
I'd blow it on champagne
A million bucks champagne yeah
It wouldn't touch the sides
No-one's gonna put a foot wrong
It's one of those nights, oh yeah yeah

And just when I was thinking
We'd come about as far
As this old road could take us
Time to pull on over baby
Yeah just stop the car
Then it falls like snow in Vegas
We're vain yeah and we're greedy
We're selfish and we're needy
But it's just the way God made us
Now pigs can fly
And I'll command these breakers---
