I felt something snap
Looked up and you were gone
Clean through the gap somewhere
That I can't get to

Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony

Batten hatches
Full survival mode
A word that
Catches in my throat
Short Pause
And then the full force
Knocks me sideways

Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony

Once upon a time
It wasn't like this
Love was mine
So what the hell
Is after happening here
I'm stepping out
Into the roar
Trying to hear that voice

Saying Hey
Don't worry
It's alright
Don't worry
Ah now Dave
Don't worry

Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony
Love vandalising me
With beautiful agony

Read somewhere
In Neptune's
Methane skies
It might be
Raining diamonds---
