Cant believe you're here now
Tiny dream come true
The answer to a prayer now
Im so in love with you

Couldn't wait to meet you
Hope you like your name
I get the funny feeling
Life will never be the same

[Chorus]
Safe and sound
You're here with me now
Like I hoped you'd be
Safe and sound
You're here with me now
And that's all I'll ever need

The world's a scary place here
But baby it's alright
I'll make sure the coast is clear
So you can just sleep tight

But if you're afraid of monsters
Like everybody is
I'll be right beside you
Closer than a kiss

[Chorus]

Someday I'm gonna teach you
The reason why we pray
So that heaven's love may reach you
Every single day

So, baby close your eyes now
And say a prayer with me
Lord, I lay me down to sleep
But I know I will be

[Chorus]

You're all we'll ever need---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
