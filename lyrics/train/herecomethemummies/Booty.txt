It's the perfect day
For gettin freaky
It's that time of day
for sniffing like a dog

Would you like to play
Some sneaky peaky
What i'm tryin to say
Is that i'm feeling like a snob

So watcha say

Come on let's get busy

Can I get some booty
Can I have some sweetness
Can I see your beauty
Can we get down on the floor

Can I get some booty
Can I have some sweetness
Can I see your beauty
Can I have some, have some more

It's time for groovin' babe
It's time for movin' slow
It's time for dancin' baby
And being in the show

Wanna come to play
