He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..
He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..

Late at night when the bars' are closin
Alcohol takes it's toll and
Us drinkers need a favorite vendor
A tasty treat of sausage splendor

A Little man behind the cart
Police can't catch him cause he's way too smart
The smell of mustard and large umbrella
Hotdog man's got the perfect cover....

He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..
He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..

He waits out patient out in the streets
And all the honnies want to sample the meats
He can't help but relish the fact
The FOOT long keeps you comin' back...

Once your feelin safe and cool
Thats when the wiener man makes his move
Umm.. Umm..Umm Umm-hummhumm humm mmm...
You can't scream when your mouth is full....

He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..
He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..

KRAUT

He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..
He's comin' for ya
He's gonna getcha
Attack of the Wiener Man..---Lyrics submitted by Dave.
