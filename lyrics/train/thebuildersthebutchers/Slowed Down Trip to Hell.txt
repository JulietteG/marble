Get on the train (Get on the train)
Get on the slow train (Get on the slow train)

And the would-be lookers-on
Are long since dead and gone
And your face is white and long
'Cuz you're takin' the slowed-down trip to hell.

Way up top, a funeral bell rings,
But you don't need the lord
Way up top, a funeral bell rings,
Everyone is bored

Now you are the wheel
Now you are the coal
Now you are the fire burnin'
In the engine down below

Get on the train (Get on the train)
Get on the slow train (Get on the slow train)
Get on the train (Get on the train)
Get on the slow train (Get on the slow train)

And the would-be lookers-on
Are long since dead and gone
And your face is white and long
'Cuz you're takin' the slowed-down trip to hell.

Way up top, a funeral bell rings,
But you don't need the lord
Way up top, a funeral bell rings,
Everyone is bored

Now you are the wheel
Now you are the coal
Now you are the fire burnin'
In the engine down below

Get on the train (Get on the train)
Get on the slow train (Get on the slow train)
Get on the train (Get on the train)
Get on the slow train (Get on the slow train)

And the would-be lookers-on
Are long since dead and gone
And your face is white and long
'Cuz you're takin' the slowed-down trip to hell.
1-2-3-4!

Way up top, a funeral bell rings,
But you don't need the lord
Way up top, a funeral bell rings,
Everyone is bored
Everyone is bored
Everyone is bored---Lyrics submitted by B.
