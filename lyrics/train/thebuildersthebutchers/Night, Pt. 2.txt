It's a harder way to heaven on the rope you swing,
And the night ain't filled with gentle things.
It's a harder way to heaven on the rope you swing,
And the night ain't filled with gentle things.
The night ain't filled with gentle things, no way.

Was your shadow on fire on the night your burned,
And the ashes all filled with the lessons you learned?
You try to fly away on your burnin' wings,
The night ain't filled with gentle things.
The night ain't filled with gentle things, no way.

You make your way across the desert for a sorry drink,
Your daddy set fire to the christmas tree.
He's a man with a funeral song to sing,
The night ain't filled with gentle things.
The night ain't filled with gentle things, no way.---Lyrics submitted by B.
