We were caught red-handed,
'Cross the county line.
But I'l take my chances on the lam,
I'm not doin' time.
You were drivin' all night,
You had a blood-soaked dress.
I was dreamin' restless,
and you were thinkin' of the rest.

And when you take a man's life you fall down,
You fall from the grace of god.
When you take a man's life you fall down, you fall down, you fall down, you fall down...
Red hands, red hands (red, red hands)
It's harder livin' on the lam
Red hands (red hands) you got those red, red hands,
A stranger's blood is on my hands.

Keep my eye on the road,
'Cuz I'm out drivin' after midnight.
And the vultures have all come way down,
Out of the the sky.
And the bad ol' things that live in the shadowed corners,
Are makin' a plan, they're gonna take away your life.

And when you take a man's life you fall down,
You fall from the grace of god.
And when you take a man's life you fall down,
You fall from the grace of god.
And when you take a man's life you fall down,
You fall from the grace of god.

When you take a man's life you fall down, you fall down, you fall down, you fall down...
Red hands, red hands (red, red hands)
It's harder livin' on the lam
Red hands (red hands) you got those red, red hands,
A stranger's blood is on my hands.

We were caught red-handed,
'Cross the county line.
But I'll take my chances on the lam,
I'm not doin' time.---Lyrics submitted by B.
