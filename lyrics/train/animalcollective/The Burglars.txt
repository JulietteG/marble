I could be a hare and Id sneak into my private rivals dreaming Im a burglar

Quick as any day in my fleeting little chest of hopefuls lost it to the burglars

I can be aware and ya maybe Im the same like pirates likened to the burglars

Threat on any day and Im hiding from the hare whos also hiding from the burglars

I didnt catch his name pow shot him on the range yow cause he was a burglar

Happens in the parks boohoo even in the old days stinking of the burglars

Happens in my home I never see it coming

When I was young we used to put alarms on our doors and screens like a burglar net
now that Im older Im sure thats absurd thats the word for the man who collects whos he stealing from next

When I was young my parents yelled beware of the ivory man that will steal and sell
now that Im older those words are still pure not the look of a crook in his books whats he taking from you?

And worried peeps go on about it
Say a lot of changes better come
A pocket full of change is emptied by
A little gawky bright and bubbly bird

Lots of heroes out there thinking bout it but minutes of their lives are ticking down
and bottles full of love are drunken by a tricky trite and thirsty hungry bird

Blooming tips on tulip cones that
Dont pay out they keep on growing
Costume thieves who never hand back half of what you end up owing

Has this town really gotten much better are the burglars gonna keep on trying to meddle with it?

Probably driving your car with someone
Close up your head cause are they reading your letters come on pack up the bed for betters

What you think you own you dont watch out the burglars

Stealing from the day. Didnt take a second. Listened to a record and they got away sneaky are the burglars

When I cross their way like a helpless chicken bones will soon be clinkin wearing me for play bracelet on a burglar

Thought I was ok not as bad as some and sunset on the slums see another day happy are the burglars

Brush it all away or do I let it sink in? Is it my ambition just to turn away? Freedom for the burglars

What you think you own you dont watch out the burglars---
