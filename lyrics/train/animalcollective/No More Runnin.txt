Merriweather Version:
No more runnin', says my mind
All this movement has just proved your kisses hard to find
Older harmony that I see
Friends I once had turn their thoughts away from me
No more runnin', I've got to breathe
On back porches with the torch of a firefly lit tree
It's what I hope for
It's what I hope for
No more runnin'
No more runnin'
I locked my bones and trapped my feet
I told them I found 'em a place to be
And stick like candy in your teeth
When you lose your faith in me
No more runnin', says my mind
All this movement has just proved your kisses hard to find
It's what I hope for
It's what I hope for
No more runnin'
No more runnin'
No more runnin'
No more runnin'

Older Version:
No more runnin', says my mind
All this movement has just proved your kisses are too far
Not much harmony from what I see
Friends I once had turn their thoughts away from me
No more runnin', I've got to breathe
On back porches with the torch of a firefly lit tree
It's what I hope for
It's what I hope for
No more runnin'
No more runnin'
'Cause you are candy in my teeth
Please don't lose your faith in me
'Cause you are candy in my teeth
Please don't lose your faith in me
No more runnin', says my mind
All this movement has just proved your kisses are too far
It's what I hope for
It's what I hope for
No more runnin'
No more runnin'
No more runnin'
No more runnin'---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
