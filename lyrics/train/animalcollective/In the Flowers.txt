A dancer who was high in a field from a moment
Caught my breath on my way home
Couldn't stop that spinning force
I fell into you
Everything drowns you to giggle
You are up with the flower and I care

So the dancer who gets wild to the deep reveling rhythm
But I am always away for weeks
That pass slow like mind gets lost
Feeling envy for the kid who danced in spite of anything
And we're out in the flowers and feel better

If I could just leave my body for the night

Then we could be dancing no more missing you while I am gone
Then we could be dancing and you'd smile and say I like this song
And then ours would meet them we will recognize nothing's wrong
And I wouldn't feel so selfish I won't be this way very long
To hold you in time
To hold you in time
To hold you in time
To hold you in time

And we're dancing, early hours drunken days finally ended
And the streets turn for pillowcase
And I fumble all good lie
Then the ecstasy turns the writhing light through our windowpane
Now I am gone, I left flowers for you there---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
