"Is this aboutwhere your heads at? (fuck)"
"No, Blanche, shes upset because they keep changing the taste of coke."

Golden Gal on her screen
Some kind of tube she'd never seen
Gift to the girl ready to dream
Hope in new forms the elderly be
Spirit is burning to hear it for the girls again

So complex and brave
A power and lure without showing some legs
Different roads not just sexual things
Went and cut a rude hue said it did right away
And Im keeping it new, and relearning girls again

Its a strange kind of plot who steps and paves the golden way
With a humour that is known to quickly put me in my place
Every words so tricky how we know what to say

My gal you're strong you should hold your head above them
And you need not ask for much to get my praise

Golden Gal on her screen
Some kinda tune she'd never seen
Gift to the girl ready to dream
Hope in new forms the elderly be
Spirit is burning to hear it for the girls again

Let me dress up like a golden gal and have my golden day
Let me watch the mark of maleness from a table side in greys
I can only dream of how Id be so amazed

The Gals were right on, when she needed laughs to fall on
For all of this and more I give them praise

("A man? Fly trap")

You think the gals should feel so comfortable these days
But sexy genders bring some troubles to the fray
And trouble tears apart another golden heart
So I want to be the reminder that shes stronger than the bulk on other days

Golden Gal gave me my strength
She said Ill be here for you later, boy
Now run along you have to fall
Golden Gal gave me my faith
All it took was some belief
But dont believe that she should change at all
Golden Gal taught me restraint
She said you'll want me more much later, dude
I'm your everything and not your toy
Golden Gal Ill be beside her
And I might want to stand in line
To find the kind of mind she can provide

You think the gal should feel so comfortable these days
But sex and gender brings some troubles to the fray
And trouble tears apart another golden heart
So I want to be the reminder that shes stronger than the bulk on other days

Golden Gal gave me my strength

Now run along you have to fall
Golden Gal gave me my faith
All it took was some belief
But dont believe that she should change at all
Golden Gal taught me restraint
She said you'll want me more much later, dude
I'm your everything and not your toy
Golden Gal Ill be beside her
And I might want to stand in line
To find the kind of mind she can provide

Here for a while I will follow my Golden Gal---
