All the pieces where they ought to be
But it's clear that he don't look like me

Pick a place around the table talk
Make a push to wake the comatose

Say you pause to say what's wrong and quickly
Blow up the cover
There's a way through fogs as long as there's a light to discover (it)

Like a twisted stick
Let's dig through the sick
And find a level space
Cinch to say

It's a gut that fears all things unknown
And a link within the brain you know

Not a shame to say the instincts there
But a virtue to deny the bait

Know the cause and move to gauze and deftly
Tratar o sangue (clean up the blood)

In the law there's room to move
As there's a need to uncover it

As a choker sucks
Let's sift through the muck
And lift this dingy veil
Same old tale

Get mixed in
This crippling fixture
Try and approach
The hidden mixtures
Get mixed in
This crippling fixture
Try and approach
The hidden picture it

For a misplaced stash
Let's search through the trash
And right this ignorant lurch
Wicked urge

Raise the gab
Above a whisper
Speak to salve
A spoiling blister
Raise the gab
Above a whisper
Talk to cure a blister
Picture it---
