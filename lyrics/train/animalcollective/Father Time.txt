Open up your locket
Does solidarity breed from a good foundation?
Things speed out of date
Now you can be falling
And when you're up it's blown up
With all new buildings painted they're not your colors
And all the places you went to you don't get what they offer
And hey that's Nathan but didn't he pass a long time ago?
Where'd he go?

We exorcised the weekend
Now all the demons can't play but they snuck into Thursday
Looking out for panthers from the road again
But didn't they pass a long time ago?

Luck
It's not real
Oh it's real
No it's not real
Maybe it's only real when lightning landed and hit you right where you were standing
Or when your imagination shows you what only time is supposed to tell you
Then I imagine time he's got real big hands and bigger plans
From a long time ago

And did I remember suitcase and all the things in my head
And all the expectations of doing something special
I could be gone today
But where do they take me?

Luck
I's not real
Though my feelings say its real
Maybe it's only real when someone blinds you
When they had always been so kind to you
Imagination won't get moldy can't wait for time to unfold me
Then I imagine time he's got real big hands and bigger plans
From a long time ago

There are none too small---
