When I make it
Back home
I'll take my shoes off
I'll take my coat off
I'll leave my belongings alone

No more in the wrong place
No more at the wrong time
No more getting through
Trials in sight
No more little fights
Never more a broke mess at night

Out of my body
Out of my mind

Lift this weight
Leave my light on---
