Child
of limousines
Whats the best place
That you have seen
all of the hands
That you have shook
Home of the queen of everything fancy
Is there a smell
That you can tell
gives you some peace
sends you to hell
all of the beds
That you have yearned
Is there a dream to
where youd return
Where is the plight
With the most stars
Where do you drink
By Echo guitars
Whats the best shore
Seen from a boat
Miniature heads that
color the shore line
If you could rest
A minute to tell
Get me some grass
Iridescent shells
I know theres a nest
Fit with a hatch
Sunset a glowin
Makes us all sweaty

I dont even know where to begin
or how I should start these days.
The green mountain south or
The Clay of the westerns

The Maryland meadows at midnight they do have a misty grace
Take a trip to blue bayou
Find Roy Orbison cryin

A continent molded from glass
or maybe a town I can taste. Dresses that glow on
girls from Barcelona

I wanna discover the key
And open the everywhere place
A mix of sky from Montana
dipped in FloriDada

FloriDada

Old
demented men
Where is the place
We can extend
Crooked state lines
Polka dot signs
Say that this place is
a state of mind
Pretty lip girls
Paint me the halls
Not on a street
Not near a mall
Raise me a thumb
From human skin
That isnt judged by
where it begins
Show me the clams
Show me the pearls
Mail me a note
Sent from a world
That isnt so far
And always right here
Where all the boundaries
Have disappeared
And all the nights
Are stitched with a glue
Thats sticking to me
And Ill stick to you
Ill take your hands
Youll take my face
And everywhere home will
be a good place

I found myself there a collagin
With all of the human race
A dancer from Ghana
smiling in Tijuana
I Frankenstein java with touches of Prada
and corn on the plates
A smear of gardenia
in the fair hair of sweden
And maybe I actually visited
some sort of mythical place
Or was it a future
connected by sutures
Oh lets go get lost in the image
I made of the everywhere place
I see the lads from Osaka
dyed in FloriDada

FloriDada

Wheres the bridge thats gonna take me home the bridge that someones fighting over a bridge that someones paying for a bridge so old just let it go---
