Here is a room
where i look down on the town below
Watching the rain
watching the people who come and go
They all look the same
yeah but i know that that couldn't be true
Not in this world
not after spending some time with you
Walking around we got the sun
and the wind on our side
Covered this town
girl you're as lovely to me as a tune
Can't stop the world
but if it decided to treat me right
I wouldn't mind any night
Remember the day
when we walked through the night
til we found that kid so low---Lyrics submitted by Dont Wantu Gvnm.
