Blue around a morning moon
The color of your eyes
I remember holding you
A fall through summer skies
You're everything that I've become
Every word I say
I need a bell a book and candle
To keep your ghost away

White horses on a troubled sea
Your smile will flash through time
Up ahead a blackbird's wing
Your hair will come to mind
Every night I see your face
When I have to pray
I need a bell a book and candle
To keep your ghost away

Keep your ghost away
Keep your ghost away
I need a bell a book and candle
To keep your ghost away

Just before the thunder rolls
I sense you next to me
And as I move through nature
I know where you will be
So I must keep myself apart
Here's where I'll stay
With a bell a book and candle
To keep your ghost away

Keep your ghost away 
Keep your ghost away
I need a bell a book and candle
To keep your ghost away

Blue around a morning moon
The color of yours eyes
I remember holding you
A fall through summer skies
You're everything that I've become
Every word I say
I need a bell a book and candle
To keep your ghost away---Lyrics submitted by Carla.
