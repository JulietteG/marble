An angry silence lay, where love had been
An in your eyes a look, i've never seen
If i have found the words, you might have stayed
But as i turn to speak, the music played.

As lovers danced their way,around the floor
I sat and watched you walk, towards the door
I heard a friend of yours,suggest you stayed
And as you took his hand, the music played.

Across the darkened room, the faintest sight i saw
He'd been something more,than friends before
While i was hurting you, by clinging to my pride
He had been waiting,and i drove him,to your side.

I couldn't say the things, i should have said
Refused to let my heart,control my head
But i was made to see,the price i paid
And as he held you close, the music played.

And as i lost your love, the music played.......---Lyrics submitted by Matet Pascua.
