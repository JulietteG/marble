I come home late at night with my boots in my hands
Stumble in the back door being quiet as I can
And I know shes there in bed, cold and all alone
And shes crying cause Im breaking up our home

(Chorus)
And she knows the hell Im going through
In this world inside my head
Theres a devil in the bottle
And he wants to see me dead

I fall into her arms and she helps me with my clothes
I guess she stays on with me because she really knows
That Im trying, Lord, to find my freedom
By escaping to the only freedom Ive ever known

(Chorus)

And its killing her to watch me die this way.
