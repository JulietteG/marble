She stood out in the crowd
Was a little too loud
But that's why we love her
She's not like other girls
She could've conquered the world
Until you broke her
Down

Are you happy now
That she's on the ground?
And do you realize the words you say
Make bruises that don't fade away?
Are you happy now
That you've brought her down?
And she's thinking that she won't fit in
'Cause you said something's wrong with her
Are you happy now?

He liked science not sports
He knew what he stood for
He's not like you, you don't like that
15 years down the road, he could be everything you won't
But right now you're breaking him
Down

Are you happy now
That he's on the ground?
And do you realize the words you say
Make bruises that don't fade away?
Are you happy now
That you've brought him down?
And he's thinking that he won't fit in
Cause you said something's wrong with him
Are you happy now?

I've heard that it was done to you
Is that why you do what you do?
Well that's no excuse, no

And if it felt hell to you
Then why'd you wanna put them through
What hurt you?

Are you happy now
That you've brought them down
(I, I don't think so)

Are you happy now
That they're on the ground?
And do you realize the words you say
Make bruises that don't fade away?
Are you happy now
That you've brought them down
And they're thinking that they won't fit in
'Cause you said something's wrong with them
Are you happy now?

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Eileene.
