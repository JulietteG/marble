Don't be confused, baby, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
Just for a one night stand in bed
Let the music take your mind
And just release and you would find

We gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music was made for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer, ohh
Every little part is in touch
Ooh baby, baby, ooh, let the music take your mind
Just release and you would find, baby
I love it, I love it

We gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music was made for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
Ohh, ooh, cruise for me, babe
Oh baby, let's cruise

Let's flow, let's glide
Ooh, let's open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you baby, ohh
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you would find, baby

We gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music was made for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
Ohh, we gonna fly

We gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music was made for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together---Lyrics submitted by edward.
