Well I ain't Burt Reynolds and I ain't Tom Selleck
I got bills up the pike and my car's an old relic
I get Chevrolet pay but I got a big smile
'Cause my little baby loves me Cadillac style

Well I don't have a condo in Panama City
You could say I'm a member of the poor boy committee
But I kinda feel rich when I've been with her awhile
'Cause my little baby loves me Cadillac style

Well about ten thirty Lord she puts me in drive
Turns all the lights down and man alive
All eight cylinders are firin' in line
Never out of gas and I'm always on time

Well I ain't Goldfinger and I ain't Joe Fashion
And you can't buy much with the checks I'm cashin'
So people if you wonder why I'm ridin' with a smile
It's cause my baby loves me Cadillac style

Yeah my little baby loves me Cadillac style
Yeah my little baby loves me Cadillac style---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
