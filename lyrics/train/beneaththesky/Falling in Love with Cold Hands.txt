As i walk in a room filled with gloom - i dont know what to do - (suddenly) - suddenly my life has changed - as another one's been taken - (is it so?) - i find myself in a daze - as the sorrow grows - (sorrow grows) - tomorrow i lay alone wandering, wondering! - (i lay alone) - wondering how come? what if? and why? - please give them words of compfort - so they may rest in peace... - and i can't stand this bad feeling - looking at you across the room today - the sun is shining bright outside - and i can't stand to fight - walking away, walking away today  - blood in his hands - my ears are shut... - tomorrow i lay alone - me!!! just let it be...---Lyrics submitted by stephen.
