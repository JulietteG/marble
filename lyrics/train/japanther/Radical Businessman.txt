(Cop, talking)
Where'd you get that belt buckle?
(Vocalist, talking)
Friend gave it to me.

I was proud of my spotless record 
Yeah, screamin like a good boy singin songs 
Free shake out 
Im a bad motherf**ker 
Gold gleamin so they come back 
Like a like a bad man of 72 
Now walk it out 

What do we want? F**k the cops
1 2 3 4, F**k the cops
1 2 3 4, F**k the cops
Lets get one more, f**k the cops

Prison, jail break 
Freedoms gone replace it with 
Life lessons tools tips
Brothers build relationships

Prison, jail break 
Freedoms gone replace it with 
Life lessons tools tips

What do we want? F**k the cops
1 2 3 4, F**k the cops
1 2 3 4, F**k the cops
Lets get one more, f**k the cops

Prison, jail break 
Freedoms gone replace it with
Life lessons tools tips
Brothers build relationships

Offer money miss my trip
Why should we should save this shit
Prison, jail break
