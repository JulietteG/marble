Who's gonna quench your thirst now?
Who can satiate?
Something can escape.
Who's gonna quench your thirst now?
Who can satiate?
Something can escape.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
I, uh, uh

And I'm not okay, and I can not stay
When the trees go barren and the sky goes gray.
And the medicine's gone and the dog has shade.
And the hurricane hits and there's no barricades.
In my bed I lay but I'm wide awake
Staring into the darkness, pain won't fade.
And my mind will rest, but let me follow in his hollow cave
Rise from the dust, I will rise from the grave
I rise from the grave!

Who am I to say?
I know nothing it seems
Until it's way too late,
I'm learning this the hard way!
Who am I to say?
I know nothing it seems
Until it's way too late,
I'm learning this the hard way!
Learning this the hard way!

Time to send it down
Crushed up in the ground
Broken kingdoms come
Crashing all around.
Palace made of glass
Start that with my eyes
So afraid of change,
Don't do anything rash.
Now I need my saint more than ever before
Yeah, it might be right,
Open up the door!
Everyone's wake on a long night
Everyone's got an opinion,
But put it in a song
And let me keep on living!

Who am I to say?
I know nothing it seems
Until it's way too late,
I'm learning this the hard way!
Who am I to say?
I know nothing it seems
Until it's way too late,
I'm learning this the hard way!
Learning this the hard way!
Who am I to say?
I know nothing it seems
Until it's way too late,
I'm learning this the hard way!
Learning this the hard way!
Learning this the hard way!

Seize your cage
You're a slave, you wouldn't have it any other way
And besides, filled it up that way,
Who's gonna make you happy ?
When you're your own worst enemy.
Who's gonna make you happy?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
