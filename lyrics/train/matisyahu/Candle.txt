There is a candle in very soul 
Some brightly burning   
Some dark and cold
There is a spirit who brings  a fire 
Ignites of candle and make his home

So carry your candle, run to the darkness
Seek out hopeless,confused and torn
Hold out your candle for all to see it 
Take your candle and go light world 
Take your candle and go light world

Frustrated  brother,see how he's tried to
Light his own candle some other way
See how your sister,she's been robbed and
Still hold a candle without a

So carry your candle, run to the darkness
Seek out the lonely,the tired and worn
Hold out your candle for all to see it 
Take your candle and go light world 
Take your candle and go light world

Cause we are family whose heart blazing 
So let's rise our candle light up the shy 
Praying to our father, in name of Jesus
Make us a beacon in darkest time

So carry your candle, run to the darkness
Seek out the helpless,deceived and poor
Hold out your candle for all to see it 
Take your candle and go light world 
Take your candle and go light world

So carry your candle, run to the darkness
Seek out the hopeless,confused and torn
Hold out your candle for all to see it 
Take your candle and go light world 
Take your candle and go light world---Lyrics submitted by neika dalberis.
