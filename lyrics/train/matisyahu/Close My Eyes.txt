No matter where I am bless me with all your light,
I'm on the train brain vexed connect and the I feel blessed
Whether day or night I'm on the street midtown New York City
Let me stop praise your name I need room to breath
I want to feel your peace; I got to feel your ease
Screaming' down on my, because my insides bleed
My hearts on fire witnessed all the vampires
Yes I came hear on a to inspire

[Chorus:]
Close my eyes and take a ride inside
Feel the breeze blow by yo I'm getting' you high
Bob Nesta said it best everything will be all right
Introspect connect the sect's and let this music make you fly

I listened' to the wind whistle in a channel of sound
my ear like a vacuum begin to boom
glisten like the sun heats a drum,
cursing' all of them doomed rising' up from the ground
growing full like the moon
Said I'm planting like a seed yes sir
them get up and get up and grow and I'm firm like a tree,
well I know that's all I know,
that some their colors wonderful like it was a rainbow
Let me tell you one time if you didn't know

[Chorus]

Moonlight enlighten my way at twilight
from the heights of my roof I send praise then poof
I'm looking up at the night
and ask for help to get up and get up and get up and get up and get it right

Jerusalem you take me high make me fly like arrow in the sky---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
