Fan the flame from the fire of freedom [x3]

From out of the fire into the flame
Burnin motherland we be goin insane
Tough like a truck keep me comin through the rain
Got me comin when I'm runnin out yet I'm feelin ok
I'm the kind of man make you fly like a plane
Take you on a vacation from the pain
Rollin like thunder like a runaway train
Let me take you on an escapade

I say oh ye oh ye oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh ye oh ye oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm keep on goin keep on rising
Elevate your mind it's all in the timing
Light up the freedom flame
Open up the skys your highway
Keep it goin till we reach the right way
Light up the freedom flame

Ouuuie ouuu ahyaeioeooeoooaioieo

I got roots like a tree holdin me down
With my eyes on the sky but my feet on the ground
And the people they'll come when they wanna gather round
Cause they hear some distant sound
Split the sea jump in with me
Tonight we leave in the streets we scream
Freedom
I said let it all ring
I said let it all ring

Oh ye oh ye oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh ye oh ye oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm keep on goin keep on rising
Elevate your mind it's all in the timing
Light up the freedom flame
Open up the skys your highway
Keep it goin till we reach the right way
Light up the freedom flame

Ouuuie ouuu ahyaeioeooeoooaioieo

Once I was in the dungeon
Now I can taste my freedom

I'm seein rainbows and rays of light
These are the things make me feel alright
Airtight outta sight like in the lyme light
When you answer it right it's bound to be alright
When the train hits on the time track
The hurricanes back and I'm goin till the lights fade black, fade black,
Fade black
Let it all rain now

Keep on goin keep on rising
Elevate your mind it's all in the timing
Light up the freedom flame
Open up the skys your highway
Keep it goin till we reach the right way
Light up the freedom flame
Ouuuie ouuu ahyaeioeooeoooaioieo

Clear the way
My love is coming through
Ignite the flame
My light will shine for you
Fight the night and do what I got to do
Kiss the sky to prove myself
Clear the way
My love is coming through

The darkness was sparkling in a hundred paths
Narrow long roads
The house of the world was made---Lyrics submitted by Jon Palmiero.
