Someday, as I look at the sun
I think of you
And traces we leave behind
Like a fallen piece well make a better start
But still end up alone
Looking down upon a place inside our heart
Dividing us in two
Somewhere, all that we leave behind
Lingers on, longing for lullabies
You live, you learn
You love, you burn
You win, you lose
Becoming you

Someday, when I cry in the rain
I think of you
Looking through eyes of pain
Passing on a feeling that we cant deny
Over on to you
Fading memory is soon becoming blind
Dividing us in two
Somewhere
All that we leave behind
Lingers on
Longing for lullabies
You live, you learn
You love, you burn
You win, you lose
Becoming you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
