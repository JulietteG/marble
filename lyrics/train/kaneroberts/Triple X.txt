Just another club, it was just another night.
Across the smoke filled room,
Shines a blue, blue light.
You turned my head around, yeah the package was complete.
We took the romance down and burned it in the heat.

We took the fall.
And we came alive that night.
Went for it all, it felt so right.

Triple X , it's only sex 'till it crosses the line.
Triple X, you find what you need and you're lost in time.

It all came down to a touch.
And all the feeling's too much.
The beat of the heart feeds the fire, in the soul.
Inhale the scent of love, don't it feel just like home.
These arms want to hold you tight and never let you go.

And if we are strong, we will survive the night.
'Cause this can't be wrong, it feels so right.

Triple X , it's only sex 'till it crosses the line.
Triple X, you find what you need and you're lost in time.

If I never saw you face and we just touch in the dark.
I know I'd be in the same hard place.
Skin to skin and heart to heart.

And if we are strong, we will survive the night.
'Cause this can't be wrong, it feels so right.

Triple X , it's only sex 'till it crosses the line.
Triple X, you find what you need and you're lost in time.---Lyrics submitted by Ken.
