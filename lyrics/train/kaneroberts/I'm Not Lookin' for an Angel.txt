You ain't no convent cutie.
You never never do your duty.
You ain't gonna never earn a halo, no way.
You make a livin' on the devil's payroll.

And in the dark you come to life.
You're so wicked you would burn up in the naked light.
I can't wait to hear your lies tonight.

I'm not lookin' for an angel.
I need someone, who's as bad as you.
I'm not lookin' for an angel.
You're no good girl, that's why I want you.

Your heart is void of mercy.
Your blood is cold and thirsty.
Your lips are spittin' fire.
And the flames are gettin' higher.

In the morning you are gone.
You have left me here to die your dirty deed is done.
I'm addicted to the pain of love.

I'm not lookin' for an angel.
I need someone, who's as bad as you.
I'm not lookin' for an angel.
You're no good girl, that's why I want you.

And in the morning you are gone.
You have left me here to die until the deed is done.
I'm addicted to the pain of love.

I'm not lookin' for an angel.
I need someone, who's as bad as you.
I'm not lookin' for an angel.
You're no good girl, that's why I want you. x2

I'm not looking for an angel.
You're on fire and I can't get enough.
I'm not looking for an angel.
I'm addicted to the pain of your love.---Lyrics submitted by Ken.
