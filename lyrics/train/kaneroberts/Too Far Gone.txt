Baby, come a little bit closer, let me inside.
Danger, you're slipping into a dream, I'll be your guide.
Oh, these sheets are like a web, oh. . .

Now you're too far gone,
You've got nowhere to run.
Cuz you're too far gone,
Now you know I'm the one.

Who can make you stay here,
Just a little bit longer,
Baby hold on.
Lay here, I will take you higher. . .
Little Angel.
I'll be leather on your lace, oh. . .

Now you're too far gone.
You've got nowhere to run.
Cuz you're too far gone,
Now you know I'm the one.
Who can make you stay. . .

Baby, close your eyes and imagine,
We're driftin' away.
Sleepin' with the face of a virgin. . .
Now I know you're.

Too far gone.
You've got nowhere to run.
Cuz you're too far gone,
Now you know I'm the one.

Now you're too far gone.
You've got nowhere to run.
Cuz you're too far gone,
Now you know I'm the one.

Now you're too far gone.
You've got nowhere to run.
Cuz you're too far gone. . .
Now you know I'm the one.
Too far gone,
You've got nowhere to run---Lyrics submitted by Ken.
