When you just give love,
And you don't get love,
You better let love depart.
I know it's true, and yet now I know,
I can't get you out of my heart.

You made me leave my happy home,
You took my love and now you're gone,
Since I fell for you.

Love brings such misery and pain,
I know I'll never be the same,
Since I fell for you.

(chorus)
Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
But I'm in love with you.
You love me, then you snub me,
But what can I do? 
I'm still in love with you 

And I -
guess I'll never see the light,
I get the blues 'most every night,
Since I fell I fell for you.

(chorus)

And I -
Guess I'll never see the light,
I get the blues 'most every night,
Since I fell for you.

Since I fell for you.---Lyrics submitted by Bill.
