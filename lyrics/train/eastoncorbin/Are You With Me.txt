It was Sunday afternoon
I was sunk in my recliner
Football game was on
Tampa Bay and Carolina
I wasnt payin much attention
The volume down not watchin it at all
This house was like an ice box
Had all the curtains drawn
I had it more like a hotel room and less like a home
Its been so quiet around here lately
I wasn't thinkin anyone would call

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin that you missed us'
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know Id finally hit the bottom
An all time low
Suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought Id never find somebody new

Let alone you

Now here I am at the baggage claim
A nervous wreck waitin on your plane
Ring in my hands checkin my watch
I never dreamed 48 hours ago
Id be standin here waitin on anyone
No not anyone

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know
Id finally hit the bottom
An all time low
Suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought Id never find somebody new
Let alone you
Let alone you---
