Moonlight's kinda like a spotlight shining down on you tonight
Ready or down low playing one good 'n slow
Setting it up just right
I can hear loud and clear what your eyes are saying to mine

It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot
It's a real deal
Yeah you're kissing me, sliding up next to me
The way your heartbeat feels
It's about to get real

Where this is going is where I'd been hoping
We'd end up at
And if you keep on touching me and telling me you love me
There's no turning back
It feels like it should, I knew it would
We can't miss, are you ready for this?

It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot
It's a real deal
Yeah you're kissing me, sliding up next to me
The way your heartbeat feels
It's about to get real
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot
It's a real deal
Yeah you're kissing me, sliding up next to me
The way your heartbeat feels
Girl the way your heartbeat feels
It's about to get real

Yeah baby it's about to get real---
