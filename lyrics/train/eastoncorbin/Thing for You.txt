Falling stars fall to the ground
Floors are flat and the moon is round
Grass is green and skies are blue
And girl I got a thing for you

Old trucks rattle down gravel roads
Rivers wind and the north wind blows
Rain drops fall on old tin roofs
And girl I got a thing for you

Dreamers dream and wishers wish
Talkers talk and fishers fish
Sun sets in the west each day
Don't ask me why it goes that way

Old cowboys don't have much to say
Christmas comes on Christmas day
And I guess what I'm getting to
Is girl I got a thing for you

Farmers farm and painters paint
God is good and the devil ain't
Summers hot and sidewalks crack
Don't ask me why it goes like that

Now slide on over next to me
Let me kiss those pretty red lips so sweet
And get lost in your eyes a blue
Cause girl I got a thing for you

When it comes to you girl I'm a fool
Cause I got a thing for you ---
