What have I done?
What have I done?

Above the grave of a stranger,
These words were never heard

I put my feet in the shoes of another man.
You were wronged, let down, defeated.
Death cheated and played you like a fool..
I should have built a tower to hold you high.
I should have built a tower to hold you high.

(I died, I died)
I died inside when I, when I, when I cut you down.
Death has come to destroy.
Defeat shows its face.

I failed you, I threw you away.
I cut you down.
I cut.
I failed you, I threw you away.
I failed you, I threw you away.
I failed you, I threw you away.
I failed you.

Sometimes I need to hit a little harder.
Sometimes I need to speak a little quieter.
I made you carry th casket of an innocent man.
When it should have been me.
It should have been me.

Oh God, Im speaking to you.
You said we are redeemed.
Oh God, Im speaking to you.
You said we are set free.
You said.

We are the weak. The pain is
The Devourer, the Devourer
We are the weak. The pain is
The Devourer. Its devouring me
I said, we are the weak. The pain is
The Devourer. Its devouring me
Forgive me.---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
