You stand up pridefully in front of thousands
Screaming words of justice and truth
You wear a mask of this city's hero
You are the pretender

You fake, you fake, but fortunate
You wear a mask of this city's hero
You fake, you fake, but fortunate
You are the pretender

Your weak speech lines you gums with gold teeth
Yet you don't believe in a word that you say
You're speaking shackles to life
Self-righteousness is your demise

You coward
Draw a line in the sand
You bastard
Look at what you have become

Your breath it reeks of perversion
Your tongue is just like a whore
Full of vulgarity
Full of the disease

Where is the life in the life you live?
You are the poor millionaire
Where is the life in the life you live?
A lifeless empire, a lifeless heir

Your crown is like a lion's mouth
Devouring you from the inside out
Turn away before there's nothing left
It's life or death

Tyrant
Ring the bells of repentance
Awakening from your deathbed

Tyrant
Ring the bells of repentance
Awakening from your deathbed

Oh, tyrant
(Oh, tyrant)

You stand up pridefully in front of thousands
Screaming words of justice and truth
You wear a mask of this city's hero
You are the pretender

Coward
Coward

Where is the life in the life you live?
Where is the life in the life you live?
Life you live---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
