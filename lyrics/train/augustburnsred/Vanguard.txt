Wave goodbye, as we turn our backs on our past
Wave goodbye, cut our future short to pave a new path
Wave goodbye, we dropped it all on a dime to be on our own
Wave goodbye, as we make the escape into the unknown

We pushed through shattering expectations
Filled with dreams, filled with heartache

We pushed through shattering expectations
Filled with dreams, filled with heartache

We're still standing strong, standing strong
As we keep living on, living on

Free fall
Close your eyes and take the dive
Free fall
Close your eyes and take the dive
Free fall
Close your eyes, and take the dive
This is your new purpose in life,
This is your new purpose in life
Free fall
Close your eyes, and take the dive
This is your new purpose in life,
This is your new purpose in life
Free fall
Close your eyes, and take the dive
This is your new purpose in life,
This is your new purpose in life
Free Fall
This is your new purpose in life,
This is your new purpose in life---
