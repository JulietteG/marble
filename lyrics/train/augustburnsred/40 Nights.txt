Youre living for today, but your future is looking bleak. One day itll all come crashing down.
Nothing lasts forever. Youve only planned for the here and now.
I said: Nothing lasts forever. Live fast, die young.

Live fast and die young. Its whats ahead, but just remember:
slow and steady wins the race, so pick your head up and keep your mouth shut.

You are the captor of originality. You are the thief of authenticity.
Respect is something that youll never see. Everything you write all sounds the same.
Youre forsaken. Forsaken on this mountain. The bridges have turned to ash.

This is your final hour. This is your great fall.
You wont make it out alive, so say your dearest goodbyes.

You are Goliath standing firm in your light. We are David and youre in our sights.
You are Goliath standing firm in your light. We are David and youre in our sights.
Your dreams have come true. Have you forgotten the reason why?

Life, death, dreams, wealth - nothing lasts forever.
Greed, envy, gluttony will amount to nothing. Nothing lasts forever.

The earth is about to quake. The earth is about to quake. The earth is about to quake.
Brace for impact. Run for the hills. Brace for impact. Its a long way home.
Brace for impact. Run for the hills. Youll surely end here.

Goliath, were screaming your name. Goliath, were coming for you.---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
