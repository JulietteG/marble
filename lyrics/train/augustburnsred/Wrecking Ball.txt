We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Dont you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I cant live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, youre not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, were ashes on the ground

Dont you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I cant live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I shouldve let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I shouldve let you win

Dont you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me

Yeah, you wreck me---
