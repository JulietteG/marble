Certainty can't be embraced or held over heads
It has no shape or form
Not one man on this earth has the answer to all, all of your questions
Running, running in circles, I'm running out of breath
I'm not sure where to go, go anymore
Even a man like me, like me, full of faith carries doubt
Yet how could faith live on if doubt did not exist (exist, exist, exist)
How can faith carry on if doubt did not exist?
How could faith carry on?
Oh

I've searched far and wide for truth
Truth is what we seek
It's what we desire, truth, truth
Can't you see I need a savior?
Truth, truth is what we seek
It's what we desire, truth, truth
Can't you see I need a savior?

I need peace of mind
I'm finding out my heart is my worst enemy
Blurring the lines between what is right or wrong
I bring myself to my knees, so that I can see, the worst within me

I bring myself to my knees, so that I can see, the worst within me
You dance around my life oh so many times
I've been searching so long across, this map, and even through the shadows
So lovely, so blind, oh truth, you're so divine

I will climb this mountain to find you
I will search far and wide
I will climb this mountain to find you before running out of time---
