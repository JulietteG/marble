I wish I still smoked cigarettes
Light one up and travel time
A stiff drink and a whisper just
Is enough to light a fire, feel alive
Wish I could go back to those nights sometimes

I wish I still drove a muscle car
Horses rumbling under the hood
Flyin past the welcome sign under the stars
Wishin I could leave for good
I swore I would..
Every now and then I go back to that neighborhood

I wish I still did a lot of things
I dont do anymore
When I didnt know what wasnt good for me
But I knew everything else for sure
I guess what I really miss is the freedom then
The way it felt, the innocence
Thats what I really meant
When I said

I wish I still smoked cigarettes
I felt more grown up then
We were talking about where we were gonna go
Instead of where wed been
Wed ride around the lake and make those plans
Still had the world in the palm of our hands
We never had a chance, now and then

I wish I still did a lot of things
I dont do anymore
When I didnt know what wasnt good for me
But I knew everything else for sure
I guess what I really miss is the freedom then
The way it felt, the innocence
Thats what I really meant
When I said I wish I still smoked cigarettes

I wish I still smoked cigarettes
Something to calm my nerves
Wherever you are tonight, you were better than I deserve
I wish I still smoked cigarettes
So I had something to let go
Up in smoke---
