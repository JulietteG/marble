Lets say were sorry, before its too late, give forgiveness a chance
Turn the anger into water; let it slip through our hands
We all bleed red, we all taste rain, all fall down, Lose our way, 
We all say words we regret, we all cry tears, we all bleed red

If were fighting, were both losing; were just wasting our time
Because my scars, they are your scars and your world is mine
You and I, we all bleed red, we all taste rain, all fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret, well cry tears, we all bleed red
Sometimes were strong, sometimes were weak, sometimes were hurt and it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath, were all the same; we all bleed red

(Instrumental break)
Lets say were sorry.Before its too late.

We all bleed red, all taste rain, all fall down, lose our way, 
We all say words we regret, we all cry tears we all bleed red, 
Sometimes were strong, sometimes were weak; sometimes were hurt
It cuts deep; we live this life breath to breath; were all the same
We all bleed r-e-e-e-d-d-d---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
