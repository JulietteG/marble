It's happened again, there's a colourless sky
It's dimmed me again, I've run out of why
Hank williams is grieving I'm scanning the psalms
it says when jesus was here they stilettoed his palms
And the pledge and the vow as you find if you seek
But what if you try and find nothing but bleak

Turn me tender again, fold me into you
Turn me tender again, mold me like new
When faith lost its promise I stood there deep blue
Turn me tender, through a union with you

Can I lay with you now, Like the very first time
I've had rooms full of dollars, but I'm down to a dime
For there's wonder and awe in the maine of a Lion, 
but there's nowhere to go tonight, and I'm chapters from Zion
But you're still my cryptic you are my cherishing prayer
with serenity kisses that can sooth and repair

Turn me tender again, fold me into you
Turn me tender again, mold me like new
When faith lost its promise I stood there deep blue
Turn me tender, through a union with you

And laments they have a purpose, laments have a cost
and that requiem playing, ah she can gather the lost
But it sometimes tastes sour, all the sweetness of hope
While the blizzards keep raging on this lovers slope
But I don't want to freeze here, inside or out
For it's you that dissolve all my cold walls of doubt

Turn me tender again, fold me into you
Turn me tender again, come on mold me like new
When  faith lost its promise I stood there deep blue
Turn me tender .. through a union with you
