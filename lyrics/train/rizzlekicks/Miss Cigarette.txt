Mmm yeah i love it when my lips are on her,
Theres a spark in our relationship i plant a kiss upon her,
I **** around too much and theres a risk that Im a goner,
So Ive got her on hand like a badge of honour,
The downside is shes never there when Im lacking dollar,
So Ive got to try and go through a day without acting bothered, 
In the hope shed leave me alone because Im better off her,
But I see that spark and I just accept the offer,


So many people say why are you with her,
And Im like; shes a damn good kisser,
She feeds my addiction,
She leaks something different,
The smoke from our last meeting has risen,
Keep her away from all of the other boys,
Cause you know shes every single cutters choice,
Always there when the cold nights are lurking,
Gotta keep hold of my Golden virgin,

Chorus:

I think shes good for me,
Thats why i dont want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when i shouldnt be,
Shes there when im in need,
But she isnt cheap,
The last time i saw her,
Mostly i couldnt breathe,
And they say shes bad for me,
But they say shes bad for me,
But i dont think shes bad for me,
But its a bit of a miss illusion,

Shes got a mate called Benson,
But hes a bitter of a WASTER,
Always chats about silver and gold,
But i dont think that hes safe (right?)
Plus his mate likes to come out at break time,
Trys to act bad but ive smoked him like 8 times!,
And if i take it the wrong places then i face a fine,
And if i dont take it much she says its a waste of time,
In fact she doesnt lie, 
She tells me that shes bad for me,
Even when i patch things up i dont feel like i have to leave,


I said i had to leave; i had to get away,
Its funny when im not around ive seen better days,
Sometimes i demonstrate how to set it straight,
I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case,
But when im chilling shes always in my mind,
I do her out but the doubts are just glassed in side,
I should respond in time but then i found out,
The last boy she kissed coughed and died,

Chorus:

I think shes good for me,
Thats why i dont want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when i shouldnt be,
Shes there when im in need,
But she isnt cheap,
The last time i saw her,
mostly i couldnt breathe,
And they say shes bad for me,
But they say shes bad for me,
But i dont think shes bad for me,
But its a bit of a miss illusion,

M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Actually wait nah ill have another kiss,
Oh **** im in love with this chick what this its,
Straight robbery,
Shes always there when im by myself and I cant remain solitary,
Babe honestly,
it appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty,
You went from my pal to my lover,
Now i see you outside with thousands of other,
But youre on my mind right now,
So I guess Im coming down from another little fling,
Gotta confess this,

Chorus:

I think shes good for me,
Thats why i dont want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when i shouldnt be,
Shes there when im in need,
But she isnt cheap,
The last time i saw her,
mostly i couldnt breathe,
And they say shes bad for me,
But they say shes bad for me,
But i dont think shes bad for me,
But its a bit of a miss illusion,---Lyrics submitted by Lucy Hollindale.
