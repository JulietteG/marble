I said Im living in a lost generation
I said Im living in a lost generation
Ive got my heart
Ive found my soul

Im living
Im living
Im living
Life man

Switch on the TV,
They keep it real, but not in that way
I turn the channel
And just see somebodys life displayed
Awkward causes and dodgy moments
I smile it keeps me sane
Reality TV is morphine
Give me that now
Let me ease the pain
(Oh Yeah)

Man, talent shows
I seen some of our friends go and beat their targets
Ive also seen carrers end when they aint even really started
Jeremy Kyle got the nation laughing at other peoples expense
Sombody tell that guy that we hate him too, we are not his friends

#trend

We make people go clap clap yeah
When I heard people buy views
I was more confused than all Jhon Terrys black friends
Watch your mouth son

#trend

Oi big brothers in the house now yeah
I said screw the voting and the talking
I just wanna see people fight and have sex

Chorus:
So lets say Hey (hey)
Im living
Im living
Life man

Say Hey (hey)
Im living
Im living
Life man
Ive got my heart
Ive found my soul
Im living
Im living
I said Im living in a lost generation
I said Im living in a lost generation
Ive got my heart
Ive found my soul
Im living
Im living
Im living
Life man

Verse:
Yeah, I wanna dance
I wanna have fun
Let me feel the music
I hope you realize how dumb you sound when you call us stupid
I wanna drive to work hear this beat and make my dreams come true
Keep it up man a beat like this reminds my heart what to do
Salute
I want you to feel useless
Baby thats right, every bad boy should
And damn right Im a slut, you know this
But Im a boy, its all good
Take snas of me, Im an icon standing here in my shades
Oi be someone
If you beg to be followed then youve lost your way

#trend

We make people go clap, clap yeah
Why is everybody so PC
Its not my fault if you take offense
Watch your mouth son

#trend

Whats wrong if a girl loves sex?
Its only wrong if its not with you
So maybe you should get better in bed
(you naughty boy)

Chorus:
Say Hey (hey)
Im living
Im living
Life man

Say Hey (hey)
Im living
Im living
Life man
Ive got my heart
Ive found my soul
Im living
Im living
I said Im living in a lost generation
I said Im living in a lost generation
Ive got my heart
Ive found my soul
Im living
Im living
Im living
Life man---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
