Yo, yeah
Check the rhyme and rhythm
Its nice and different
Plus is bright and brilliant

Kinda how I like my women
And thats the right opinion
Although at night Im slipping
Win her never, ring her, now she thinks Im a villian

See, Im not festive, but I quite like presents
Dont wanna die, but I quite like heaven
Wanna good place, but I dont like waiting
Wanna go crazy, but Im not patient

Wanna be smart, but I dont like learning
I wanna be rich, but it takes time earning
Wanna be fit, but I dont like running
Then I see you and I wish I done something

I like your style
Been watching you for a while
I said
Oh yeah
Lets dance and then
Lets skip to the good bit. Oh!
Lets skip to the good bit. Oh!

So, been here two days long
Still not stepped that stone
Still not moving on, on
Now, let us go

I will take control
No more moving slow
In this situation
Hell yeah!

I like your style
Been watching you for a while
I said
Oh yeah
Lets dance and then
Lets skip. Oh!
Lets skip to the good bit. Oh!
Lets skip
Lets skip to the good bit. Oh!
Lets skip to the good bit. Oh!

Yeah, we got that real vibe
we dont know what were doing but it feels right
Yeah, listen up, yo
Feeling alive is a good way to kill time.

Yeah and were bubbling up
We came here with nothing but love, we stay easy
Yeah, and if troubles a must
You gotta stay till they pack up the club just to please me.

I say,
Lets skip to the good bit
I say,
Lets skip to the good bit
I say,
Lets skip to the good bit
Lets skip to the good bit
Lets skip to the good bit
Lets skip to the good bit
Lets skip to the good bit
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lets skip to the good bit
Lets skip to the good bit---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
