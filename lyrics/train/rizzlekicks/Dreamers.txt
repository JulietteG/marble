Intro 
Wooo! Rk... Rk what! ? 
We're the believers, do you believe us? 

Chorus 
I can find my place in my dreams 
(In my dreams, in my, in my dreams) 
Yeah I can find my place in my dreammms 

Verse 1 
Yeah, it's that kid with the British accent, 
Still kicking and bringing us wicked raps when, 
Other rappers lack sense, innovation absent, 
Take that in to the count like your bank said, 
Yeah, let me set the rhythm, 
And these texts are spinning, 
We be best in Britain, 
When I say best, I mean best of living, 
As the best decision, 
To see lesser limits 

We aim higher, 
Higher than Mariah in a choir or the guy who chills with Bubbles in The Wire 
Desire, to leave behind, the reason why, 
As little as, read to find, our recent times, 
I'm paying what I wanna be like a portrait, 
You let other people paint you (poor trait), 
All day, I have more faith, than what you'll say, 
But you're foretelling to talk straight, 
And I know 

Chorus 
I can find my place in my dreams 
Said I can find my place in my dreammms 

I don't care what you choose as facts, 
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back, 
In my dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreams, 
( My dreams), 
My dreams, 
(My dreams), 

Straight up me to the sand, Imma spaceman, 
Yeah, with a suit to match 
In my dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreammms

Verse 2 
Yeah, imma grafter, 
Check it or the grit on my Nike's, 
Delivering these lyrics like I'm big in the 90's, 
I love rhythm, and I sit on it nicely, 
Your chicks' lips, take it cos she Rinses it nightly, 
Yeah, 
It's far from a mission to find me, 
Kicking it and Camden, 
Spitting with Hynze, 
And if you like, I'd just listen to high beats, 
? if your swimming with the fishes you Pisces, 
I'm getting ready for stress days, 
How I rap now aint the best way, 
To earn money and tea, 
It seems like rapping like you're dumb as (woo! ) 
That's how you get paid, 
Well, I'm not on that, 
I'm different, I love rap I'm living, 
Wrong that, you're kidding, 
All facts considered, 
You made me believe your make-believe, 
? in a Batman figures, Yeah! 

Chorus 
I can find my place in my dreams 
Said I can find my place in my dreammms 

I don't care what you choose as fact, 
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back, 
In my dreams, 
(My dreams), (x4) 

Straight up me to the sand, Imma spaceman, 
Yeah, with a suit to match 
In my dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreammms 

Bridge 
I can find that place, up in my dreams tonight, 
Where you and I, don't have to fight, 
Over what is right or wrong, 
It's not you who decides, 
Oh this is my life 

Verse 3 
I said think of all those stupid things that you've ever said to me, 
Put it in perspective and then tell me that you don't agree, 
I'm not telling you to think what I think, 
While your point of view just really aint my cup of tea, 
I wish everyone could all live in harmony, 
When people made decisions, 
It was always made impartially, 
I find it hard to speak, 
Suppose I'm always half asleep, 
Doesn't change the fact that I've never made a half a speech 

Yeah I'm feeling spaced out, 
What, 
A place for the believers, 
That don't becue then leave us, 
We need some dreamers to feature, 
(I'm feeling spaced outtt), 
Spaced out, 
Yeah, I'm feeling spaced out 

Yeah, now I wanna stomp on the moon, 
Stomp on it, 
Stomp on the moon, 
Stomp on it, stomp on it, (x4) 

I don't care what you choose as fact, 
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back, 
In my dreams, 
(My dreams), (x4) 

Straight up me to the sand, Imma spaceman, 
Yeah, with a suit to match 
In my dreams, 
(My dreams), 
My dreams, 
(My dreams),
