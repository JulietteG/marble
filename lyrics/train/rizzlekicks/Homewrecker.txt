Im sorry your boyfriend isn't saying alot...oh

He said youre a homewrecker
Well, you should know better,
Shes out your league and plus,
You know that Im a go getter
[x2]
Im a go go get her, Im a go getter [x4]

Yeah, Id be lucky to see,
Her face when I go clubbing it seems,
She picks up her bag as she leaves, 
Am I a mug to tell her shes my cuppa tea? 
Ive known her for ages,
But Im looking at my shoes when I try to 
Converse with her, know my chat ain't the greatest,
Want her to know, theres no one as lovely as me!
Come into my world,
But Ive gone for a few of her mates and, 
The concept of getting with friends, 
Then being their lovers is just for the Spice Girls.
And your guy, I dont buy that,
I mean look at him hes a right prat,
He says dont talk to her like that,
I said sorry its like that... LEAVE HER

Im sorry your boyfriend isn't saying alot..

He said youre a homewrecker
Well, you should know better,
Shes out your league and plus,
You know that Im a go getter
[x2]
Im a go go get her, Im a go getter [x4]

He whispered to me, he said brother
Can you be kind?
Another bit of flirting and the ending
Will be we fight
I told him, I completely understand and
Youre a sweet guy
But I completely love your girlfriend
so it looks like
I dont really care bruv (shes mine)
Already made up (my mind!)
Cause when I see her (I find)
Every impluse in my body kicks in, the thing is,
For me she is worth risking, getting kicked in
But its you shes always kissing and it fucks me off
Yeah yeah yeah yeah homewrecker
Im whats known as a homewrecker
They call me a homewrecker

I think Im better off avoiding the girl,
Whenever i see her with you it annoys me to hell, 
And then Im sorry I dont mean to disappoint 
You as well,
When you ask me if Id ever wanna steal her,
And the answer is
I dont really care bruv (shes mine)
Already made (my mind!)
Cause when I see her (I find)
Every moral in my body gets lost, and I best not,
Confirm myself a guest spot, in a bad track record 
Guess what,
When I see her I get effed off cause...

He said youre a homewrecker
Well, you should know better,
Shes out your league and plus,
You know that Im a go getter
[x2]
Im a go go get her, Im a go getter [x4]

Im sorry your boyfriend isnt saying alot... True
Say whaaat
Im whats known as a homewrecker
They call me homewrecker
