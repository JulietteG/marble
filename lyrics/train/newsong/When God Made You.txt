Its always been a mystery to me
how two hearts can come together
and love can last forever..
and now that I have found you I believe
that a miracle has come
when God sends the perfect one
now gone are all my questions about why
and i've never been so sure of aniything in my life

Oh I wonder what God was thinking
When he created you.
I wonder If he knew evrything I would need
because he made all my dreams come true.
when God made you, 
He mustve thinking abt me.

I promise that wherever you may go
and wherever life may lead you
from my heart i'll be there too
and from this moment on
i want you to know
I'll let nothing come between us
and I will love the ones you love

now gone are all my questions about why
and i've never been so sure of anithing in my life

I wonder what God was thinking...

He made the Sun
he made the moon
to harmonize in perfect tune
one cant move without the other
they just have to be together
and that is why I know its true
cuz your for me and Im for you
cuz my world just cant be right
without you in my life

I wonder what God was tinking....

He mustv heard evry prayer Iv been praying
Guess he knew evrything I would need
When God made you (i thank God He made you)
when dreams come true
when God made you
he mustv been thinking about me.---Lyrics submitted by khayali.
