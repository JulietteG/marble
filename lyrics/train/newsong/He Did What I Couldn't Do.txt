God looked out from Heaven and saw the pain that I was in
My life was so confused and blinded by my sin
He knew there was nothing in this world that I could do
That's why he sent His son to die for me and you

He did what I couldn't do, went to the cross so I could be forgiven
He spent three days in the grave, to make my life worth living
And the wonder of salvation is, I could never be good enough
He did what I couldn't do

Some people think they've got this whole thing figured out
Living right, doing good is what they think life's all about
But they need to know that there's an answer to their faith
They've got to know that Jesus is the only way

He did what I couldn't do, went to the cross so I could be forgiven
He spent three days in the grave, to make my life worth living
And the wonder of salvation is, I could never be good enough
He did what I couldn't do

Make no mistake, this is not fairy tale
One day everybody's gonna need some help
There's just no way that we could make it by ourselves

He did what I couldn't do, went to the cross so I could be forgiven
He spent three days in the grave, to make my life worth living
And the wonder of salvation is, I could never be good enough
He did what I couldn't do

He did what I couldn't do, went to the cross so I could be forgiven
He spent three days in the grave, to make my life worth living
And the wonder of salvation is, I could never be good enough
He did what I couldn't do

He did it, He did it
He did it, He did it
He did it, He did it
He did it, He did it
He did it, He did it
He did it, He did it---Lyrics submitted by Linda Raebel.
