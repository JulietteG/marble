Blessed be your name 
in the land  that is plentiful.
where your streams of abundance flows
 blessed be your name.

 blessed be your name 
when I am found in the desert place
 for I walk through  the wilderness .
Blessed be your name 

every blessing you pour out  of
turn back to praise 
when the darkness  closes in lord
still I will say 

blessed be the name of the lord 
blessed be your name blessed be the name of the lord 
blessed be your glorious name

blessed be your name 
when the sun shining down on me 
when the world all as it should be 
blessed be your name 

blessed be your name 
on the road marked with suffering 
and its playing in the offering 
blessed be your name 

every blessing you pour out of
turn back to praise  
when the darkness closes in Lord 
still I will say 
blessed be the name of the lord blessed be your name 
blessed be the name of the lord blessed be your glorious name 

You give and take away 
you give and take away 
my heart will choose to say 
lord blessed be your name 

every blessing you pour out of 
turn back to praise 
when the darkness closes in lord still I goanna say
 blessed be the name of the lord
 blessed be your name Jesus
 blessed be the name of the lord blessed be your glorious name .

blessed be the name of the lord
 blessed be your name
 blessed be the name of the lord blessed be your glorious name .

You give and take away 
you give and take away 
my heart will choose to say 
lord blessed be your name---Lyrics submitted by trystian.
