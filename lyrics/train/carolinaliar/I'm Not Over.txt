what a waste of time
if i cross my mind
and i never missed a beat
can explain the who
or what i was
trying to believe

what would you do
what would you do 
do you know
i once had a grip on everything
it feels better to let go

Chorus 
I'm not over
I'm not over you just yet
i cannot hide it
you're not that easy to forget
I'm not over

never took the chance 
could have jumped the fence
i was scared of my own two feet
could of crossed the line 
it was black and white
no contrast to be seen

what would you do 
what would you do 
do you know 
was it all a joke
never had control
I'm not better on my own

what a waste of time
if i crossed my mind
cant explain this thing
or what i mean 
I'm trying to let go
