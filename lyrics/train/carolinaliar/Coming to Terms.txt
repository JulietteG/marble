Oh no, it's not me 
I just forgot to tell you 
Didn't mean, it seems obscene 
We just lost trck along the way 

I'm coming to terms, I'm starting to learn 
This ain't all it's cracked up to be 
'Cause I'm using you, you're using me
It's never as easy as we believe 

'Cause this hurt, I can't leave
I understand, but can you?
I'm just scared, you're lonely 
Everyone know you're better than me  

I'm coming to terms, I'm starting to learn 
This ain't all it's cracked up to be 
'Cause I'm using you, you're using me
It's never as easy as we believe 

Is this what you need?
Am what you need?

I'm coming to terms, I'm starting to learn 
This ain't all it's cracked up to be 
'Cause I'm using you, you're using me
It's never as easy as we believe 

Na, na na na, na na na na 
Na, na na na, na na na na 
Na, na na na, na na na na 
Na, na na na, na na na na 
Na, na na na, na na na na
