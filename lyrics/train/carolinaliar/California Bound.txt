You're miles away
You just can't relate
Are you what surrounds you

You feel alive
At least you think that life is something in you
What do we know

There's a southern bound train tomorrow
Takes us out of this dirty town
Chase the sun back to the west coast
In eight hours we're California bound
We're California bound

You got butterflies
Well so do I
Just pretend that they're not there

We can only rely on ourselves like every time
It's just a new plan
What do we know

There's a southern bound train tomorrow
Takes us out of this dirty town
Chase the sun back to the west coast
In eight hours we're California bound
We're California bound
We're California bound

You look so brave with the sun in your face
Just gotta believe me
Why don't we go

There's a southern bound train tomorrow
Takes us out of this dirty town
Chase the sun back to the west coast
In eight hours
Oh
Oh
Oh

Forget everything tomorrow
We'll be on a brand new road
Chasing the sun back to the west coast
In eight hours we're California bound
(Ah)
We're California bound
(Bound)
We're California bound
We're California bound---Lyrics submitted by mason.
