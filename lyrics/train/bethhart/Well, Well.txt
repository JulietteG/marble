Well well gettin to know you so well
Well well gettin to know you so well
I've heard some talk in the neighborhood bout a good time somebody's havin'
They don't know
They just don't know the half about it
And that there's so much to it
And what they're sayin
They don't know what we're knowin
Never gonna catch up
Never get goin

Well well gettin to know you so well
Well well gettin to know you so well
As long as I can see its you and me alone together
It feels so good
Lord I feel so good about it
If its feelin good inside of one
Nothin ever matters
Lovin you doin what I'm lovin
Lovin me lovin what ya do
Well well gettin to know you so well
Well well gettin to know you so well

Don't you hear me talkin to you Joe?
Come on
Well well 

Well well gettin to know you so well 
Well well gettin to know you so well
I heard some talkin in the neighborhood bout a good time somebody's havin
But they don't know
They just don't know the half about it
And that there's so much to it
What they're sayin
They don't know but we know it
Never gonna catch us
They'll never get goin

Well well gettin to know you so well
Well well gettin to know you so well
Well well gettin to know you so well
Well well gettin to know you so well---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
