I just stopped by
To see your face
I heard youve been out running in the heart and all over the place
So youre gone and youve decided
To give it all away to the church
You say sick but a little bit of the living hurts

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be there
Inside of you

There in your heart
There in your heart
Wherever you go
I will go too

The hours late, Im like lightning
Stretching far across the sky, the same, youve seen it
Must be a million years ago when I believed that I could fly
Maybe Ill burn down the house
Or build crosses from the wood
Maybe Ill go to Africa
And be lion king, if only I could

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be there
Inside of you

There in your heart
There in your heart
Wherever you go
I will go too

I was there in the beginning
You took your first breath alone
Ill be there in the ending
When the worlds desire leaves your bones
And all of the corners and in all the wide open spaces in the dark
Ill be there in your heart
Ill be there in your heart

Ill be there in your heart
There in your heart
Ill be there in your heart ---
