I sing these words, time and time again
To express my life, of being your lover, and your friend
And as the clouds, cry cry cry cry, high above, she'd their tears
I'll embrace you, with love, from all your fear

(chorus..varys each time)
Am i the one, am i the one that you love
Am i the one,hheeyy, 
Am i the one that you think of
Am, am i, am i the one..

Oh yeh yeh yeh
A passion in your carres, floats from your fingertips
And i pray for the day, that i hear those prescious words pass through your lips
Wishin upon the start, from up above..uhh
That soon you'll love at me baby, and say im the one that you love

Am i the one, yeh, 
Am i the one that you love
Am i the one, hey hey
Am i the one that you think of

Don't you make me feel crazy, if i break down and cry
Just tell me that you love me baby
Even if it is a lie

Am, am i
Am, am i
Am, am i, 
Am i the one..
