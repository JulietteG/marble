Springing like a chicken
I wake up in the morning
Cooking me my bacon and bread
Jumping in the shower
In less than half an hour
To make it to the congregation

Im going, lets shake it down the aisle
Breaking bread with my own flesh in sky
Ive got the spirit of God
Ive got the spirit of God

Now the preacher going crazy
He swears hes gonna save me
Knocking pebbles out on the floor
My soul stops jumping
I know Im feeling something
While Im giving it up to the Lord

Were going, lets shake it down the aisle
Different mother, brother, sister and child
Got the spirit of God
We got the spirit of God

And make it like a slow celebration
Just set your situation right
I know Im gonna head straight to heaven
Destination straight to the light
Im going on the highway to heaven
I know.. Ive got the spirit of God 
Ive got the spirit of God

My moves already working
Im broken but Im burning
Get myself back up on the street
People call me lazy
Yea just a little maybe
Driving everyone that I meet

But Im going, lets shake it down the aisle
Yea Ill do it with my own flashy style
Ive got the spirit of God
Ive got the spirit of God

And make it like a slow celebration
Just set your situation right
I know Im gonna head straight to heaven
Destination straight to the light
Im going on the highway to heaven
I know.. Ive got the spirit of God 
Got me the spirit of God

Alright, alright now, show em how to do it
I couldnt, I couldnt
Thats alright

Ive got the spirit of God, I want to thank you Lord
Ive got the spirit of God for giving me the word
Ive got the spirit of God, I want to thank you Lord
I want to thank you Lord, Ive got to thank you Lord
Ive got the spirit of God, I want to thank the one
Ive got the spirit of God, you take his only son
Ive got the spirit of God, I want to thank you Lord
I want to thank you Lord

Im going on the highway to heaven
Destination straight to the light
Im going on the highway to heaven
Destination straight to the light
Im going on the highway to heaven
Ive got the spirit of God
Ive got the spirit of God
Yea Ive got the spirit of God
You gave me the spirit of God---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
