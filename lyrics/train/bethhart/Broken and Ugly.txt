Me and my dog really get along 
She don't howl when I'm screamin' my songs 
I cuss, I drink, I lie, I spit, 
Guess I really don't give a shit 
Broken and ugly yes I am 
Still I feel good divin' in Mama 
I'm runnin' again- odelay 
Down in Alabama where I'm wanted in jail 
I'm a little nervous in the Bible belt 
I'm broke I'm smoked out and passed out on the bar 
Then I took all the money and your grandma's car 
Broken and ugly yes I am 
Still I look good divin' in Mama 
I'm runnin' again- Odelay 
Do what ya do say what ya say 
Don't waste no time on yesterdays 
Cash in your ticket to ride 
Don't let them talk you into walkin' 
Into no one else's shoes 
Don't be no sucker in line---
