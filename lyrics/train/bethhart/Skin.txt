She combs her hair & cleans her face 
Closes the door & kneels to pray 
It don't matter that she's alone 
Beast or dragons she's going home 
If I lay me down 
Bow my head unto the ground 
Would you heal my skin 
& these blisters within My skin

She found today 
So hard to say 
I sweat the sheets
Too tired to play
& it don't matter 
Cause I'm still alive 
Beast or Dragons 
Won't make me hide
Make me hide, make me hide, 

If I lay me down 
Bow my head unto the ground 
Would you heal my skin 
& these blisters within, blisters within My skin

Another way 
I just can't find the words to say
Cold where I lay
It's cold where I lay
Bones cracked to clay
A killer's in the way
And hot is my shame
Fire pulls my veins
For never is my name
Forever in my shame
Holy come heal me
Solely, delivery delivery

If I lay me down
Bow my head unto the ground
Would you heal my skin
& these blisters within...

If I lay me down 
Bow my head unto the ground 
Would you heal my skin 
& these blisters within, blisters within my skin---
