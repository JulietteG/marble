(with Joe Bonamassa)

You told me baby one more time
Wont make me sit on the lonely ride
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

Im like a fish out of water stuck in the tree
You dont even wanna talk to me
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

He wont take me back when I come around
Says hes sorry then he puts me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And Im broken down like a train wreck
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

Said I got a candle that burns so bright
In my way up every night
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

You dont like a seaman standing around
Feel like Ive been shot back and down
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

He wont take me back when I come around
Says hes sorry then he puts me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And Im broken down like a train wreck
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

Turn off the trouble like you turn off a light
Went off and let me, it just aint right
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

I ran at the corner, there is something to see
Brings it out round back where I used to be
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

He wont take me back when I come around
Says hes sorry then he puts me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And Im broken down like a train wreck
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

He wont take me back when I come around
Says hes sorry then he puts me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And Im broken down like a train wreck

[x6]
Well its over
I know I thought I cant let go

Cant let go
Cant let go
Its over
I know I thought I cant let go
Cant let go
Cant let go ---
