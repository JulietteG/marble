One, one, one, one, one, one. One, one, one, one, one, one

June is on the run for so long,
Pushed and pulled then shunned,
It was so wrong,
These fours walls crashing in won't stop me now,
Cause I'm alive, I'm out tonight, all night.

Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat,
Every day we've got to hold on,
'cause if we hold on we could find some new energy.

Streets with flags unfurled like treasure,
Thank me for my words, it's a pleasure,
Just don't ask me to stay 'cause I'll be gone,
But it's alright I'm OK - always.

Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat,
Every day we've got to hold on,
'cause if we hold on we could find some new energy.

One plus one is one - together,
One plus one is one - forever. (x2)

Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat, (x4)
Every day we've got to hold on,
'cause if we hold on we could find some new energy.---Lyrics submitted by Lot.
