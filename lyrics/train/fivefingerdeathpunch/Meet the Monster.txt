[V1:]
It's not that complicated and you ain't gotta believe
They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed
I've never been complacent, I can't afford to be
I know you think you're special but you ain't nothin'

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can you read between the lines?
Or are you stuck in black and white?
Hope I'm on the list of people that you hate
It's time you met the monster that you have helped create
Boo!

[Chorus:]
You've pushed me one too many times
I'm sick of all of the fiction, we're gonna settle it
You've pushed me one too many times
I'm sick of all of the shit, I'm gonna settle it!

[V2:]
It's not that complicated and you ain't gotta believe
They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed
I've never been complacent, I can't afford to be
I know you think you're special but you ain't nothin'

[Pre-Chorus:]
Well there's nothing you can say to me now
And there's nothing you can do to stop me
It's hard not to be a menace to society
When half the population is happy on their knees

[Chorus:]
You've pushed me one too many times
I'm sick of all of the fiction, we're gonna settle it
You've pushed me one too many times
I'm sick of all of the shit, I'm here settle it!

[V3:]
'Cause I can't take it anymore
I refuse to live this way
It's not that I don't care enough, it's not that I can't see
It's everything inside of me that won't let me be you
It won't let me be you!

[V4:]
It's not that complicated and you ain't gotta believe
They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed
I've never been complacent, I can't afford to be
I know you think you're special but you ain't nothin'
No, you ain't nothin'
And you'll never succeed
I know you think you're special,
but you ain't nothin'

But you ain't nothin'!---Lyrics submitted by Tobby.
