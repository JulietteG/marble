I'm so fed up with everyone around me
No one seems to care
I'm just so far gone and nothing's gonna change
I'll never be the same
It's always do this do that everything they want to
I don't wanna live that way
Every chance they get they're always pushing me away

It's never enough no it's never enough
No matter what i say
It's never enough no it's never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be

It's all so messed up and no one ever listens
Everyone's deranged
I'm just so fucked up and i'm never gonna change
I wanna lay it all to waste
They're always say this say that nothing that you want to
I don't wanna live that way
Every chance they get they're always shoving me aside

It's never enough no it's never enough
No matter what i say
It's never enough no it's never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be
I'm done!(i'm done)

In the end we're all just chalk lines on the concrete
Drawn only to be washed away
For the time that i've been given
I am what i am

I'd rather hate you for everything you are
Than ever love you for something you are not
I'd rather you hate me for everything i am
Than have you love me for something that i can't

It's never enough it's never enough
No matter what i say
It's never enough no it's never enough
No matter who i try to be
It's never enough no it's never enough
No matter how i try to taste
It's never enough never never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be---Lyrics submitted by KathleenMarie.
