If you wanted to set me free
Why the fuck wouldn't you say something?
See I was just over 17
Made of poison, cave in free

Oh no please don't abandon me
Mother, Father I love you so
But this is just me disguised as me
I'm the killer who burned your home

This is the street youth rising up---Lyrics submitted by Ridge Broussard.
