I changed your mind and ended up here
Your stained glass eyes and colorful tears

Fine maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to god Im gonna change the world
I promise you some day we'll tell ourselves
Oh my god this is paradise

I cherish my American girl
She holds them down while I destroy the world
My desperate crimes she dont seem to care
She bites her tongue then we can tell each other
Baby this is paradise and its so god damn good
Now we live like we should

Fine maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to god Im gonna change the world
I promise you some day we'll tell ourselves
Oh my god this is paradise

Fine maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to god Im gonna change the world
I promise you some day we'll tell ourselves
Oh my god this is paradise---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
