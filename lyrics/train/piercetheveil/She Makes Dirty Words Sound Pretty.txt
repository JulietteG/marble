If you call me at all
Don't tell me that I'm ordinary
Cause I won't be passing you, please don't leave
And if you tell me you're listening to everything you read

Turn off this light, call my name
Don't talk, just ride
Who wouldn't let you be all about,
About me
I'm only trying to work this out

So, if you call me at all
Don't tell me that I'm ordinary
Cause I won't be passing you, please don't leave.
And if you tell me you're listening to everything you read
If you call me at all

Oh, I hear you breathing on the line
Oh baby girl, I'm not your type
I'll leave you hurting every night
So I won't be coming back
Who wouldn't let me be all alone
Who wouldn't let me be all alone
Who wouldn't let you scream ohh to a soft pillow

I'm such an animal
And baby honestly these teeth won't let you go

Don't tell me that I'm ordinary
Cause I won't be passing you, please don't leave
And if you tell me you're listening to everything you read
If you call me at all
Don't tell me that I'm ordinary
Cause I won't be passing you, please don't leave
And if you tell me you're listening to everything you read
If you call me at all (5x)---Lyrics submitted by Luis Castillo.
