(Where you from, fool?!)

This world is about to change
1, 2 ...
1, 2, 3, 4

Look into my eyes
And write down the words you taste
Blood on your tongue with a crass embrace.
A photo kiss on the day we met said
"This will be a night we won't forget"

Speak slow now, I don't wanna miss when you cry
Glass over diamond blue eyes

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer
Hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming, "Why can't we just be friends?"
It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
To see you throw the first punch.

Now, it's such a shame you had to go and run your mouth
Your mouth is what you make it, but at least I've got real friends
Can you hear me now?
Now that I'm a big star
Fuck you and your new love for yourself
It don't mean shit.

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer
Hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming, "Why can't we just be friends?"
It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
To see you throw the first punch now

I've got so much to give, but
I would kill just to feel less invisible
And you've got so much to learn about gravity
So live it up baby, don't look down
Live it up baby, don't look down

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer
Hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming, "Why can't we just be friends?"
It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
And I saw it coming when you threw the first punch
You threw the first punch
Now it's your turn to run

This is the breath that will take my life
There's no future but matches and propane.
And through the mutated words I write.
Kill it fast and never watch it die.---
