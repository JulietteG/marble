I was saving myself for you.
I was saving myself for you.
I was waiting my whole life for you.
I was saving myself for you.

Tonight we'll be throwing a party.
Under the sunset we started to drink.
A little faster now.
The celebration, so many faces.
I say the words as the moon painted us blue

I've been saving myself for you.
I've been saving myself for you.
I waited my whole life for you.
beause I was saving myself for you.
Now brother bring that beat back.

Now hold on, this is innocent blood, all the beach boys look like sharks
Oh, because without you nothing ever mattered.
I scream and wave my arms, but you dont understand me.
Now as i watch them feed on you, it's over
If I die, you die, too.

Because I'm saving myself for you.
I've been saving myself for you.
I waited my whole life for you.
beause I was saving myself for you.
I just wanted one dance with you.
one night under the smoke alarm.

Every single door in this house is on fire

So melodramatic but it turns me on
I close my eyes it feels just like a movie,
I'm convinced that we don't make sense.
But, I'd kill anyone who gets close.

I've been saving myself for you.
I've been saving myself for you.
The sharpest thing I find for you.
beause I was saving myself for you.
I've been saving myself for you.
I saved myself for you.
Don't you know I'd die for you.
I saved myself for you. 
without you whats the point---Lyrics submitted by ANA.
