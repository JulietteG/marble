Vic:
Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up Keep it up lets raise our hands
I take a look up in the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy,
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide.
Everything red.

Kellin:
Please, won't you push me for the last time,
Lets scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore.
The thought of you is no fucking fun.
You want a martyr, I'll be one because enough's enough,
We're done.

Vic:
You told me think about it
Well I did, now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want,
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor.

The thing I think I love
Will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up
Pubescent drama queen
You make me sick I make it worse by drinking late.

Kellin:
(Scream) Until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want too anymore
The thought of you is no fucking fun
You want a martyr I'll be one
Because enough's enough we're done

Vic:
You told me, think about it well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor.

Kellin:
Imagine living like a king someday.
A single night without a ghost in the walls.
And if the bass shakes the earth underground.
We'll start a new revolution NOW
(Alright here we go)

Vic:
Hail Marry, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me, Now this is war!

Fuck with this new beat
Oh

Kellin & Vic:
Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift so,
Close your eyed and rest in peace

Vic:
You told me, think about it well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor.

Kellin:
Imagine living like a king someday.
A single night without a ghost in the walls.
We are the shadows screaming take us now

Vic:
We'd rather die than live to rust on the ground.
