call the police this whole place is gonna burn 
come on holly put the gun down for me 
call the police this whole place is gonna burn 
you love the money and the sex in your veins
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
they're trying to take it from us
they're trying to take it from us
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
you're so pretty when you dress for the grave

yaah oooh
love me as you lay
dizzy and falling
your legs dangling
although accidents happen
they happen to me
try to fogive the bigging and the end
forget the world
without removeing the glass from your lips

call the police this whole place is gonna burn
you love the money and the sex in your veins
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
they're trying to take it from us
they're trying to take it from us
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
the sun's comin up
and were still awake

am i the trigger of your gun
your pretty eyes dont give me much choice
but ill take them (ooh ooh)
i've done some thinkin of ym own
and when i come home
i want to be done
don't want to be famous no more
leave that girl alone
my teenage heart-attack keeps talking back
keeps talking back to her
and i can't pretend that off this balcony 
we wouldn't want to jump off it 
and put an end to this

call the police this whole place is gonna burn
you love the money and the sex in your veins
call the police this whole place is gonna burn (yeahh)

doll up and sleep walk 
untill we have some teeth marks
narcotic sweet talk
till we have some teeth marks
this whole place is gonna burn---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
