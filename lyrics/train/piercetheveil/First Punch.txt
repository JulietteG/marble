This world is about to change
 1, 2 ...
 1, 2, 3, 4

Look into my eyes
 And look at the words you say
 Blood on your tongue with a crass embrace.
 A photo kiss on the day we met said
 "This will be a night we won't forget"

Speak slow now, I don't wanna miss when you cry
 I saw her diamond blue eyes

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
 So move a little bit closer
 Hear the sound of your voice
 We're screaming, "Why can't we just be friends?"
 It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
 To see you throw the first punch now

Such a shame you had to go and run your mouth
 Your mouth is what you make it, but at least I've got real friends
 Can you hear me now?
 Now that I'm a big star
 Fuck you and your new love for yourself
 It don't mean shit.

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
 So move a little bit closer
 Hear the sound of your voice
 We're screaming, "Why can't we just be friends?"
 It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
 To see you throw the first punch now

I've got so much to give, but
 I would kill just to feel less invisible
 And you've got so much to learn about gravity
 So live it up baby, don't look down
 Live it up baby, don't look down

And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
 So move a little bit closer
 Hear the sound of your voice
 We're screaming, "Why can't we just be friends?"
 It's not that easy, but it's half of the fun
 I saw it coming when you threw the first punch
 You threw the first punch
 Now it's your turn to run

This is the breath that will take my life
 There's no future but matches and propane.
 And through the mutated words I write.
 Kill it fast and never watch it die.---Lyrics submitted by Gabby~.
