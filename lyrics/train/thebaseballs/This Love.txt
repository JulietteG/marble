I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered good-bye as she got on a plane
Never to return again but always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right
(It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your lips, I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
And she said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
