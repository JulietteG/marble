Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York city
I'm a thousand miles away but girl tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do, Time Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear its true
Hey there Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it's my disguise, I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me, oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me, oh it's what you do to me, what you do to me

Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard
But just believe me girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good
Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all, even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me, oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me, oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah I can promise you that by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same and you're to blame

Hey there Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do, you know it's all because of you
We can do what ever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one's for you

Oh it's what you do to me, oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me, oh it's what you do to me, what you do to me---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
