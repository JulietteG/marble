It's the strangest thing
To have you back in my face
With all those years passed
I guess I just got used to my space

I don't know how to feel
This whole thing seems so surreal
So you keep one foot out the door
I know I said 'leave' but, baby, don't go

We got so much history
I hurt you, you hurt me
No, we don't need therapy
What I need is you here

And even though I know I'm right
Just like some lapse in my memory
You're back to me, hand on the door
I want you, baby, don't go

I'm so glad you give back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you give back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you give back my keys
My keys

You got so many issues but I guess I can top me, too
I'm just fine by myself
But I don't know who's gonna help you
I'm not no secretary, I'm nobody's Major D

But like a lapse in my memory
I want you, baby, don't go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't leave, yeah
Stay the night, baby
Don't go, baby, oh, hey, baby, don't, baby, don't go

I'm so glad you give back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you give back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you give back my keys
My keys

I'm so glad you give back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you give back my keys
Oh, I'm so glad you give back my keys
My keys---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
