Oh no no no

If love was a bird then we wouldn't have wings

If love was the sky we'd be blue

If love was a choir you and I could never sing

'Cos love isn't for me and you

If love was an Oscar you and I could never win

'Cos we could never act out our parts

If love is the Bible then we are lost in sin

'Cos it's not in our hearts

So why don't you go your way

And I'll go mine

Live your life

And I'll live mine

Baby you'll do well

And I'll be fine

'Cos we're better off

Separated

If love was a fire then we have lost the spark

Love never felt so cold

If love was a light then we're lost in the dark

Left with no-one to hold

If love was a sport we're not on the same team

And you and I are destined to lose

If love was an ocean then we are just a stream

'Cos love isn't for me and you

Why don't you go your way

And I'll go mine

Live your life

And I'll live mine

Baby you'll do well

And I'll be fine

'Cos we're better off

Separated

Girl I know we had some good times

It's sad but now we gotta say goodbye

Girl you know I love you I can't deny

Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I

I know it hurts so much but it's best for us

Somewhere along this winding road we lost the trust

So I'll walk away so you don't have to see me cry

It's killing me so, why don't you go

So why don't you go your way

And I'll go mine (yeah)

Live your life (ooh)

And I'll live mine (I'll live mine)

Baby you'll do well

And I'll be fine

'Cos we're better off

So much better off

Go your way (go your way)

And I'll go mine (I'll go mine)

Live your life (live your life)

And I'll live mine (yeah yeah

Baby you'll do well (oh-oh)

And I'll be fine

'Cos we're better off

So much better off

So much better off...

Separated

I'm sorry we didn't make it..---Lyrics submitted by rena.
