(Jay-Z)
Yo Usher this what it come to man
This how we gonna do it
I mean Even grass grow baby
Seeds become plants boys become men
What we gonna do
Lets lead the way

Wrapped around all girls like pashmeanas 
Was my demeanor, the grass is always greener on the other side
We think about can give a ringer
I couldnt give a Fu how could I give a finger
Let alone half bath and closets 
So claustrophobic and fearin close objects
Now its sorta like two car garages its like two braudes monaushin

(Usher) 
Is there any chance, that you remember me being more than just a horrible man
And would you consider pullin this trigger and taking a second shot romance
Oh babe, from the days when you were my girl and I was your man
Tell I took you for grandid, but it wasnt til now I see how much I missed you
Girl, Im sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool, but for once here goes the truth

(Hook)
I can't be fake I can't be fony
Actin all hard thats for niggas that lonely
I tried to flex, I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me you took the best thing
The best thing I ever seen you took the best thing
The best thing I ever ha-had
And now all I feel is strain cause when you left you took the very best

(Usher)
Remember 
Remember 
I aint gotta no more
Hey its from the only in Ginny
But the same outcome is chillin
Girl I let em all go 
Ooooonobodys suckin and kissin
This miscellaneous chicks actin like a jerk
Women Ive been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this which ya, how much I miss you
Im so sorry that I ran the streets actin like a damn fool but for once here goes the truth

HOOK
I can be fake I can be fony
Actin all hard thats for niggas that lonely 
I tried to flex, I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me you took the best thing
The best thing I ever seen you took the best thing
The best thing I ever ha-had
And now all I feel is strain cause when you left you took the very best

(Jay-z)

Momma tried to tell me hold da hold me slow it down
You gonna loose your best thing if you keep getting round
Like pop you need a partner when you old to hold you down
Ma forever young was forever num
Sorry Stacy sorry Tonya, Milian and all of thum
All of them was for the time
It wasnt you it was him
School me once school me twice, three times I was dumb
Now its so plain to see to me I got the one
You da best Mama
