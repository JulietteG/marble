Yeah man!

So we back in the club got those bodies rockin from side to side (si-side to side)
Thank god the week is done I feel like a zombi gone back to life (ba-back to life)
Hands up, suddenly we all got our hands up No control of my body
Ain't i seen you before i think i remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again
And baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again
So dance dance like it's the last last nite of our life life imma get you rite
Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again

Keep downin drinks like this, not tomorow not just rite now, now, now, now, n-now, now
Gonna set the roof on fire, gonna burn this motha**** down, down, down, down, d-down, down
Hands up, when the music drop we both put our hands up, put your hands on my body
Sware Ive seen you before I think i remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again
And baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again
So dance dance like its the last last nite of our life life imma get you rite
Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again

In the cover of the music get naked baby
I'm sorry chica Beta holla at Tyronne
Let him know how i jump through you're foot loop
Scolla chica two can
We're from bloca bloca o polaca
Where the boys loose like waka flaka
Oh no man its global watsup Colale Flacka
I wana be your giant no not your dada

Yo soy el cubanito que esta acostaito

Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again
And baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again
So dance dance like its the last last nite of our life life imma get u rite
Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again

So dance dance like its the last last nite of our life life gone get you rite
Cus baby tonite dj got us fallin in love again---Lyrics submitted by james.
