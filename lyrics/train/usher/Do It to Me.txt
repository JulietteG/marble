Ooh no no, no no no no.

I got two-dozen roses, and a card that says baby I cant wait to see you later
We made dinner reservations at Nobu or Mr. Chow you just pick the location
Now were sitting at the table sippin the finest wine having a damn good time
I know whats on your mind I want you, you want me too stop frontin I know exactly what you wanna do

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me I guarantee you wont regret it let me set it out like you aint never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me Im gonna give it to you, Im gonna make this a night to remember

Watchin you work the stick in the ride , the motion how you move from 3rd to 5
Can't imagine what its gon be once we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you want me the same way, ooh I cant wait
Im tired of thinkin about it, speakin about it, baby its time to be about it, turn off the lights, take off your
clothes, jump in the bed, and let it flow
Squeeze and holdin bitin scratchin spankin screamin pullin my hair when you need me everything goesbaby when you.

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me I guarantee you wont regret it let me set it out like you aint never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me Im gonna give it to you, Im gonna make this a night to remember

So long I waited for this night to get inside you look in your eyes and tell you baby take me Im yours
And if you feel anything like I feel, by the end of the night Im certain youll be screamin for more
I wanna do anything and everything to your body till you break down cant take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs you gon get it baby please pleaseooh DO IT TO ME.

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me I guarantee you wont regret it let me set it out like you aint never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me Im gonna give it to you, Im gonna make this a night to remember---
