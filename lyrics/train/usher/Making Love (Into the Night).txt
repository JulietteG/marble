Intro:
Just tell me were to go,
and i'll take off my clothes for you,
(you know we had to do it again right?)
you're in total control,
and you're running the show,
i'll do whatever you yell me baby.

Chorus:
Baby i can come by,
and pick you up,
we'll make love into the night,
its never enough,
oh baby i know what you like,
and i would make love to you,
forever and ever,
into the night ,
forever and ever,
we'll make love into the night.

Verse 1:
Your wish is my command,
so i'll cancel my plans,
I'll make you understand,
that i'm the only one,
who can handle your body right,
and ima show you tonight,
Oh baby i'm coming.

Chorus:
Baby i can come by,
and pick you up,
we'll make love in to the night,
its never enough,
oh baby i know what you like,
and i would make love to you,
forever and ever,
into the night ,
forever and ever,
we'll make love into the night.

Verse 2:
So if you ever wanna know,(if you ever wanna know),

and girl ask who i love,
cause thats you,(thats you),

Chorus:
Baby i can come by,
and pick you up,

its never enough,
oh baby i know what you like,
and i would make love to you,
forever and ever,
into the night ,
forever and ever,
we'll make love into the night.

Verse 3:
You wanna tell everybody,
about how i got you,
all coming when i call,
you know i break you off,
and if these walls could talk,
they would tell everybody,
about how i put it down,
you know i shut you down,
got you up off the ground,
yes i can be wasted,
and if i let you on my spaceship,
you'll have to let me taste it,
hop on it,
i'll i'ma give you a ride,
cause we're gonna make love through the night.---Lyrics submitted by Aeriel.
