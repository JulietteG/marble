Yeah umm
See its situations like this
That causes us players to get caught up
In umm the truth
Yeah
What you doing, where you been?
I paged you and you aint hit me back
I been callin and I know you see my number on that caller I.D.
Just listen to the words

I got reason to believe that youve been foolin around
The way you feel, the past you lived
The things you did
It dont matter to me
For what its worth just dont lie to me
Cause that aint what I need right now
Baby, everything we built on trust
Youre tearing it down
Cause I know the truth hurts {truth hurts}

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doing and who
Ya been doing it with {truth hurts}
Where you been going and
How you been putting ya thing down {truth hurts}
Whatever youz was working I
Hope that it was worth it baby {truth hurts}
I got reason to believe that you been foolin around

Girl, Im really tryin hard to understand
I want to move on and put it in the past
Cause, you claim that you aint doin nothing
Must be my insecurities
Its got the best of me right now
What I know I cant hold it inside of me
Its gonna drive me insane

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doing and who
Ya been doing it with {truth hurts}
Where you been going and
How you been putting ya thing down {truth hurts}
Whatever youz was working I
Hope that it was worth it baby {truth hurts}
I got reason to believe that you been foolin around

Now wait a minute
Oh, listen babe {truth hurts}
The truth is Ive got the secret
Ive been keeping from you baby
Cause I know that you
Will tear up the place
Punch me in my face
Pull the hot grits out
I think you need to sit down oh
I been blaming you
When I the one doing wrong
Im gonna go on
My guilty conscience
Is the real reason I wrote this song

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doing and who
Ya been doing it with {truth hurts}
Where you been going and
How you been putting ya thing down {truth hurts}
Whatever youz was working I
Hope that it was worth it baby {truth hurts}
I got reason to believe that you been foolin around
