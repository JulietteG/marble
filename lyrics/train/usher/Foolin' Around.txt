I know i vowed to never do this again but
I guess this seems to be the only thing im good at

Got something that u need to know
Be the realest ishh that I never wrote
Cant hold it gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note

Yea yea
Listen babe

Let me start by saying that
The way i feel for u is never once changed
And the games ive played, mistakes i made
Leave me sorrier than youll ever u never know
We got a problem babe i cant lie
Cuz lately i realize that i
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that there was wrong but we (let it be)
And i know u never knew when u say i do
That u would have to face all the (pain u feel)

And its killin me girl that u have to live with these
Live with the lies i tell
Live with the pain u feel
Knowing the man u love is fooling around
Oh baby said its killin me girl
Said i just dont understand
Why u wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would u love a fool with all the things i do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with this

Trade memories from moments
Treat love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me
Blame it on
celebrity
When the nights time feel like the right time
And the spotlight feel like the right light
But its really just my fears
& still dont dry your tears when i
Say she aint you when i really love u more
When u say if its true
Why u do it for and i
I really dont
have no excuse
I break ur heart make u cry
I just wanna say goodbye

Its killin me girl that u have to live with these
Live with the lies i tell
Live with the pain u feel
Knowing the man u love is fooling around
Oh baby said its killin me girl
Said i just dont understand
Why u wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would u love a fool with all the things i do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with him

What i feel i dont even got it write it
Its like poisons in my body & there's no way deny them
Now that my heart is a time bomb
One seconds left to explode
But i gotta let u kno before it blows
Still it aint on u
Its my fault
All the gossip n talk behind your back when u walk
By the time you'll know
Before long u'll see that u deserve more
U deserve more
U deserve so much more
than what ill ever be

And its killin me girl that u have to live with these
Live with the lies i tell
Live with the pain u feel
Knowing the man u love is fooling around
Oh baby said its killin me girl
Said i just dont understand
Why u wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would u love a fool with all the things i do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with him---Lyrics submitted by rachel.
