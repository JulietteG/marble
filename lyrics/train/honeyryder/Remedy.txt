I'm watching you
She's watching me
I'm not a fool
I see the chemistry
I sit alone got no energy
without your love I don't know how to be

If its right I won't stand in the way 
I won't play these games
If it's her over me can't you see
It's a crying shame

If its got to be
Her instead of me
I'll pack my bags and promises
And I'll leave quietly
I won't slam the door
I'm not fighting anymore
You know that I'll be fine
The teams will come in time
But there'll be hers instead of mine
I gotta find my remedy, I've gotta find my remedy, if its her instead of me

As morning breaks, he's lying there
How my heart aches but he's unaware

If it's right I won't stand in the way, I won't play these games
If it's her over me can't she see - you won't ever change

Chorus

Do I let this ruin me? Do I let this break me down?
How much worse am I gonna feel - than the way I'm feeling now?---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
