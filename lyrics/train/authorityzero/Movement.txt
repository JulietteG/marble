There's a movement
What ya been through?
Just watch what you'll become
See times are changin'
Sittin' waitin'
For it to knock down your front door
While ya sit ther aniticipating
It was right there all along

Woah!

Bright sunny days lying ahead
Peekin' throug the cracks
Something more being said
There's a movement
An underground affair
Underneath the surface
A network awe
Making a big soundThrough the system's blaring
Speaking to the youth
And now we're shouting through the air 
Yeah everybody's moving
All are gathered round
Make way for sudden movements
As they shake you up and down
Stomping to the beat yeah
Rally round the street yeah
Screaming through the feedback
On and on and on

And we're moving 
Moving through the air
We're moving
An Underground Affair

Rally Rally Rally round the unpopular one
Breath in deep as it peirces your lungs
Unified relations
Shouting straight from the heart
Searchin' for release
Yeah right from the start
Rejuvenation
Yeah this is were we meet
Where we lose all our minds
And we stomp our restless feet
Yeah this is how we do this
This is where we run
This is where we go 
Where we become one

They wanna bitch and moan to break your spirit
What  you goin through???
Set up on the side your daily problems
So what you think' you're going to do???
Take it upon yourself 
This time just tak it up any time
Shoutin through the static
GONNA MAKE A BIG NOISE!!!---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
