School is in another year
And I just want to disappear again, again
I hate the world, I just can't win
And sometimes I just wish it would all end
All end

1, 2, 3, 4

I walk around with headphones in
A hoodie on, I'm trying to blend in
With all the other useless kids
That's how I've always been

And I know one day I'll be the king of the music scene
Like O.M.G

So what do you do when everyone fails you
Am I just a stupid with boy with nothing left to lose
I'm so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hope to believe, my hopes and dreams will get me out

Well I'm a stereotype of a fucked up kid
And there's nothing really nice about the way I live
I got no money in my pocket but I'm handsome and cocky
Start a band with my posse, beat the scene up like Rocky
I'm a late winner, take your sister to dinner
And I may kiss her but I won't even miss her
I'm a bad boy, big dreams, headed to the top
And I'ma sing my little heart out till the music stops

Just get me out
When everyone fails you
Just get me out
With nothing left to lose
Just get me out
I'm so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
Just get me out
So ..., my hopes and dreams will get me out
Just get me out---
