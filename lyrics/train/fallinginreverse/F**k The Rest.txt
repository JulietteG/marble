Charlie, what are you barking at? Charlie, I'm trying to sing a song, you gotta go. Charlie, go. Ahem.

My mind is like a puzzle or a Rubik's Cube
But figuring me out is something that you shouldn't do.
Because my thoughts are locked inside a padded room
And if these padded walls could talk I'd surely be doomed.
Let's go.

Well, trouble's what they told me since the day I was born.
Evil's what they stamped upon my hospital forms.
I tried to choke my mom with my umbilical cord.
The doctor was too busy amputating my horns.
So the devil and the Lord both keep waging a war,
Pulling me in opposite directionsI'm torn.
A change of course, a deadly force, a terrible storm,
Kicking down the devil's door to settle the score.

It's over, I'm older, I'm alive, I'm sober.
Believe me, I'm living, I'm happy, I'm winning.

Faster, faster, I am on my way.
Straight up.
This disaster I can truly say, saved us.
And I know in my heart if you reach for the stars
All the things that you dream will indeed take you far.
So just hope for the best,
And just say, "Fuck the rest."

Well, I Should I've been aborted when they had the chance.
'Cause now I'm spilling venom in the ears of the class.
And all the high school kids are sick of being told to relax (fuck off).
The crazier the kid, the tighter his pants.
Yeah, I'll start a revolution bringing Gothic back,
Got them marching like an army wearing black-on-black.
Out of a thousand of these motherfucking copy cats,
None of them can do it quite like I can.

It's over, I'm older, I'm alive, I'm sober.
Believe me, I'm living, I'm happy, I'm winning.

Faster, faster, I am on my way.
Straight up.
This disaster I can truly say, saved us.
And I know in my heart if you reach for the stars
All the things that you dream will indeed take you far.
So just hope for the best,
And just say, "Fuck the rest."

I'm so tired of being sick, I'm so sick of being tired.
This is for everyone out there who feels like they've had enough.
This song is for you, and your mother too.

"You'll never win," they said,
"So stop while you're ahead."
And music is my love and passion's in my blood.
So say what you will, 'cause I just don't give a fuck.
So get the fuck up, go.

Faster, faster, I am on my way.
Straight up.
This disaster I can truly say, saved us.
And I know in my heart if you reach for the stars
All the things that you dream will indeed take you far.
So let's hope for the best,
And just say, "Fuck the rest.".
And just say, "Fuck the rest."
And just say, "Fuck the rest."

Charlie! Charlie, what are you barking for?

Charlie bit my finger.
Ow, Charlie.---Lyrics submitted by Shane Siton.
