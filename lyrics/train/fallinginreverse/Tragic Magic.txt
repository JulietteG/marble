I'm back *hahahahaha*

So let's rewind, back to the time, 2005, I almost died
I overdosed, I did not know, did I provoke this evil ghost?
Disaster

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
over catchy beats,
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene

*la la la la la*

I dug a hole
10 miles wide
So I could throw all of you inside.
You're such a dumbfuck
You need to shut up
You bring a picture of me every time you get a haircut
Imposter!

Lalalala...

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
over catchy beats,
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene

*la la la la la*

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
over catchy beats,
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene---Lyrics submitted by Kyle.
