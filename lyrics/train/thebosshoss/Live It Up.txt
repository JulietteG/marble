I can't get enough, and I'm dreaming of
Spreading my wings and fly into the sky.
Into a new direction, in a pair of new shoes,
I'll run like a fast-train to find my satisfaction.

I want a new 'nothing' - and I'm happy to say!
I wanna build up my castle and follow my way.
Don't want no more lies, to keep me upbeat,
I don't wanna run, 'cause after rain will be sun...
Alright!

I said, hey ho come on run,
Take the cake, before it's gone
Now hey ho, live it up for today!

Hey hey hey-ho, now don't you run,
No need to be no. 1,
Relax, hear what I say,
You'll find your way, hey-ho anyway,
Now live it up for today-ho,
Live it up! Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!

My frame of mind, it's golden cage
Looking so good, hey, but I need more space.
I wanna break out, fly away,
Free my animal and let it play.

Hey, I'm OK - with my peace of mind,
My animal found it's 'one of a kind',
I'm free in my world, like a fish in the sea,
If it stays like this, then it's fine with me...
Alright!

I said, hey ho come on run,
Take the cake, before it's gone
Now hey ho, live it up for today!

Hey hey hey-ho, now don't you run,
No need to be no. 1,
Relax, hear what I say,
You'll find your way, hey-ho anyway

I said, hey ho come on run,
Take the cake, before it's gone
Now hey ho, live it up for today!

Hey hey hey-ho, now don't you run,
No need to be no. 1,
Relax, hear what I say,
You'll find your way, hey-ho anyway
Now live it up for today-ho,
Live it up! Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!
Hey ho - live it up!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
