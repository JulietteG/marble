Big ideas

For the first time in my life I have seen
The relevance of love
When you don't have much
When it's what you need

And I have big ideas
For you and me

I feel lucky
With the worst luck
Then I met you when i felt messed up
I feel lucky
With the worst luck
Then I met you when i felt messed up
I feel lucky
With the worst luck
Then I met you when i felt messed up

Big ideas
You're the shadow stealing light against the wall
You're the dream I had just before I woke up
Am I running through that mind of yours
At all

And I have big ideas
For you and me

Wish I'd met you now before we're broken in---
