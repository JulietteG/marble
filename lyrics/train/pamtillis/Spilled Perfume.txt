i aint even gonna ask 
you i can read you like a book
 girl if i ever saw one thats an
 i cant believe i did that look 

you look like something that the cat drug in
so i wont kick you while your down 
just let me tell you friend to friend
about the block ive been around

chorus:
did you really think last night would last forever
 did you really think that guy hung the moon
right now you hate yourself cause 
you knew better but theres no use cryin over spilled perfume

theres a big difference between
 lonely and lonely for way too long 
and i knew when he made his move 
you werent feeling all that too strong

so i bit my tongue cause i saw it coming 
as you danced so close to him
its 2 steps forward and 3 steps back 
when a heart is on the line

chorus:
did you really think last night would last forever?
 did you really think that guy hung the moon 
right now you hate yourself cause you knew better
 but theres no use crying over spilled perfume

you fell in a moment of weakness 
when you just gotta pull yourself back up 
cry your morning after tears
cause whats done is done 

chorus:
did you really think last night would last forever?
 did you really think that guy hung the moon 
right now you hate yourself casue 
you knew better but theres no use crying over spilled perfume

no use crying over spilled 

no use crying over spilled 

no use crying over spilled perfume---Lyrics submitted by amber.
