She likes the taste of captain morgan
Cigarettes oh she adores them
She can get a little crazy sometimes
Tight shirts and mini skirts
Her family's rich so she'll never work
And she's always on my mind

I can see the love when i look into her eyes
If everyone could see what i see inside

Well she lives at night and sleeps all day
She'll dance and drink her life away
But she doesn't know who i am
She gets what she wants and doesn't quit
She might as well get paid for it
But she doesn't know who i am
And she doesn't give a damn

She doesn't kiss under rain clouds
Only boys in the same crowd
Kissing my luck now
Is it because of my long hair?
Tattoos and the fact that I don't care what she thinks of me?
and that drives her crazy

I can see the love when i look into her eyes
If everyone could see what i see inside

Well she lives at night and sleeps all day
She'll dance and drink her life away
But she doesn't know who i am
She gets what she wants and doesn't quit
She might as well get paid for it
But she doesn't know who i am
And she doesn't give a damn

Someday she'll know that she loves me
That she loves me
Someday she'll know that she loves me
That she loves me
When she's alone i can't write about her
When she's alone i can't

But she lives at night and sleeps all day
She'll dance and drink her life away
But she doesn't know who i am
She gets what she wants and doesn't quit
She might as well get paid for it
But she doesn't know who i am
And she doesn't give a damn

And someday she'll know who I am
then maybe she'll give a damn---Lyrics submitted by Lexi.
