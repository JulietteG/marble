Come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see
Come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see
Theres a meaning there, but the meaning there doesnt really mean a thing
Come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see
I am the real thing!

Oo mama mow-mow
Oo mama mow-mow
Oo mama mow-mow
Oo mama mow-mow

Oo mama mama mama mama mama mama mow
Tryin hard to understand the meaning that youll see in me
Tryin hard to understand the meaning that youll see in me
Theres a meaning there, but the meaning there doesnt really mean a thing
Come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see
I am the real thing!

Oo mama mow-mow
Oo mama mow-mow
Oo mama mow-mow
Oo mama mow-mow

I am not seeing you
I am not seeing you
Ahhhhh!

I am the real thing!
(ad-lib fade-out)---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Hetherington.
