Oh, oh, oh 
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You are missing that kissing when we're over
Boy what I'm feeling never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over
And you my lover but I love you like a brother

Baby don't want at the end of the day
You are who you are and I love it that way
Lasting love, if you know the difference 
You had a little game on ya
Caught up in your feelings we together like, ohhh

You know that I'mma do whatever I'm not gon' leave, oh yeah
This kind of love dont come easy, oh yeah
We don't care what they think, yeah
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me

Chourse:
See I know you like being round chicks
And looking at hips, and a little outfit, hey
What can I say (what can I say)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)
Yeah, I don't mess cause I know you gon' lie
You way too sexy, never be shy, hey
What can I say (what can I say)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)

Don't hey! Do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
 do ya, do ya, do ya thang 4x

You the shit, ye
ah, ah baby you the bomb
Middle of the day give me what I want
It feels so special
It feels so good
And he ain't going no where
Even if he could

I got that ow, ow
You know what I'm talking about, bout
Make a ni--a scream and shout, shout
Everytime the lights go out, out
We out out
ohh..

You know that I'mma do whatever I'm not gon leave, oh yeah
This kind of love don't come easy, oh yeah
We don't care what they think, yeah
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me

Chourse:
See I know you like being round chicks
And looking at hips, and a little outfit, hey
What can I say (what can I say)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)
Yeah, I don't mess cause I know you gon' lie
You way too sexy, never be shy, hey

Don't hey! Do ya thang,
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
 do ya, do ya, do ya thang 4x

Ohh, 
And I know what you thinking of 
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl 
And he's the one for me

See this sh-t 
ain't worth trippin' over
Do ya thang, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever
Love is all we need

Do ya thang, do ya thang,
 do ya, do ya, do ya thang 4x

See I know you like being round chicks
And looking at hips, and a little outfit, hey
What can I say (what can I say)
That's what I love about you babe (That's what I love about you babe)---Lyrics submitted by Kate Bjornson.
