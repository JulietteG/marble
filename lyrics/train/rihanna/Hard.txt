They can say whatever
Ima do whatever
No pain is forever Yup!
You know this
Tougher than a lion
Aint no need in tryin
I live where the sky ends Yup!
You know this

Never lying
Truth teller
That Rihanna reign just wont let up
All black on
Black top shades
Black top maybach
Ima rock this sh*t
Like fashion
As in goin to this Gang stop
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bit** in heels right here
No fear
And while youre gettin your cry on
Im gettin my fly on
Sincere
I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard

So hard, So hard, So hard, So hard
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (That Rihanna range just wont let up)

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (That Rihanna range just wont let up)
So hard, So hard, So hard, So hard

All up on it
Know u wanna clone it
Aint like me (that chick to flaunt it)
Ride this beat beat beat (like a pony)
Meet me at the top (top) top
(Getting loaded)
Who think they test me now?
Run through your town I shut it down
Brilliant resilient fanmail from 27 million

And I want it all
Gonna take more than that
Hope that I know you got

I need it all
The money the fame the cars the clothes
I cant just let you run up on me like that (all up on me like that) yeah

I see you aiming on my pedestal
So I think I gotta let u know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
