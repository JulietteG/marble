Eenie, meenie, minie, mo 
Catch a playa by the toe. 
If ya want to let him go 

[Rihanna] 
Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty more 
They be falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Oh its raining men girl what you worry 'bout 

Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya."? 
You got me mistaken thinkin' you gon get it easy 
First of all you need to know that I'm not the one 
Think you getting something baby, you aint getting none 
All you need to know that I'm a 2 times 5 
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye bye 
Set your standards lower, boy you're aiming too high 
Matter of fact your friend looks better so (huh) good bye 

Eenie, meenie, minie, mo 
Catch a playa by a toe 
If ya want to let him go 

Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty more 
They be falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Oh it's raining men girl what you worry 'bout

[Nicki Minaj] 
Excuse me but who are you fixin' to be 
Let them muthafuckas know its plenty fish in the sea 
And he sweatin' me just cause I got the tightest hole 
But I couldn't find that th-thing wit a microscope 
Give me dome, dome, d-d-d-d-d dome, dome, dome 
I ain't trippin on yo money, money long, long, long 
Want my own tv production company 
So tell Harpo to hit me Celie 
Anyway RiRi what rhymes wit yo name freely 
Money got you vacationing in Chile 

do you want to sit on the back while i wheelie really? really!? 
No for real, really? 
Laid out on the beach they be feedin me my catfishes 
Cause it's raining men 
Fat bitches 

[Rihanna] 
They be falling like the rain so we aint running out

I said ay, outta my way, with my lady 
Ridin' big, living good, doing big things 
Dancing dont pay, player keep the money, I can buy my own brain 
Up in the club, see me coming, dime a dozen so it don't mean nothing to me 
And I aint even worry bout you cause there's plenty more fish in the sea 

Eenie, meenie, minie, mo 
Catch a playa by the toe 
If ya want to let him go 

[Rihanna] 
Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty more 
They be falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Falling like the rain so we aint running out 
Oh it's raining men girl what you worry 'bout
