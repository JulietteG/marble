[Another version begins with:
"What am I supposed to do with this heart
How do I take it off if I love it on it's like a work of art"]

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap)

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap)

What am I supposed to do with this heart? [3x]

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise
