Heres a little story i gotta tell
About this boy I know so well
back in the day it was cool and all
fell in love i fell in love
I thought he was the one for me
other boys i could not see
and look what happened to him
a love that couldn't be
It should have been me and you
it could have been you and me
before you broke my heart and I'm 
standing  here
It should have been me and you
it could have been you and me
now all i got are these photographs

Chorus:
All I've got 
All I've got
All I've got
are these photographs
All I've got 
All I've got
Is nothing without you
you
you
is nothing without you
you
you
I'm nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
the fact that you went around
baby I'm falling down
I may need a remedy
been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
baby I'm hurting now
I know your a better man
when i was your girl
This land is a better land
When your in my world
today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
so happy and lovely

Chorus:
All I've got 
All I've got
All I've got
are these photographs
All I've got 
All I've got
Is nothing without you
you
you
is nothing without you
you
you
I'm nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I use to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
but your all that I have, that I have...
I don't wanna loose what we built this far
Its just me an you your my superstar
I'll give anything baby heres my heart...my heart...my heart

Will_i_am:
My heart don't stop
my heart be beating over
my love'n never stop
even though that it's over
girl I been reminiscing 
when I play that Casanova
way back when we was kissing
on yo grandmama's sofa
girl i got this lovey dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rockin calvin...klein 
you had yo guess jeans on
lookin sexy all alone why couldn't I be the one...

Bridge:
Why? Why? Why?
I am not the one
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldnt you be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldnt you be the one?

Chorus:
All I've got 
All I've got
All I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got 
All I've got
Is nothing without you
you
you
is nothing without you
you
you
I'm nothing without you---Lyrics submitted by Jadeina.
