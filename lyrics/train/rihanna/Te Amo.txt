Te Amo,Te Amo
she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice..
and we danced underneath the candelabra
she takes the lead
that's when I saw it in her eyes it's over
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, 
She cries Te amo
I told her Im not gonna run away
but let me go
My soul is crying, 
without asking why
I said te amo, 
would somebody tell me what she said?
Dont it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Dont it mean I love you

Te amo, Te amo,
shes scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice uhh
Pull me out on the beach, danced in the water,
I start to leave
Shes begging me and asking why its over
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no,
She cries Te amo
I told her Im not gonna run away,
but let me go
My soul is crying,
without asking why
I said te amo,
would somebody tell me what she said?
Dont it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
dont it mean I love you

Listen we can dance, 
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night, Im movin' to the night because I understand
that we all need love
and Im not afraid
to feel the love but I dont feel that way
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cries te amo
I told her Im not gonna run away but let me go
My soul is crying,
without asking why
I said te amo,
would somebody tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
dont it mean I love you
Think it means I love you, 
I love you
Te Amo
Te Amo
Don't It means I Love you...---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
