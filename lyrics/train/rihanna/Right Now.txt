Tomorrow way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We got right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is Right Now

 Tomorrow way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We got right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is Right Now

 [pause]

 Baby tonight I need you
 And I feel it when I see you
 Wherever you wanna go
 Whenever baby i'm yours

 Tomorrow way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We got right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is Right Now

 Tomorrow way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We got right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is Right Now

 [pause]

 Cause all we got is Right Now....

 So close I can taste you
 Ain't scared I can take you
 Can't fight the feeling
 Got me feel feeling
 You got me feeling

 Something you wanted to do all your life
 There's no more waiting tonight is the night
 And it can't be wrong not if it feels this right
 Turn it up, scream it loud, yeah

 Tomorrow way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We got right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is right now

 Tomorrow way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We got right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is right now

 Cause all we got is right now---Lyrics submitted by eric bou karam.
