Cheers to the fricken weekend

Dont let the bastards get ya down
Turn it around with another round
Theres a party at the bar everybody putcha glasses up and I drink to that

Cheers to the fricken weekend

Dont let the bastards get ya down
Turn it around with another round
Theres a party at the bar everybody putcha glasses up and I drink to that
I drink to thaaaaaat.
And I drink to thaaaat.
I drink to thaaaaaaat.
And I drink to that.---Lyrics submitted by Jenni.
