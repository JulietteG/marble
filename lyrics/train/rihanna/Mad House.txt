Ladies and Gentlemen
To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think ypu can take it, we say
Welcome to the Mad House

Ahh ahhhh ahh
Ahhhh ahhh ahhhh ahhh
Ooohhhh
Ahh ahhhh ahh
Ahhhh ahhh ahhhh ahhh
Ooohhhh (Mad House)
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Come on come on come on in
Come on come on in (Mad House)

Ahh ahhhh ahh
Ahhhh ahhh ahhhh ahhh
Ooohhhh
Ahh ahhhh ahh
Ahhhh ahhh ahhhh ahhh
Ooohhhh (Welcome to the Mad House)
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Come on come on come on in
Come on come on in (Mad House)---Lyrics submitted by cecil.
