You were my courage, my sword and shield
Grace under pressure, my wall of steel
I was a stone weighing us down
You were the angel I chained to the ground
I miss the way you undress, I miss your head on my chest
Cant stop this bleeding, cant stop believing

Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby Im in love with you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Im missing the sound of your heart beating

You showed me heaven, you rang up bells
I played with matches, it hurt like hell
I sleep and wake, youre all I see
I cant escape you, cant set you free
I miss your full moon rising, catching a breath in silence
Cant stop this bleeding, cant stop believing

Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby Im in love with you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating

Baby Im coming, baby Im coming
Tell me now, baby I come running
Baby Im coming, baby Im coming
Say the words, baby I come running

Baby Im in love with you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Im missing the sound of your heart beating

Im missing the sound, Im missing the sound of you baby, baby
Im missing the sound of your heart beating

Missing you missing you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you missing you
Im missing the sound of your heart beating
Beating, beating, Im missing the sound of your heart beating---
