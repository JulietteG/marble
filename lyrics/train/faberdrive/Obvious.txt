They're scared of his make-up tattoos and piercing
They say that it's too bad
He won't amount to anything
They judge by the way he looks
Whoa
The cover's not quite like the book
He's just so misunderstood
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

Cuz it's so obvious
There's nothing wrong with us at all
It's our life, we're alright
No, we're not about to go and make
The same mistakes you mighta made

It's so obvious
So just stop blaming us
Because it's not wrong to be young
No we're not about to go and make the same mistakes you mighta made
No, we're not about to go and make the same mistakes

She eighteen
So sexy
She never made love
So called friends are saying
She sleeps with everyone
They judge by the way she looks
Whoa
But the covers not quite like the book
She's been so misunderstood
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

Cuz it's so obvious there's nothing wrong with us at all
It's our life, we're alright
No, we're not about to go and make the same mistakes you mighta made

It's so obvious
So just stop blaming us
Because it's not wrong to be young
No, we're not about to go and make the same mistakes you mighta made

They judge by the way we look
Whoa
The covers not quite like the book
We're just so misunderstood
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

It's so obvious 
There's nothing wrong with us at all
It's our life, we're alright
No, we're not about to go and make the same mistakes you mighta have made

It's so obvious 
So just stop blaming us
Because it's not wrong to be young
No we're not about to go and make the same mistakes you mighta made

It's so obvious
No, we're not about to go and make the same mistakes you mighta made
It's so obvious
No, we're not about to go and make the same mistakes---Lyrics submitted by lauren.
