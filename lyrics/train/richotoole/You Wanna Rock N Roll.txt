You, you just dont understand
I wanna be your man
I whisper in your ear,
but you dont turn over little darlin

But you, you just dont take the time
You heart is in a bind, but you come runnin
You could sit right down
Let me show you around....YEAHHHHH

But you, you say you wanna Rock N Roll
Well you say you wanna give me your soul
Well you say you wanna stay up all night
Baby, lets make love

But you, well you know what you did was wrong
But you been doing it all along
So why dont we just stay up now and lets make love

...Guitar Solo...

You, you tell me everyday
That it will be O.K.
Look me in the eyes and you lie to my face a little darlin

You, well you know how I really feel
Is this love real
Wont you come right in, you could sit right down
Let me show you around

But you, you say you wanna Rock N Roll
Well you say you wanna give me your soul
Well you say you wanna stay up all night
Baby, lets make love

But you, well you know what you did was wrong
But you been doing it all along
So why dont we just stay up now and lets make love

...Guitar Solo...

(x2)
But you, you say you wanna Rock N Roll
Well you say you wanna give me your soul
Well you say you wanna stay up all night
Baby, lets make love

But you, well you know what you did was wrong
But you been doing it all along
So why dont we just stay up now and lets make love

Baby lets make love...---Lyrics submitted by Christina.
