Jumpin' out the window 
Movin' on, groovin' on 
Which way will the wind blow? 
We can't be wrong, so say 'solong' 
I'mma pick you up, I'mma pick you up 
What're you tryin' to say to me? 
Catch the train at two what you're tryin' to do 
Are you gonna play with me? 

All my life, I've been waiting 
Pass my time, procrastinating now 
It's a trip I'm a flip 
And flash right through the scene 
Can't you see what I mean? 

Breaking through the boundaries 
Rollin' on, strollin' on 
They won't ever find me 
And after all, we'll have a ball 
I'mma pick you up, I'mma pick u up 
We're gonna see where we can go 
This is how I live, this is what I give 
And you're the one I want to know 

All my life, I've been waiting 
Pass my time, procrastinating now 
It's a trip on a flip 
And flash right through the scene 
Can't you see what I mean? 

Tiny minded two-tone suckers 
Same old faces make me shudder 
Countless times I've screamed 'oh brother!' 
Where are you? I need someone to be my lover 

All my life, I've been waiting 
Pass my time, procrastinating now 
It's a trip on a flip 
And flash right through the scene 
Can't you see what I mean? 

It's a trip on a flip 
And flash right through the scene 
Can't you see what I mean?---Lyrics submitted by avraham.
