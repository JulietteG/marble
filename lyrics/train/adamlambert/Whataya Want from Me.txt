Hey 
Slow it down
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me? 
Yeah 
Im afraid 
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

There might have been a time when I would give my self away
Oh once upon a time I didnt give a damn
But now 
Here we are
So what do you want from me? 
What do you want from me?

Chorus:
Just dont give up
Im working it out
Please dont give in 
I wont let you down 
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe.
Just keep coming around.
Hey! 
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

Yeah, 
Its plain to see (Its plain to see)
Baby your beautiful 
There is nothing wrong with you (nothing wrong with you)
Its me 
Im a freak 
But thanks for loving me 
'Cause youre doing it perfectly (perfectly)

Yeah, there might have been a time when I will let you slip away
I wouldnt even try 
But I think you could save my life.

Just dont give up
Im working it out 
Please dont give in 
I wont let you down 
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe.
Just keep coming around.
Hey! 
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
What do you want from me? 
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)


Just dont give up on me 
Ohhhhhh!!
I wont let you down
No 
I wont let you down

Just dont give up
Im working it out 
Please dont give in 
I wont let you down 
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe.
Just keep coming around.
Hey! 
What do you want from me?

Just dont give up
Im walking it out 
Please dont give in 
I wont let you down 
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe.
Just keep coming around.
Hey! 
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)
What do you want from me? (What do you want from me?)---Lyrics submitted by jen.
