I saw a picture of you
Hanging in an empty hallway
I heard a voice that I knew
And I couldnt walk away
It took me back to the end
Of everything
I taste it all I taste it all
The tears again

Outside the rains fallin down
Theres not a drop that hits me 
Scream at the sky but no sound
Is leavin my lips
Its like I cant even feel
After the way you touched me
Im not sleep Im not awake
After the way you loved me

I cant turn this around
I keep running into walls that I cant break down
I said I just wonder around
 With my eyes shut because of you
Im a sleepwalker walker walker
Im a sleepwalker walker walker

Let me out of this dream

Everywhere that I go 
I see another memory
And all the places we used to know
Theyre always there to hunt me
I walk around an I feel so lost and lonely
Youre everything that I want
But you dont want me

I cant turn around
I keep running into walls that I cant break down
I said I just wonder around
 With my eyes shut because of you
Im a sleepwalker walker walker
Im a sleepwalker walker walker

Let me out of this dream, dream
Let me out of this dream

I cant turn around
I keep running into walls that I cant break down
I said I just wonder around
 With my eyes shut because of you
Im a sleepwalker walker walker
Im a sleepwalker walker walker
Im a sleepwalker walker walker
Im a sleepwalker walker walker

Let me out of this dream---Lyrics submitted by Shahrzad.
