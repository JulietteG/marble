Left, right, step up to the spotlight
Why you actin uptight?
Im takin you to school, thats right
High, low, dont tell me you dont know
how to ever let go
Im takin you to school, thats right

Tonight we burn it all
get hot get tall
yeah were lighter than air
you got the key to your release
so pop that lock until youre lighter than air.

(Chours) 
If you wanna be that
youve got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it
you have got to scream
if you got the key then baby pop that lock
Banjee Boys and Dancey Girls get down, down down
Get down, down down!

Werk bitch you dont gotta stress this
got em feeling restless show em how its done alright
Secret dont care if you dont keep it dont care if you leak it
Show em how its done alright

Tonight we burn it all
get hot get tall
yeah were lighter than air
you got the key to your release
so pop that lock until youre lighter than air

(Chours)
If you wanna be that
youve got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it
you have got to scream
if you got the key then baby pop that lock
Banjee Boys and Dancey Girls get down down down

get down get down
Werk Werk Werk alright
get down
Werk Werk Werk alright
Banjee Boys and Dancey Girls get down
You better pop that lock

(Chours)
If you wanna be that
youve got to dream.
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it
you have got to scream
if you got the key then baby pop that lock

Get down
Baby pop that lock
Get down, get down
Pop that Lock, get down!---Lyrics submitted by Sara Rodriguez.
