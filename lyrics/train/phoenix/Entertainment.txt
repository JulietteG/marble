Headline from this day on,
Why you keep pretending
That you wanna let go?
Do do you wanna let go?

Loud volume torns to
Low low low low low low

What you want and
What you do to me
I'll take the trouble
That you have in mind

Entertainment,
Show them what you do with me
When everyone here
Knows better

What I once refused to be
Is everything they
Long together.
I'd rather be alone.

(Turn away, turn away)

I love, I love, I love,
I notice
I heard it all
Before I died
Before I knew you

Once upon a time
Would take too long
Long long long long long

What you want and
What you do to me
I'll take the trouble
Let you have my mind

Entertainment
Show them what
You do with me
When everyone here
Knows better

What I once
Refused to be
Is everything they
Long together.
I'd rather be alone.---
