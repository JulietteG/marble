Diet of the heart, help him fade away
Written in the kite
I want to get through the hope, man's land to town

It's been long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long
Long, long, long, long hangover

See the talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talkin' to you

I'm down on my knees
Remindin' me please
Talk a little bit better---Lyrics submitted by Anny.
