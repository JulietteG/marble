Fences in a row (X2)
Why are they protecting in Rome?

If only the necessary Silhouette
Unknown join a dissident
Carried away
Hide them from the lies and discord
What's remembered not forgotten

Come roll the dice for me
Roll the dice for me

Hold on better I'm not,
Really on your own,
Thinking this is fun
Feathers falling from Grey
Fold them into pieces
Tied openly

Fences in a row (X2)
Why are they protecting in Rome?

You carried away
Phoenix Fences lyrics found on 
Thought I would have let you know
Oh no did you miss it?
Familiar stare
Would rather mess with me than get going
She's been building up a castle
And I
Roll the dice for me

Hold on better I'm not,
Really on your own,
Thinking this is fun
Feathers falling from Grey
Fold them into pieces
Tied openly

Fences in a row (X2)
Why are they protecting in Rome?

Fences in a row (X2)
