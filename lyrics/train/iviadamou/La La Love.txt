Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalala love

Love the way you fill me up with life
Baby we can break the speed of light
Nothing to fear when you are near
Just gimme more

Reaching for the sky, Im aiming high
Close my eyes and then its almost like you fly
Up in the air, lets take it there
Never let go

Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby its so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How Ive been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love
Oh Ive been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love

From Paris to LA over the night
All around the world just you and I
Nothing to fear, when you are near
Were on a roll

And we do it again, no stop no end
Out of control

Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby its so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How Ive been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love
Oh Ive been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love

Nothing to fear when you are near

Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby its so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How Ive been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love

Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love
Oh, Ive been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalalalala love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
