"Feel no regrets, 'cause I am death
Feel no regrets."

"I wanna know where do we go
Where do you take me now
There is no choice, my inner voice
Tells not to fear somehow

It's hard for me to let it be
I cannot understand
I'm still so young, I don't belong
To those who meet their end."

"You always thought your first man would marry you
Now, as it seems, he just comes to burry you
I am this man and I'm gonna be your last
Give me your hand, your life belongs to the past

'Cause I am death
Feel no regrets."

"It's so unfair, 'cause everywhere
I see the blossom grow
While others try to end their lifes
I want it, heaven knows."

"You always thought your first man would marry you
Now, as it seems, he just comes to burry you
I am this man and I'm gonna be your last
Give me your hand, your life belongs to the past

'Cause I am death
Feel no regrets."

Feel no regrets, my friend, I will speak to those who listen
See, I am heaven sent, you will find what you've been missing
Feel no regrets, my friend , noone ever knows the reasons
Why and when it will end. Every life is just a season
Feel no regrets, 'cause I am death---Lyrics submitted by Thomas.
