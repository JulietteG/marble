Prosterne toi!
Danse!
Rve!

Come to us 
I could be good
Come to us
Enjoy the blue
So, be with us
And feel the sound
Come to us
Up off the ground
So, be with us
I could be yours
Come to us
Followers fool
So, be with us [x4]
So, baby, your money is following
An eternal blue

Danse!
Rve!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
