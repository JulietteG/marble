What manner of love is this
That You would lay down Your life
You paid the price, the sacrifice for redemption
Now I am determined to know
Christ and Him crucified
Now alive and the power in me is You

Now blameless, You call me Holy
Ive been forgiven, You call me righteous and free
Now spotless, You call me worthy
I am Your child, You call me chosen
Im Yours, I am Yours

I will boldly come
Running straight to the One
Singing over me
Your songs of salvation
No one can take this from me
Im a child that You name free
Nothing will separate us
Im held by You
Oh I know, oh I know Im

Now blameless, You call me Holy
Ive been forgiven, You call me righteous and free
Now spotless, You call me worthy
I am Your child, You call me chosen
Im Yours, I am Yours

I am Yours, I am Yours, I am Yours
And I am Yours, I am Yours, I am Yours
I am Yours, yes I am, yes I am

Now blameless, You call me Holy
Ive been forgiven, You call me righteous and free
Now spotless, You call me worthy
I am Your child, You call me chosen
Im Yours, I am Yours---
