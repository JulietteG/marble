(Verse 1)
He was the congregation's vagrant, with an unrequited love
When your passion's exaltation, finding refuge is not enough
She was the youngest of her family
and the last to be let go,
and they decided they would try and make it on their own

(Chorus)
Oh memories, where'd you go?
You were all i've ever known
How i miss yesterday
and how i let it fade away

(Verse 2)
When July became December,
their affection fought the cold
but they couldn't quite remember what inspired them to go
and it was beautifully depressing,
like a streetcar named desire
they were fighting for their love that started growing tired

(Chorus)


The money lost momentum,
and their bills were piling high,
then the smile had finally faded from the apple of their eye
and they were young and independent,
and they thought they had it planned,
should've known right from the start you can't predict the end.

(chorus x2)---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
