Oh, well imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear,
No I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words

What a beautiful wedding!
"What a beautiful wedding"
Says a bridesmaid to a waiter
Yes, now what a shame,
What a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore

I'd chime in
With a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the god damn door?" 
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I'd chime in
With a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the god damn door?"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things 
With a sense of...

Oh, well in fact,
Well I'll look at this way,
I mean technically our marraige is saved
Well this calls for, a toast so, pour the shampagne
Oh! Well in fact,
Well I'll look at it this way,
I mean technically our marraige is saved
Well this calls for a toast so pour the shampagne,
Pour the shampagne

I'd chime in
With a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the god damn door?"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I'd chime in
With a "Haven't you people ever  heard of
Closing the god damn door?"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

Again

I'd chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the god damn door?"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I'd chime in 
With a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the god damn door?"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
