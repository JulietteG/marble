when the world gets too heavy, put it on my back
I'll be your levy
you are taking me apart like bad glue on a get well card..

but it was always you falling for me
now there's always time calling for me
I am the light blinking at the end of the road
blink back to let me know

I'm a fly that's trapped in a web
but I'm thinking that my spider's dead
oh, lonely little life
I could kid myself in thinking that I'm fine..

but it was always you falling for me
now there's always time calling for me
I am the light blinking at the end of the road
blink back to let me know

I'm skin and bone
just a cane and a rusty throne
oh, the castle's under siege
but the sign outside says "leave me alone!"

but it was always you falling for me
now there's always time calling for me
I am the light blinking at the end of the road
blink back to let me know---Lyrics submitted by Gali.
