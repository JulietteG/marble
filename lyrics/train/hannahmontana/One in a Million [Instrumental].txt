How did I get here
I turned around and there you were
Didn't think twice or rationalize
Cause somehow I knew
That there was more that just chemistry
I mean I knew you were kind of into me
But I figured it's too good to be true

I said pinch me, where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get use to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it 
Oooh Ohhhh Ooh Ohhh Ooooh
You're one in a million

All this time I was lookin' for love
Try'n to make things work that wasn't good enough
Til' I thought I'm through
Said I'm done
Then stumbled into the arms of the one

You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff
Say that I'm your diamond in the rough
When I'm mad at you, you come with your velvet touch

Can't believe that I'm so lucky
I have never felt so happy
Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it 
Oh Oooh Ohhhhhhhhhhh
You're one in a million

(yeah yeah)
All this time I was lookin' for love
Try'n to make things work that wasn't good enough
Til' I thought I'm through
Said I'm done
Then stumbled into the arms of the one

I said pinch me wheres the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it 
Ohh ohhhh
Yeah yeah

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in a blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it
Whoa
You're one in a million
Yeah
You're one in a million
Yeah
You're one in a million---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
