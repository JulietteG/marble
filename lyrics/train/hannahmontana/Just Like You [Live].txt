(yeah, yeah)
So what you see
Is only half the story
There's another side of me
I'm the girl you know
But I'm someone else too
If you only knew

It's a crazy life
But I'm alright

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

(yeah, yeah)

Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
Half the time I've got my name in lights
The other half I'm by your side

It's a crazy life
But I'm just fine

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

Yeah-ee yeah

Can't you see
I'm just an ordinary girl
Living in an extra-ordinary world
Trying to live
Trying to learn
Trying to just be who I am
Who I am

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream (the dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted (always wanted)
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream (livin' the dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted (always wanted)
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you .---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
