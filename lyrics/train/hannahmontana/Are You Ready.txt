Put on your coolest dress
And your hottest pair of shoes,
Come on let's go

oh.......

Get in my car
And turn the radio on up high
I said high

At the red light
Boy's trying to get the digit
But we sneak by (ah by by)

Cause we're heading to the club,
Nothing's gonna stop us now,
Let's go (Let's go , Let's go)

oh.......

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go x 2

Are you ready,
Are you

yeah....

I'm coming up with all my girls
We're gonna party like 
There's never a worry cause
Good times rules and no curfew
We're showing of our moves
The breeze so cool

Let your hair down
Tonight get to be a superstar
You're living like a superstar

So we're flirting with the dude at the door,
Till he says we're okay

Hey!

Move the velvet rope,
Back off,
Get out of our way

Hey!

All the guys
Got their eyes on us 
As we're moving up to the floor

oh......

Trying to waste our time
But we're doing what we came here for
(we're here to dance baby)

oh....

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go x 2

Are you ready,
Are you

I'm coming up with all my girls
We're gonna party like 
There's never a worry cause
Good times rules and no curfew
We're showing of our moves
The breeze so cool

Let your hair down
Tonight get to be a superstar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar......
Are you ready-ready-dy-dy-dy-dy

We get red carpet love
When we come stepping up
The boys keep dropping thier jaws,
Can never get enough

We make them stop and stare
We see them everywhere
And you know who we are,
Tonight you're living like a superstar

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Let's go x 2

Are you ready,
Are you

yeah....

I'm coming up with all my girls
We're gonna party like 
There's never a worry cause
Good times rules and no curfew
We're showing of our moves
The breeze so cool x 2

Let your hair down
Tonight get to be a superstar
You're living like a superstar-ar-ar-ar

Tonight you get get get to get to be a be a
you're living like a superstar-ar-ar-ar---Lyrics submitted by Eliana Wilson.
