How did I get here
I turned around
And there you were
I didn't think twice or rationalize
Cuz somehow I knew
That there was more than just chemistry
I mean I knew you were kind of into me
But I figured it's too good to be true

I said pinch me where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it
You're one in a million

All this time I was looking for love
Trying to make things things work
They weren't good enough
Til I thought I'm through
Said I'm done
Then stumbled into the arms of the one

You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff
Say that I'm your diamond in the rough
When I'm mad at you
You come with your velvet touch
Can't believe that I'm so lucky
I have never felt so happy
Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet you were a million to one
I can't believe it
You're one in a million

All this time I was looking for love
Trying to make things work
They weren't good enough
Til I thought I'm through
Said I'm done
Then stumbled into the arms of the one

I said pinch me
Where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I can't believe it

You're one in a million

One in a million

You're one in a million---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa.
