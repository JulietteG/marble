Ha
Whatever will be, will be

Delete me from your friends
I dont care what you think
Lets forget we ever met
Dont cha worry bout me

So Im sick to my stomach
when Im think about the wasted time we spend together
planning on forever
(whatever)

cheat me once, shame on you
cheat me twice, shame in me
Im an idiot
that I couldnt see whats underneath

That beautiful face
Or these warm or worse days
Surprise, surprise
Im doing just fine
(whoa)

Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera, sera

Whatever comes Ill be okay
Whatever life Throws my way
You wish Id hurt
but Im as free as a bird
And Im happier no-ow-ow-ow
(yeah)

Aaaah
Que sera

I could never go back
to a thing that didnt last
and Im sorry to say
that youre living in the past

And if youd ever believe
I would take you back (no)
It took you long to get in
But now youre out so fast

The way you played your cards
shoulda told me who you are
always goin all in
and you hated when I win

Just had me whipped too far
I shoulda known from the start
that you gamble
with my heart
(ha)

Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera, sera

Whatever comes Ill be okay
Whatever life throws my way
You wish Id hurt
but Im as free as a bird
And Im happier no-ow-ow-ow

Whoo
Ha Ha

Ooooh I feel it in the air
(feel it in the air babe)
Ooooh Theres something better out there
Ooooh Hello to the new me
(hello, hello, hello)
Ooooh So goodbye baby
(goodbye)

I could never go back
to a thing that didnt last
and Im sorry to say
that youre living in the past

And if youd ever believe
I would take you back (no)
It took you long to get in
But now youre out so fast

The way you played your cards
shoulda told me who you are
always goin in all in
and you hated when I win

Just had me whipped too far
I shoulda known from the start
that you gamble
with my heart
(ha)

Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera, sera

Whatever comes Ill be okay
Whatever life throws my way
You wish Id hurt
but Im as free as a bird
And Im happier no-ow-ow-ow
(whoo)

Que sera, sera
