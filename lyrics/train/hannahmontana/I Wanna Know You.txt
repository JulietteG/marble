Woah woah woah, woah woah (3x)

When I saw you over there
I didn't mean to stare, 
but my mind was everywhere
I wanna know you
Girl,I guess that you're the kind
to say whats on your mind,
But you listen 
when I have something to show you.
There's a mark above your eye
You got it in July
Your fighting for your sister's reputation
You remember people's names
and Valentine's are lame
so you bring me flowers just for no occasion
Woah

Woah (5x)
I wanna know you
Woah(5x)
I wanna go there ,where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday,down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
Yeah I thought so.

You smile never shout
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if I'm wrong 
Your fragile and your strong
A beautiful and perfect combination
Yeah

Woah(5x)
I wanna know you
Woah(5x)
I wanna go there, where you go,
I wanna find out what you know,
And maybe someday down the road,
I'll sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me 
in our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself 
Yeah I thought
I thought so

Woah Woah
Yeah yeah
Yeah

Yeeeaaah(2x)
I wanna know you
Yeeeaaah(2x)
I wanna go there, where you go 
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road 
I'll sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me
in our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself 
Yeah I thought so---Lyrics submitted by jose.
