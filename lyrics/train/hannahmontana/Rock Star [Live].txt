Sometimes I walk a little faster
in the school hallway just to get next to you.
Some days I spend a little extra time in the morning
just to impress you.

Guess you don't notice,
Guess you don't need this,
Sad your not seeing what you're missing.
On the outside shying away,
On the inside dying to say:

CHORUS
I'm unusual,
not so typical,
way too smart to be waiting around.
ti chi practicing,
snowboard champion,
i can fix the flat on your car;

I might even be a rock star,
I might even be a rock star.

Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
that it would be you saying lets hang out.
Then you confess that there's something
special between us, why don't we find out.

You don't even know me 
Guess you don't need me.
Why you not seeing what you're missing?
On the outside shying away,
On the inside dying to say:

CHORUS
I'm unusual, 
not so typical,
way to smart to be waiting around.
ti chi practices, 
snowboard champion, 
i can fix the flat on your car; 
i might even be a rock star.
(a rockstar)

If you only knew the real me;
i might even be a ro-ockstar.
I'm telling you that we are meant to be,
 and wouldn't it be nice if you could see,
that i really am a rock star,
(yeah)yeah, yeah, wooh

yeah i really am a rock star
Hey, hey, hey
(guitar solo)
a rock star

CHORUS
I'm unusual,
not so typical,
way too smart to be waiting around.
ti chi practicing,
snowboard champion,
i can fix the flat on your car;

rocking wherever we are,
yeah, yeah
'cause i really am a rock star
'cause i really am a rock star

I am a rockstar,
woah oh oh
Goodnight everybody!---Lyrics submitted by mariah.
