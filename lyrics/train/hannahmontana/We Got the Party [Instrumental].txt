C'mon guys tell me what we're doing
We're hangin' around when we could be all over the pla-a-a-ace
The sun is shinin' just the way we like it
Let's get out of this hallway
Show the world our fa-a-a-ace

It's friday but there's nowhere to go
Anywhere is cool but we're not going ho-ome
We can do anything we wanna do
It's all up to me and you

[chorus:]
Turn this park into a club 
The stars are lights and the moon is a vibe from above
This skateboard here's our ride so pull on up 
Everyone is waiting for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
We got the party with us
Oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
We got the party with us

Radio, let me be a DJ
I'll turn you up keep us movin' 'till we're on a roll,
Everyone is dancing to their own beat
And letting go, everybody here's got so-o-o-oul

It's friday and there's nowhere to be
We're kickin' it together it's so good to be fre-e
We got each other and that's all we need
The rest is up to you and me

[chorus]

[bridge:]
Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer
That nothing can stand in our way today let's find a place to play

[chorus:]
Turn this park into a club 
The stars are lights and the moon is a vibe from above
This skateboard here's our ride so pull on up 
Everyone is waiting for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us

Turn this park into a club
The stars are the lights and the moon is a vibe from above
We got the party with us
This skateboard here's our ride so pull on up 
Everyone is waiting for us

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody kno-ows
Oh oh oh
We got the party, we got the party, we got the party, we got the party with us
Oh oh oh oh ohh
We got the party with us---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
