it feels like i'm a million miles away
from myself more and more these days
i've been down to many open roads
but nothing leads me home

and now i just don't know who i really am, how it's gonna be 
is there something that i can't see?
i wanna understand
maybe i will never be who i was before 
maybe i don't even her anymore 
or maybe who i am today ain't so far from yesterday
can i find a a way to be every part of me?

so i'll try, try to slow things down
and find myself, get my feet back on the ground.
it'll take time but i know i'll be alright
cause nothin' much has changed on the inside.

it's hard to figure out how it;s gonna be
cause i don't really know now.
i wanna understand
maybe i will nevber be who i was before 
maybe i don't even know her anymore.
or maybe who i am today ain't so far from yesterday.
can  find a way to be every part of me?
 i don't wanna wait to long
to find out where i'm meant to belong
i've always wanted to be where i am today
but i never thought i'd feel this way

maybe i will never be who i was before
maybe don't even know her anymore
or maybe who i am today aint so far from yesterday
can i find a way to be every part of me?
every part of me.---Lyrics submitted by Beccca.
