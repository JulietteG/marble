Yeah
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yea-hey-yea.

Sometimes I walk a little faster in the school hallway
Just to get next to you (you)
Somedays I spend a little extra time in the morning
Just to impress you

Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad you're not seein what you're missin'

On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waitin' around
Tai chi practicing, snowboard champion
I could fix a flat on your car
I might even be a rock star! 
I might even be a rock star! 

Sometimes I wish when the phone rings that
It would be you sayin' let's hang out
Then you confess that there's something special between us
Why don't we find out

You don't even know me
Guess you don't need me
Why you're not seein'
What you're missin'

On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say
Woooh! 

I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waitin' around
Tai chi practicing, snowboard champion
I could fix a flat on your car
I might even be a rock star (rock star)

If you only knew who the real me
I might even be a rock star
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rock star

Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yea! Woooh! 
Yeah I really am a rock star! 
Hey, Hey, Hey! 
Wooo! 
Hah, a rock star

I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waitin' around
Tai chi practicing, snowboard champion
I could fix a flat on your car
Rockin' it wherever we are

Yeah yeah! 
Cause I really am a rock star
Cause I really am a rock star
I am a rock star
Whoa-oh oh-oh! Yeah! 
Goodnight everybody!---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
