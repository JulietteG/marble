Don't let no small frustration
Ever bring you down
No no no no
Just take a situation
And turn it all around

With a new attitude everything can change
Make it how you want it to be
Stayin' mad, why do that?
Give yourself a break
Laugh about it and you'll see

Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on come on (everybody now)

Why be sad, broken hearted?
Theres so much to do
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Life is hard or
It's a party
The choice is up to you

With a new attitude everything can change
Make it how you want it to be
Stayin' sad, why do that?
Give yourself a break
I know you wanna party with me

Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on come on

Lets celebrate it
Join in everyone
You decide
'Cause life's...what you make it

Things are looking up
Any time you want
All you gotta do is realize that
It's under your control
So let the good times rock and roll

Ow!
Da da da do it now
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
OW!
Alright
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock
(let's make it rock)
Life's what you make it
So come on come on (everybody now)
Let's celebrate it
Join in everyone
You decide
'Cause life's...what you make it
Life is what you make it---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
