I always knew this day would come
We'd be standing one by one 
With our future in our hands
So many dreams so many plans

Always knew after all these years 
There'd be laughter there'd be tears
Never thought i'd  walk away
With so much joy but so much pain
But it's so hard to say goodbye 

But yesterdays gone we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments so glad i got to know ya
The times that we had i'll keep like a photograph
And hold in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

Na Na Na Na Na

Another chapter in the book 
Can't go back but you can look 
There we are on every page
Memories i'll always save
Up ahead on the open doors
Who knows what were heading towards 
I wish love I wish you luck
For you the world just opens up
But it's so hard to say goodbye

Yesterdays gone we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments so glad i got to know ya
The times that we had i'll keep like a photograph 
And hold you in my heart forever 
I'll always remember you

Everyday that we had all the good all the bad
I'll keep you here inside
All the times that we shared every place everywhere 
You touched my life
Yeah one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh
But right now we just cry
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye

Yesterdays gone we gotta keep moving on 
I'm so thankful for the moments so glad i got to know ya
The times that we had i'll keep like a photograph 
And hold you in my heart forever 
I'll Always Remember You

Na Na Na Na Na
