you ready?
whoo!
here we go!

Life is just a party so come as you are
dress it up or dress it down
never forget your guitar (yeah)
just be courageous
this styles contagious
everyone can rock out like a supeerstar

lets get crazy
get up and dance
take a swing do your thing
if we're taking a chance
lets get crazy
yeah just kick up your heels
don't miss out, time to shout
always keeping it real
lets get crazy
crazy

our songs our style 
our hair our smile
our laughs our heart
our grace our smarts

you see me on the cover of a magazine
remember
things are always different then the way that they seem
heres an invitation, to every nation
meet me on the dance floor 
and we'll make the scene

lets get crazy
get up and dance
take a swing do your thing
if we're taking a chance
lets get crazy
yeah just kick up your heels
don't miss out, time to shout
always keeping it real
lets get crazy

our songs our style 
our hair our smile
our laughs our heart
our grace our smarts

lets get crazy
get up and dance
take a swing, do your thing
if we're taking a chance
lets get crazy
turn the music up loud
nows the time to unwind
lose yourself in the crowd
lets get crazy

yeah the funs just begun
come on dance everyone
heres an invitation to every nation
oh oh yeah,
oh oh yeah
crazy
take a swing, do your thing
if we're taking a chance
lets get crazy
yeah just kick up your heels
don't miss out, time to shout
always keeping it real
lets get crazy!---Lyrics submitted by katiee.
