Finally
Ive been waiting for this moment
For you to see
The real me
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

Its been an illusion
But I never meant to fool you
I got caught up in a fantasy

Im just a girl
With a dream
That got the best of me
In a world
That believes fame is everything
Yeah yeah
Got out of touch
With the ones who gave me my wings
To fly
To fly

People say
That the world is like a stage
Yes I confused
The roles I play

Ive been away
(So long)
From home for so long
That I
Almost forgot where I belong
Yeah yeah yeah

Im just a girl
With a dream
That got the best of me
Yeah
In a world
That believes fame is everything
Got out of touch
With the ones who gave me my wings
To fly
To fly

Its so easy to forget
What really matters in this life
Its so hard to live with regrets
But I promise I will try
To be a better me
(To be a better me)
From now on
Im sorry
I didnt mean to do you wrong

Im just a girl
With a dream
That got the best of me
Yeah yeah
In a world
That believes fame is everything
(Everything yeah)
Got out of touch
With the ones who gave me my wings
To fly
To fly
To fly
To fly

You give me my wings
So I can fly
I can fly
Yeah
Yeah yeah

Im just a girl---
