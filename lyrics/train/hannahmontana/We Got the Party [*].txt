Come on guys, 
Tell me what were doing,
We're hanging around when we could be all over the place,

The sun is shining 
Just the way we like it,
Let's get out of this hallway, show the world our face. 

It's Friday, but there's no where to go,
Anywhere is cool but were not going home.
We can do anything we wanna do,
It's all up to me and you...

Chorus:
Turn this park into a club
The stars are lights 
and the moon is the light from above
the skateboard's here,
our ride so cool hollar , 
everyone is waiting for us  
anywhere we are
anywhere we go 
everybody knows 
we got the party with us 
anywhere we are ,
anywhere we go everybody knows,
we got the party with us, 

radio let me be a dj 
ill turn you up 
cause were moving till were on a roll
every one is dancing to their own beat  and letting go 
every body heres got soul

its friday and theres nowhere to be
were kicking it together 
its so good to be free 
we got eachother 
and thats all we need 
the rest is up to you and me,

Chorus:
turn this park into a club
the stars are lights
and the moon is the light from above
the skateboard's here,
our ride is so cool hollar,
everyone is waiting for us
anywhere we are
anywhere we go
everybody knows
we got the party with us
anywhere we are,
anywhere we go everybodys knows,
we got the party with us,

life is for dreamers 
and im a beliver 
that nothing can stand in our way 
we need to find a place to play, 

Chorus: (x2)
turn this park into a club
the stars are lights
and the moon is the light from above
the skateboard's here,
our ride is so cool hollar,
everyone is waiting for us
anywhere we are
anywhere we go
everybody knows
we got the party with us
anywhere we are,
anywhere we go everybodys knows,
we got the party with us,---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
