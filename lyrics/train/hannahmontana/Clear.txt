It's six A.M. and I'm wide awake
Cause I can't stop thinking 
About the stuff you were saying to me 
And I can't let is slide
The paper's not here yet the suns not up 
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that makes it all so 

Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective 
It's so Clear to me now
You can't treat me that way 
It appears to me 
How long you tried to make me think it was me 
Who was being the fake
So Clear

Why did I smile when I hurt inside
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free 
I'm on my way
Yeah I'm stepping out of the haze and it's so

[Chorus]

I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I in a can find better days
The first time while
I think I even feel a smile on my face

[Chorus]x3

Suns going down on a Saturday
And I feel all right and I feel OK---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
