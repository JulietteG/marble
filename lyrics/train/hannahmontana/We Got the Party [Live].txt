VERSE:
Come on guys tell me what we're doing,
We're hangin' around when we could be all over the place,
The sun is shinin' just the way we like it,
Let's get out of this hallway,
Show the world our face,

It's Friday but there's nowhere to go,
Anywhere is cool but we're not going home,
And we can do anything we wanna do,
It's all up to me and you,

CHORUS:
Turn this park into a club,
The stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above,
Skateboard here's our ride so pull on up everyone is waiting for us,
Anywhere we are,
Anywhere we go,
Everybody knows,
We got the party with us,
Anywhere we are,
Anywhere we go,
Everybody knows,
We got the party with us.

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
We got the party with us
ah ah ah ah ah ah
We got the party with us

VERSE:
Radio, let me be your DJ,
I'll turn you up,keep it moving,'till we're on a roll,
Everyone is dancing to their own beat,
Thier letting go,everybody here's got soul,

It's Friday and there's nowhere to be,
We're kickin' its together it's so good to be free,
We got each other and that's all we need,
The rest is up to you and me,

CHORUS:
Turn this park into a club,
The stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above,
Skateboard here's our ride so pull on up everyone is waiting for us,
Anywhere we are,
Anywhere we go,
Everybody knows,
We got the party with us,
Anywhere we are,
Anywhere we go,
Everybody knows,
We got the party with us

(Guitar Solo)
We got the party with us,
we got the party with us,
Whoo!
We got the party with us

BRIDGE:
Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer
That nothing can stand in our way today let's find a place to play,yeah

CHORUS:(x2)
Turn this park into a club,
the stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above,
Skateboard here's our ride so pull on up,
Everyone is waiting for us,
Anywhere we are,
Anywhere we go,
Everybody knows,
We got the party with us,
Anywhere we are,
Anywhere we go,
Everybody knows,
We got the party with us,

Turn this park into a club
the stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above
We got the party with us
Skateboards,here's our ride so pull on up

Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
