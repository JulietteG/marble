I rode all night on a big old bus
You came a long way to be with us
You pay good money to see a show
Yeah, let's get ready 'cause here we go

Get on your feet 'cause I'm plugged in
So come on lets do this

I'll turn it on, I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I'll get loud, I'll wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down

I know just what you came here for
And i want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet, you know you can't resist
Let's do this, let's do this

Don't call this work but im paid to play
And the real party starts backstage
And all my friends they sing my song
I wish you all could come along

To take a picture to show your friends
So come on, let's do this

I'll turn it on, I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I'll get loud, I'll wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down

I know just what you came here for
And i want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet, you know you can't resist
Let's do this, let's do this

Everybody come on now's the time to get loud
Throw your hands up, let me hear you shout it out
All my people let me see you jump up and down
Let me hear the words you know, you know i'll sing' em out

Freak out, scream, shout
This is what it's all about
Let me hear the hook now

I'll turn it on, I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I get loud, I wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down

I know just what you came here for
And i want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet, you know you can't resist
Let's do this, let's do this, Let's do this!---Lyrics submitted by mary.
