I believe, my baby got a black cat bone 
I believe, my baby got a black cat bone 
Seems like everything I do 
Seems like I do it all wrong 

I tried so hard, to get along with that woman of mine 
I tried so hard, to get along with that woman of mine 
Seems the more I try 
She goes around cheatin' and lyin'. 

I walked all the way from Dallas 
Down to Wichita Falls 
Got to thinkin' 'bout that big leg woman 
And it weren't no walk at all 

I believe my baby got a black cat bone---
