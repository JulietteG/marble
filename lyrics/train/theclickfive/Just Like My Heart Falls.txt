Oohh...

Water's over the flood line
Rain is pourin' down
In the deep end, we swan dive
Tryin' not to drown
Over and over again
Over and over our heads

Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Every time I think of you
Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Falls for everthing you do
Yeah, falls through everything you do

Oohh...

Chain and blade through the timber
Down without a prayer
Straight and shade in a splinter
For the naked air
Over and over again
Over and over our heads

Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Every time I think of you
Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Falls for everthing you do
Yeah, falls for everything you do

And though we never learn
We close our eyes and hope it won't hurt
I wanna put it out, but I watch it grow
Turn and let it go- oh

Bombs over the buildings
Breakin' like the black
Leavin' only the welling
Never drawn back
Over and over again
Over and over our heads

Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Every time I think of you
Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Falls for everthing you do
Yeah, falls through everything you do

Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Every time I think of you
Fallin' from the sky
Just like my heart falls
Falls for everthing you do
Yeah, falls through everything you do---Lyrics submitted by nowanadzieja95@gmail.
