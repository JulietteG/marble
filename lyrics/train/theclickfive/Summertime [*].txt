On the boardwalk
working two shifts
saving for that diamond ring
then i'll quit
all the cool kids
hang at south pier
guess i'll have it figured out
By next year

Summertime
Summertime
you do it to me everytime
summertime
you do it to me

oh oh oh oh oh
i'm restless
oh oh oh oh oh
defenceless
oh i can feel it
baby is it real or is it just a sign
i'ts Summertime

on the weekend
got my ink done
took my baby for a ride
in the sun
left the boardwalk
on my four wheels
now we're blastin'
down the shore
and we feel

summertime
summertime
you do it to me 
everytime
summertime
you do it to me

oh oh oh oh oh
i'm restless
defenceless
oh i can feel it baby is it real or is it just a sign
it's summertime
summertime summertime
you do it to me everytime
summertime
you do it to me
