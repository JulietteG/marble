Bees in the caramel and I'm not afraid
Surgeons make incisions
What a mess they've made
Tearing at my skin leaving knives in my brain
Stabbing at the voices making me insane
Girls vomit candy and lies that they're fed.
Boys whisper lullabies and wet their beds
Eat TV violence on the toast that they spread
Talking with their mouths full here is what they've said

Say hello to my little friend the world is getting ugly 
and we did it again. . . . 
Say hello to my little friend the world is getting ugly
and we did it again. . . . 
Ohh Uh Ohh the band aid only covers the bullet hole
Ohh Uh Ohh the band aid only covers the bullet hole

La  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la 

Spinders in my hair and guns on my mind
Thinking about the people who've been so unkind
If looks could kill them 
I might make myself blind
Startled at the reaons that I just can't find
Kids break the dishes they crash on the floor 
Parents hate the noise and shove them out the door.
Robots steal emotions hide them under their beds
It gets them so excited
Here is what they've said

Say hello to my little friend the world is getting ugly 
and we did it again. . . . 
Say hello to my little friend the world is getting ugly
and we did it again. . . . 
Ohh Uh ohh the band aid only covers the bullet hole
Ohh Uh ohh the band aid only covers the bullet hole

The band aid only covers the bullet hole
la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blahhhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
