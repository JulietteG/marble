Hey girl you're comin' with me, your comin' with me.

Talk to me girl, Let me tell you girl. 
Got you stuck on my elevator. 
Get it up. On my ehh o ehh oh. 

Hey 
My first flo stopped a gold diggin' woman 
Money cash flow all big faced hundreds 
Stuntin' on the pole got them b-boys running 
Shorty got both broke can't see what's comin' 
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey 
Dolce and Gabbana and she get it from her mommy 
Louis bags, rich, Gucci, Fendi and Armani 
See the carrots on her wrist now she pimps Bugs Bunny 
Used to date Kanye now she want me 
While I got my juice wanna take my OJ 
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake 
If I ever play for booty grade A 

Got you stuck on my (yeah) 
On my elevator (uh huh) 
Get it up, on my elevator 
Check it out! 

My First floor, stuck on the gold digger 
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece 
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat 
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know cuz.

(This girl is)She's stuck on my ehh o ehh oh 

She got her nails bid, she got her hair bid 
She got a Gucci bag, her brand new outfit 
Stuck on my elevator, she on the second floor 
Now I want you to break it down, DJ turn it up some more 
Hey, dime piece girl; True Religion, Ed Hardy 
Little mama twerk that top model body 
South Beach piece on the back of that Ducati 
I'll bet you that brand new Ferrari 

Got you stuck on my (yeah) 
On my elevator (uh huh) 
Get it up, on my elevator 
Check it out! 

First floor, stuck on the gold digger 
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece 
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat 
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know, cuz...

My third floor stuck on the hood rat charm 
Cut, take boy Hollyhood action 
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone 
Tattoo type, bump the low ringtone 
Bending Ghetto booty, playing the ghetto booty on her. 
Roll up machilles don't smoke arizona 
One night stand one night with the clan 
One night, one time broke her off 10 grand. 
Project all the way gutta all day 
Computer on first thang, while we in this thing 
Shorty don't fake she'll put it in your face 
Three stories while them hood rats beg 

Got you stuck on my (yeah) 
On my elevator (uhuh) 
Get it up, on my elevator 
Check it out! 

First floor, stuck on the gold digger 
Second floor, stuck on the dime piece 
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat 
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know, cause...
