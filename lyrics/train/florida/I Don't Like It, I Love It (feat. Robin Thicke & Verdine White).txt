I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can finds the word I just go
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

All out, turn the beat up
Hey now I'm glad to meet ya
Turn up girl, blow the speaker
Yeah up, think about it now, blow the speaker
I'll speak louder, let's get wild tonite
Billionaire bottles, we just down em like
Ain't no problem, all my roads are right
All right, all right

I don't like it, I love it
I got another comin' in my budget
I got a anaconda in my truck fit
Don't push it, don't push it
Cause I'ma hit it til I jackpot, that's right
Wax on baby wax off, act right
You can put it on the black card, all night
And I'll spend it, I'll spend it cause

All night, let me group ya
Dance with me, turn down for who girl
Another runner help us step the moves up
Yeah bet that round need a measure or ruler
Celebrate life and I'll pay for it
That Cavalli nice next to my Tom Ford
Yeah party all night, let's all aboard
Let's all aboard, all aboard

I don't like it, I love it
And them other girl they can't touch it
Competition, that's a whole nother subject
I wanna walk it out in public
You a star baby, just know, let's go
To the mansion or the condo, let's go
Perfect time gotta let it flow, you know
I'm watching, I'm watching, cause

Meet me at the studio
Bangarang just like Ruffio
Feel the base, let ya booty go
I wanna get inside it
Run away for a few days
Thinkin' bout love, baby touche
Tied up like a shoe lace
I don't like it, I don't like it

I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it---
