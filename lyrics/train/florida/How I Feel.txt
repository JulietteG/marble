(Chorus)
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Its a new day,
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Its a new day,
You know how I feel

(Verse 1)
Yea Im a new man baby
Yo other man probably should follow my bank plan baby
Strap on yo seat and get ready to go
You know we feelin', be 43 million feet up in the sky full of diamonds
Im only beginning then I get the feeling that we had yo people to light this
I got a few Miami vices
I dont never look at the prices
My super bow flickers are priceless
You know who the king
And the night is beautiful
Music for you to go low
Im feeling a bit awkward, this moment I think Im bout home

(Chorus)
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Its a new day,
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Its a new day,
You know how I feel

(Verse 2)
What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistol, somebody is bigger than life
50 bottles of lumen, its Dom Perignon, bout my dollars, we good for the night
Cameras flickin', I see me and vixen
Im fixin my call on my natural high
She can get it, my whole clique is with it
No question, we over, its everything bout it
This ho'w I ride, my passenger fly
We took off in London and land in Dubai
This is America, music my ride
My life is so lavish, you dont recognize
So lets toast to a new day and vouch yea
80 million and still rolling, hold still
Both of us agree to this compulsion
I got this melody so were like vultures

Who told y'all the partys over
Well it aint over til I told ya
I fill my cup, running over
Tomorrow I might be sober
But tonight Im like

Birds flying high
Its a new day
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
Its a new day,
You know how I feel---
