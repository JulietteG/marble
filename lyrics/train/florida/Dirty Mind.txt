Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?

Gotta be starting something
Don't you feel it tonight that you wanna be free?
No you don't mind
Cause what's mine is yours and your's is mine
I don't mind we on this to keep
Turn down for what? I'm not taking a breather
Can't help myself, I'm surrounded by divas
I can just tell how you look at me, stare at me, watching me watching you think like a freak
Jos-oh, Mateo
I don't kiss and tell
She sent me, she can't hide that tongue in mascara
You like it, I love it
That kinky, that yell
I know I'm in trouble, but I clean up well

Road rage, gold cage
Drink up the stuff it's gon' be a long day
I'd 'n got up in your mind
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya now

Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?

My skin diamond loosey
T-tie me up, shine me up, give me that bubblegum flavor
Caramel lollipop pop it for papi and drop it for papi, but papi won't save her
You're hot as a...
Hot as a...
Hot as a sunburn in Africa
Me on Stephanie
You on Erica
Two on two baby, we need the camera

Road rage, gold cage
Drink up the stuff it's gon' be a long day
I'd 'n got up in your mind
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya now

Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?

Oops
Oops I
Oops I got
Oops I got up in...

Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?---
