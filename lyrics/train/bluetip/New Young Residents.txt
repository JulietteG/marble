Had a dream that I found
extra rooms in my house
on the day I was to move out
and it kinda made me not want to leave
with a dusty smile
they offer up their space
such a shame to find them on the day 
the new young residents moved in

Woke up afraid I may not be living
up to my potential. I go to bed 
more afraid that I maybe I am
I get envious

It's hard to recognize 
the beauty of some things
until I see them 
framed by another's hands
that's how covetous I am

Woke up enraged
I may not be getting all that I deserve
found yesterday's forgotten lesson
left on the bed asleep knowing that life
owes me nothing

Envious I am covetous I am always
cursing the name
of the new young residents---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
