I can hear your voice has been
out loose with the satellites
then saddled in
a thousand backwards miles
through wiring
tone got compressed
clipped tight by the process
far from home
tethered by the telephone
I hope you're well
I hope you're good
I hope you're all alone---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
