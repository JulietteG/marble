Cautious > convicted
your body's got a fragile cadence
something you have to cater to
so you do
last time you fell down
chipped your teeth now your smile 
looks serrated, so you seldom take it out

Comments > like breath mints
keep it sweet don't be offensive
sit on the fence for the fight
stiff-lipped > silent
speak the words you can't hold onto
though you've got them
throttled pretty tight
last time you spoke up
chipped your teeth now your smile 
looks serrated, so you seldom take it out

New shoe premonition is:
ankle twisted to the floor
stepping on your leg-end
still taking baby steps
in your favorite shoes
with the soles worn through

Stand up straight > silent >
so afraid of falling down.---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
