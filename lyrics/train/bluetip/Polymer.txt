All the tollbooths are painted
hospital green
operator's eyes
yellow in the hazard lights
indicates a failed liver
like a late warning sign
a rattle in the lungs 
that begs investigating
might've already found the noise
dumb down to a crude
sort of science
since you've been born
we're making a brand new world...
have a look around

Good morning your baby was born
with no set of eyes pesticide effect
you'll get for the betterment
if you had something of value
it would already be gone
industry's feng shui moves in
clear-cut times
might've already found the noise

I want to be embalmed in 
the latest polymer
a compound that's never been around
half-lives that last a thousand life times
that kind of immortality isn't born;
it's manufactured

(Railroad stitches in dead grass
moving cargo on a raised up scar
embroidered closed. If it gave
and came around unwound what would it show?
pretty petrol rainbows.)

Have a look around 
might've already found the noise---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
