A messenger arrived through 
a sunlit' open door 
Passed the dangers of the world 
to his troubled queen so bored
With a voice full of worry and
a frightened fighter's face
Another day's morning in life's busy race
He looked into her eyes before he spoke 

Play my darling, play
Don't you put yourself on the throne no more
Play my darling, play
There's a world outside our broken borders
Play my darling, play
Don't you put your key in another door
Play my darling, play
With a world outside your broken borders
She's a lonely young girl 
she's the sister of the moon
Her heart is like November 
though she wants it to be June
Larger than life she's standing there so tall
There's a note with her name and 
it's hanging on the wall
Her eyes they opened wide when she read 

(Play my darling, play) 

She's stuck there on her 
island so marooned
The limelights got 
her blinded and harpooned---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
