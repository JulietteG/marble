Empty are the hours
 And empty are the days 
I've locked up all the doors
 Take me on my way

Down a broken road of questions
 That lead me to a lie
 To a cold night in December 
When we both sat down to cry

 Now will you carve my name upon a stone?
 Will you lay me down to rest?
 Do you think I'll see my father's father
 Do you think I'll pass his test?
 Will you whisper "Lord please keep me,
 always walk right by my side"?
 Will you place the coins upon my eyes
 To pay the boatman for the ride?

Chorus:
 Well I was standing in the drizzling rain
 Just long enough to wash away my pain
 And realize that she's never coming home
 She said "I won't come back"
 I said "Don't come back, I'm better off alone"

She called me from a pay phone
 South of San Antone
 And I could hear somebody talking
 But she swore she was alone
 You know it sounded so familiar
 I pray to God that I am wrong
 I always thought she'd leave me
 I never dreamed he'd go along

Chorus X2

I'm better off alone---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
