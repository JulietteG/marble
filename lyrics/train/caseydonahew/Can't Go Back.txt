Well I said things I didn't mean 
And you threw down that diamond ring
 Turned around with no regrets
 Just like we never met
 Saw that ring skip across the floor
 Said I don't love you anymore

(Chorus)
 I never thought leaving would be this hard
 Standing out front in the yard
 I turn around and watch 
While the lights in the house all fade to black
 Realize you can't go back

I still love you this I know
 And it's so hard to turn and go
 I still see you in my dreams 
And I still want you to wear that ring
 If nothing ever changes 
Then life just stays the same
 And I'm the only one to blame

Chorus X2---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
