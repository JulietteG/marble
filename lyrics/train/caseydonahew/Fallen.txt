When I came home you said your crazy. 
You know I think your probably right. 
Cuz I bee out and  been drinkin. 
I left you alone again last night. 
You haven't cried that I've noticed. 
But I dont notice much at all. 
Just that suitcase by the front door. 
You said I can't stand to watch you fall.

But I've already fallen.
I've already lost control.
I've already missed.
And I've already sold my soul.
And I've already cried, and I wish that I was flyin.
But I keep on fallen.

Now I won't even try to stop you.
Your better off with someone new.
And I hope that you don't rememeber, all the pain that I put you through.
You'll find a new love and you'll be happy.
And you won't think of me at all.
All those nights you've tried to save me, then I'd stumble, and I'd fall.

But I've already fallen.
I've already lost control.
I've already missed.
And I've already sold my soul.
And I've already cried, and I wish that I was flyin.
But I keep on fallen.

I've already fallen.
I've already lost control.
I've already missed.
And I've already sold my soul.
And I've already cried, and I wish that I was flyin.
But I keep on, again.

But I keep on fallen.---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
