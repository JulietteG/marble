I cleaned up my truck
Bought a long stem rose
I shaved with shaking hands
and put on my best clothes
I laughed at all your jokes
like a fool, I cant look away
Now your hands in mine
And,  I dont know what to say
Im not ready to say goodnight
Im not ready to drive you home
Im not ready to watch you close that door
While I drive off alone
I know theres something between you and me 
Lets just ride til we see daylight
This road is long and the moon is bright 
Im not ready to say goodnight 
I can see youre not sure, Im not sure lets just take a chance
Call it love call it fate, destiny or circumstance 
now you can walk away and not look back if you choose
I know weve both been hurt before so theres nothing left too loose 
Im not ready to say goodnight
Im not ready to drive you home
Im not ready to watch you close that door
While I drive off alone
I know theres something between you and me 
Lets just ride til we see daylight
This road is long and the moon is bright 
Im not ready to say goodnight 
We might end up lost or we find what we need the most
We can turn around with the sun or drive til we hit the coast
Im not ready to say goodnight
Im not ready to drive you home
Im not ready to watch you close that door
While I drive off alone
I know theres something between you and me 
Lets just ride til we see daylight
This road is long and the moon is bright 
Im not ready to say goodnight 
This road is long and the moon is bright 
Im not ready to say goodnight---Lyrics submitted by Shelby Brown.
