I hear you're lookin' for a cowboy to take you for a ride
 Well baby, I think that I'm your man
 'Cause I've been broken and busted
 But these spurs still ain't rusted, and this saddle it's a wonder she'll still ride
 And it's gonna be a long night, so baby hold on tight
 I talk slow, but I still move real fast
 I'm here for the real deal, and your heart's all that I'll steal
 And girl there won't be no doubt

You can't resist my Resistol
 It's black as the nightfall
 My boots they're leather and hide
 I'm here for a wild ride
 I'll stand right by your side
 And we'll dance til the sun comes up
 And I'm tore up from the floor up, look down and look up
 I'm a cowboy from my head to my toes
 And this rodeo's all I know
 I'll put on a real show
 And girl there won't be no doubt

I've been thrown, I've been bruised
 Tossed and confused
 Eight seconds can seem like a day
 But stay out of my way
 'Cause I come to play
 And eight seconds is all that I'll stay

You can't resist my Resistol
 It's black as the nightfall
 My boots they're leather and hide
 I'm here for a wild ride
 I'll stand right by your side
 And we'll dance til the sun comes up
 And I'm tore up from the floor up, look down and look up
 I'm a cowboy from my head to my toes
 And this rodeo's all I know
 I'll put on a real show
 And girl there won't be no doubt

I love a girl with a tramp stamp
 A double dockin' boat ramp
 Whiskey - shaken, never stirred
 Tank tops and flip flops
 Those all night long truck stops
 And beer when it's cold and when it's free

You can't resist my Resistol
 It's black as the nightfall
 My boots they're leather and hide
 I'm here for a wild ride
 I'll stand right by your side
 And we'll dance til the sun comes up
 And I'm tore up from the floor up, look down and look up
 I'm a cowboy from my head to my toes
 And this rodeo's all I know
 I'll put on a real show
 And girl there won't be no doubt
 No, girl, there won't be no doubt

I hear you're lookin' for a cowboy to take you for a ride
 Well baby, I think that I'm your man---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
