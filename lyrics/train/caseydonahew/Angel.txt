well her wings are broken
and she never prays
and that ole halo on her head has seen better days
she knows hes watching
she feels him there
and it breaks her heart to think the weight was to much to bear

Chorus:
yea shes an angel whos lost her way
yea shes an angel from another day
she may be the devil set to lead me a stray
but i think shes an angel
thats lost her way

shes got lines runnin up her arms like an LA freeway
i dropped her off at rehab 7 times but she just wont stay
shes never climbed a mountain but shes seen her share of snow
she got locked up in johnson county for 7 pills and blow

Chorus:
yea shes an angel whos lost her way
yea shes an angel from another day 
she may be the devil set to lead me a stray
but i think shes an angel
thats lost her way

she got 3 kids that dont know her name
she sold her body a couple times to ease the pain
she wakes up screamin her face full of tears
shes only 29 but she has aged beyond her years

Chorus: 
yea shes an angel whos lost her way
yea shes an angel from another day 
she may be the devil set to lead me a stry
but i think shes an angel
thats lost her way

yeah i think shes an angel
well i know shes an angel
whos lost her way---Lyrics submitted by kaylaa keeton.
