boundless water in an eternity frame of mind 
and all thats lost is our time 
peaks break through open sky that grasps for land below 

mountains climb and topple on themselves. 
steel breaks wave and sounds lull us to sleep 
all things drift quietly away 

forget your cell phone man, it won't work here 

my cameras zoom - it captures all that might embrace it 
unsteadied ice creates the wake in deeper places 
oh darling I cant bare the thought of seperation 
the years will pass and we'll forget just how this made us 

there is substance in this silence 
the proof of what surrounds us. 
photographs are a mirror image 
look deep and see yourself in them. 

seasickness, ancient forests, and water creatures 
keep us from thinking about home---Lyrics submitted by bodie.
