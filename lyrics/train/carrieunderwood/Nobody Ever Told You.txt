Take off all the makeup girl
Shine your light, show the world
Dont be shy, dont be scared
You dont have to hide under there
Lets throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

[Chorus:]
Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you
Yeah
La la la la la

Mirror mirror on the wall
Acting like he knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
He doesnt care whats underneath
All hung up on the negative
Doesnt have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

[Chorus:]
Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

[Bridge:]
Free as a bird,
Up on a watch
Just like a flower growing wild
Youre beautiful, youre beautiful
Nobody ever told you,
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you

[Outro:]
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you ---
