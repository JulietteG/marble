There's somethings that i regret
Some words;
I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts;
That had some bitter endings
Been some bad times i've been through
Damage i cannot undo
Some things;
i wish i could do all
All over again

But it dont really matter
Life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger

Oh, 

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday i wondered how
I'd get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me,
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart,
I'm greatful for every scar,

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

There's mistakes that i have made
some chances, i just threw away
some roads, i never should've taken
Been some signs i did'nt see
Hearts that i hurt needlessly
Some wounds that i wish 
I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference,
The past can't be rewritten,
You get the life you're given

Oh,

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday i wondered how
I'd get through the night
From every change, life has thrown me,
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart,
I'm greatful for every scar,

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And All the things that break you,
Are all the things that make you strong,
You can't change the past

cause its gone,
And you just gotta move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From everyday i wondered how
I'd get through the night
From every change, life has thrown me,
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart,
I'm greatful for every scar,

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

Oh,

Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned---Lyrics submitted by Bilal.
