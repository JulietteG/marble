Oh he gave up on arrows a long, long time ago
Turns out Im too hard to hit so he put away his bow
I might just keep on runnin from here to Timbuktu
Cause he gave up on arrows and I aint bulletproof

[Chorus:]
Yeah Cupids got a shotgun aiming at my heart
Ive been dodging bullets, Ive been hiding in the dark
Shot a double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupids got a shotgun and hes pointing it at me

Hes sitting in that treestand and his wings are camouflage
Im dug down in my foxhole waiting on his next barrage
Must be open season, got a target on my back
Think hes throwing love grenades and Im under attack

[Chorus:]
Yeah Cupids got a shotgun aiming at my heart
Ive been dodging bullets, Ive been hiding in the dark
Shot a double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupids got a shotgun and hes pointing it at me, yeah

[Bridge:]
Well hes got me in his sights, Ive got a red dot on my chest
But little does he know I strapped on my Kevlar vest
I pulled out my Remington and I loaded up these shells
Hes about to find out Im a dang good shot myself

[Chorus:]
Yeah Cupids got a shotgun aiming at my heart
Ive been dodging bullets, Ive been hiding in the dark
Shot a double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupids got a shotgun and hes pointing it at me
Yeah Cupids got a shotgun
But right now hes running from me, wooh ---
