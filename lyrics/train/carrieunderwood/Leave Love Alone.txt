Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out, make you think its real
Funny how love can make you feel, yeah

[Chorus:]
Ouh, ouh, yeah
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
Hey!

Aint it funny how love can make you fly
Sweetest buzz and the highest high
When you cant walk to the other side
Aint it funny how love can make you fly

[Chorus:]
Ouh, I cant stop it
Ouh, gotta have it, want it,
I cant help it
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
(Cant leave it alone)
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
Hey!

[Outro:]
Oh come on!
Burn me once but it dont sink in
I just keep coming back again
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave, I cant leave it
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I cant leave it alone
I cant leave it ---
