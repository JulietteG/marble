On a big ball cruisin'
Through the Stars
It's a rocket ride
No matter who you are

Flyin' Spinnin'
Through the blue
It's Full circle
On the move

It's a 360 Revolution
360 around the sun
Flying high
It's good to be alive
Doin' 360
365
A 360 revolution

Life's another ride
And sure enough
Sometimes you find you're
Down - side up - 
But in a day or
Two you'll come
Right back where you
Started from

It's a 360 Revolution
360 around the sun
Flying high
It's good to be alive
Doin' 360
365

We're up, we're down
We're up, we're down
We're Turnin' 'round

Its good to be alive 
Its good to be alive

It's a 360 Revolution
360 around the sun
Flying high
It's good to be alive
Doin' 360
365

360
360
360
360 around the sun
360
360
360
360 around the sun---Lyrics submitted by chelsea.
