yo L i think they got a problem
i think i got a problem a fucking alchohol problem
ye, i aint on some outerspace shit 
or some out of place shit
or some dollar in a dream
penny in a          shit
basicly cases pursuasivly being made
the game has been stagment
no faces are being changed
rearanged saying hes insane 
is an understatement
i aint the boss really 
im workin under saitan
im just playing around 
but you be gunnin hatin
so what you want a verse from me
i got one that taken
now a days everybodys on my dick
people either love me or they hate me quick
its almost like theres nothign i can saefly say
cuz they reconize my voice like im masie grey
hey let me get this shit strait
i dont ever spit hate
i aint ratialy charged just because my mix tape
name is the white man is the devil by slaine
when i say the white man im fermative cane
at the same time talking about the shit that im sayin
and the circumstances that i gotta live everyday
i gotta work with chances hopin that it might pan out
but it seems like they're tryin to keep this white man out

but i herd u got a problem with everything i do, everything  i say, every fucking day.
i think you got a problem acting this way, rappin this way, fuck em anyways.
you should not involve them, watch what you say, you should just forget what you see.
cuz you gon have a problem, you gon have a problem, you gon have a problem wit me.

i guess i represent a lifestyle the battle bell dont like now
im apposed to these people in the whitehouse
the whole administration im just a menis to them
i make offensive music about criminals and drug abusers
they lookin down apon us labelin us thugs and loosers
thats the athority always tryin to judge 
but only god can judge me
im not a roll model
my bodies not drug free
ill drink a whole bottle---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
