In my head
Finally my saviour is here
In my head
Finally my saviour is here

I here you call me from the other room
You say my name as if you know
What you're about to do
You say you're tired and you must be leaving soon
When will we ever
See this through?

And I continue to drown my sorrows
After you're gone
And look around for somebody else to
Hang my hopes on

In fact it's easier now that
You're not here
I'm no longer dreading you, muttering those words
In my ear

In my head
Finally my saviour is here
In my head
Finally my saviour is here

I can't explain the dark expression on my face
To the people that I'm surrounded by
But you understand me more than most
And you let me try

In fact it's easy now (x4)
I'm no longer dreading you, muttering those words
In my ear

In my head
Finally my saviour is here
In my head
Finally my saviour is here
In my head
Finally my saviour is here
In my head... 
Finally my saviour is here---Lyrics submitted by Gabby.
