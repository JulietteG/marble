Waiting for a perfect breeze to come
For a change, no matter where from
Pushing the clouds away
Bringing better day

For too long, too long, the sky's been gray
A silent motion to a new life
Wind direction's holding me back...

Replacing winter by summertime
We will never change, we know it,
but we could try...

The entire world in a single tear
After the rain the sun reveals what real
Life's crystal clear, remaining
what we've been
Let's get the sun to ignite our skins.

A silent motion to a new life
Wind direction's holding me back...

Replacing winter by summertime
We will never change, we know it,
but we could try...
Replacing winter by summertime
We will never change, we know it,
but we could try...

Let's erase everyting from our past
Just to see it something somehow...
Let's erase everything
Something, somehow, anything...
I don't want us to die...

Replacing winter by summertime
We will never change, we know it,
but we could try...
Replacing winter by summertime
We will never change, we know it,
but we could try...---Lyrics submitted by Jules.
