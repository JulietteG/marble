So here, yes here we stand
Clenching our hands
Backed up, backed up against the wall

These times they move too fast
I'm left in the past
But those things, those things never last

I don't really wonder why
Some things live & some things die
I don't really think about what it's really all about

And I say yes (and i say yes)
We'll show them all (oooooooooo)
we'll show them all (we'll show them all)
Some things never fall
And i say yes (and i'll say yes)
we'll show them all (ooooooooooo)
we'll show them all (we'll show them all)
somethings never fall

My friends they're all left for dead
The words they said
They ain't so easy to forget

My mind just slips away
My brain decays
I'm getting dumber every day

I don't really wonder why
Some things live & some things die
I don't really think about what it's really all about

And I say yes (and i say yes)
we'll show them all (oooooooooo)
we'll show them all (we'll show them all)
some things never fall
and i say yes (and i say yes)
we'll show them all (oooooooooo)
we'll show them all (we'll show them all)
some things never fall
And I say yes (and i say yes)
we'll show them all (oooooooooo)
We'll show them all (we'll show them all)
some things never fall
and i say yes (and I say yes)
we'll show them all (ooooooooo)
some things never fall
and i say yes (and I say yes)
we'll show them all (ooooooooooo)
we'll show them all (we'll show them all)
some things never fall
and i say yes (and i say yes)
we'll show them all (ooooooooo)
we'll show them all (we'll show them all)
some things never fall---Lyrics submitted by Ben.
