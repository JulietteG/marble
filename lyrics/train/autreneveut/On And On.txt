Babe, do what you want
 You've gotta carry your light
 Then your doubt be all worth while
 And you said:
 "Felt like time was the place to be..."
 Your faith goes on and on
 This race goes on and on,
 On and on, babe.

Babe, do what you want
 You've gotta carry your light
 But then your doubt be all worth while
 And you said:
 "Felt like the time and space to be..."
 Your faith goes on and on
 This race goes on and on,
 On and on, babe.

Babe, do what you want
 You've gotta carry your light
 But then your doubt be all worth while
 And you said:
 "Felt like time was a waste of me..."
 Your faith goes on and on
 This race goes on and on,
 On and on, babe.

babe, do what you want
You've gotta carry your light
Then your doubt be all worth while
And you said:
"Felt like time was the place for me..."
Your faith goes on and on
This race goes on and on, 
On and on, babe.

Oh I love the way you make me think
Push me harder baby babe
Push me harder baby babe
Push me harder babe
Love the way you make me feel
Push me harder baby babe
Push me harder baby babe
Don't wanna make it up baby

But first babe, do what you want
You've gotta carry your light
But then the doubt be all worth while
And you said:
"Feels like I've got the fantasy..."
Your faith goes on and on
This place goes on and on
On and on, oh... girl.
