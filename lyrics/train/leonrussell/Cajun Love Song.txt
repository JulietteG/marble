Woah, mama cancha leave me fishin,
Papa, catched too
Well, back in the bayou it's-a fishin' time
Workin' together on a bottle of wine
We'll go down toTippydoe tonight

**Chorus**
Go roun', go roun', lil' Alice Bluegown
We'll soon be together on the bayou sundown
We'll jaw jambalaya, and sing all night long
Me and my baby and a cajun love song

Now I can't remember when Alice first came
From Lake Charles to see me at Ponchetrain
But my heart beats slower when she not around
The best things in life not the same

**Chorus**
Go roun', go roun', lil' Alice Bluegown
We'll soon be together on the bayou sundown
We'll jaw jambalaya, and sing all night long
Me and my baby and a cajun love song

Sometimes I get lonely and I'm hurtin' inside
When my Alice can't understand
Like a dancer I saw in New Orlean' one time
She makes me feel just like a man

**Chorus**
Go roun', go roun', lil' Alice Bluegown
We'll soon be together on the bayou sundown
We'll jaw jambalaya, and sing all night long
Me and my baby and a cajun love song

**instrumental**

**Chorus**
Go roun', go roun', lil' Alice Bluegown
We'll soon be together on the bayou sundown
We'll jaw jambalaya, and sing all night long
Me and my baby and a cajun love song---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
