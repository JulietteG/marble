Come on in,
Talk baby
I'm all alone another night
Where've you been pretty, pretty baby
Don't wanna hear another lie

Open up,
Talk to me,
Don't be afraid to speak your mind.
Come on in, (settle down, settle down)
Come on in baby (settle down)

You got to talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
You got to talk to me
You got to let me know what's on your mind

Need to know
Hey darling
What's going on
Things ain't right
I hear your friends whispering baby
It don't take long 'cause the rumors fly
I want to know
Talk to me
I'm losing all my self control
So come on in baby, (settle down, settle down)
Come on in darling (settle down)

You know you got to talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
You got to talk to me
You got to let me know what's on your mind

Tell me what's on your mind oh baby

You know that I've been waiting
You've got to talk to me
You'd better use persuasion
That will keep me from setting you free
You've got to talk

What's on your mind
I just don't know
I've been wondering what to do what to say
We can solve any problem
Just open up and communicate

So come on in, (settle down, settle down)
I want you to come on in baby (settle down) ohh

You got to talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
Talk to me
You got to let me know what's on your mind

Talk I want you to talk
Talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
Talk
Just talk
Why don't you talk to me
You've got to tell me what is on your mind
Baby talk , talk to me
You got to let me know whats on you mind
Talk
Drive me crazy
Talk
I want you to
Talk
Talk
Talk
I want you to
Talk---
