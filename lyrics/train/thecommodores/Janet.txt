Mmm...hmm...hmm...mmm...hmm...mmm...
Mmm...mmm...

Tearin' me apart
Somehow I just joined in
She's playing with my heart
But Janet's so aware

And people tell me, "She keeps telling you lies"
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it
I believe in Janet

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet
Oh, Janet

There could never be
Another girl like Janet
It's only her and me
Together on this planet

And people tell me, "She keeps telling you lies"
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh, yeah
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it
I believe in Janet

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet
Oh, Janet

Why can't they see
Without her there'd be
No reason to go on and on

As long as she stays with me
I'll keep holdin' on
I believe in Janet

I believe in Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet, Ja-Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong---
