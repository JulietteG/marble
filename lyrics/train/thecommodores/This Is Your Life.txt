Do what you wanna do
So much in life to see you through
Be what you wanna be
Be strong and tell the world you're free

I see the children of the world
Searching to find themselves and who they are
So many roads for them to choose, yeah
So many ways for them to win or lose

Oh, this is your life
Oh...oh...yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah
This is your life
Yeah, yeah

I'll see you there
Dyin' in your wisdom
Where do you go, tell me
Where do you go

Just see the light
Shine through your window
Why can't you see, tell me now
Why can't you see

I'm longin' to see
If your search will find
Ah, peace of mind
Well...peace of mind

If this is your life (Yeah, yeah)
This is your life, yeah, yeah
This is your life, yeah, yeah
This is your life, yeah, yeah
This is your life, yeah, yeah---
