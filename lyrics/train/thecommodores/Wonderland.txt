Hello, honey, this is your lucky day
I've come to take you far, far away
We'll use love as our guide to the stars
And if I'm lucky I'll put a thrill in your heart

Come into (whoa, baby) this Wonderland of mine (This Wonderland of mine, girl)
(And I'll take control of your beautiful mind)
I can't tell you (Girl) just what to expect (Some times I don't know myself)
(Whoa, the joy you give is the pleasure you get)

Won't you come into this land of love (Come on, baby)
Won't you come into this love with me (Oh...)
(Won't you come into this love of mine)
It's for you and for me (Yeah)

Mr. Taxi driver, could you give us a ride
And take us down to, oh, Paradise Drive
Hurry, won't you hurry 'cause I just can't wait
Oh, one minute lost might be one minute too late

Sugar, don't you be afraid, no, no
Just take me by the hand and I'll show you the way
Ooh

Ooh...hoo...yeah
(It's for you and for me)
It's for you, baby
All I need, all I ever needed was you

Whoa, girl, let me take you to a (Wonderland)
Got so many thing we can do, girl
(It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's gonna be in Wonderland)
(It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's gonna be in Wonderland)---
