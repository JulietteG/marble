I seem to think I think I got a little situation
So listen to me sister listen maybe you can help
I think I gave a lot of problems my consideration
But not for me they always seem to be for someone else

Why all the people always seem to just be on vacation
What do I get from never touching anything at all
Im like a trash can holding all the information
And every single time Im in the field to be taught

Salute your solution, now, salute your solution

I find myself just looking worthy of my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda pause I might receive at all
All others seem to find a road thats tough to satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isnt cool for me at all

And if theres one little answer to this complication
Someone somewhere some help me settle what is on my mind
Theres only one Im only taking getting and receiving
Theres only one Im taking
And only one Im taking

And only one Im taking
And only one Im taking
And only one Im taking
And only one

And I got what I got all despite you
And I get what I get just to spite you

And I got what I got all despite you
And I get what I get just to spite you

And I got what I got all despite you
And I get what I get just to spite you

I find myself just looking worthy of my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda pause I might receive at all
And all the others seem to find myself a satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isnt cool for me at all

But if theres one little answer to this complication
Someone somewhere some help me settle what is on my mind
Theres only one Im only taking getting and receiving
Theres only one Im taking
And only one Im taking

And only one Im taking
And only one Im taking
And only one Im taking
And only one---Lyrics submitted by Eduardo.
