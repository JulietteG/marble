CHORUS
Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky
I hope to go back to those hills before i die
Will my old friends be waiting for me buy and buy
Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky

By day i work down in the coal mines
Loading the cars when they roll
Each night when i sit by my window
I dream about the days of old

Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky
I hope to go back to those hills before i die
Will my old friends be waiting for me buy and buy
Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky

I sell my gold watch for a ticket
Back to the hills of Caroline
And find my dear redded sweetheart
With lips as sweet as cherry wine

Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky
I hope to go back to those hillls before i die
Will my old friends be waiting for me buy and buy
Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky

Is my home still up there
Where the pines touch the sky---Lyrics submitted by michael thomas.
