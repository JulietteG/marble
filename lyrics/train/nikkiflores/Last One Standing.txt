If its swords and guns or words and lies
Theyve got equal strength taking lives

Till you raise your hands
Im gonna keep on fighting
Till the last one stands

Father mother

Prepare your surrender 
And lay your weapons on the ground
But dont wait for my  vengance

Ill take you one.. by one
Till Im the---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Bojanic.
