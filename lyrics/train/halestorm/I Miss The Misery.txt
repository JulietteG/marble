Ohh, I miss the misery!!!
ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
I've been a mess since you stayed
I've been a wreck since you changed
Don't let me get in your way, I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm telling you!
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me,
I miss the screaming, the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls, when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all!
I like the kick in the face, and the things you do to me!
I love the way that it hurts!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!
Oh oh oh oh
I tried but I just can't take it
I'd rather fight than just fake it (cause I like it rough)
You know that I've had enough,
I dare ya to call my bluff,
Can't take too much of a good thing,
I'm tellin you!
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me,
I miss the screaming, the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls, when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all!
I like the kick in the face, and the things you do to me!
I love the way that it hurts!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!
Just know that I'll make you hurt,
I miss the lies and the pain, what you did to me
When you tell me you'll make it worse
(I'd rather fight all night than watch the TV)
I hate that feelin inside
You tell me how hard you'll try
But when we're at our worst, I miss the misery
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screaming, the way the way that you blame me
I miss the rough sex, leaves me a mess,
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest
Miss the phone callss, when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all!
I like the kick in the face,and the things you do to me!
I love the way that it hurts!
Don't miss you, I miss the misery!
I don't miss you, I miss the misery!---Lyrics submitted by Layla Winters.
