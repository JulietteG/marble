I walked away,
From everyone I know.
I looked around and thought...
This must be what it's like to be alone.

Awareness fell on me,
(my bones, my bones)
I felt my ribs.
(my bones, my bones)
I'm mud, I'm mud,
Everybody thinks I'm calm.

Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave.
(you gotta be..)

Don't seem like no choice to me.

Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave.
(you gotta be..)

Don't seem like no choice to me.

Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave.
(you gotta be..)

Don't seem like no choice to me.

I walked away,
(I walked away)
From everyone I know.
(I walked away)
I looked around and thought...
This must be what it's like be alone.

Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave,
(you gotta be brave)
Oh I had to be brave.
(you gotta be..)

Don't seem like no choice to me.---Lyrics submitted by Jared Cason.
