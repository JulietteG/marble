How I wish for a flame that never dies
Like a candle & its flame bring back the light
You put on your shoes of lightning
You put on your shoes and run
Youll be the lightning bolt
So put them on

Put on your shoes of fire
Put on your shoes that burn
If you get burned, my love
Well thats exactly how you learn

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
You put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run

Theres always an ugly duckling
Theres always an ugly one
Give her a chance to grow
Into a pretty, pretty one

Theres always a mean machine
Theres always a beauty queen
Always so many fools
That dont care about the other ones

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Put them on
Let them run

Zap away on your tv
Things that you dont wanna see
Get your head out of your ass
Ignorance is such bliss
Dont you stand there like the rest
Without a heart youll finish last
Without a heart youll finish last

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
You put on your shoes of lightning
Put them on
You put them on

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run

Bring on the day to come
And wear it like its a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run

I wish for a flame that never dies
Like a candle & its flame bring back the light---
