What did you say?
I heard soluble words
They fell out of your face 
Then fell back to earth
Inaudible sounds
Get carried away
I know your game you've got nothing to say

Is there something you can tell me 
That could make me hear the call
Everything I've heard you say is 
Sleepier than seconal
How can pretend to think 
That what you say is meaningful
Everytime I look inside there's nothing but an empty hole

What did you say?
I heard questionable sounds
They dropped out of your mouth
Then fell to the ground
What are you fighting for?
What could it be?
I don't know but
I don't think you mind all the extra money

Is there something you can tell me 
That could make me hear the call
Everything I've heard you say is 
Sleepier than seconal
How can pretend to think 
That what you say is meaningful
Everytime I look inside there's nothing but an empty hole

What did you say
I heard questionable sounds
They dropped out of your mouth
Then fell to the ground

Is there something you can tell me 
That could make me hear the call
Everything I've heard you say is 
Sleepier than seconal
How can pretend to think 
That what you say is meaningful
Everytime I look inside there's nothing but an empty hole (repeat)

An empty hole

I can't afford o let you down
There's nothing here but broken sounds
I'll leave the tape beside your door 
On my way home (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by diane.
