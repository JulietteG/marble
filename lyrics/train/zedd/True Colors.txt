Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins, letting go again
I'm not afraid, I'm not

All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
No I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow

A promise with the light, is broken by design
What we thought we knew, has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame, right before it rains
I'm not afraid, I'm not

Something tells me, I know nothing at all
We've escaped our capture
Yet we have our masters
And somehow it's like I've waited---
