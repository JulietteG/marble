I'm digoxin from the foxglove plant
The last remaining VX from Anniston
I'm an ACN and I'm DDT
Tap into your spine
I am a chemistry

It's a gas, a sarin for high tea
A C4H10FO2P puts you on your knees
A sulfur dichloride with ethylene
I say it again: I am a chemistry

She doesn't need my help poisoning the well beneath the rue leaves
She only needs my help pleasuring herself beneath the rue leaves

My mama told me not to fool with oleander
And never handle the deadly quaker buttons again
My mama told me not to fool with oleander
And never handle the deadly quaker buttons again
My mama told me not to fool with oleander
And never handle the deadly quaker buttons again

I am chemistry
I am chemistry
I am chemistry
I am chemistry
(When you least expect it) I am chemistry
(That is when you get it) I am chemistry
(When you least expect it) I am chemistry
(That is when you get it) I am chemistry---
