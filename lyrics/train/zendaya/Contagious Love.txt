(with Bella Thorne)

[Bella (Verse 1):]
It might rain just a little but
Yeah we dance in it
Rock to the rhythm
And we put our hands with it
One live to live
So we live it to the fullest
Young and free yeah you know
How we do it

[Zendaya:]
Head in the clouds
And the sun shines bright
Hope in your eyes
And it shines that light
Gravity itself couldnt hold you down
Joy inside in the merry go-round

[Bella:]
And we bring it right back
Positive energy magnetic attract
Ha ha so we spread that love
Now everybody show it now
Do it all together now

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need Contagious Love

[Bella:]
And Ill be happy with just
Enough lemme get that Contagious Love like

[Zendaya:]
Give me up somelove
Everybody need Contagious Love

[Bella:]
And Ill be happy with just
Enough gimme gimme that Contagious Love like

[Bella (Verse 2):]
It was smiles over frowns
And we laugh without reason
Live out loud
Cause our hearts still beating
Sing on the elevator
Watch how people stare
Capture reaction the moments
Still there

[Zendaya:]
These are the times
That we live for
So do it big make it count
Reel it in slow
Cause the clock dont stop
Time wont stand still
Youre still every moment that you can feel

[Bella:]
Ha ha so we spread that love
Now everybody show it now
Do it all together now [x2]

[Chorus:]
[Zendaya:]
Give me up some love
Everybody need Contagious Love

[Bella:]
And Ill be happy with just
Enough lemme get that Contagious Love like

[Zendaya:]

Everybody need Contagious Love

[Bella:]
And Ill be happy with just
Enough gimme gimme that Contagious Love

[Zendaya (Verse 3):]
You aint gotta worry
About a thing
Itll be alright

[Bella:]
And itll be alright

[Zendaya:]
You aint gotta worry

[Bella:]
It might rain just a little but
Yeah we dance in it
Rock to the rhythm
And we put our hands with it
One live to live
So we live it to the fullest
Young and free yeah you know
