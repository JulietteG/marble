Steppin' out the doorhere waiting on for something to happen like oh yeah
Brush up on the scene like where in about a magazine like oh yeah
Souped up from head to toe
Keep yours, we got out own
Can't tell us nothin'
Oh we do what we want like oh yeah
Cause we gonna get it poppin' poppin'
That's that reason why you talkin' talkin'
You say we killin' it? stop it stop it

Baby we're too much, much to handle
Understand it when we turn it up
Too much, much to handle
Yeah we're just too much

Can you get it?
You don't get it babe
You'll never gonna get it babe

Too much, much to handle (hey)

You don't get it babe
You'll never gonna get it babe
