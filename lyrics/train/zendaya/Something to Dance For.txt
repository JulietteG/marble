A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When its a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

Hey yeah, yeah,
Oh oh, this is something you dance for

Theres a moment when you look to decide
Who will fall, who will survive
Thats the moment when you find it inside
On the line, this is your time

And its all I want
And its all I do

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When its a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

Can you believe it, are you feeling alive?
Pick your mark, ready to rise
Your bodys aching, but your heart doesn't mind
Feet on the ground, eyes on the prize

And its all I want
And its all I do

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When its a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for
[x2]

For the love
For the fame
To bring down the rain
By the way that you feel
When theyre calling your name
For the days
Nothing more
Its just you on the floor

Oh this is something you dance for

A dream like this
Not something you wish for
A dream like this
Not something you ask for
When its a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for
Then This is something to dance for.---Lyrics submitted by cassandra.
