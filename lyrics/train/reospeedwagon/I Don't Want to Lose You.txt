You left this mornin' on an early plane
You left your picture behind to haunt me
You left in a steady rain
You say, you'll miss me, you say, you want me

I'm left this mornin' with a world of doubt
I'm left this mornin' indecently exposed
So much we never did talk about
And your kiss goodbye, said the case is closed

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found
Don't want to lose you
Why didn't I cry when you said goodbye
Why didn't I break down, break down and say
I don't want to lose you

We met last night in a public place
And your new lover was just across the street
But tears washed across your face
Girl, I wanted to hold you close to me

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found
Don't want to lose you
Why didn't I cry when you said goodbye
Why didn't I break down, break down

I remember all the things that we did
The warmth of your smile and your tender touch
I always knew I cared about you, girl
I just didn't know how much

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found
Don't want to lose you
Why didn't I cry when you said goodbye

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found
Don't want to lose you
Why didn't I cry when you said goodbye

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found
Don't want to lose you
Why didn't I cry when you said goodbye

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found---
