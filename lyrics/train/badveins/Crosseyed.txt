Help me,
Can you help me?
I am lost without you.
Tell me,
Can you tell me?
How to get out from between,
What I say and what I mean.
Cause I cant take it back.
Ones who say,
I cant take it down.
Now in between the sky.

But if thered be a perfect time to try,
Right now Im standing here,
And staring right between my eye.
I will follow through and I will tell the truth.
I would be lying if I said I never hated you.

How do,
How do I do?
What it is that Im supposed to.
Not supposed to.
Go all crosseyed.
Silent sea,
What is right for you and me?

But if there'd ever a perfect time to try,
Right now Im standing here,
And staring right between my eye.
I will follow through and I will tell the truth.
I would be lying if I said I never hate it too.

But if thered ever be a perfect time to try,
Right now Im standing here,
And staring right between my eyes.
And I'll follow through and I will tell the truth.
But I would be lying if I said I never hated you.---Lyrics submitted by dylan.
