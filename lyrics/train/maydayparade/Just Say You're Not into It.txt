A show of hands, who has said these words before?
With a show of hearts on the floor, who has ever meant them more ?
Well I'll swallow my pride if you'll stay for the years 
And watch me spin circles as I disappear 
and hearts, they don't lie they just quiver in fear 
As you say 

Tonight we, forget everything 
And stay the night 
If I was wrong then I'm sorry 
I'll stop this fight 
For the night 
And this empty space left in the seat 
To my right where you should be 
says a lot 

Don't let it say goodbye 
Don't let it say goodbye, let it say goodbye.

forget everything 
and we stay the night
if i was wrong then i'm sorry.
I'll stop this fight for the night.

and this empty space left in the seat
to my right where you should be 
says a lot

And today I know
that tomorrow is going to shine again golden
and bring our hearts back home 

And today i know
that tomorrow is going to shine again golden
and bring our hearts back home

(And today i know, meant nothing)
And today meant nothing,

(that tomorrow will shine again golden)
because youre gone
And I swear that this meant everything to me,
(And bring our hearts back home)

 because my hearts not home---Lyrics submitted by kaytee.
