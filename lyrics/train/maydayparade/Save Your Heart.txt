She fell to the bottom of her life
This wasnt meant for two
She struggles to find herself in time
But she can barely move

Just try and get up
You gotta slowly brush off
I know that words arent enough
But you're better than this

Save your heart
For someone thats worth dying for
Dont give it away
Torn apart
Never getting what you've been crying for
Its always the same

She turns the pages everyday
Just to change the mood
But every chapter reads the same
Its so hard to make it through

Just try and get up
You gotta slowly brush off
I know that words arent enough
But you're better than this

Save your heart
For someone thats worth dying for
Dont give it away
Torn apart
Never getting what you've been crying for
Its always the same

And you give
And you take
And its love that you want
But not love that you make
Save your heart
For someone thats worth dying for
Dont give it away

Save your heart for someone who leaves you breathless
And I know that you're scared
Seems like someone said you had it in you
All along you said you knew this felt wrong
But not worth dying for

And you give
And you take
And its love that you want but not love that you make
Save your heart
For someone thats worth dying for
Dont give it away
Dont give it away---Lyrics submitted by Diane.
