Baby, I sorely miss the vibrant gleam that's in your eyes
I'll write a song about it
And maybe if the melody's just right
I hope tonight it will find you
It will remind you

But what's holding me back is the thought of time we never had
My world's hanging by three words that I can't bear to say

When you hear this chorus
Do you miss the way the world was spinning for us?
Do you hurt the way that I do?
After all this time you leave me broken
This song is every word I left unspoken
When you hear this, girl, I'm hoping that you think of us
That you think of us

Baby, I told myself that I'll be fine but it's a lie
I don't want to talk about it
Memories, oh they cut like knives
Deep inside I'm falling
Baby, catch me if you can

What's holding me back is the thought of time we never had
My world's hanging by three words that I can't bear to say

When you hear this chorus
Do you miss the way the world was spinning for us?
Do you hurt the way that I do?
After all this time you leave me broken
This song is every word I left unspoken
When you hear this, girl, I'm hoping that you think of us

When you hear this chorus
Do you miss the way the world was spinning for us?
Do you hurt the way that I do?
After all this time you leave me broken
This song is every word I left unspoken
When you hear this, girl, I'm hoping that you think of us
That you think of us

Baby, I sorely miss the vibrant gleam that's in your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa Weddell.
