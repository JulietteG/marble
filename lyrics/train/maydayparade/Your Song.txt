you say that gainesville's got no soul
well that sounds like a good excuse for coming home
and all these tallahassee skylines, they keep singing out a song
i know it's your song they've been singing all night long
and this galley alley rooftop just keeps calling out your name to come and stay, so stay

(don't go) stay and watch the stars come out and then the sun as they all fade away
i'll sing you every song i know if it'll make you want to stay
and then i'll say
that i missed you
and these words
they'll convince you

i poured through every song i wrote
every line that i've cried every note that was spilt with this pen 
and every line in every song, they all seemed to come out wrong,
until your song

so lets sing it all night long
and this tallahassee skyline hasn't changed
while the view from every rooftop says to stay

stay and watch the stars come out and then the sun as they all fade away
ill sing you every song i know if it'll make you want to stay
and it'll say, that i missed you, and these words, they'll convince you

and i could call you baby doll all the time
and you'd whisper in my ears you'd say i miss you boy
now sing it over again, and over again, and over again,

and i could call you baby doll all the time
and you'd whisper in my ears, you'd say i miss you boy
now sing it over again and over again, and over again---Lyrics submitted by Summer.
