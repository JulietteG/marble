Jessie says she's been here for a thousand days
a thousand days to her that just don't mean a thing
Because the city makes a perfect place to sleep

And daddy's coming home he said he brought her things
Like jewels from every coast and songs for them to sing
But singing never got her very far, and this whole coast is full of prenup paper rock stars

She says she'll fun until her feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out, well keep listening she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night
And she'll be a secret you can keep, keep me, keep me

Cuts on paper hearts they can be awful deep
Rips from wear and tear on different city streets
They don't all need a home but just a place to sleep

So i will run until my feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out,well keep listening she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night
And she'll be a secret can you keep,  keep me, keep me
And soon she'll find that every time she runs she leaves behind
Another piece of her on every city street

So i will run until my feet don't touch the ground
As the waves carry me out, keep listening

So i will run until my feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out,well keep listening she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night
And she'll be a secret you can keep, keep me, keep me

So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night
And she'll be a secret can keep, she says keep me
Keep me---Lyrics submitted by Haley.
