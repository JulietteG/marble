Girls, please, please,
allow my voice to calm you down.
Boys understand,
girls will never listen or learn.

I was old enough to know better,
Young enough to still decide,
That it was worth my time for something beautiful.
I finally found my voice,
it's something that's worth writing down.
with a picture perfect memory of your body, your body.

Girls, please, please,
allow my voice to calm you down.
Boys understand,
girls will never listen or learn.
and I'll sing so sweet
hold a spindle by my tongue,
cause girls never listen.

She was young enough to fall in love
Naive enough to think she wanted out,
It wasn't worth her time for something beautiful.
You say love, she says maybe.
I say please, she says baby, "it's not you, I'm just out of my head."
Her body, her body.

Girls, please, please,
allow my voice to calm you down.
Boys understand,
girls will never listen or learn.
and I'll sing so sweet
hold a spindle by my tongue,
cause girls never listen.

Speak low,
Can you keep this a secret?
Tell me your lies and I will tell of mine.
Whisper sweetly, while you touch me gently,
I'm out of my mind.
(Speak low)
We're not 21, it's time that we had some fun,
(Speak low)
We're not 21,
(cause girls never listen)
We're not 21, it's time that we had some fun,
We're not 21,
(cause girls never listen)
We're not 21, it's time that we had some fun,
We're not 21. ---
