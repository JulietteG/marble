I know I've got my problems and it starts with me.
She saw something inside that I can't see.
And late at night, yeah, she'll comfort me.
Hold onto me, hold onto me.

I got a nervous habit, and I drink too much.
She said she hates her life,
And wants to change her ways.
She wakes in the night and whispers oh so quiet,
"Hold onto me, hold onto me.
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave."
I know I got my problems and it's probably me,
So hold onto me, hold onto me.

I stay up too late, and it hurts to breathe.
I said, "It's 4 a.m., girl, go back to sleep."
Sometimes at night I can hear her dreams.
"Come rescue me, come rescue me.
And don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave."
I know we've got our problems and it's probably me.
So hold onto me, hold onto me.

I'm a drifter's body and an open sea.
And I see my reflection staring right back at me
With no place to go and you're left all alone,
There's no place like home.

Hold onto me, hold onto me.
And just stay with me, just stay with me.
I know we got our problems and you'll probably leave,
So hold onto me, hold onto me.
I could never leave, I will never leave.
So hold onto me, hold onto me.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
