3 years is something I call love
When the phone calls and photographs were never enough
To save the heart that's been broken
That's so close to screaming.
This can't be happening, I must be dreaming.

What's the worst that can happen?
I never knew when all I ever wanted
Was to get away from you.
And now the possible's impossible and I can't refuse.
Grab all your drinks and raise all your glasses.

Let's toast to the lucky ones,
To the girl that just broke my heart.

I can't breathe after all that you told me.
You took my heart and made me melt again.

I could never imagine we'd end up this way
After all that we went through.
Now I'm fighting through the pain.
It's like this heart that's been broken
Is so close to screaming
Was ripped from my chest
And I can't stop the bleeding.

Now we all fall for the bad ones
Who just break us cause we're so young,
Dumb and vulnerable, young and vulnerable.

Here's a toast to the lucky ones,
To the girl that just broke my heart.

You ripped apart these pages.
I can't breathe
Our book was overrated.
After all that you've told me.
This brings up all these questions.
Tell me what just happened.
You took my heart and made me melt again.

I put your picture in a frame
That stands at the side of my bed.
So whenever I get sad, I can stare at your face
And hope and pray that I won't forget
When all that I know is talking is cheap,
And your lies were expensive.
And God only knows when I come to my senses.
Now I can't breathe at all.
Now I can't breathe.

Here's a toast to the lucky ones.
Here's a toast to the lucky ones.
To the girl that just broke my heart.
You ripped apart these pages.
I can't breathe
Our book was overrated.
After all that you told me.
This brings up all these questions,
Tell me what happened.
You took my heart and made me melt again.
I'll say

You ripped apart these pages.
I cant breathe-
Our book was overrated.
After all that youve told me.
This brings up all these questions.
Tell me what happened.
You took my heart and made me melt again.
Ill say.
Tell me what just happened.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
