It happens every time.
If it counts, I'll lose my courage when I need it the most.
Then it comes crawling up after,
Begs me to ask her what I already know.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold."
If I promise that I take you there with me,
Would you go?
I found in one step, I'll get closer
To heaven than you'll ever know.
You may never know.

Feel it out again.
Go and try to be a man
When there's a gun to your head.
After you found out your good enough
Wasn't good enough for everyone else.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold.
Pull me right up by the fire
And I'll show you what home means now."
The words came with a new kind of sadness
That mean everything.
You mean everything to me.

I'll take the first train out of this town
With a glare in my eye,
And my pockets full, ready to die.
And when I get hazy, I will think just maybe
You're out there somewhere.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold."
If I promise that I take you there with me,
Would you go?
I found in one step, I'll get closer
To heaven than you'll ever know.
You may never know.

Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold.
Pull me right up by the fire
And I'll show you what home means now."
The words came with a new kind of sadness
That mean everything.
You mean everything to me.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
