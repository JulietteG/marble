I'm burned out like a bright light,
I wasn't ready for this. 
You're adorable as Hell,
but I'm glancing at your wrist.

Oh, please have faith,
I can be so cavalier.
And when they start to ask questions,
I'll make sure to be clear.

When you see my friends, tell them hi for me.
Tell them what you think about the way you handled everything.
You turned and all you left me with this broken key.
So, tell me what you think.

Give it up for the long nights,
and all those terrible fights.
Were you honest with yourself?
Every version of yourself?

Did you get lost on the side of the road?
If you keep acting this way,
I swear I'll never come home.

When you see my friends, tell them hi for me.
Tell them what you think about the way you handled everything.
We walk alone on this broken road for eternity.
So, give me company and help me sing this lonely melody.

You turned, and all you left me with was this broken key.
So, tell me what you think.

Sign me up, no regrets.
Make a man out of me.
And I won't say a word,
and I'll give all the things you want and I need.

Just give me some peace.
At the bottom of the ocean, there's a place for you and me.
Lead the way, straight ahead.
You gave me the time of my life and cut like a knife to the bone.

When you see my friends, tell them hi for me.
Tell them what you think about the way you handled everything.
So neat and clean while the world is full of such pretty things.
So, do you best for me.---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
