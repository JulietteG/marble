Hey, my walls keep coming down, but I stand brave.
Love is just an empty word you say.
I found loyalty and it was pain.
And you hate God keeps coming down cause you're afraid
Lucifer just might be your middle name.
You're the only angel that got away.

And we're all alone now
With nothing to stand in our way.
Don't swear that it's over.
If love is our secret, I know you won't keep it.
We're taking this easy
Cause, darling, it's what dreams are made of.
This story is probably made up,
So why don't you go back to sleep?

Hey, walls keep tumbling down, but I stand brave.
Maybe I'm the one who's in your way.
I'm the only reason love got away.
Love got away.

And we're all alone now.
Yeah, I'll be alright.
With nothing to stand in our way.
Yeah, I'll be just fine.
Don't swear that it's over.
Don't leave me guessing.
If love is our secret,
I know you won't keep it.

We're taking this easy
Cause, darling, that's what dreams are made of.
This story is probably made up,
So why don't you go back to sleep?
Just like you never do.
Why don't you dream about me?
Just like we always do.
Cause I'm the reason you're alone now.
Quit blaming everything on your hometown.
Why would you say that?

Oh, oh, oh, I think you're better off
When you're on your own.
You said you keep me close cause 
I'm the closest thing that you've ever known.
You said the problem's in your heart,
But the problem's who you are.
So leave me alone now.
I'd rather be lonely when I scream
And shout and let it out.

We're taking this easy
Cause, darling, that's what dreams are made of.
This story is probably made up,
So why don't you go back to sleep?
Just like you never do.
Why don't you dream about me?
Just like we always do.
Cause I'm the reason you're all alone now.
Quit blaming everything on your hometown.
Why would you say that?---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
