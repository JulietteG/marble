I catch myself wishing
You were whispering my name
Every star, every scar
Every mark upon my heart
Up and fades away

I feel myself missing
Everything I threw away
Every dream, every scene
Every song we'd ever sing
Got lost in yesterday

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight

Do you find yourself wondering
If I still think about you
Every thought, every step
Every tear and every breath
I swear I do
Yeah, that's all I ever do

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
If I can kiss you tonight

Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
If I can kiss you tonight
If I could kiss you tonight---
