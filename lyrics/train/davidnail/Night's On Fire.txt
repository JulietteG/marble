Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows shes gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, its a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Days gone and the nights on fire

Shes telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nights on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nights on fire

Shes a seat laid back, a boys dream
Drawin hearts in the window steam
Shes a gettin you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what youre headed to
Whats a red blooded boy to do

Shes telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nights on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nights on fire
You try to play it cool but the nights on fire

Shes telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the nights on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the nights on fire
You try to play it cool but the nights on fire

You try to play it cool but the nights on fire---
