Sometimes you don't know what to do or what to say
When someone tells you all their trouble, all their pain
You don't feel like you've got much to offer
That's when you come to Jesus and you lay it on the altar

The burden's not as heavy as you might think it is
He's right there with you beside you time as this

You be the one to answer his call
You be the one to stand up tall
Reaching out to lift them up
With the arms of love when they're feeling small
You be the one to shine the eyes of Jesus
Even when you think that they don't need you
Don't give up until the race is run
You be the one

With a little grace he can heal the broken past
Help you forgive someone who can't forgive you back
Speak a word of kindness, a little comfort for their soul
Sit awhile and cry with them and help them to let it go

Even when it feels like you can't take one more step
So run the road of Jesus and let him do the rest

See them look down in the ground
It grows and ends up
Coming back around
He knew, He'd be the one for you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
