A letter came this morning, it said Mrs. Frankie Shaw.
It had a postmark in the corner:  July, 1944.
It just lay there in the hallway, like some ancient contraband,
And though the ink was brown & faded, I still recognized the hand.

My Frankie was a solider in some politicians' war,
And he believed that king and country was a cause worth fighting for.
And I still see us on the dockside, Frankie's askin' for my hand.
And now through 16 years of anguish, I just let that promise stand.

But there was no grand reunion, there was no glorious event.
I just knelt there in the hallway, as the grieving came and went.
And it was all I could say, it was all I could do.
I fell down on my knees and I wailed for you, how I wailed for you.

A letter came this morning, full of passion and intent.
It said we've had our first encounter, but we barely made a dent.
We're going back again tomorrow, and I'm quaking in my boots.
He said the tension's overwhelming, he said the terror's absolute.

As as I waited for the punchline, you know, the one that never came.
I felt just like a victim, in some poltician's game.
And it was all I could say, it was all I could do.
I fell down on my knees, and I wailed for you, how I wailed for you.

A letter came this morning, and it shook me to the core.
It was a letter from my Frankie, sent in 1944.---Lyrics submitted by Jay Vivian.
