They gon' talk about you
Of course they gon' complain
They're not used to flexing
The spaces are not diamond
And diamonds wait until time and
You feel some type of way
She got shit to say
They gon' say some things that don't
Do nothing but remind me
And if they're bringing up problems

There's no time for it
You wanna tell me how it is
But theres no time for it
You wanna tell me how you feel
But there's no time for it
Do you thing, get your change
By the way dont you think Imma care cause Im not
Got my mind on my money
And the hate dont really matter, nah
There's no time for it
Oh-oh, there's no time for it
No time, no time, no time

I dont care for gossip
What they gonna say?
Just got off the plane
Im strictly focused on commas
And dollars signs in my pockets
So I been out the way
Think Ive been the same
You cant hang today
Theres nothing fake about it
For the ones thats causing me problems

There's no time for it
You wanna tell me how it is
But theres no time for it
You wanna tell me how you feel
But there's no time for it
Do you thing, get your change
By the way dont you think Imma care cause Im not
Got my mind on my money
And the hate dont really matter, nah
There's no time for it
Oh-oh, there's no time for it
No time, no time, no time
There's no time for it
You wanna tell me how it is
But theres no time for it
You wanna tell me how you feel
But there's no time for it
Do you thing, get your change
By the way dont you think Imma care cause Im not
Got my mind on my money
And the hate dont really matter, nah
There's no time for it
(I dont have no time)
There's no time for it
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
No time, no time, no time

No time, no time
No time, no time
I got no time
Can I get one time if youre outstanding
One time if you get filthy
Bitch, no time for the haters tripping
No time for the haters tripping
Can I get one time if youre outstanding
One time if you get filthy
Bitch, no time for the haters tripping
No time for the haters tripping

There's no time for it
You wanna tell me how it is
But theres no time for it
You wanna tell me how you feel
But there's no time for it
Do you thing, get your change
By the way dont you think Imma care cause Im not
Got my mind on my money
And the hate dont really matter, nah
There's no time for it
(Have no time for it, no time for it)
No time, no time, no time---
