A shadow in these walls, yeah that is all I am
A prison deep under fortress grounds where they spill the blood of man
A second chance at life is all I've dreamed of
For now inside these walls I stay

Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow
(Nevermind what is underneath the stone)
(It's a life that we're living all alone)
Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow
(Light is calling from the narrow road)

Sometimes kindness speaks in tongues with one of them
I can see love in her eyes
And if I fall death will never stain one of his hands
I find safety in these lies.
A second chance at life is all I've dreamed of
For now inside these walls I stay

Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow
(Nevermind what is underneath the stone)
(This life we live alone)
Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow
(Light is calling from the narrow road)

The chains are part of me
Stale air is all I breathe down here
I need to find a way
I've gotta find my way far from me
Another chance at life is fading slowly
Upon the cross I bleed

Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow
(Nevermind what is underneath the stone)
(This life we live alone)
Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow
(Light is calling from the narrow road)

Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow
Nevermind what is underneath the stone, we live alone
Step out in the rain to feel the deep sorrow
Light is calling from the narrow road---
