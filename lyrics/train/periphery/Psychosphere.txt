Silence is bringing on the heart attack
Pushing and pulling going on within my brain says
To lay low
(To lay low)

Dead end, the darkness latches on now I am
A product of a mind that was never mine and now it says
Kill them slow
(Kill them slow)

Weighed down, Im drowning in this stale moment
Free now and shelling at me from above
This is a one way road
Kill them slow

Long ago I was forced to drag
Now I long for a taste
Of what stains the martyr in red
Think back to the moment of a distant memory

Strip away all the empathetic
Feeling towards our will thats grown up
Ascend up, O my love

Sadistic horror
(Horror)

Dead end, the darkness latches on now I am
A product of a mind that was never mine and now it says
Kill them slow
(Kill them slow)

Weighed down, Im drowning in this stale moment
Free now and shelling at me from above
This is a one way road
Kill them slow

Stop fucking pulling, would you release the grip and let go?!
Ive got a life to live and a life to end
I wont give up, leave a bloody mess all around
Bow my head and calmly walk away

Kill them slow---
