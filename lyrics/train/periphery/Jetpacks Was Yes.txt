These walls of time release
My eyes move like the drift
The cries, they resonate within
The fabric tears before me
Break ties between the kin

Reaching for a way out of this dream
I waste my breath ascending
Fears lead me astray
The past brings them to be
Whats left to carry me...

But a memory
The dream endures these lies
Forever at the edge, left surviving alone

Whats left as I wonder
I've found a world where I am free
Inside that which is truth

The ground upon which I have grown is not the same
The fears, they've fallen away
Presently I've found I am not alone in a world of infinity sewn

Perceive beyond the seam
A soul evolves as one---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
