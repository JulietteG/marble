Lost the way
Feel the world below me
Painlessly ascend
Torn away dissolving the life I know
Grasp the light
Feel the glow enfolding
Exaltation
Isolate the answers are truths from lies

Loss of faith
The path unravels before me
Unholy day
I'm letting go

Through time these cries distort the view
Hopeless misdirection
We all defy the chance to know
This world is not the one I knew
Holding tight to our beliefs
Awake to what we have become.

Void the past, create the new
Separate the few because I hold ability to lead
Astray
Now living through every day on the path between
The frozen lines

Now no one ever will know about this experience
Will someone for once step back
And gaze upon the world through my eyes

Drawn behind the point of view
Seal us from the truth
On our own the fear of life decays

Time alone reveals our fatal aspect of arrogance
In life we're not the only ones
Free from the walls I'm alive

Lost the way
The path unravels before me
Unholy day I'm letting go---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
