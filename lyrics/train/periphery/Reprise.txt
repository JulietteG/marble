The screams will echo on a quiet night
Silver faces, an unholy cathedral
Death has come
A sacrifice in this duality
Our blessings given as the children moan
A man is burdened with a life full of evil
Hungry eyes
They will not live to see another day

All in the feeling of a soul within
Set it free in bloody ecstasy
Lie in the circle of a few who stain
(Our bodies with their own blood)---
