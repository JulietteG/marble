As I sit with eyes heavy omens clear
Face down in seclusion the evil steer
What drives the stake within my heart
This man he fell apart
Now that the entrance is open wide
This black all around makes it's way inside
What have you done? Will hate abide?
Where is my death invitation? Elation?

Dead glimpse lurking beneath this prison, I
I give my life for a taste of, taste of
What lies beyond the dead place now
Fire burns rising beneath these sins in time
I leave my life for the void

I have not tried

Survive! I will survive
Collapsed ceilings above drop rage upon them (raging upon them)
Stone cold fist and a memory running on the blunt end of a blade
The blood that is spilled shall start my serenade, to you

I will survive
I will survive
Survive---
