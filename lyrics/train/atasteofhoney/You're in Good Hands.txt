I know youre kind of blue
Cause love aint been good to you
Well, dry your pretty eyes
Those days are through
Hey, youre in good hands now
Youre in good hands

Now, the love you gave went to waste
All the heartaches she made you face
Things will be different now with me in her place
Hey youre in good hands now

If trouble ever comes to you
Ill see you through me and you
And whenever you are down Ill be around
You will never ever need for anything
My love will bring true happiness to you
Cause I, cause I, I realize
Its your heart I have here
So delicate and oh so rare
I promise to handle it with tender loving hands
Hey, youre in good hands now
Yeah

Honey honey honey honey.
Youre in good hands now, baby
Youre in good hands now, baby
Youre in good hands now, baby
Youre in good hands now, baby---Lyrics submitted by melanie vowles.
