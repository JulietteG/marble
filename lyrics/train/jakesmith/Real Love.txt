I am sick of all these conversations
Got me Got me Got me going crazy
Can you feel the drama building
As my voice lingers on
Dont tell me that he needs you
When he doesnt even see you
For who you are

Everybodys got a reason to love
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Everybodys got a reason to
Here it is

He took a walk with weight on His shoulder
It was down a crowded street
Changing history
He gave a dieing world a chance
Yea it was His time but He had you in mind

This is real love
But somethings got to give
When youre trying your best
Not to feel love
But I feel it but I feel it

Its a patient kind of love
Never boasting love
Jealous of nothing love
An unfailing love
Prophecy will fade
Knowledge goes away
Only the perfect things
Out last what life may bring
So you got to know
So you got to show
This love
This love
Cause this is love---Lyrics submitted by Steve Millar.
