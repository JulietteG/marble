There where I've been and the things I've seen
Well I just try remembering
That in their dreams those Kings and Queens
Are feeling just the way I feel

Agi-magic-la-talagy
Agi-magic-la-talagy
Agi-magic-la-talagy
My wish come true

I'm moving up to pastures new
To see it all again anew
It's always and forever true
That this is all I have to do
To get to you

My spell on you

Hocus
Hocus pocus
Out of the realm of a dark material

Opus
New modus
Can't describe adequately
This ethereal dream

Makin' love's only make believe
It's possible to be achieved
If you're brave enough to take the lead
Invention always follows need

I have come to claim my prize
To kiss you on your tired eyes
My hopes and dreams are realised
The moment I've made up my mind

Focus
If I just focus
If I superstitiously believe
This wish will come true
(I wish for you)

Evil eye
I'll keep you by my side
This evil eye
Has powers I would prize
Your strange magic play
Keep me from harm's way
I've witnessed, Eye
It's mystery claim

Gonna put those demons in their place
(Get to know)
Gonna slap myself across the face
(Comings and goin')
Gotta face my demons all the day
(You know it)
The devil's work is made by idle hands
(Comings and goin')

Gonna put them demons in their place
(Get to know it)
Gonna slap myself across the face
(As long as you know it)
Gotta face my demons all the day
(You know it)
The devil's work is made by idle hands
(Comings and goin')
Gonna put those demons in their place

Hocus
Hocus pocus
Cast a spell and hope to hell
The Gods are listening

Ipsus
Calling orders
Out of the heavens we fell
With a formula

Come to

My wish come true---
