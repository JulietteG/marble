We were glass house girls
in a plastic wigs and verse
In a crazy house
from within and from without
You could see right through
see the things that people do
There's no place to hide
when you live from the inside
All the blow
people I guess
from broken homes
never through stars
leave us alone

We were glass house girls
full of drugs or be enburf
build a house of glass
Out of pregnant from the bless
when it so revealed
must be sin to people in
ear angle sister
were aloud to dream
made a new reality
people who live in glass houses
No
Every glass house girls
kept the secret from the world
What you think you see?
A naive transparency
On a stage of glass
how long can that play? (glass)
every glass house child
is a trouble-inside
all the blow
little pieces around broken dreams
schedule in million different places
people live in glass (houses)
people live in glass (houses)
No
all the blow
what you think you see?
a naive transparency
On a stage of glass
how long can that play? (glass)---
