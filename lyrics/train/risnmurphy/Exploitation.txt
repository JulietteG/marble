If you'd lend me your ear
This is a so called true story
We had the time of our lives
Stirring up clouds of scandal.
Freedom, the ultimate freedom,
Then the bombshell hit,
A fiasco!

Who, who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who who who
Who's exploiting who?

Never underestimate,
Creative people and the depths that they will go.
Loneliness,
Cruising at high speed
Ain't that a feeling
You and I know well.
So let the sparks fly,
You and I collide,
Ticking like a time bomb
Til' I receive your reply.

Who, who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who who?
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who
Who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who who?
Who's exploiting who?

I just don't know who.

You're losing your aura
Of invincibility
And your self-effacing modesty
Should leave the money and run
You son of a gun, or
We could go down fighting
Who's exploiting who?

Who, who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who?
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who who who
Who's exploiting who?

Who, who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who who who
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who,
Who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who who?
Who's exploiting who?

Who?---
