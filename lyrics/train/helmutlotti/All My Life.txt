All my life
All the years
That I had spent with you
Were they a dream
Made sweeter by your smile
All of those days I think of now
Wondering when will I see you again


Now and then
I speak out
Just as if you were there
And though the music of your voice
That echoes through my heart 
And cross my mind
Somehow makes the silence easy to bear
But there are times
When I think of what life will be like
When the children are grown
And Im afraid to be alone


Looking at them
I can see everything I treasured in you
They have your way of speaking with their eyes
They have your laughter now and then
I look at them and I see you again


Oh my love 
How I love you 
You just never know
And then my heart 
I just grow old every day that were apart
With all the memories of long ago
And all the beautiful things
That I wanted to say
And it stayed in my head
Somehow never got said


So much to learn
There is so much to learn about love
And Ill wait until then 'til the day 
When I see you again


When will I see you again---Lyrics submitted by BeeLee Gee.
