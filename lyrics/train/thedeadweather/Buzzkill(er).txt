Oh Lord, forget about me
Im doing fine
Oh Lord, forget about me
Let me ride
Oh Lord, Ive got no mind for you
I will not please
No mercy shall be given me
Down in Tennessee
Go

Buzzkill me
Why dont you stop?
Buzzkill

Got my boots and my jacket on
My cash and keys
Got my highs and my lows
And I come and go as I please
Good Lord, I got no time for you
I gotta run
Stop

Buzzkill me
You gotta stop
Buzzkill

Good Lord, wont you forget about me
Im getting mine
Good Lord, wont you forget about me
Let me ride
Oh Lord, I will not follow you
Im in the lead
Oh lord, you will not get to me
Down in Tennessee ---
