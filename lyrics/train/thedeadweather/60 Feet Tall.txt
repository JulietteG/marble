You're so cruel and shameless, but I can't leave you be.
You're so cold and dangerous
Can't leave you be.
You've got the kind of lovin' I need constantly.
Hooked up to my motor all day long.
We got down to Texas,up to Montreal.
Two eyes none the wiser in the deep.
Oh and the water gets hotter, both hands in the deep.
You got my attention,  oh you got it all!

I could take the trouble,
Cause I'm 60 feet tall!

I know it ain't easy.
I must track you people well.
Boy, you come growing like a bat out of hell.
You drive me so reckless, you'll kill us both!

I could take the trouble!
I take you ALL!

I could take the trouble,
Cause I'm 60 feet tall!

You're so cruel and shameless, but I can not leave you be.
So cold and dangerous, but I can't leave you be.
You've got the kind of lovin' I need constantly.

I could take the trouble!
Cause I'm 60 feet tall!---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
