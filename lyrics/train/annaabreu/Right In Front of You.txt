I dont know why
It takes me so that long to get things done
Its like to get into a room but I cant find a way out
And I start feeling down, down
I dont know why
Its so hard to believe
What the world really need is almost next to me
And I still keep searching, keep searching

When everything youve ever been looking for is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you
And everything youve ever been dreaming of is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you
Its now, or it might be never, might be never
And everything youve ever been dreaming of is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you

Im not sure why
I can be so afraid to say goodbye
To the person I used to be when I was a child
I know its right
Im not sure why
Sometimes find its so hard to let go
But things I prevent them from moving along
And Im stuck with suspicious

When everything youve ever been looking for is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you
And everything youve ever been dreaming of is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you
Its now, or it might be never, might be never
And everything youve ever been dreaming of is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you

Give it up, give it up, give it up
But try to get real
Give it up, give it up, give it up
But try to get real
Give it up, give it up, give it up
But try to get real
Give it up, give it up, give it up

When everything youve ever been looking for is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you
And everything youve ever been dreaming of is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you
Its now, or it might be never, might be never
And everything youve ever been dreaming of is there
Right in front of you, right in front of you.---
