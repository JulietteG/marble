Joanie make your mind up,
use your imagination.
You don't wanna wind up
state of agitation.

Joanie take some time out
break communication.
You just gotta sign out
take some medication.

Chorus:
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that.
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that.
It's the same, it's the same,
It's the same old drag.

Joanie I got your message
psychic oscillations.
You're going on a voyage
got no destination.

Chorus:
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that.
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that.
It's the same, it's the same,
It's the same old drag.

Joanie I got your letter
skip the explanation.
Hope you're feeling better
took some medication.

Chorus:

It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that.
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that.
It's the same, it's the same,
It's the same old drag.---Lyrics submitted by Haley Sheehan.
