And the world is made of energy
and the world is electricity
and the world is made of energy
and there's a light inside of you
and there's a light inside of me.

And the world is made of energy
and the world is synchronicity
and the world is made of energy
and there's a light inside of you
and there's a light inside of me.

Its gonna be all right
Its gonna be all right uh huh yeah.
Were gonna see the sunlight
Were gonna see the sunlight uh huh yeah.

And the world is made of energy
and the world is possibility
and the world is made of energy
and there's a light inside of you
and there's a light inside of me.

Its gonna be all right
Its gonna be all right uh huh yeah.
Were gonna see the sunlight
Were gonna see the sunlight uh huh yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Haley Sheehan.
