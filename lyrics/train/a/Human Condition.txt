We got a human condition, nobody wanted to listen
Just want to get a reaction
Nobody wants to be lonley, I am the one and the only
I make a pleasure to know me
When I'm looking in 'cause you're crying out

We got a human condition not like I need your permission to feel like something you step in
I'm not the bloke in the photos,don't hang around at the right shows
I'm gonna fall when I let go
When I'm looking in. Crying out. Just want to be myself....

When I'm in your face. In your face
Don't know what I came here, don't know what I'm doing. In your face

We got a human condition. Beaten into submission
Just want to get a reaction
I am a child of the eighties. Go on and on if you let me
I hope you never forget me
When I'm looking in. Crying out. Just want to be myself.....

When I'm in your face. In your face
Don't know what I came here for, don't know what i'm doing

Don't want to be lonely, I want you to know me
Don't understand me, take me for granted
Don't know what I'm thinking of, don't know why I care

We got a hunman condition...

When I'm in your face. In your face
Don't know what I came here, don't know what I'm doing. In your face
When I'm in your face. In your face
Don't know what I came here, don't know what I'm doing. In your face---Lyrics submitted by Ausan.
