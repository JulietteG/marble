When the music fades, all is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, its all about You
Jesus
Im sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When its all about You, its all about You
Jesus

King of endless worth no one could express
How much You deserve
Though Im weak and poor all I have is Yours
Ev'ry single breath---
