He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath
The weight of His wind and mercy
And all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions
Eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me

Oh, how He loves us, oh
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us all

We are His portion
And He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If His grace is an ocean
Were all sinking

Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I dont have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way That He loves us---
