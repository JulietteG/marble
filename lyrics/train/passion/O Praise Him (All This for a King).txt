Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside
The sound of angel's awe, the sound of angel's songs
And all this for a King, we could join and sing
All to Christ our King

How constant, how divine, this song of ours will rise
Oh, how constant, how divine this love of ours will rise
Will rise...

Oh, praise Him, oh, praise Him
He is holy, He is holy (yeah)

Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise, yeah
The sounds of salvation come, the sounds of rescued ones
And all this for a King, angels join to sing
All for Christ our King

Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la

How infinite and sweet, this love so rescuing
O, how infinitely sweet, this great love that has redeemed
As one we sing...

Alleluia, alleluia
He is holy, He is holy---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
