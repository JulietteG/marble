On yonder hill, the darkness flew
The morning broke in light and dew
When day had come again anew
All we sinners sang
In muck and mire our wretched souls
Had fallen to the depths below
Hell deserved, but there was hope
All we sinners sang

Saved, we are saved
The gates of heaven wide open
Saved, we are saved
The keys to the grave have been stolen

What could ever pay the cost?
On Calvarys hill there rose a cross
And could it be that evil lost?
All we sinners sang and all we sinners sang

Saved, we are saved
The gates of heaven wide open
Saved, we are saved
The keys to the grave have been stolen

The crimson river, like a flood
Came washing over all of us
It swallowed sin and death right up
And all we sinners sang
Yeah, all we sinners sang

Saved, we are saved
The gates of heaven wide open
Saved, we are saved
The keys to the grave have been stolen

On yonder hill, where darkness flew
The morning breaks in light and dew
Day has come again anew
All we sinners sang---
