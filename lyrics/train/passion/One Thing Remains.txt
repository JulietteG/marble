Higher than the mountains that I face 
Stronger than the power of the grave 
Constant in the trial and the change 
This one thing remains
This one thing remains

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love

And on and on and on and on it goes 
As it overwhelms and satisfies my soul 
And I'll never ever have to be afraid 
Cause this one thing remains

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love

In death, In life, Im confident and 
covered by the power of Your great love 
My debt is paid, theres nothing that can 
separate my heart from Your great love

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

And on and on and on and on it goes 
As it overwhelms and satisfies my soul 
And I'll never ever have to be afraid 
Cause this one thing remains

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me

Your love

It's Your love

God I know Your love is never ending
Your love is never failing

It's Your Love

Your love

Your love---
