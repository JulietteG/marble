(Feat. Chris Tomlin)

The battle rages on
As storms and tempests roar
We cannot win this fight
Inside our rebel hearts
We're laying down our weapons now

Chorus
We raise our white flag
We surrender all to You, all for You
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, Your love has won

Here on this holy ground
You made a way for peace
Laying your body down
You took our rightful place
This freedom song is marching on

Chorus
We raise our white flag
We surrender all to You, all for You
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, Your love has won

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high

Chorus x2
We raise our white flag
We surrender all to You, all for You
We raise our white flag: the war is over
Love has come, Your love has won

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high

We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high
We lift the cross, lift it high, lift it high---Lyrics submitted by Michael Rosales-Picazo.
