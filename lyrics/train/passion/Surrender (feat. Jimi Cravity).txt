You're every beat of my heart
And every breath in my lungs
Is Your's
Lord, everyday of my life
And every dream in my mind
Is Your's

From glory to glory
I am transformed in Your image
From glory to glory
The blood has bought my redemption

And I, I surrender
I surrender, I surrender

Lord, I am a vessel here
I'll be Your's now
The earth, the earth
Lord, let Your kingdom come
And let Your will be done
Make me Your witness

From glory to glory
I am transformed in Your image
From glory to glory
Your blood has bought my redemption

And I, I surrender
I surrender, I surrender

And I, I surrender
I surrender, yes surrender---
