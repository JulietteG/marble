You alone, You walked that road all for love
The road to Calvary where death would lose its sting
Where chains are broken free
Greater love has no one than this
That You would give Your life the perfect sacrifice to wash our sin away

Your grace amazes me
Your grace amazes me
Where else could I go? Where else could I run but Your arms
There's no height, no depth You can't reach
And nothing in this world could ever come between us
Jesus I am Yours
Your grace amazes me

But to Your arms, oh Jesus Your grace it changes me
Oh Lord Your grace, my everything
Where else could I go? Where else could I run but to Your arms oh, Jesus
Your grace it changes me
Oh Lord Your grace
My everything and what else could I say?
And what else could I do?
I stand in awe---
