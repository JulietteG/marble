Neon lights draw me like a moth to a flame
Mama raised me right
That just leaves me to blame
When I get a little sideways on a honky-tonk tear
I'm old enough to know better
But I'm still too young to care

Cowgirls with an attitude
Boots and tight blue jeans
Take my mind off doin' right, and doin' other things
When the weekend's gone
I won't have a dime to spare
I'm old enough to know better
But I'm still too young to care

Monday morning I wake up
With a hammer in my hand
The boss-man yelling something at me
That I don't understand
I don't know how I got to work
But I sure know I'm there
I'm old enough to know better
But I'm still too young to care

When the eagle flies on Friday
Well he barely leaves the ground
I've got just enough left to get dressed up
And head back to town
Boss says "Son, having all that fun
Won't get you anywhere"
I'm old enough to know better
But I'm still too young to care

Monday morning I wake up
With a hammer in my hand
The boss-man yelling something at me
That I don't understand
I don't know how I got to work
But I sure know I'm there
I'm old enough to know better
But I'm still too young to care

I'm old enough to know better
But I'm still too young to care---Lyrics submitted by jeremy tibbitts.
