Somebody wrote me, a nasty letter,
But they didn't, sign their name
I think I know, I know who wrote it
Well I recognize, recognize that hand
It's getting warm
Oh so warm
It's so warm
On a winter's day

I'm reading backwards, reading backwards,
On this page
Hoping to defend
If the devil come
I've been wrongly, wrongly accused
Been wrongly, I've been wrongly,
I've been wrongly, wrongly accused.---
