I see you drive around town with the guy i love
And i'm like forget you
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like forget you and forget him too

Said, if i was richer, i'd still be with you
Ha, now ain't that some shh
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a forget you

Yeah, i'm sorry, i can't afford a ferrari
But that don't mean i can't get you there
I guess she's an xbox, and i'm more an atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Well, i've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little girlfriend

I see you drive around town with the guy i love
And i'm like forget you
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like forget you and forget him too

Said, if i was richer, i'd still be with you
Ha, now ain't that some shh
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a forget you

Now i know that i had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep you, trying to please you
'cause being in love with your face ain't cheap

Oh, i pity the fool that falls in love with you
Well, i've got some news for you
Oh, i really hate you right now

I see you drive around town with the guy i love
And i'm like forget you
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like forget you and forget him too

Said, if i was richer, i'd still be with you
Ha, now ain't that some shh
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a forget you

Now, baby, baby, baby
Why'd you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad? so bad
I tried to tell my mama but she told me
This is one for your dad
Yeah, she did

Why, why, why baby?
Oh, i love you
I still love you, ooh

I see you drive around town with the guy i love
And i'm like forget you
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like forget you and forget him too

Said, if i was richer, i'd still be with you
Ha, now ain't that some shh
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a forget you---
