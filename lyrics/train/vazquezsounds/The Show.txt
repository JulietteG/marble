Im just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I dont know where to go I cant do it alone Ive tried
And I dont know why

Slow it down
Make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
Cause its too much
Yeah, its a lot
To be something Im not

Im a fool
Out of love
Cause I just cant get enough

Im just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I dont know where to go I cant do it alone Ive tried
And I dont know why

I am just a little girl lost in the moment
Im so scared but I dont show it
I cant figure it out
Its bringing me down I know
Ive got to let it go
And just enjoy the show

The sun is hot
In the sky
Just like a giant spotlight
The people follow the signs
And synchronize in time
Its a joke
Nobody knows
Theyve got a ticket to that show
Yeah

Im just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I dont know where to go I cant do it alone Ive tried
And I dont know why

I am just a little girl lost in the moment
Im so scared but I dont show it
I cant figure it out
Its bringing me down I know
Ive got to let it go
And just enjoy the show

Just enjoy the show

Im just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I dont know where to go I cant do it alone Ive tried
And I dont know why

I am just a little girl lost in the moment
Im so scared but I dont show it
I cant figure it out
Its bringing me down I know
Ive got to let it go
And just enjoy the show

Dum de dum
Dudum de dum

Just enjoy the show

Dum de dum
