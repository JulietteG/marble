When I had you to myself, I didnt want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now its much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
Wont you please let me
Oh darlin, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in her arms

Yes, I do now
Ooh ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na na na na

Tryin to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, boy, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the boy, I didnt even want around

Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
Wont you please let me
Oh darlin, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in her arms

Yes, I do now
Ooh ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na na na na

Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
Wont you please let me
Oh darlin, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in her arms

Yes, I do now
Ooh ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na na na na

Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
Wont you please let me
Oh darlin, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in her arms---
