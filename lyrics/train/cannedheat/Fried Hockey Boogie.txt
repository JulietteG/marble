I used to buy my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I throw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be care free
No, no, no, until I took a trip to the other side of town
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey, I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down
Dance, nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
I feel the thunder see the lightnin'
I know this anger's Heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
Because of the boogie I feel so hell bent
Hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I never ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do but then that's nothing new
Stuck between hell and high water I need a cure to make it through
Hey, dancing nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Hey, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know, know, know
I'm gonna dance, yeah
Off all the nasty things that people say, dance yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway, dance yeah
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know I've got canned heat in my heels, baby
You know this boogie is for real
Only the wind can blow the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says, "You know that you can go much faster
I know that peoples talk can be so cheap, hey, hey"
I got this voodoo child in veined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know, I got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way to lose
I was born to run and built to last
You've never seen my feet, they can go so fast
Dance yeah
Hey, nothing left for me to do but dance
All these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Hey, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
Hey I've got to dance, yeah
Off the nasty things that people say, dance yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway, dance yeah
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know this boogie is for real, girl
So much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
You know I'm gonna dance my blues away
You know this boogie is for real, girl
So much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
Dance
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, dance
Canned heat in my heels tonight, dance
Canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
Hey, got so much
Dance
Hey DJ, let the music play, I'm gonna live this party life
Hey DJ, throw my cares away, I'm gonna live this party life
Hey DJ, let the music play, I'm gonna live this party life
Hey DJ, throw my cares away, I'm gonna live this party life
You know this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat in my heels
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
You know, you know this boogie, this boogie is for real
You know there is canned heat in my heels tonight
You know I'm gonna dance my blues away tonight
I used to buy my faith in worship ---Lyrics submitted by Margit Torkkola.
