I got money in the bank so we order couple of drinks
Matter of fact, just bring the bottle throw it up, throw it up
Rock the boat until we sink, lot of fishes in the tank
Face around like we be down, but I tell them tear it up
Baby I huff, I puff, I'll blow your house in
In the building like constructions, we don't need no introductions
Single ladies need no drama, they already baby mamas
So the focus for tonight is just put it on the floor

Got my system all equipped we get louder than the club
Face around like we be down, but I tell them tear it up
