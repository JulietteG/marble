I pretend I'm a happy, lying man 
But it's easy to learn when I don't understand 
Never thought I'd be running back so soon 
But I don't believe in nothing without you 
There is a part of me hoping there's a chance 
That you look in these eyes and hold these hands 
I don't care about finding someone new 
'Cause I don't believe in nothing without you 

Thought I had nothing to lose 
Thought I had nothing to prove to you 
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry 
Funny only now I know it's true 
Baby, I got nothing without you 

Since you left I'm a cartoon, of myself 
I'm a mess, I'm a joke, I'm someone else 
I keep telling this story like it's bad news 
'Cause I don't believe in nothing without you 

Oh, thought I had nothing to lose 
Thought I had nothing to prove to you 
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry 
Funny only now I know it's true 
Baby, I got nothing without you 

I know that I'm a gamble 
I know that it's a long shot 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
I do everything I can do 
'Cause you're everything that I got, I got 

Thought I had nothing to lose 
I thought I had nothing to prove to you 
And I wasted all this time, I'm sorry 
Funny only now I know it's true 
Baby, I got nothing without you 

Nana, nanananana, nana, nanananana 
And I (na) wasted (na) all (na) this (na) time (na), 
I'm sorry 
Funny only now I know it's true (naaaa) 
Baby, I got nothing without you---
