Winter time in London are you making plans
Are you still rocking converse with your old Raybans
If youre sitting in the places that we used to be
Or if youre somewhere listening to Bob Marley

Then I know that youre somewhere thinking of me

Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi breeze

Then I know that youre somewhere thinking of me
Oh yes, you are
Then I know that youre somewhere thinking of me

No point regretting that it didnt last
No point regretting that it went so fast
Time that we had was like sand in our hand

But when I look behind
Im so glad that you were mine

I remember taking you home on that 86
Standing in your doorway where we used to kiss
Then your Dad came out and chased me down the street
If you remember just how scared I used to be

Then I know that youre somewhere thinking of me

I know wherever you go
that youll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
that youll be thinking about me

Bumped into Irene down in waterloo
She told me that you got yourself somebody new
She said you musta like him cos hes oh so nice
But I remember that you like a pinch of spice

Well I
I know wherever you go
that youll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
that youll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
that youll be thinking about me now---Lyrics submitted by Musab Kilani.
