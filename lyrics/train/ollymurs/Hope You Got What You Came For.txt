You and I, you and I, always the same thing 
Every time, every time you come around 
Tell me now, tell me now, why are you leaving? 
Is it time, is it time to take a bow? 

Our little hearts are quiet now 
I feel the silence coming down 

I hope you got what you came for 
I hope you got what you came for 
You've been standing outside in the cold air 
On your own, yeah 
You must have known you were right 
I hope you got what you came for 

I would give, I would give everything I am 
Go ahead, go ahead, do what you like 
Guess I was, guess I was lost in the moment 
Had to be, had to be, run out of time 

Our little hearts are quiet now 
I feel the silence coming down 

I hope you got what you came for 
I hope you got what you came for 
You've been standing outside in the cold air 
On your own, yeah 
You must have known you were right 
I hope you got what you came for 

I guess we started something we just don't know how to stop 
I guess we're broken hearted every time we have to part 

Our little hearts are quiet now 
I feel the silence coming down 

I hope you got what you came for 
I hope you got what you came for 
You've been standing outside in the cold air 
On your own, yeah 
You must have known you were right 
I hope you got what you came for 

I guess we started something we just don't know how to stop 
I guess we're broken hearted every time we have to part 

You and i, you and i, always the same thing 
Every time, every time you come around---
