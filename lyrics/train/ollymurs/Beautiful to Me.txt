She ties her hair up, tight 
Puts her armor on When she steps outside 
She is in black and white, and the colors gone
But its in her eyes 
Time and time again were going back to the start 
And Im trying, try again to bring some light to the dark 
You know every days a battle and it tears her apart 
And I dont know why 
And Im picking up the pieces when we fall to the feet 
We confide in other demons, though shell never be free 
We could hide it in the shadows, though its hard to believe 
And I dont know why 

Love, dont ever change the way you are 
You light the sky just like a star 
I dont care what you say 
Youre beautiful to me 
Oh

She, she never gets it right 
And it feels like rain on a perfect night 
And I, Id be a hand to hold 
You can push me hard, but I wont let go 
Time and time again were going back to the start 
And Im trying, try again to bring some light to the dark 
You know every days a battle and it tears her apart 
But, dont you cry

My love dont ever change the way you are 
You light the sky just like a star 
I dont care what you say 
Youre beautiful to me 

Love, Ill be your ordinary goal
Youre so amazing, dont you know? 
I dont care what you say 
Youre beautiful to me 
Oh

The light breaks through your hair and 
Theyre all stopping and staring 
Id go anywhere 
Oh, why cant you just see that? 
Im crazy about you 
I cant live without you 
You dont see it, 
But youre beautiful to me 

Love, dont ever change the way you are 
You light the sky just like a star 
I dont care what you say 
Youre beautiful 
Oh

Love, dont ever change the way you are 
You light the sky just like a star 
I dont care what you say 
Youre beautiful to me 
C' mon 

Love, Ill be your ordinary goal 
Youre so amazing, dont you know? 
I dont care what you say 
Youre beautiful to me

Youre beautiful to me---
