Mmm...

The sky looks pissed,
the wind talks back,
my bones are shifting in my skin
and you, my love, are gone.

My room seems wrong,
the bed won't fit,
I cannot seem to operate,
and you, my love, are gone

[Chorus]
So glide away on soapy heels
and promise not to promise anymore.
And if you come around again
then I will take, then I will take
the chain from off the door.

I'll never say
I'll never love,
but I don't say a lot of things, 
and you, my love, are gone.

[Chorus 2x, second time begins into a round that repeats 4x, the last time is a cappella]

So glide away on soapy heels
and promise not promise anymore.
then I will take 
the chain from off the door.

Then I will take,
then I will take, 
then I will take, [round all comes together]
the chain from off the door.---Lyrics submitted by anne.
