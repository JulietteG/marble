I call you my friend
And thats all that I do
Why do I have to pretend
To find ways to be around you?

You've been there all along
Holding my hand like you do.
Why do I feel that its wrong
To love to be around you?

And I think I'm losing my mind
maybe I've been hopelessly blind to your beauty
And you have a sweet sinful smile
I'm in trouble
Cuz you turn me upside down and around and around

Do you feel what I feel? Well?
Do you feel this way too?
That every wound seems to heal when I am around you

And I must be losing my mind
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beaauty.
And you have a sweet sinful smile
I'm in trouble
You turn me upside down and around and around and around

And I must be losing my mind maybe you have a sweet sinful smile 
I'm in trouble
Cuz you turn me upside down and around and around
Turn me upside down and around and around
Turn me upside down and around and around

My feet don't touch the ground when I'm around you
When I'm around you you you you you---Lyrics submitted by Adriane.
