I wait in the rain but I dont complain because I wait for you
I dont feel pain, youre like novocain, and I got you

It was always you
It was always you

Time and again i thought that the end was just around the bend
You showed me theres more, I got more in store, and I got you

It was always you
It was always you

It was always you
It was always you
