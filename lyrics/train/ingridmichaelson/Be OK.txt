I just want to be ok, be ok, be ok 
I just want to be ok today 
I just want to be ok, be ok, be ok 
I just want to be ok today 

I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today 
I just want to feel something today 
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today 
I just want to feel something today 

CHORUS: 
Open me up and you will see 
I'm a gallery of broken hearts 
I'm beyond repair, let me be 
And give me back my broken parts 

I just want to know today, know today, know today 
I just want to know something today 
I just want to know today, know today, know today 
Know that maybe I will be ok 

CHORUS 

Just give me back my pieces 
Just give them back to me please 
Just give me back my pieces 
And let me hold my broken parts 

I just want to be ok, be ok, be ok 
I just want to be ok today 
I just want to be ok, be ok, be ok 
I just want to be ok today 

I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today 
I just want to feel something today 
I just want to know today, know today, know today 
Know that maybe I will be ok 
Know that maybe I will be ok 
Know that maybe I will be ok---Lyrics submitted by Riley.
