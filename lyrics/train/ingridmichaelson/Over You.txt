(Ingrid)
Over, I'm so over you
The way that you look
In a 3-piece suit

Over, I'm so over you
The way that you held me
Like nobody else would

Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get over you
Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get all over
You
You oh
Over you
You

(A Great Big World)
Over, I'm so over you
The way that you laugh
Made everything that I do
Over, I'm so over you

(Both)
The way that you said that you'd always be true
And maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get over you
Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
I'll get all over
You
You
Over you
You
Over you

(A Great Big World)
I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
Oh

Canon-
(Ingrid)
Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do
A Great Big World:
I'm falling around you
I'm falling around you
Oh
Maybe if I tell myself enough

(A Great Big World)
I'm falling around you

(Both)
Maybe if I tell myself enough
Maybe if I do---
