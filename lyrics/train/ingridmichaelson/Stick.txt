Long long time ago
You and I put on a show
Then we ran it in the ground
You said it's not enough
Don't want a broken love
You were nowhere to be found
Even after something's gotta hold on

Did any of me stick at all?
Was it really no one's fault?
Can you hear me singing through the walls
That we used to lean on?
There's a part of you that stays with me
Someone else gets to know
Did any of me stick at all?
Did any of me ever stick at all?

I've got somebody new
He dances just like you
It makes me wonder how you are
I can't hide the memory
The memory of you and me
When we went kissing in the dark
I'm always after something that won't hold on

Did any of me stick at all?
Was it really no one's fault?
Can you hear me singing through the walls
That we used to lean on?
There's a part of you that stays with me
Someone else gets to know
Did any of me stick at all?
Did any of me ever stick at all?

We are the road untaken
The moon that's fading
If it means that you and me we gotta break it
Well I'm done faking
But I need to know
Do you remember who I am?

Did any of me stick?
Did any of me stick?

Did any of me stick at all?
Was it really no one's fault?
Can you hear me singing through the walls
That we used to lean on?
There's a part of you that stays with me
Someone else gets to know
Did any of me stick at all?
Did any of me stick?
There's a part of you that stays with me
Someone else gets to know
Did any of me stick at all?
Did any of me stick at all?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
