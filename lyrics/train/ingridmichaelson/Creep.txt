When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
You think you're so special
I wish that I was special

but Im a creep
and Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
No, I dont belong here

And I dont care if it hurts
'Cos I wanna have control
Oh, I want a perfect body
And I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When Im not around, not, not around
You think you're so special
I wish that I was special

cos Im a creep
and Im a weirdo
Oh, what the hell am I doing here?
No, no I dont belong here

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You think youre so special
Well, I wish that I was special

'Cos Im not a creep
And Im not a weirdo
Tell me, what the hell am I doing here?
No, no, I dont belong here
I dont belong here---
