Oh, let me wear your overcoat, my bones are super chill and all the ponies have gone home
Oh, walking through Manhattan with the ache from last nights smile still smarting up from my toes

Here we go, dancing on our own, inside this house that we have never known,
Here we go, going in alone into the dark and wonderful unknown, let us go, let us go

Oh, we make bread on Sundays and the little ones are climbing up the walls, up the walls
Oh, nothing lasts forever but the sound of love astounds me every time that it calls

Here we go, dancing on our own, inside this house that we have never known, never known,
Here we go, going in alone into the dark and wonderful unknown, let us go, let us go

In the best way, youll be the death of me
In the best way, youll be the death of me
In the best way, youll be the death of me
In the best way

Oh, got your fathers wristwatch on, the one your mother gave him when they thought the world wont end,
Oh, we will be there one day with a smile and nothing more to say goodbye to a friend

Here we go, dancing on our own, inside this house that we have never known, never known
Here we go, going in alone, into the dark and wonderful unknown, let us go let us go 

Here we go, dancing on our won, inside this house that we have never known, never known
Here we go, going in alone, into the dark and wonderful unknown, let us go, let us go
In the best way youll be the death of me [x7]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
