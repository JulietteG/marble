I don't tell anyone about the way you hold my hand
I don't tell anyone about the things that we have planned
I won't tell anybody, Won't tell anybody
They wanna push me down, they wanna see you fall down

I won't tell anybody that you turn the world around
I won't tell anybody that your voice is my favorite sound
I won't tell anybody, Won't tell anybody
They wanna see us fall, they wanna see us fall down

I don't need a parachute, baby if I've got you
Baby if I've got you, I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me, You're gonna catch if I fall (Down, down, down)

Don't believe the things you tell yourself so late at night
And, you are your own worst enemy, you'll never win the fight
Just hold onto me, I'll hold onto you
It's you and me up against the world, it's you and me

I don't believe anything, don't trust anyone but me
But I believe you when you say were never gonna fall
Hand behind my neck, arm around my waist
Never let me hit the ground, you'll never let me crash

I don't need a parachute, baby if I've got you
Baby if I've got you, I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me, You're gonna catch if I fall (Down, down, down)

I don't need a parachute, baby if I've got you
Baby if I've got you, I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me, You're gonna catch if I fall (Down, down, down)

I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I fall into you

I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I fall into you

I don't need a parachute, baby if I've got you
Baby if I've got you, I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me, You're gonna catch if I fall (Down, down, down)

I don't need a parachute, baby if I've got you
Baby if I've got you, I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me, You're gonna catch if I fall (Down, down, down)

I don't need a parachute, baby if I've got you
Baby if I've got you, I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me, You're gonna catch if I fall (Down, down, down)---Lyrics submitted by Adriane.
