open heart surgery
that is what you do to me
cut me up, set me free
that is what you do to me

now i'm walking in, walking into fire
i'm walking into fire with you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
when i walk, into you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
i'm walking into fire with you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
when i walk, into you

into you into you into you into you into you
into you into you into you into you into you

heart attack up your sleeve
you can make me believe
that i will grow from the ground
after you burn me down

now i'm walking in, walking into fire
i'm walking into fire with you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
when i walk, into you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
i'm walking into fire with you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
when i walk, into you

into you into you into you into you into you
into you into you into you into you into you

you burn me up
you burn me up
you burn me up
and i love it
you burn me up
you burn me up
you burn me up
and i love it

now i'm walking in, walking into fire
i'm walking into fire with you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
when i walk, into you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
i'm walking into fire with you
i'm walking in, walking into fire
when i walk, into you

into you into you into you into you into you
into you into you into you into you into you
you burn me up
you burn me up
you burn me up
and i love it---
