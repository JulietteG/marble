When I hear your voice over the radio from a world away
So sweet
Singing out to me I know
It's a lullaby
And I'm tangled in thoughts of you
And I'm all alone till you come back home
Why don't you come back home?

Oh, you got me
Oh, you got me good
Oh, you got me
Oh, you got me good, good, good

And when I see the curve of the earth in your willow eyes
I'm a rocketeer
Coming home after years at the speed of light
And suddenly you're there
Like a pearl in the palm of the universe
Your unlikely skies
Filling up my eyes
You come as some surprise

Oh, you got me
Oh, you got me good
Oh, you got me
Oh, you got me good, good, good
You got me good

Falling for the world again
Falling back to you
I was nailed shut like a shack on the edge of town
You were broken down
Till you came around

Oh, you got me (you got me)
Oh, you got me (you got me good)
Oh, you got me (you got me)
Oh, you got me (you got me good)
You got me good
You got me good
You got me good---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
