We have fallen down again tonight 
In this world it's hard to get it right 
Trying to make your heart feel like a glove
What it needs is love, love, love.

(chorus)
Everybody, everybody wants to love
Everybody wants to be loved
oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Everybody, everybody wants to love 
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved 
oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

Happy is the heart that still feels pain
Darkness drains and light will come again 
swing open up your chest and let it in
Just let the love, love, love begin

(chorus)

oh,
Everybody knows the love 
Everybody holds the love
Everybody falls for love
Everybody feels the love
Everybody steals the love
Everybody heals with love


oh oh oh
Just let the love, love, love begin

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Christie.
