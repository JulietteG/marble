I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm always right behind you
I'm always right behind you

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm always right behind you

When I go away, I go
Just tell me that you love me
And make some room for me
By the sea when I go

And if I right behind, behind you
You can fall back, you can let go
I am right behind you
And if I right behind, behind you---
