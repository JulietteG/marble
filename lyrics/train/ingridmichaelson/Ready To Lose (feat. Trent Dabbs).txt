When you coming home?
It's the quiet in the night
That makes my mind make noises and guessing second times
Tell me that you're mine
Say it one more time

I'm ready to lose everything but you
I'm ready to lose everything but you
Everything
Everything

It's the heart in you
I know it in my bones
That made me change direction when I thought better off alone
Say it one more time
Tell me you are mine

I'm ready to lose everything but you
I'm ready to lose everything but you
Everything

Tell me that you're mine
Say it one more time
Tell me that you're mine
Say it one more time
Tell me that you're mine
Say it one more time
Say it one more time
Tell me that you're mine

I'm ready to lose everything but you
I'm ready to lose everything but you
Everything
Everything

Say it one more time
Say it one more time---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
