Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
And the baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well baby I have been here before
I've seen this room, and I've walked this floor
You know I, I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
