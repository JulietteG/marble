Another day, another fight
It always feels like an uphill climb
Another step, another mile
The story of your life
It's harder than you ever thought
And it costs you everything you've got
When you're back against the wall
And you feel like giving up

(Chorus)
This is only a mountain
You don't have to find your way around it
Tell it to move, it'll move
Tell it to fall, it'll fall
This is only a moment
You don't have to let your fear control it
Tell it to move, it'll move
Tell it to fall, it'll fall

You've gotta find a second wind
It's not as high as you think it is
Don't give up and don't you quit
You gotta climb if you wanna win

And I know it looks big
And I know you feel small
But just a little bit of faith can change it all
Change it all

Chorus

Ask like you believe it
Trust like you can see it
Take your fear and say
There's nothing in your way, no oh
Even when it looks big
Even when you feel small
Just a little bit of faith can change it all

Chorus

It's only a mountain
Just a little bit of faith can change it all---
