So many faces of different colors
So many stories untold.
So many places these streets and numbers
And we're all pieces of this old, big world.

And we all come alive and we all fall apart
And we all need someone to love us where we are.
What if we all took a minute to look at one another
And lay our differences aside.
We will find that we are the same kind...the same kind of broken.

There's a thousand reasons why how we got here
But only one way to explain
Why it hurts you and why it hurts me, too
No matter where you've been it's all the same.

We all come alive and we all fall apart
And we all need someone to love us where we are
And what if we all took a minute to look at one another and lay our differences aside.
We would find that we are the same kind..the same kind of broken.

All the colors bleed to one, like a river we all run - searching for the place that feels like home.
So let's all take a minute and look at one another and lay our differences aside.
'Cause we all come alive and we all fall apart and we all need someone to love us where we are. 
'Cause we are the same kind - the same kind of broken.---Lyrics submitted by Sheryl.
