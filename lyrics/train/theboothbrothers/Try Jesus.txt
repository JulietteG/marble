If you ever need a friend closer than your brother
Try Jesus
And if you ever need a counselor better than your mother
Try Jesus
And if you ever need a someone to draw you closer to the Father
Try Jesus
And if you ever need a hand to help you step out on the water
Try Jesus

He alone knows your condition
He alone knows your hearts intention

If you ever needed someone to lay down their life for you
Try Jesus
If you ever need a healer when the doctor walks away
Friend try Jesus
And if you never thought youd have the strength to face another day
Try Jesus
If you ever needed someone to walk with you to the end
Try My Jesus
And if you ever need to hear the words I forgive you again
Try Jesus

Try Jesus. He never fails
Try Jesus when the doubts assail
Try Jesus He never fails
If you ever need a friend
Try Jesus.---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
