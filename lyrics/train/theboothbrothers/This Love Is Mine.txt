A living flame forever burning
An endless road that has no turning
The love of God will never die
And it reaches to such as I

CHORUS
This love is mine I know it
He gave His son to show it
He lifted me from depths of darkness
To walk in light divine
A love that has no ending
All other loves transcending
Forevermore with joy Ill tell it
This love is mine

I cant explain how God could save me
And I cant explain the love He gave me
But still its real. It lives today
And it never will pass away

Repeat Chorus
