Time has cast a shadow on her memory
And age has robbed her mind of dates and names
Seems the pieces of her past are lost forever
And the old home place just doesnt seem the same
Faded pictures taped into the family albums
She tries in vain but cant seem to recall
That the handsome man was once her loving husband
Who went Home to be with Jesus just last fall

But she still remembers Jesus and His amazing grace
He left a mark upon her heart that time cannot erase
She can tell you who He is and what He did and why He came
Yes she still remembers Jesus name

Still her children come most every day to see her
Behind their smiles they try to hide their pain
But at times it's hard to keep the tears from coming
When she asks her first born child, Now whats your name?
Yet she knows every word to Rock of Ages Cleft for Me
You can feel His presence in the room when she quotes John 3:16
Though she was just a young girl when she first knelt down to pray
She remembers when she met Him like it was yesterday

Yes she still remembers Jesus and His amazing grace
He left a mark upon her heart that time cannot erase
She can tell you who He is and what He did and why He came
Yes she still remembers Jesus name

Its a comfort to her family and it helps to ease their pain
That she stills remembers Jesus' name---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
