Theres a storm on the horizon
And everywhere I turn
It seems as if Ive tried that way before
Lookin for the answers to come to me right now
To pick me up and set me on higher ground

CHORUS:
In His time, He will make everything right
In His time, Hell show me His way
In His time, He will deliver me
And in this storm He will be glorified
In His time

How long, Oh Lord, How long, Oh, Lord
Will I have to cry
I know you long to wipe away
The tears from my eyes
And though I may not understand
Your purpose and Your plan
I know Your grace will carry me through

Repeat chorus

BRIDGE
They that wait upon the Lord
Shall renew their strength
Like the eagles soar

TAG
And In this storm, He will be glorified
In His time.---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
