CHORUS:
Heaven, Holy City, New Jerusalem
City Four square
But will Heaven be heaven without you
Dont you want to spend eternity there

Everybodys heard about it, talked about it
Dreamed about it, Im gonna shout
Its gonna happen some day in the air
In the air. In the end
Oh please dont miss it, Friend, dont miss it
Come to Jesus this very minute
Then we all can spend eternity there

Repeat Chorus Twice

TAG
Heaven, Oh I want to see you there
Up in Heaven---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
