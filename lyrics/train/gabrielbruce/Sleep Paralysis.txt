You wouldn't believe
The things that i have seen
I wouldn't expect you to 
You've never been asleep

You wouldn't believe 
The things that i have seen
How could i expect you to
You've never been asleep

I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
X4

Across the sea
We're both fixed in a dream
There's an island just like this
A person just like me

You couldn't conceive 
The possibility
That though he loves all of us
He's given up on me

I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
X4

This is alive
The dead man
Possesses me
And there's a shortness of breath
There's weakness in me

I got this feeling that we're dead
I got this feeling that we're dead
And there's nothing more
X3
But what if we're dead
But what if we're dead
And there's nothing more
Yeah there's nothing more---Lyrics submitted by Keivida.
