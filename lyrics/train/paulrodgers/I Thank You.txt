You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

If you took your love somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You make me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

Every day was something new
You pull out your bag and you're fine to do
You got me trying new things, too
Just so I can keep up to you

You didn't have to shake it like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

All my life I've been short changed
Without your love, babe, it's a crying shame
I know I know what the fellows are talking about
When they say that they're been turned down

I wanna thank you, thank you, baby
I wanna thank you, thank you, baby

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

All my life I've been like this
Without your love it's a crying shame
I wanna thank you, thank you, baby
I just wanna thank you, girl

I wanna thank you, baby
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
Oh, thank you, baby---
