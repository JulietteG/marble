I drink alone
Yeah with nobody else
I drink alone 
yeah with nobody else
Yeah you know when I drink alone 
I prefer to be by myself.

Now every morning just before breakfast
I don't want no coffee or tea
just me and my good buddy 'weiser
that's all I ever need.

'cause I drink alone
yeah with nobody else 
yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah the other night I lay sleeping
and I woke from a terrible dream
so I called up my pal Jack Daniel's
and his partner Jimmy Beam.

Then we drank alone
yeah with nobody else
yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah the other day I got invited to a party
but I stayed home instead
just me and my pal Johnny Walker
and his brothers Black & Red.

And we drank alone
yeah with nobody else
yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah my whole family done give up on me
and it makes me feel oh so bad
and the only one who'll hang with me
is my dear old grand dad.

And we drink alone
yeah with nobody else 
you know when I drink alone 
I prefer to be by myself 
Yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
