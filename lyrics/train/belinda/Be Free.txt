what happend to me?
im just a girl,
only a girl wanting to be someone
and if i try oh
and if i dream oh
and if i see my heart inside of me
let's go flying together
let's go fly like a bird 
ye, ye, ye
let's go skating the sky 
to hear my voice and your cry 
i just want to be free in this world 
i hope that everyone understands 
i just want to be free and fly away
and smell all the flowers in my heart 
i want to feel the love in me 
i want to go go go go away 
i'm feeling real love 
only for you
you opend my eyes and i saw the world
it's time to live oh
you can be mine oh 
and we can journey to paradise
let's go flying together
let's go fly like a bird 
ye, ye, ye
i just want to be free in this world 
i hope that everyone understands 
i just want to be free and fly away 
and smell all the flowers in my heart
i want to feel the love in me 
i want to go go go go away 
if i had a wing to fly 
if i had a tear to cry 
i would give my soul 
to the angels of the sky
i just want to be free in this world 
i hope that everyone understands
i just whant to be free and fly away 
and smell all the flowers in my heart 
i want to feel the love in me 
i want to see the librety 
to share the feelings in my heart
    UUU UUU
