Yeah, It's been so long!

I found myself still thinkin' about you!

Do you ever think about me?
...Ever thiiiiink about me!

Check this out girl...

Verse 1
All those nights that we kissed,
All the nights that I missed,
Holdin hands, I's your man for sure,
We were young but secure,
what we had was so pure,
Innocence eve since we spoke.

B-Section
Why do we fall in love,
When love will only tear us apart,
Back then the world was ours,
Everything was so riiiiight!

Hook
But we were kissin' with our eyes closed so tight,
so young and feelin' so right,
never thought that we would do wrong!
Oh, we were kissin' with our eyes closed so tight,
so young and feelin' so right,
I can't believe that those days are gone!

Yeah, I miss you baby!

Verse 2
So much pride as my girl,
Thought I showed you the world,
Memories you and me so real,
...so real,
Gave my heart and my soul,
Make you sunshine from cold,
All those days far away from here,
...uh huh.

B-Section
Why do we fall in love,
When love will only tear us apart,
Back then the world was ours,
Everything was so riiiiight!

Hook 1x

...Can't believe it,
I still think about you,
here we are!

We danced so close,
we held on tight,
I never knew that love could feel so right,
We danced so slow,
we danced all night,
Assuming that tomorrow would be bright.
We kissed goodnight,
You walked on by,
A vision of your shadow caught my eye.
My life stood still,
You wait inside,
I never got to say my last good byyyyye!

Say goodbyyyyye!

Hook 1x

Can't believe those days are gone!

Hook 1x

...Can't believe it,
I still can't believe it,
After all this time,
I'm still missing you,
Damn...somethings will never change!---Lyrics submitted by Joy.
