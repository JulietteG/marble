*Nowhere*

(Yeah..uh)
Oh yeah
(Girl I'm nowhere without you)
(And I wanna prove it to you)
I'm nowhere..yeah
(That's right)

Right now
Here we are
And here I'll stay
For as long as you say
I'll never go
Don't you know
I'll be yours for always
And I don't care what it takes to make y ou
Undestand I'll never leave you
(That's right)
And I don't wanna be standing here
On my own without you
(I can't live without you)
Yeah

Chorus
Because I'm nowhere if I'm not with you
And I don't care what it takes to prove
There is no way I can stand to lose you now
Because I'm nowhere without you

Oh babe, if you should leave
Then you'd see
How my heart was torn in two
And then you'd know
Just how far I'd go
Girl to get back to you
And I don't care what it takes to give you
Everything I ever meant to
And I don't wanna be standing here
On my own without you
(I can't live without you girl)

Chorus 2x

Now I don't even know how I got here
All I know is that I just want to stay right here
And every single day you're right here
Is another chance is another way
Baby to stay with  you forever
There is no way, there is no way, there is no way, there is no way I can lose you now, Oh, no
no

Chorus 2x

(I can't stand to lose you)
Because I'm nowhere without you
(I can't live without you)---Lyrics submitted by Joy.
