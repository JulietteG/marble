Another holiday
Well you're walking straight ahead 
But you're looking to your right
Got your eyes down low
But you hold your head high.
A holo hola ho and a hola hola hey
Another holiday

Beach the sun and sand dunes
Takes me far away

Distant lands are not so far away
I don't know why we don't go
Take my hands I'll show you the way
Pack your bags and sail away

Well I hate my job and I got no car
And my aching feet won't take me that far
A hola hola ho and a hola hola hey
Another holiday

Kiss me in the moonlight
Listen to the waves

Distant lands are not so far away
I don't know why we don't go
Take my hands I'll show you the way
Pack your bags and sail away

Another holiday

Distant lands are not so far away
I don't know why we don't go
Take my hands I'll show you the way
Pack your bags and sail away---Lyrics submitted by Trevor Mackie.
