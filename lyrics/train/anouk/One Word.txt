I close my eyes
And imagine you're here
Did it all seem so hopeless
Given the chance
I would ask
Forgive me
I didn't do a thing to make you stay
I didn't say a word to make you stay
If I would have known
Could I have tried to make it easier
But I didn't do a thing
Or say a word
One word

And I don't know why you're gone, now you're gone
No beautiful goodbye
You will never leave my mind
And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams
Now you're, you're a star in heaven

My thoughts unsaid
Stuck in my head
And it all feels so useless
Never forget to give all I have
Forgive me
I couldn't do a thing to make you stay
And I couldn't say a word to make you stay
If I could have known
Could I have tried to make it easier
But I couldn't do a thing
Or say a word
One word

And I don't know why you're gone, now you're gone
No beautiful goodbye
You will never leave my mind
And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams
Now you're, yeah you're a star in heaven

Still I don't know why you're gone, now you're gone
No beautiful goodbye
You will never leave my mind
And it turns out to be so much different than our dreams
Now you're, you're a star in heaven
You're a star in heaven now
You're a star in heaven
Yeah you're my star---Lyrics submitted by sherida.
