Crazy way to get your kicks
Shoot the silicone in your lips
If your figure makes you said
They suck the fat right off your back

Make up your mind about your tits girls
They can puff 'm so no bra will fit girls
There's only one thing they can't fix
No I won't let you be misled
And that's the hole in your head
Can't do nothing 'bout that

[Chorus]
Hail hail modern world
Hail to all you boys and girls
Hail hail the colour green
Hail hail to what I've seen
Hail hail hail this modern world

You tell her tha she's beautiful
And put her on a pedestal
But as you Google triple x
Imagination kicks in

The more you think about sex boys
With someone else the better it gets boys
Do you have a purpose in your life
Besides cheating on your wife
For fuck sake show some  sense

[Chorus]

These days adoption is a hot thing
You can get a child for nearly nothing
You take them home to a nanny
Buy off your guilt with toys and candy

But all the money that you work for girls
You can't compare to love boys
There's only one thing they can't fix
No I won't let you be misled 
And that's the hole in your head
Can't do nothing 'bout that

[Chorus]

Yeah yeah yeah...---Lyrics submitted by Taja.
