I was in the bedroom packing for a trip
You were in the kitchen a smile on your lips
Whats it gonna matter when this moments gone ?
The worlds spinning faster but were just holding on

A sudden disaster could roll from sea
The earth could just open forget you and me
Life is what happens while were making plans
You gave me your heart but it slipped through my hands

Did i ever stop to say ?
Did i ever find a way ?
To catch you when time flew
Did i ever make it show ?
Did i ever let you know ?
Nothing else matters but you
Nothing else matters but you

I was on the rooftop the sun in my eyes
You were in a mood for a little surprise
But nights turn to days then weeks become years
What are we left with when all this disappears ?

Did i ever stop to say ?
Did i ever find a way ?
To catch you when time flew
Did i ever make it show ?
Did i ever let you know ?
Nothing else matters but you
Nothing else matters but you

Cause time doesnt slip it runs though our hands
And just where it goes, I cant understand
Like an old photograph, in white and black
The hours have faded, but i just want them back, i just want them back

Did i ever stop to say ?
Did i ever find a way ?
To catch you when time flew
Did i ever make it show ?
Did i ever let you know ?
Nothing else matters but you
Did i ever stop to say ?
Did i ever find a way ?
To catch it when time flew
Did i ever make it show ?
Did i ever let you know ?
Nothing else matters but you---Lyrics submitted by remie.
