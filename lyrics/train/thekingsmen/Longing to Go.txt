They say the water is clear as a crystal, with streets like a mirror of gold
There each face is void of frustration, not one broken heart will be known
More beauty than we can imagine, what splendor our eyes will behold
The more that I hear about heaven, the more I am longing to go

Call me heavenly-minded if thats how it seems
Say Im gone off the deep end, caught up in a dream
The more I read Johns description of that city of gold
The more I am longing to go.

In life Ive enjoyed this worlds beauty, the oceans, the mountains so high
The flowers that bloom in the garden, the sunset that lights up the sky
But when the death angel takes a loved one, & Im left behind so alone
The more that I hear about heaven, the more I am longing to go.---Lyrics submitted by Rick.
