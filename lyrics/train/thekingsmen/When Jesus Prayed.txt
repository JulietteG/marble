Jesus knew he would deny Him, 
but he loved him anyway. 
The same voice that calmed the storm called out his name. 
Saying Peter, 
Satan wants you but theres one thing he doesnt know. 
Ive been on my knees pleading at the throne. 

I prayed for you, 
I talked to my Father. 
Your forgiveness will prove that your Faith will not falter. 
Doubt and fear fall away, 
when intercession is made, 
and Satan still trembles to this day. 
When Jesus prays. 

Your burdens seem so heavy, 
from the load youve had to bear. 
Theres a voice thats calling out through your despair. 
So, when you feel that no ones listening and your prayers they seem unheard, 
thats when Hell assure you with these words. 

I prayed for you, 
I talked to my Father. 
Your forgiveness will prove that your Faith will not falter. 
Doubt and fear fall away, 
when intercession is made, 
and Satan still trembles to this day. 
When Jesus prays. 

Child, I want to say with you, 
a prayer that has the power to, 
open blinded eyes and cause the dead to rise. 
Thats the kind of prayer, 
I prayed for you.

I prayed for you, 
I talked to my Father. 
Your forgiveness will prove that your Faith will not falter. 
Doubt and fear fall away, 
when intercession is made, 
and Satan still trembles to this day. 
When Jesus prays. 

Doubt and fear fall away, 
when intercession is made, 
and Satan still trembles to this day. 
When Jesus prays. 
My Jesus prays.---Lyrics submitted by Johnathan Irey.
