VERSE 1
Well it didn;t make the papers, in this world when I prayed through.
It didn't seem to matter, to all but just a few.
But on the golden streets of Glory, the celebration banners waved.
And it made news in Heaven, when I got saved!

CHORUS:
Angels were rejoicing, Hallelujahs rang!
When Jesus touched my life, and I was changed
Everyone on glory's realm, knew my name was written down
And it made news in Heaven, when I got saved!

VERSE 2
Not long ago a begger, but now a child of the King.
This old world just shrugged it's shoulders,
To them it didn't mean a thing,
But it was God's apprpoval that my spirit really craved,
And it made news in Heaven when I got saved!---Lyrics submitted by Rev C Morrow Jr.
