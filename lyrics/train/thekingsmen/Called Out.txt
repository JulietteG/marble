Some folks I know by their name, some folks I just know their face.
Some are known by their fame, others known by their race.
But in the kingdom of our Lord, each soul has its place.
And in my mind I have no doubt, by name we've been "Called Out"

Chorus:
And we've been Called Out for a purpose, Called Out to be a servant
Called Out to lift the standard, He's called you out. Raise the banner.
Called Out to be a witness. Called Out to show forgiveness.
Called Out from the world. Shout! You're Called Out.

Within the prison walls that day, the jailer bound up their feet.
Stripped of their garments, there they laid, bleeding from where they were beat.
Long 'bout midnight Paul began to pray and Silas , he started to sing.
Earth shook about, doors flew open wide.
God said "You've been Called Out"!

Chorus:
And we've been Called Out for a purpose, Called Out to be a servant
Called Out to lift the standard, He's called you out. Raise the banner.
Called Out to be a witness. Called out to show forgiveness.
Called Out from the world. Shout! You're Called Out.
