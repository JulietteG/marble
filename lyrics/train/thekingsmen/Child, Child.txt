Think back to the time when Jesus saved your soul 
remember the joy when you gave Him full control 
but if time has removed the peace you knew 
then He's calling you back to the place you began

Child Child why do you wander out in the darkness 
away from the fold 
Child Child there's comfort in closeness 
so walk just as close as you can. 

I know I'm redeemed cause Ive been to Calvary 
though sometimes I falter & fail 
His will to see but forgiveness is all mine 
in Him I'll rejoice because I'm one of His sheep 
& His sheep know His voice 

Child Child why do you wander out in the darkness 
away from the fold
Child Child there's comfort in closeness 
so walk just as close as you can. ---Lyrics submitted by andrew aihi.
