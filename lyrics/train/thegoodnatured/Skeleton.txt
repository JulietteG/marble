Stop what you're doin'
Hey, come on over
What can I do today
See me standin' naked
Hot for you and I'm takin' it all off for you

So we're standin' all alone
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
and I am naked to the bone
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
Rip it all off, give it what you got
Rip it all off, so hot, don't stop
Now you can see my skeleton

Never speak of this
Keep this firmly placed in between your lips 
Burn, I'm standing naked
Hot for you and I'm takin' it all off for you

So we're standin' all alone
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
and I am naked to the bone
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
Rip it all off, give it what you got
Rip it al off, so hot, don't stop
Now you can see my skeleton

You make me strip, you make me sweat
What you see is what you get
You make me strip, you make me sweat
What you see is what you get

So we're standin' all alone
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
and I am naked to the bone
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
Rip it all off, give it what you got
Rip it all off so hot don't stop
Now you can see my skeleton

Rip it all off, give it what you got
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
Rip it all off, so hot don't stop
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh
Rip it all off, give it what you got
Rip it all off so hot, don't stop
Now you can see my skeleton---Lyrics submitted by Michaella.
