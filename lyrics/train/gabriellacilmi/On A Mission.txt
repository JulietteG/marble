Its time for me to make a move
And I know what i gotta do
Coz I got everything to prove
I got a plan Im sticking to

The word is out all over town
But I dont let it get me down
I aint nobodys push around
If they could only see me now

Theres only one thing on my mind
And I'm running out of time
I'm coming through so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission, woah
Nothing can stop me, Im stronger than ever
I wanna see this through
I am a woman on a mission, woah
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

I'm gonna lay it on the line
I won't give up without a fight
Coz I can see the finish line
Won't stop till I make you mine
So read the writing on the wall 
I'm ready here and standing tall
So people think they know it all
So I guess I'll have to show them all

Theres only one thing on my mind
And I'm running out of time
I'm coming through so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission, woah
Nothing can stop me, Im stronger than ever
I wanna see this through
I am a woman on a mission, woah
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

Stand aside coz I'm on a mission
I'm on fire with no competition
You can't blame me I got intuition
And I never miss a trick just like a magician
don't need cash, don't need permission
Think I'm scared, you must be triping
Full on gas, key in ignition 
Can't stop now coz I'm on a mission

I am a woman on a mission, woah
Nothing can stop me, Im stronger than ever
I wanna see this through
I am a woman on a mission, woah
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

I never give up, I never give up, I never give up
I'm on a mission
I never give up, I never give up
I'm gonna see this through
I never give up, I never give up, I never give up
I'm on a mission
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do---Lyrics submitted by Paris.
