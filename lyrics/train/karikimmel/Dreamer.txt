I used to laugh aloud when you were around, now you're far away
Can't even hear me
With every other word you said to me as I fell asleep
Now they're fading whispers
I can't remember
I believed we were in this together
Giving everything for a chance at forever

I'm a dreamer
Who should've known better
But I thought you had a dream here too
I'm a dreamer who should've known better
Cuz now I have to live, I have to live
In this dream without you

With every other word you made me yours
With every wish you breathed
And every promise
Yeah, yeah
How did you read my mind,
Tell me every line that I longed to hear
Well you were so convincing
But you left me empty
I remember when we were both so naive
And now you're telling me that you never believed

I'm a dreamer
Who should've known better
But I thought you had a dream here too
I'm a dreamer who should've known better
Cuz now I have to live, I have to live
In this dream without you

And then it all becomes too much
Couldn't you fight a little harder for us
You traded dreams for reality
And promises you couldn't keep
And nothing was the way it seemed

I'm a dreamer
Who should've known better
But I thought you had a dream here too, yeah
I'm a dreamer who should've known better
Cuz now I have to live, I have to live
In this dream without you
I should've known better
Oh, and I thought you had a dream here too, yeah
I'm a dreamer
Who should've known better
Cuz now I have to live, I have to live in this dream without you---Lyrics submitted by Alex Jordan.
