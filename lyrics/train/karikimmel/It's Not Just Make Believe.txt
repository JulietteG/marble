Hey yeah ohhh yeah ohh yeah eah yeah

I thought that I was to old to believe in fairy tales
But there's a letter from you waitin' when I check my mail

I start to shakin' like a 7 on the Richter scale when you say you love me

Look in the mirror and I'm not who I used to be at all

It's coming clearer 

I'm Cinderella at the ball I'm Alice growing 10 feet tall 
It's not just make believe

Here comes the prince's kiss, I'm positive the slipper fits

It's not just make believe

It started out like just another ordinary day 
Now suddenly my life is different in every way

The sun is brighter ad the happiness is here to stay
It's like I'm dreaming

Thank you for showing me that true love doesn't hurt when you fall

You got me glowing 

I'm Cinderella at the ball I'm Alice growing 10 feet tall 

It's not just make believe

Here comes the prince's kiss 
I'm positive the slipper fits it's not just make believe

Whenever wherever forever I'll be with you 

We have it it's magic ohhhh

Look in the mirror and I'm not who I used to be at all

It's coming clearer

I'm Cinderella at the ball I'm Alice growing 10 feet tall
It's not just make believe

It's finally happening, I feel so good I gotta sing
It's not just make believe

I'm Ariel above the sea, I'm Beauty dancin' with the Beast

It's not just make believe

Here comes the prince's kiss I'm positive the slipper fits

It's not just make believe
Ohhh yeah 

It's not just make believe (it's not just make believe)
Ohhh yeah yeah ohhh yeah

It's not just make believe---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
