Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
La da da da da da da
Uhmmm... 

You walk on by 
Don't blink an eye 
It's kinda funny 
Got me wonderin' why 
Maybe I'm just not your type 
Or maybe I'm your Mr. Right 
I can be your Romeo 
You could be my Juliet 
Maybe I'm the one that you'll never forget 
I know that I'm just passing through 
But I might stay for you 

[Chorus:]
You've only got one life, one life to live 
I wanna give it everything I got 
Who knows this might be it for us 
So why don't we 
Live it up, 
Live it up darlin' 
Give it up 
My heart is starvin' 
Live it up, Give it up 
Oh oh 

Excuse me miss I don't mean to stare 
You got me hypnotized with your long, brown hair 
And your hazel eyes and your don't care smile 
Would it be rude to ask if I could stay a while 
I don't mean to intrude I had to say "Hello" 
'Cause if I never did then I would never know 
I may be just passing through 
But I might stay for you 

[Chorus:]
You've only got one life, one life to live 
I wanna give it everything I got 
Who knows this might be it for us 
So why don't we 
Live it up, 
Live it up darlin' 
Give it up 

My heart is starvin' 
Live it up, Give it up 
Oh oh 

And every second that passes me by 
And we're wasting precious time 
So let's find out what lies between 
You and me and the more we say "Hello"
Let's get this right 

So why don't we 
Live it up, 
Live it up darlin' 
Give it up 
My heart is starvin' 
Live it up, Give it up 
Oh oh 

You've only got one life, one life to live 
I wanna give it everything I got 
Who knows this might be it for us 
[X2]

So you got to 
Live it up 
Oh live it up darlin' 
Give it up now 
My heart is starvin' 
Live it up now 
Give it up 
Oh oh 

Live it up, 
Live it up darlin' 
Give it up 
My heart is starvin' 
Live it up, Give it up
