It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you until the bitter end

Now I'm on my back again
I surrender
How many times have I had to start over
Just when I'd thought I lost you forever
You turn around and say

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight fight for you until the bitter end

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you until the bitter end

You've seen me at my worst
So vacant
Just leave my here alone down on the pavement
How many times do I have to lie to you to be the person that you think I am

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you until the bitter end

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you and everything you have

For you kept me breathing while you were beating hell
You made me stronger while you were tougher
You gave me purpose
Yeah you gave it all

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you until the bitter end

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you until the bitter end

It's all for you
For you my friend
And I will fight for you until the bitter end

It's all for you
For you
It's all for you---Lyrics submitted by Mady.
