As I sat there by the bedside of a friend who's passing on,
He recalled the memories of his life, and the years that have gone.
I listened to each story, There was one I didn't know.
An incident that happned some forty years ago.

As he sat there in the evening, he remembered long ago,
A little girl he saaw one night, standing by thge road.
He stoppede his car to offer help. She seemed to be alone.
She got into the car and asked if he would taker her home.

(break-8 bars)

Though his life is swiftly fading, the memory remains
Of that chilly, ghostly evening while driving in the rain.
It seems to give him comfort as he's drawing near the end.
A look of piece comes over him as if he sees a friend.

As the shadows fall across his face, there's a vision thatnhe sees,
Of a little girl all dressed in white, who spoke so quietly.
You gave me comfort years ago, when I was so alone,
She said, "My name is Mary, and I've come to take you home."
