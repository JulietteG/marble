Rode out of Savanna, headed up the seaboard 
Tryin' to sing an old gospel song to recall long-ago
It was something 'bout living the good life like Jesus had taught
And turning your back to the dark side of life, and facing the Son

I've got no one to blame but myself for all the trouble I've seen 
I'm riding this long lonesome road, in search of some dream 
Where ever I'm going, things won't seem much different at home
Til I come to look at myself and answer your call 

Gathered friends all around me, to listen to my side of it all 
But they don't want to listen, they know, they can't answer your call 
I've run out of excuses, a running and hiding, I've got to turn my face from the wall 
Then maybe someone will hear me, O Lord, and I can run after all---Lyrics submitted by milt baker.
