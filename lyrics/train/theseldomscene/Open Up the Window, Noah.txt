A little bird flew to the window and mourned (?)
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
Get ready O Noah, for this coming storm
Open up the window, let the dove fly in

CHORUS
Open up the window, Noah
Open up the window, Noah
Open up the window, Noah
Open up the window, let the dove fly in

For forty long days, it will be stormy and dark
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
So, Noah, get ready, build you an ark
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
CHORUS

Now the water's risin' there's no time to lose
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
Go gather the creatures all in by twos
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
CHORUS

A little bird flew to the window and mourned (?)
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
Get ready O Noah, for this coming storm
Open up the window, let the dove fly in
CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Margaret Aumack.
