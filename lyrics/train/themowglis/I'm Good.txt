Im good, Im good, Im good
Livin life just like I should
Wouldnt change it if I could
Im good, Im good, Im good, Im good

Tryin to figure out who I am
Or what Im supposed to be
And feel good about where I stand
So I can make the most of me, Im
Comin back down from space
Felt a million miles away
But theres a lot of love in this place
Im letting go of yesterday, Im good

Im good, Im good, Im good
Livin life just like I should
Wouldnt change it if I could
Im good, Im good, Im good

Spent a long time livin this way
Worrying what people say
Feelin like I dont fit in
Now Im done playin pretend
I dont want to be like everybody else
I was born to break through,
I was born to stand out
It took awhile but now I see
Aint nobody better to be but me, Im good

You only live once (YOLO)
Im good by myself (SOLO)
Hangin out with my friends (LOCO)
Until the music ends (OH NO)

You only live once (YOLO)
Im good by myself (SOLO)
Hangin with my friends (LOCO)
Until the music ends (OH NO)

I wanna see another love revolution
Found a way to be a better person
If we come together like we should
We could all be good, Im good---
