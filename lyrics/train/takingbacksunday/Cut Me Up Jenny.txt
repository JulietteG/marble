Oh...

On a borrowed mattress you were stopping time
I've been watching you
I've been watching you
For hours and hours before you knew, ooh
You are the satin noose
I've been saving up to buy...you.
You are the polished-pearl grips of your fathers .45,

Give me all those gory details,
Do tell, do tell.
So cut me up, Jenny,
Well, cut me up gently

I took full advantage of
Being taken full advantage of
Yeah, I took what I could get
And eventually it took the place of love
The match-makers in heaven,
Oh, they've got a one-track mind
So in our case, I don't think they mind
Alright...

Finger prints, a perfect match
And no you didn't have to leave the way you did
I've been watching you
I've been watching you
Most times you never knew.

You are a Sunday afternoon
With nothing to do
You are Manhattan in June
As the population's wearing next to nothing.
So cut me up, Jenny
Well, cut me up gently.

I took full advantage of
Being taken full advantage of
Yeah, I took what I could get
And eventually it took the place of love
The match-makers in heaven,
Oh, they got a one-track mind
So in our case, I don't think they mind
No in our case, I don't think they mind
So cut me up, Jenny
Well, cut me up gently

Yeah...
Talking about our prayer
Is it gonna make me swear?
Yeah, move on, right on

Give me all those gory details,
Do tell, do tell.
So cut me up, Jenny,
Well, cut me up gently.

I took full advantage of
Being taken full advantage of
Yeah, I took what I could get
And eventually it took the place of love
The match-makers in heaven,
Oh, they've got a one-track mind
So in our case, I don't think they mind

So cut me up, Jenny
(Cut me up Jenny)
Cut me up gently
(Cut me up gently)
So cut me up, Jenny
(Cut me up Jenny)
Well, cut me up gently
(Cut me up gently)
So cut me up, Jenny
(Cut me up, Jenny)
Cut me up, Jenny
(Cut me up, Jenny)
Well, cut me up gently
(Cut me up gently)
Cut me up, Jenny
Cut me up gently---Lyrics submitted by Simeon.
