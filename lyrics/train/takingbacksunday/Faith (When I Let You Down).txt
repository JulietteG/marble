You might lose your faith in science.
You might lose your faith in wealth.
You might lose your faith in Jesus,
Or lose your faith in yourself.

But when I let you down,
Look past your doubt.
Just, please please, don't lose your faith in me.

You could lose your faith in music,
Or lose your faith in friends.
You could lose your faith in freedom,
Feel trapped in your own skin.
I'll be right there beside you,
When the walls are caving in,
I swear, oh, I'm not going anywhere.

But when I let you down,
Look past your doubt.
Just, please please, don't lose your faith in me.
Please, don't lose your faith in me.

I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.

But when I let you down,
Look past your doubt.
Just, please please, don't lose your faith in me.
Please, don't lose your faith in me,
I'm not going anywhere.---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina.
