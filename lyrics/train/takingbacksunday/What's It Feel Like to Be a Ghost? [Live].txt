And then you said a little more about your dreams, like that was my call (my call)
"If you would only listen"
By passed everything and went straight for the neck
(I study)
We're studied
(Up nightly)
Dragged you out into the streets before you buckled at your knees
(Buckled at your knees)

"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"

Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for..)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for..)

This is quick but not quite painless
It sits perched on your arm
Tacky and irrelevant (So what?)
A permanent reminder that, Ohh christ...
(Ill start)
we'll start
(Up nightly)
Drag you out into the streets before you buckled at your knees
(buckle)

What's it feel like to be a ghost?
(Well, louder now, louder now)
What's it feel like to be a ghost?

Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for..)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for..)

I said so, look closely
there might be something you'd like
What was it like?
(oh and I...)
I look so close but it's been months who knows if I
will get this right...
(Oh and I..)
look so closely, there might be something you'd like
What was it like?

Oh and I...

So, what's it feel like to be a ghost?
(Well, louder now, louder now.)
What's it feel like to be a ghost? Ahh
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Are you up for, are you up for...)---Lyrics submitted by robyn.
