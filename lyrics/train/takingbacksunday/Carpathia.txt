I'm gonna leave the same way I came
Up from the ashes, then out from the ashes
If our house had stood here on this wood foundation
Then you, you could've fooled me
I admit I was a fool for your southern days
(One hundred and fifty degrees in the shade)
It wasn't an option to go back to my place
(No, I was put in my place)
And you...

We lived in separate houses
We have for all our lives
It would've been nice to say
(It would've been nice to say)
Sure would've been nice to say I knew you
When, oh, when will this sinking feeling
Feel like, Man, that was ages ago?

I don't worry half as much as I did
When I was an experiment, your resident tourniquet
Life's not about your neck
Wait, just what is it?
I am a mantle, and you're a painting
Come rest your frame on me
(Come rest your frame on me)
I was a tower, and you were an airplane
We happened before we knew what was happening

We lived in separate houses
We have for all our lives
It would've been nice to say
(It would've been nice to say)
Sure would've been nice to say...
When, oh, when will this sinking feeling
Feel like, Man, that was ages ago?
When, oh, when will this sinking feeling
Feel like, Man, that was ages ago?

Man, that was ages ago...
Man, that was ages ago...

(Man, that was ages ago...)
We lived inside each other
Such careless, lazy lovers
(Man, that was ages ago...)
Would've been nice to say
Sure would've been nice to say

When, oh, when will this sinking feeling
Feel like, Man, that was ages ago?
When, oh, when will this sinking feeling
Feel like, Man, that was ages ago?

(Man, that was ages ago...)
Man, that was ages ago...---Lyrics submitted by Simeon.
