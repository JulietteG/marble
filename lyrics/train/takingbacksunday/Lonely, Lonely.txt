Your flower tongue wilts with too much sun
And that's where we've been living for so long
She's still sending off the western coast
And watch the sun set with your shrinking voice
See, I ain't the boy she loves the most
I'm just enough to fill the void her daddy left.

Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
Don't you go changing for me.
(She says)
"Wanna get me high?"
(She says)
"Wanna get me high?"
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
Don't you go changing for me.

But I often wondered just how deep I could
Sink my teeth into that crease on your arm
The place where all the good times,
They grow and grow.

Would it taste the same, the same for me?
Yeah, would it sound the same coming from me?
Such an awful tearing sound.

Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
Don't you go changing for me.
(She says)
"Wanna get me high?"
(She says)
"Wanna get me high?"
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
Don't you go changing for me.
Changing for me...

Oh, all the things they said about you,
Paper thin walls stacked around you,
An hour glass is silhouetting them.

No matter how hard I try
Or how dirty you fight
There is no place on God's great Earth
Where you can go to hide from me

Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
Don't you go changing for me.
(She says)
Wanna get me high?
(She says)
Wanna get me high?
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
Don't you go changing for me.
Changing for me...---Lyrics submitted by Simeon.
