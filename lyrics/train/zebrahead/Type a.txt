Shut up, I'm not like you
Back of, don't smother me
Fuck this, I see through you
Suffer me through

Shut up, I'm not like you
Shut up, I'm not like you
Shut up, I'm not like you
Suffer me through

Type A, fly away, don't lie

I wont let you get the best of me
I wont let you get the best of me
I wont let you get the best of me
If I try, If I try

Oh God, I can't stand you
Disappoint you with me
One day you'll come done too
Suffer me through

Shut up, I'm not like you
Shut up, I'm not like you
Shut up, I'm not like you
Suffer me through

Type A, fly away, don't lie

I wont let you get the best of me
I wont let you get the best of me
I wont let you get the best of me
If I try, If I try

I wont let you get the best of me
I wont let you get the best of me
I wont let you get the best of me
If I try, If I try---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
