Pariah dogs and wandering madmen
 Barking at strangers and speaking in tongues
 The ebb and flow of tidal fortune
 Electrical changes are charging up the young

It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit
 It's a far cry from the way we thought we'd share it
 You can almost feel the current flowing
 You can almost see the circuits blowing

One day I feel I'm on top of the world
 And the next it's falling in on me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on
 One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel,
 And the next it's rolling over me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on

Whirlwind life of faith and betrayal
 Rise in anger, fall back, and repeat
 Slow degrees on the dark horizon
 Full moon rising lays silver at your feet

It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit
 It's a far cry from the way we thought we'd share it
 You can almost feel the current flowing
 You can almost see the circuits blowing

One day I feel I'm on top of the world
 And the next it's falling in on me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on
 One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel,
 And the next it's rolling over me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on

It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit
 You can almost see the circle growing
 You can almost feel the planet glowing

One day I feel I'm on top of the world
 And the next it's falling in on me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on
 One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel,
 And the next it's rolling over me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on

One day I fly through a crack in the sky
 And the next it's falling in on me
 I can get back on
 I can get back on---Lyrics submitted by Megan Truesdale.
