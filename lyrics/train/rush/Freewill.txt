There are those who think that life has nothing left to chance
A host to holy horrors to direct our aimless dance
A planet of play things
We dance on the strings
Of powers we cannot perceive
The stars aren't aligned or the gods are malign
Blame is better to give than receive

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose freewill

There are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand
The cards were stacked against them
They weren't born in Lotusland
All preordained a prisoner in chains
A victom of venomous fate
Kicked in the face
You can't pray for a place in heaven's unearthly estate

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose freewill

Each of us a cell of awareness
Imperfect and incomplete
Genetic blends with uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose freewill---Lyrics submitted by ron.
