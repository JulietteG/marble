Whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah!

And the meek shall inherit the earth

Ooh, we've taken care of every thing 
the words you hear, the songs you sing
the pictures that give pleasure to your eye

It's one for all,  all for one
we work together, common son 
never need to wonder how or why

we are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls

we are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
all the gifts of life 
are held within these walls

Look around this world we've made 
equality our stock in trade
come and join the brotherhood of man
oh, what a nice, contented world
let the banners be unfurled
Hold the red star proudly high in hand

we are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls

we are the priests of the temples of Syrinx
all the gifts of life 
are held within these walls

What can this strange device be?
when I touch it, it gives forth a sound
it's got wires that vibrate and gives music
what can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain or notes that fall gently like rain

I can't wait to share this new wonder
the people will all see its light
let them all make their own music
the priests praise my name on this night

I know it's most unusual
to come before you so
but I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know
listen to my music
and hear what it can do
there's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

yes, we know, it's nothing new 
it's just a waste of time
we have no need for ancient ways
our world is doin' fine
another toy that helped destroy
the elder race of man

forget about your silly whim
it doesn't fit the plan, No! 

I can't believe your're saying
these things just can't be true
our world could use this beauty
just think what we might do
listen to my music and hear what it can do
there's something here that's as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Don't annoy us further!
Oh, we have our work to do
just think about the average
what use have they for you?
another toy that helped destroy
the elder race of man
forget about your silly whim
it doesn't fit the plan!

I wandered home through silent streets
and fell into a fitful sleep
excaped to realms beyond the night
Dream, can't you show me light?

I stand a top a spiral stair
an oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
through astral nights, galactic days
I see the works of gifted hands
that grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise 
with hungry mind and open eyes

they left our planets long ago
the elder race still learn and grow
their power grows with purpose strong
to claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the temples down
Home to change!

The sleep is still in my eyes
the dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
and lie awhile in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
not fade like all my dreams...

Just think of what my life might be
in a world like I have seen!

I don't think I can carry on
carry on this cold and empty life
oh no

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
my life blood spills over

Attention all planets of the solar federation

Attention all planets of the solar federation

Attention all planets of the solar federation
