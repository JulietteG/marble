Well, I can see what you mean - it just takes me longer 
And, I can feel what you feel - it just makes you stronger 

Well, you can take me for a little while 
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end 

Yes, you can 

I can see what you mean - it just takes me longer 
And, I can feel what you feel - it just makes you stronger 

I know, I know, I know 
The feeling grows 
I see, I see, I see 
It's got to be 

Oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah 

I can do what you do - you just do it better 
And, I can cry like you cry - it just makes me sadder 

I know, I know, I know 
The feeling grows 
I see, I see, I see 
It's got to be 

Oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah yeah 

Oh, you can take me for a little while 
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end 

Oh, yeah 

I can shine like you shine - it don't make me brighter 
But, if I think, Lord, like you think - it don't make my load much lighter 

I can see what you mean - it just takes me longer 
And, I can feel what you feel - it just makes me stronger 

Oh, yeah yeah 
Oh, yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Indy Goiiz.
