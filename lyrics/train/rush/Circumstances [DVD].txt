A boy alone so far from home
Endless roof-tops from my window
I felt the view of empty rooms
On many afternoons

Sometimes in confusion
I get so lost and disillusioned
Innocence gave me confidence
To go up against reality

[CHORUS]:
All the same we take our chances
Locked up by time
Tricked by Circumstances
Plus a change
Plus c'est la mme chose
The more that things change, 
The more they stay the same

Now I have some understanding
Of the only world that we see
Things that I once dreamed of
Have become reality

These walls that still surround me
Still contain the same old me
Just one more who searching for
The world that ought to be

[CHORUS]x2---Lyrics submitted by Frank Mayer.
