Don't believe in Jesus
Don't believe in Jah
Don't believe in the wars 
we fight just to prove how real we are

I believe in lovers, I believe in friends
I believe in heaven here on earth
'til the, the beginning ends

Love me and leave me
Love me and leave me
Love me and leave me
Leave me to love
Don't you ever tell me it came from above
Just love me and leave me
Leave me to love

I believe in heroes, I believe in stars
I believe that we'll meet one day
say hello in some astral bar

I believe in brothers I know
you know who you are
Here's to those who bore us and
made us what we are---Lyrics submitted by Sandesh.
