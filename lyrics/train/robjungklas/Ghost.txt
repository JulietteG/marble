The weight of all this water
The weight of all this dirt
My flesh and blood turn into mud
But it don't hurt

The weight of all this beauty
The weight of my desire
And I am buried underneath
In a sepulcher of spiritual fire

I am a ghost
I am a ghost now baby
I am a ghost
Forsake this world and follow me

I am dead and I am living
I don't which is worse
Not having any water
Or not having any thirst

I am a ghost
I am a ghost now baby
I am a ghost
Forsake this world and follow me

Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
You sure can't come too(?)

In the crucible of consciousness
We make our heaven and our hell
I'm pretty sure this place is neither one
You'd think I could tell

I am a ghost
I am a ghost now baby
I am a ghost
Forsake this world and follow me---Lyrics submitted by skylos.
