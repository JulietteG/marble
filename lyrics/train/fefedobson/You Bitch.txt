My heart stopped beating
The day that you got busy
Busy diggin' my grave

D-d-d-dyin'
D-d-d-dyin'
D-d-d-dyin' here

And oh like
Like outta nowhere you changed
So got that feeling
Feeling it in my pain

D-d-d-dyin'
All used up from crying
I'm d-d-dyin' here

You bitch, he's mine
You're such a waste of time
You better give him back to me

You bitch, he's mine
Go, find some other guy
You better give him back to me

Oh, you can't love him like I love him
You don't know him like I know him

You bitch, he's mine
You're a waste of time
You better give him back to me
Back to me

So watch your front and your back
'Cause you can't take him
Away from me like that

See you never tell the truth
And all you do is lie
It doesn't really bother you
To know that I'm not fine

I'm d-d-d-dyin'
All used up from crying
I'm d-d-dyin' here
D-d-d-dyin' here

You bitch, he's mine
You're such a waste of time
You better give him back to me

You bitch, he's mine
Go, find some other guy
You better give him back to me

Oh, you can't love him like I love him
You don't know him like I know him

You bitch, he's mine
You're a waste of time
You better give him back to me
Back to me

Yeah, somebody's gonna pay for this one
Nobody's gonna break my heart again
Somebody's gonna pay for this one
Gimme what's mine
So I can finally breathe again
I'm dying here

D-d-d-dyin'
All used up from crying
I'm d-d-dyin' here

You bitch, he's mine
You're such a waste of time
You better give him back to me

You bitch, he's mine
Go, find some other guy
You better give him back to me

Oh, you can't love him like I love him
You don't know him like I know him

You bitch, he's mine
You're a waste of time
You better give him back to me

You bitch, he's mine
Go, find some other guy
You better give him back, back
Give him back, back to me---Lyrics submitted by Kari.
