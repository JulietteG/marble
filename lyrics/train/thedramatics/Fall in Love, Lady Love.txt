Would you hear me
If I called your name out loud
Could you see me
With your head stuck in a cloud?

How can you see
That I'm in love with you
When you ignore me so
Wandering to and fro
HUng up on yourself 

Oh!

Fall in love, lady love
Be my lady, please lady love.

You could touch me
If you would just hold out your hand
I'm always near you
Trying hard as I can

to make you notice
that I"m in love with you,
But you just walk on by
Head up high
Hung up on yourself 

Oh!

Fall in love, lady love
Be my lady, please lady love

I'm so in love with you, lady love
Be my lady, please lady love
Fall in love, lady love
Be my lady, please lady love

I'm so in love with you, lady love
Be my lady, please lady love.

Fall in love. Lady love---Lyrics submitted by Matthew Stelly.
