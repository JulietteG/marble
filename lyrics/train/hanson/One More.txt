I sit here by myself 
Just staring into space
I thought I knew you well 
Well who can ever say

It seems Ive spent so long 
I cant define my right from wrong

One more for the night
And one more for the pain and 
One more, long goodbye 
And one shot to the brain 
And one more takes the knife 
And one more takes the train
Who do I name today

A dream of better days 
Has long gone by the way
Is there a better place 
Well who can ever say

It seems Ive spent so long 
I cant define my right from wrong

One more for the night
And one more for the pain and 
One more, long goodbye 
And one shot to the brain 
And one more takes the knife 
And one more takes the blame
Who do I name today
Who do I blame today

Nothings over til its over
And if its over I dont want to hear it
Look into my eyes I told her
Holding on to what is gone wont heal it

It seems Ive spent so long
I cant define my right from wrong

One more for the night
And one more for the pain and
One more, long goodbye 
And one shot to the brain 
And one more takes the knife 
And one more takes the train
Who do I name today
Who do I blame today---Lyrics submitted by jill.
