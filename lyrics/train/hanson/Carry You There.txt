Well I don't care, what you say 
I don't have use for your words anyway 
You don't need a Cadillac 
cause I'll be waiting with my bare back 
to carry you there 

Try and you don't have to be afraid 
to just rely 
on someone to hold away part of you child 
It's alright 
You can get to much to handle by yourself 
If you can't do it alone I know you will say 
I don't know what's at stake 
Or what it takes 

(chorus): 
Well I don't care, what you say 
I don't have use for your words anyway 
you don't need a Cadillac 
cause I'll be waiting with my bare back 
To carry you there 

Turn around 
and you just might see the good 
you've left behind 
But you're all caught up 
in what's still left to find 
and it's never enough 
so slow down 
and the root of what you're feeling might appear 
when all the pushin' up the hill has brought you here 
and you're used up 
to the line 
if you tell me you are fine 

Well I don't care, what you say 
I don't have use for your words anyway 
you don't need a Cadillac 
Cause I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting) 
To carry you there 
Oh yeah 

Say - don't be too proud 
I'm holding my hand out 
You've been my friend on darker days 
See, I'll still be there 
Despite your despair 
And I don't really care what you say 
hey hey hey 

I'll carry you there 
I will carry you there
