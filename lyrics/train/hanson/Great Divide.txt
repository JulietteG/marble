The earth is shaking under seige
And every breath we'll meet is fate
Still we hunger for a moment of freedom
Even though the hour is late

I find hope and it gives me rest
I find hope in a beating chest
I find hope in what eyes don't see
I find hop in your hate for me
Have no fear when the waters rise
We can conquer this great divide

When every eye is on the fortune
It can only breed contempt
They say bloos is thicker than oceans
Still we box our brothers in

I find hope and it gives me rest
I find hope in a beating chest
I find hope in what eyes don't see
I find hop in your hate for me
Have no fear when the waters rise
We can conquer this great divide

Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
And we're gone
And we're gone
And we're, holding on
And we're, holding on
And we're, holding on

I find hope and it gives me rest
I find hope in a beating chest
I find hope in what eyes don't see
I find hop in your hate for me
Have no fear when the waters rise
We can conquer this great divide

Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo---Lyrics submitted by Laurie.
