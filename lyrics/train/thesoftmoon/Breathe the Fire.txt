Take a deep breath and let the stories begin
I'm having flash backs
Now and again
I feel like I did before
I see the signs that I try to ignore

No one else can tell me
Who I am
Its safe to say that I'm to blame
But I can't change

Breathe the fire
And fade away
Breathe away your innocence
And taste the flames

And now it's got you crawling
Back ashamed
Cause' I'll never be free from your games

Take a deep breath
This one last time
I see my face reflected
From between the lines

Lost inside the skin I shed
voices screaming in my head
No one else can tell me
Who I am

Its safe to say that I'm to blame
But I can't change

Breathe the fire
And fade away
Breathe away your innocence
And taste the flames

And now it's got you crawling
Back ashamed
But I'll never be free from your games

Breathe the fire
And fade away
Breathe away your innocence
And taste the flames

And now it's got you crawling
Back ashamed
Cause' I'll never be free

Breathe the fire
And fade away
Breathe away your innocence
And taste the flames

And now it's got you crawling
Back ashamed
Cause' I'll never be free

Breathe the fire
And fade away
Breathe away your innocence
And taste the flames

And now it's got you crawling
Back ashamed
But I'll never be free from your games---Lyrics submitted by Effy.
