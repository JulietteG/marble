Though you dont call anymore
I seat in wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane (2)

I wanna tell u babe
The changes Ive been going through
Missing you, missing u
til u come back to me 
thats what Im gonna do 

Why did u have to decide?
You had to set me free
Im gonna swallow my pride
Beg u to please, babe please see me 
Im gonna walk by myself
Just to proof that my love is true 
Ohhh, for you babe
till u come back to me
Thats what Im gonna do 

Living for u my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea 
Ive got to make you see
That our love is dying 

Although ur phone u ignore
Somehow I must explain 
I m gonna rap on ur door
Tap on you window pane

Im gonna get by ur steps
until I COULD PROVE TO YOU 
Ive got to change your view babe
Till u come back to me 
thats what Im gonna do (3) 

I m gonna knock on ur door
Tap on, and tap on your, and tap on your, and tap on your window pane 
open up babe 

I m gonna rap on ur door
Tap on you window pane---Lyrics submitted by Lorraine.
