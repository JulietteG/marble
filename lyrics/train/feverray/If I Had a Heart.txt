This will never end cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more
This will never end cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more


If I had a heart I could love you
if I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings

Aaaaah aaaaah
aaaaah ... If I had a voice I would sing

Dangling feet from window frame
will I ever ever reach the floor?
More, give me more, give me more
Crushed and filled with all I found
underneath and inside just to come around
More, give me more, give me more

Aaaaaah aaaaaah
aaaaaahhh ... If I had a voice I would sing---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlyn.
