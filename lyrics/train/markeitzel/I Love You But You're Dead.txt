Let's go toast the twilight at the old horror house 
It's the graveyard, the music's loud, the future's bleak 
And we'll say hi to Lead Pipe, books the bands, says he's free 
Squeals like a pig when forced to speak 

The speaker stack is covered in thick pile of dust 
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, gimme me something I can use 
I wanna get messed up and give up and end up somewhere else 
Sometimes, you don't wanna choose 

It's a plywood stage and the carpets are rotten 
The band is so loud they're lighter than air 
The singer's heart and soul had long since been bled 
And like the ocean she didn't care 

The music, it was blasting 
And i couldn't hear what she said 
Oh, but when she signed my poster 
She wrote i love you (x3)
But you're dead 

The guitar was pure evil, like the engines on a jet 
The singer is beautiful and oh so bored 
When she started crawling around on the ground 
Well, honey, you bet I've been down on that beer-soaked floor 

Lead Pipe fell in love, said wouldcha lookit that slut 
Beauty brought what was left of him to the edge of despair 
He said, for a little I bet she would do a whole lot 
'Cause you'll do anything when you're not really there 

The music, it was blasting 
And i couldn't hear what she said 
Oh, but when she signed my poster 
She wrote i love you (x3)
But you're dead
She wrote i love you (x3)
But you're dead

Now tonight I wanna disappear so wish me Godspeed 
For membership to the human race I give up all claim
And I'll control my arms and my legs and my hands and my hair and my face 
Like I'm holding a gun in a video game---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
