I know it's my job to smile and wave
And bring you into the magic
But in your snake eyes everything dies
And makes our costumes seem tragic

I did not mean to scare your sad little brat
And also being right don't make you true
And hey, if pixie dust is not in your heart
It becomes the dirt that buries you

I don't believe in the future, it's all going to shit
But I thought we could still put on a show
The doubts you share are the autumn to despair
It's like watching ashes fall on snow

And when I walk 
Down Main Street USA
I wave and smile 
But look no one in the eye

When I walk 
Down Main Street USA
Through faces 
Too deadly to die

And when I walk 
Down Main Street USA
I wave and smile
And say my goodbyes

And when I walk 
Down Main Street USA
This is all over
This is just a lie

I know it's my job to smile and wave
Hey, can you tell me my crime
Honestly dear, it drains my soul 
To be the mean focus of your fake good time---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
