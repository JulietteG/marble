Lyrics to Crank It Up :
Crank it up! 
If you're by the stereo yo I'm telling you to 
Whack that up! 
And even if you're not can you please make sure that you 
Get the fuck up! 
No joking around I'm telling you 
Show some love! 
Please can you show some Love 

Rip the tune off the compact disc and drag-drop into your favourites playlist 
Convert to MP3 and give it 5 stars in your itunes library 
Set as your profile song and show the hipsters your first quote this one 
Bluetooth the file to your phone and set this track as your default ringtone 

We'll show you what we're doing cranking up the decibels 
We're gonna take control so bring your drinks and alcohol 
If you were born for the party 
If you live for the night 
If you're there for the moment 
If you're up for the ride 

Crank it up! 
If you're by the stereo yo I'm telling you to 
Whack that up! 
And even if you're not can you please make sure that you 
Get the fuck up! 
No joking around I'm telling you 
Show some love! 
Please can you show some love 

Stick this tune in your portable pod and make a playlist with this track at the top 
Find out your phono to jack lead, crank it up and make your ears bleed 
Steal this tune from a download site and stick it on repeat all Saturday night 
Log on to your MSN and spread this tune like a virus trojan 

Do what you wanna wanna, Crank it up! 
And now your gonna gonna, Whack that up! 
So when you wanna, Show some love? 
Cos we just wanna, cos we just wanna 

Crank it up! 
If you're by the stereo yo I'm telling you to 
Whack that up! 
And even if you're not can you please make sure that you 
Get the fuck up! 
No joking around I'm telling you 
Show some love! 
Please can you show some love 

Do what you wanna wanna 
And now your gonna gonna 
So when you wanna 
Cos we just wanna 
Cos we just wanna 

Crank it up! 
If you're by the stereo yo I'm telling you to 
Whack that up! 
And even if you're not can you please make sure that you 
Get the fuck up! 
No joking around I'm telling you 
Show some love! 
Please can you show some love---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
