Just turn me loose
I'm balling out
I'm doing my thing tonight, baby
I'm here to say
Get out my way
Or turn me loose

Jesus is coming
I hope that she gets here soon
'Cause what I saw you blazing
I knew you came and made my prayers true now
And I know you're sick and tired of the fallen ones
I'll be your only gone so higher
And lies

Just turn me loose
I'm balling out
I'm doing my thing tonight, baby
I'm here to say
Get out my way
Or turn me loose

When you make money money
Make money money
Make
Take your money money
Take your money money
Take

When you make money money
Make money money
Make
Take your money money
Take your money money
Take

Gotta get original
Gotta get new kicks and learn new tricks before I fall
Gotta keep the title
American medal
You think it's right to be embattled for desire

When night falls
We get serious
Turn it up
Turn me loose
On your stereo

When night falls
We get serious
Turn it up
Turn me loose
On your stereo

Just turn me loose
I'm balling out
I'm doing my thing tonight, baby
I'm here to say
Get out my way
Or turn me loose

All my life, I've been here waiting
For love to turn me loose
And like a pain to you we're painting
Portrait of my face to show we are a proof
I'm love I

I'm balling out
I'm doing my thing tonight, baby
I'm here to say
Get out my way
Or turn me loose

Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't nothing you can do
To despair from the show
'Cause my mama does say
Just be yourself
And you'll be everybody, baby---
