Gather 'round the beat like a campfire
Gather 'round the beat like a campfire
Gather 'round the beat like a campfire
Singin' folk songs, but not no Kumbaya my Lord

Play like Timmies, all we had, nothing else on 46
Play like Timmies, all we had, nothing else on 46
Got you caught up in the mix
Just 'cause I know the late night---
