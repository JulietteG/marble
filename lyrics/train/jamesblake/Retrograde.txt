Youre on your own, in a world youve grown 
Few more years to go, 
Dont let the hurdle fall 
So be the girl you loved, 
Be the girl you loved 

Ill wait, so show me why youre strong 
Ignore everybody else, 
Were alone now 
Ill wait, so show me why youre strong 
Ignore everybody else, 
Were alone now 

Suddenly Im hit 
Is this darkness of the dawn 
And your friends are gone 
When you friends wont come 
So show me where you fit 
So show me where you fit 

Ill wait, so show me why youre strong 
Ignore everybody else, 
Were alone now 
Were alone now 
Were alone now 
Ill wait 
Were alone now 
Were alone now 
Ill wait 
Were alone now 
Were alone now 
Were alone now 
Were alone now 

Suddenly Im hit 
Is this darkness of the dawn 
And your friends are gone 
When you friends wont come 
So show me where you fit 
So show me where you fit---
