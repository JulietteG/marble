Can you hear Jerusalem's Cry?
Can you see the storm on the rise?
Look around, you can't deny
This is the hour of heavens time.

Army's gather in th east,
For the war thats soon to come.
Death will march with the mark of 

the beast, 
So seek the light and walk with the sun.

Soon We'll see his wrath come down,
And the Lord, descending from the sky.
When you hear the trumpets sound,
God has answered Jerusalem's Cry.

When the sun goes black,
And the moon blood red, 
And the stars fall from the sky,
The word of God, in the bible says,
We are living, in the end times.

Soon We'll see his wrath come down,
And the Lord, descending from the sky.
When you hear the trumpet sound,
God has answered Jerusalem's Cry.
God has answered Jerusalem's Cry.

Soon the dead and Christ will rise,
And join Him in the sky.
And even non-believers will see
God has answered Jerusalem's Cry.
God has answered Jerusalem's Cry.---Lyrics submitted by Amanda B.
