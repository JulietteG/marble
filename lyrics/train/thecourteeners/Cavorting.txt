Your club is full of over rated, dehydrated, goggled eyed girls,
And their trying to stare at me, but their eyes are rattling and theyre struggling to see

And she cant stand still because of sixteen pills that
shes taken in the mini bus,
Her conscience followed her into the night, gave her mum a fright,
I said Fuck that it is her own fault for letting her out of her sight

And now youre too tired to eat, and youre too hungry to sleep,
Youre hooligan on E and were too tired to bother with any of you

Cavorting, and snorting your way through the band,
Get your hand out of my trouser leg,
Were turning up tonight but only to knock u down a peg or two

And now youre too tired to eat, and youre too hungry to sleep,
Youre hooligan on E and were too tired to bother with any of you

Your club is full of over rated, dehydrated, goggled eyed girls,
And their trying to stare at me, but their eyes are rattling and theyre struggling to see

And now youre too tired to eat, and youre too hungry to sleep,
Were Gentlemen arent we? and were articulate to bother with any of you---Lyrics submitted by Calvyn.
