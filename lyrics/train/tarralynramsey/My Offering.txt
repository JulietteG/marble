I offer you my praise
I give you all my love
This is all I owe, this is my offering
(Repeat)

I offer up this heart, a sweet melody 
A divine interpretation of my indebtedness to thee
Oh please receive it Jesus
Receive it freely from me
I give you my body, my spirit and my soul
This is all I know Lord, You are in control

I offer you my praise
I give you all my love
This is all I owe, this is my offering
(Repeat)

I give all of me, cause you gave your best to me
You died to save a wretch like me......on Calvary
Oh, Please receive it, receive it Jesus
Receive it freely from me
I give you my body, my spirit and my soul Lord
This is all I know Lord, You are in control

I offer you my praise
I give you all my love
This is all I owe, this is my offering
(Repeat)

this is my offering, this is my offering, this is my offering---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Pryce.
