So created in me a clean heart
And renew the right spirit within me
Lord wash me with hyssop and I shall be clean
Purge me from all of my inequities
And I shall be cleaned 
Cause Your return is for
People without spot or wrinkle
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless

Lord since I've opened my eyes
I realized I've got oh so far to go
So this is my earnest prayer Lord
Cleanse me from all of my unrighteous
And I shall be cleaned 
Cause Your return is for
People without spot or wrinkle
Lord I want to be teach me to be oh faultless
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless

Nothing but the pure and heart
Shall see God
So let's Your spirit cry out to me
Faultless

Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless
Lord I want to be teach me to be faultless

When I stand before You present me simply faultless---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
