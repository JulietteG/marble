"Black Friday Rule"

I want to believe in myself once again 
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end 
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you 
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

And for every tear that is lost from an eye 
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy 
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold 
But all I remember is the freedom of old

Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane 
Flew all the way to California 
This mess in my head is a mess getting out 
Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout

But after a while, when my mouth's not so dry 
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine 
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed 
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

The buildings they shake but my heart it beats still 
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill 
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe 
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state

So I must remain in my new adopted land 
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can 
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name 
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe 
I've been down in this world, down and almost broken 
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
