We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm

For one sacrifice,
they have schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife
I've got an appetite
for nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by
Ooh metaphors
Views that are better for you can't survive or find your competitor
Rise together
Ooh Fight separate wars i pray I'm never forced to be a predator

Suspecting we won't last
They're glad to hate but gladiators breed their last
Scream or mash for their dreams do clash
Like swords in the war let me bleed on that
Put the heat on that
Cept we need strong backs
You call us weak and don't redeem contracts
Well this speech won't last
If the beast attacks
The sons and the fathers will be free at last

This is love, it's not not treason
This is love, it's not treason
This is love, it's not treason
This is love, this is not treason

They see sharks in the estuary
They claim the ark is Bartholomew's
They say war is necessary
But we say war is child abuse

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

Take to the core we're the one's we've been waiting for
We hold steady, steady on the step of door
The type of you are matadors and matadors are capable
Forgive the death and settle scores and test the metal and the ore

What's your plan go to do with me?
If the bell tolls us let freedom ring
And find the new ways that we must be king
Instead of leading the young to our suffering

The past test of this
Now screams back in heaven
For testing us like wednesdays at 11
Want to recruit and train us to act evilly
Save it for the shooting range
So back DVD

we'll study war no more this millennia
It's never again for me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murders

This is love, this is not treason
This is love, this is not treason
This is love, this is not treason
This is love, this is not treason

They shell dwellings to quell the shellings
And lift taboos and seduce the cowards
They say we're too yellow bellied
But we say we're the new superpower

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

We seek ways to not be liable
We claim to speak for a higher truth
We stand opposed to the homicidal
We tell you you are fire proof

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag
Warriors
We'd rather make our children
We'd rather make our children

Do what you want to our courage
Ask us what you will
Demand from us a sacrifice
But do not make us kill---Lyrics submitted by Reilly.
