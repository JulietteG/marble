I can ride my bike with no handlebars,no handlebars,no handlebars,
I can ride my bike with no handlebars,no handlebars,no handlebars,
Look at me,look at me, hands in the air like its good to be alive,
And I'm a famous rapper,
Even when the paths are all crookidy,
I can show you how to dos-i-do,
I can show you how to scratch a record,
I can take apart the remote control and I can almost put it back together,
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem,
I can tell you about Leif Ericson,
I know all the words to De Colores,
And I proud to be an American,
Me and my friends saw a Platapus,
Me and my friend made a comic book and guess how long it took?,
I can do anything that I want cause look,
I can keep rythym with no metronome, no metronome, no metronome,
And I can see your face on the telephone, on the telephone, on the telephone,
Look at me, look at me, just called to say that it's good to be alive,
In such a small world and all curled up with a book to read,
I can make money, open up a thrift store,
I can make a living off a magazine,
I can design an engine 64 miles to a gallon of gasoline,
I can make new antibiotics,I  can make computers survive aquatic conditions,
I know how to run a buisness,
And I can make you wanna buy a product,
Movers, Shakers, and Producers,
Me and my friends understand the future,
I see the strings that control the system,
I can do anything with no resistance,
Cause I can lead the nation with a microphone, with a microphone,with a microphone,
And I can split the atoms of a molecule, of a molecule, of a molecule,
Look at me, look at me, driving and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top,
My reach is global, my tower secure, My cause is noble, My power is pure,
I can hand out a million vaccinations,
Or let them all die from exsasperation,
Have them hilled from their lacerations,
Or have them all killed by assassinations,
I can make anybody go to prison just because I dont like them,
And I can do anything with no permission,
I have it all under my command,
I can guide a missle by satellite, by satellite, by satellite,
And I can hit a target through a telescope, through a telescope, through a telescope,
And I can end the planet in a Holocaust,
In a Holocaust,
In a Holocaust,
In a Holocaust,
In a Holocaust,
In a Holocaust,
I can ride my bike with no handlebars, no handlebars, no handlebars,
I can ride my bike with no handlebars, no handlebars, no handlebars.---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
