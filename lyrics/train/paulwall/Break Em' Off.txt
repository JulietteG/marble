Paul Wall 
Now I gotta work ma wood grain wheel 
Poppin' trunks, poppin' grillz, still poppin' seals 
Higher than a hill with ma mind on millz 
Piece and chain swangin', bank roll, shiny grill 
Baby, I got million dollar dreams, with ma mind on cream 
I'm in that mean green machine clean on 19s 
Flat screens in the headrest, swangin' like a swang set 
Brandy wine, paint wet, comin' down tha's a fact 
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian 
Full of that Kush flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians 
Higher than the street lights, floatin' like a parachute 
Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard green Bentley coupe 
Young gangsta, Mac game, sharper than a thumbtack 
Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract 
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up fully loaded and slabbin' 
Tryin' to hit it and quit it 
Walk off like big poppi then break 'em off 

Chorus 

Lil Keke 
Aye, aye 
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist 
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist 
The truck gold mist five 50 slow buddy 
Bentley continental with the mink floors dummy 
Paul Wall money, dat's expensive taste 
And 'em friendly ass fools we send 'em to myspace 
I'ma break 'em off until the backbones broken 
Stainless steel drop phantom, leave the top open 
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose 
And the Kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes (that's right) 
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lazers 
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors 
I'ma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal 
Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle 
Hold on then u buckle up the seat belt 
Swisha House, Young Don, capital TF 

Chorus 

Paul Wall 

Already I'm 
Higher than the satellite, crawlin' like a baby 
Maneuverin' thru the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady 
Still choppin' on 'em buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh 
Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best 
In dat minute maid droppa', with retractable roof 
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the tooth
The fifth wheel on the ground, and the trunk in the air 
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa 
Ma skillz is so ill when workin' the wood wheel 
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill 
Wide screen mind frame, panAramic pimpin' 
I'm sippin' on dat Osama, baby leanin' like I'm limpin' 
In dat 2 seater feeder, it's me and a senorita 
3 ounces up in the liter, and it's tint up in the heater 
Mackin' a mamacita 
Runnin' game like a cheetah 
I'm knockin' 'em out the park
