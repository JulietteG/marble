Afterlife. Oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath and the dirt and the fires are burnt.
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow Ive gotta know Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out
till we work it out, till we work it out
till we work it out, till we work it out

Afterlife. I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
Its like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow

Ive gotta know

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?

But you say Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
And you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

And after this
Can it last another night?
After all the bad advice
That had nothing at all to do with life

Ive gotta know

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?

But you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
And you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
We know its gone
But where did it go?
And where do we go?

Is this the afterlife?
Its just an afterlife with you.
Its just an afterlife.
Its just an afterlife.
Its just an afterlife with you.
Its just an afterlife.
Its just an afterlife. ---
