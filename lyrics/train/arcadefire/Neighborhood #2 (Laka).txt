Alexander, our older brother,
set out for a great adventure.
He tore our images out of his pictures,
he scratched our names out of all his letters.

Our mother shoulda just named you Laika!

Come on Alex, you can do it.
Come on Alex, theres nothin to it.
If you want somethin dont ask for nothin,
if you want nothin dont ask for somethin!

Our mother shoulda just named you Laika!
Its for your own good,
its for the neighborhood!

Our older brother bit by a Vampire!
For a year we caught his tears in a cup.
And now were gonna make him drink it.
Come on Alex dont die or dry up!

Our mother shoulda just named you Laika!
Its for your own good,
its for the neighborhood!

When daddy comes home you always start a fight,
so the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights.
The police disco lights.
Now the neighbors can dance!
Look at em dance---Lyrics submitted by miguel.
