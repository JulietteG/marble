Hey!
(instrumental)*
Hey!

We know a place where no planes go 

We know a place where no ships go
Hey! No cars go..
Hey! No cars go..
where we know
We know a place where no spaceships go
We know a place where no subs go 
Hey No! cars go
Hey No! cars go
Where we know
Hey
Hey(Come on again)
(Dont go)
Hey! us kids know
hey no cars go 
where we know

(4x )Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
[i dont want any pushing and i dont want any shoving,
were gonna do this in an orderly manner]
[Woman and children,
woman and children]
woman and children lets go
old folks lets go!
ladies and their prince lets go 

ahhhhahhhhoahhooaahhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Leslers.
