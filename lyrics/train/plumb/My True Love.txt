Once upon a time
I thought I had it all
Then life just fell apart
Thought I was all alone
I've never been so scared
Than when I danced with fear
But then You took my hand
And it disappeared

Oh there is not another
That could love me like You love me
Oh my God
No there is not another
That could love me like You love me
Oh my God

I know You're holding me
Even when I cannot see
Even in my ocean deep
My true love
I know You're all I need
And You won't stop loving me
I've never ever been so free
My true love
My true love

Thought I lost it all
I could barely breathe
Oh You were all I had
But You're all I need
All I need

Oh there is not another
That could love me like You love me
Oh my God
No there is not another
That could love me like You love me
Oh my God

I know You're holding me
Even when I cannot see
Even in my ocean deep
My true love
I know You're all I need
And You won't stop loving me
I've never ever been so free
My true love
My true love

So when I start to break
Or feel unusable
You'll pick the pieces up
And make them beautiful, beautiful

Oh there is not another
That could love me like You love me
Oh my God
No there is not another
That could love me like You love me
Oh my God

I know You're holding me
Even when I cannot see
Even in my ocean deep
My true love
I know You're all I need
And You won't stop loving me
I've never ever been so free
My true love
My true love

I know You're holding me
Even when I cannot see
Even in my ocean deep
My true love
I know You're all I need
And You won't stop loving me
I've never ever been so free
My true love
My true love
My true love
My true love---
