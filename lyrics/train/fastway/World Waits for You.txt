Look around see it all,
Small town boy looking for more,
is it all too far beyond the dream
Yesterday was dead and gone,
will tomorrow shine at all
you will go as far as you believe

chorus:
the world waits for you,
and i know so long as its true,
you can find your place inside yourself
the world waits for you,
and i know so long as its true
you can feel the fire inside you burn

Now you see the challenge rise,
victory holds the prize,
who will know the price you had to pay
face to face with eager eyes,
your only dream has just arrived,
now its up to you to break away...

chorus

take it all, take it away,
we sacrifice to yesterday , win or loose
ive nothing to hide,
i feel the fire still burning inside,
still burning inside of me.
