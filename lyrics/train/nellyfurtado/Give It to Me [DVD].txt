aland[Nelly Furtado]
I'm the type of girl that'll look you dead in the eye (eye)
I'm real as it comes if you don't know why im fly y-y-y-y
Seen ya try to switch it up, but girl you ain't got to
I'm the wonderwoman, let me go get my ropes
I'm a supermodel and mummy, s, mummy
Amnesty international, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
You love my ass and my abs in the video of promiscuous
My style is rediculous (redic-dic-diculous-culous-culous)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watching all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

[Timbaland]
When timbo is in the party everbody put up their hands
I get a half a mill for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gonna see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-i-a. way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just the piano man
Your song gonna top the charts, I heard em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them their chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

[Chorus]
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watching all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

[Justin Timberlake]
Could you speak up and stop up mumbling
I don't think you came in clear.
Sitting on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here.
I saw you tryin' to act cute on tv just let me clear the air.
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn that's right, you wasn't there.
If "sexy" never left, then why's everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it.
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'cuz our run will never be over, not at least until we say

[Chorus X3]If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watching all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah ---Lyrics submitted by sachin.
