Yeah.

Verse 1:
I know a place where the hearts don't break.
The reality is scripted and the boobs are fake.
The smell of success is sold like incests.
And pumped through the vents of your Mercedez-Benz
And all my friends are almost famous.
Making sex tapes to get on the A-list.
Trying to get their faces in the tabloid pages.
So they can get paid to party in Vegas.
And rehab and then it's off to rehab an a 22million dollar Malibu beach pad.
I seen that. They way these girls on the scene that.
When they first show up trying to grow up.
You know what these little girls they need to grow up.
Before they sniff and spend all their dough up.
O.D. Choke on their throw up. At the Hotel California.

I know a little place we can go right down the road.
The lights are always on.
The bars never close.
I know a little place we can go right down the road.
But nothing good is free.
It'll cost you your heart and your soul.

I know a place on the Sunset Strip.
Where all the beautiful ladies like to undress quick.
And if you got a nice whip and can pick up the check.
You can get your dick wet by a young Rocket.
Sex money and fame. In Los Angeles 
It's a place where a pretty face gets you access.
To the access of the young and the reckless.
Another scratch on the bumper of my Lexus.
New in town is the nest best thing as he sings like bird if you're pitch corrected.
Little pop star headed for the top now. In the fast lane with the top down.
To late for the brakes cant stop now, wild child calling for your mom now.
Screaming out theres no places like home.
And then you're spending another night alone.

I know a little place we can go right down the road.
The lights are always on.
The bars never close.
I know a little place we can go right down the road.
But nothing good is free.
It'll cost you your heart and your soul.

It's a shame how the money and fame gotta pretty young thing going out with a bang,
Getting used up so beat and bruise up same old shit comes later comes sooner.
Nothing new just a different case, she disappeared in a year no sign no trace.
Got caught up in the pace, leather and lace, got addicted after just one taste.
She made an entrance lit up the place with a thousand flashes going off in her face.
She couldn't take it the fame stripped her naked taken over by the need to make it.
Sleeping with the agents to get her start, sleeping with the directors to get the part.
Sleeping pills and alcohol, I've seen it all in the Valley of the Dogs.

I know a little place we can go right down the road.
The lights are always on.
The bars never close.
I know a little place we can go right down the road.
But nothing good is free.
It'll cost you your heart and your soul.

I know a little place we can go right down the road.
The lights are always on.
The bars never close.
I know a little place we can go right down the road.
But nothing good is free.
It'll cost you your heart and your soul.
Cost you your heart and your soul.---Lyrics submitted by kalia.
