Come, come summertime
Love, love hold my hand
Come, come summertime
Love, love take a ride with me

Sweet little nectarine
Sit down next to me
Take a load off, Annie
I think you're beautiful

Do-ah-diddy-diddy-dum-diddy-do
When the moon is full, I'll be a wolf
Howl at you and growl at you
Ladybugs and flowers, too
I want to go out with you

I'm just a kid, living a dream
Slid in the scene like an old pair of jeans
You know my name, but you don't know me
Wanna go out with me? Show me.

Come, come summertime
Love, love, hold my hand
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Come, come summertime
Love, love, take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy

Black smoke billow out the black tinted window
In my black limousine as I ride through the ghetto

She wore blush, it gave me a rush
She was a lush, I gave her a touch on the tush
I gave her a push on the bed
And we smushed our lips together
Like blue and yellow, we made a green meadow
Chilled together forever, real mellow
She fell in love, I had to act, hello
I couldn't say goodbye, she was too special

Come, come summertime
Love, love hold my hand
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Come, come summertime
Love, love take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy

All my ladies, put your hands in the sky for me babies
And say my name, they call me Shwayze
Turn it up, turn it up, Play me
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up

Black smoke billow out the black tinted window
In my black limousine as I ride through the ghetto
(Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up)

Come, come summertime
Love, love, hold my hand
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Come, come summertime
Love, love, take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy

Come, come summertime
Love, love, take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Come, come summertime
Love, love, take a ride with me
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy
Don-don-don-do-don-don-do-don-don
Don't be shy---Lyrics submitted by Kafros.
