She look like sex, drugs, rock and roll. (Say ho! )
When she movin' on the dance floor.
Stop! Go! Stop and go! (Say ho! )
Like a New York cab, yo! 
Fast! Slow! Fast and Slow! 
She drives me mad, yo! Just like
My nano she's shufflin'. I'm lovin' it.

I'm thinkin' about touchin' it, kissin' her in public.
But baby got me fumblin', stumblin' and mumblin'.
She got me wonderin' if I should get her number then
She just looked up at me and said... 

Take me in the bathroom, take my clothes off.
Make love to me up against a dirty wall.
'Cause I can't wait to get you home, wait
To get you home.

She tastes like cigarettes and alcohol, up all night
On aderoll. Innocent, but not a doll.
She my Brooklyn barbie doll. Dancin' light (mmm), 
Drinkin' light (oh, oh). Whatcha think about sex on
The first night? Mmm. Okay! 

I'm thinkin' about touchin' it, kissin' her in public.
But baby got me fumblin', stumblin' and mumblin'(mumblin').
She got me wonderin' if I should get her number then (Say ho! )
Well I just looked at instead, and I said... 

Take me in the bathroom, take my clothes off.
Make love to me up against a dirty wall.
'Cause I can't wait to get you home, wait
To get you home.
Take me out the back door, take my clothes off.
Make love to me up against somebody's car.
'Cause I can't wait to get you home, wait
To get you home.

She was an waitress, wait! She was an actress.
Actin' like a starlet, in fact she was a harlot.
Her lips like Scarlet, Johansson. They part to
Say I'm handsome. I start to say "I know." That's
When she pulled out my handgun, BAM! 

Take me in the bathroom, take my clothes off.
Make love to me up against a dirty wall.
'Cause I can't wait to get you home, wait
To get you home.
Take me out the back door, take my clothes off.
Make love to me up against somebody's car.
'Cause I can't wait to get you, 'cause I can't wait to
Get you home.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
