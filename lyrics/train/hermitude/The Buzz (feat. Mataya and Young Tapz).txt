Do you feel, feel
Do you feel, feel, feel
Do you feel me, hey, hey, hey
Do you feel, feel
Do you feel, feel, feel
Do you feel me, hey, hey, hey

Do you feel the buzz or it's just me, just me
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
Call it a clean break
Do you feel the buzz now
Do you feel the buzz?

Do you feel, do you feel it in the air
Is it just me
Do you feel, I could feel it in the air
Is it just me, is it just me?
Do you feel the buzz or it's just me, just me
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
Call it a clean break

Do you feel the buzz now
Do you feel the buzz?---
