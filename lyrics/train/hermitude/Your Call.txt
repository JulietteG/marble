Your Call, by Hermitude.

Urthboy:
I heard a lot about the links with the phones and the cancer,
And all the radiation we absorb as we banter.
I can see the scientific nuttters (?) propaganda, 
aint no pointing fingers, everybody put your hands up.
Still I hazard if youre doing good I understand ya,
But Im no expert, Im just candid.
Electromagneticism (sic) is rampant, so when I get a call, Ill answer.
No matter what the circumstances, 
or however the latest lot of research damns us, Ill take my chances.
They dance around truths like theyre just rumours, 
That aint been proved yet, and Ive got the evidence that cant be refuted so resistance is futile:

Refrain: 
Urthboy: So why didnt you call me yeah,
Elana: But Im just wondering if I should call you.
Urthboy: If buts and maybes, and babys steps
Elana: Ive been thinking what could I do for you?
Urthboy: A gambling woman would say
Elana: Takin my chances with you.

Elana: 
And what will happen if I contact you,
The implications if I follow through.
If we go steady Im not ready for another fall, 
I have to think it through before I even make the call.
Ive been with a ginger before,
And when I see the red flag Im like a bull to the matador.
You play in a hip-hop band, Im not looking for a one night stand.
With your groupies, what if youve got herpies? I dont think that this is gonna work.
These are the reasons that make it clear, that we should not get involved my dear.

Elana: Are you the cure? Im not sure, if my heart can take another fall. 
I cant even pick up the phone to make the call.

Refrain (x2)

Both: I get confused making my mind up, are you the fuse that could light me up? (x6)---Lyrics submitted by Bec.
