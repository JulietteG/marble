Your fear it moves me. 
Your weakness I taste. 
I breathe you, I hate you. 
You course through my veins. 

And now. 
And now. 

You want me. You love me. 
And I hate myself. 
I need you, but I hate you. 
'Cause I want nothing else. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
Your pain escapes through me. 
'Cause I breathe you, but I hate you. 
'Cause they say we could never be. 
They can't see. 

I know I shouldn't love you. 
There's just too much to fake. 
But you see me, and I feel you. 
And I am not afraid. 
I'm not afraid. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
Your pain escapes through me. 
'Cause I breathe you, but I hate you. 
'Cause they say we could never be. 

It seems the pain's been traded, 
Since I pulled you through. 
And now my mind's been so jaded. 
And I would kill myself for you. 
I'd die for you. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
Your pain escapes through me. 
'Cause I breathe you, but I hate you. 
'Cause they say we could never. 

And I bleed you since I've healed you. 
But I hate you, but I breathe. 

And I see you. 
And I feel you. 
And I hate you. 
But I'd die for you. 
I'd die for you.---Lyrics submitted by Eva-Marie.
