Well, somebody told me
That I would be a dreamer for life
Well, somebody told me
I would never reach the other side.

Well, you say old news
You cross your fingers and youre to lose
What if I told you,
That things will never improve.

And If I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright
So I can burn,
So I can burn.

The grass is always greener
Someone elses past is always cleaner
But Im a believer
It doesnt fool all of us.

And If I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright

No, I dont really know where I must go
No, I dont really know where I must go
So, I lived a lie
For just tonight, tonight

We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers
We are believers

We are, we are

And If I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright
And If I lived a lie
Would someone meet me on the other side
So I could burn out bright

No, I dont really know where I must go
No, I dont really know where I must go
So, I lived a lie
For just tonight
And burn out bright---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
