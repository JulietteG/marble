And I know something you don't 
It comes and goes like the strength in your bones, whoa
So keep your mind at a rest
I'll never let the two of us be friends, does it hurt?

Underdog
Just look at the mess you've made
It's such a shame, a shame
We had to find out this way

You must have, the must have
Moment in your hands and it's sad
To think that this season, I'm gonna change
Just not face to face, it ain't broke, so don't fix it

Underdog
Just look at the mess you've made
It's such a shame, a shame
We had to find out this way

Revenge loves company, three makes it a crowd
So watch your mouth, sit this one out

~Breakdown~

And I'm down, down, but definitely not out
(But definitely not out)
Yeah, why did you call me again?
I bet, I bet we don't make it
(I bet we don't make it)

'Cause I never take advice
From my... friends in very high places
They're only making bets with themselves, selves
They're very, very selfish
We'll keep you in mind in the end

Underdog
Just look at the mess you've made
It's such a shame, a shame
We had to find out this way

Revenge loves company, three makes it a crowd
So watch your mouth, sit this one out---Lyrics submitted by cyrah.
