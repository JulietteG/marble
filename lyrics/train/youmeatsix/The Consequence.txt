Calm down she said consider this a warning.
A souvenir for the morning, a headache that you can't fix.
I said I can talk my way out of anything, but i am struggling in this emergency
This ones on your side.
I said this one is on your

Ambulance I'm calling you now
Accidents bring the house down
Come on come on, you don't know me
Come on come on, you owe me nothing

Dry your eyes and stick them on ice.
Give your chest a rest it's been cold your whole life
I'll have you know, the tables are about to turn
And you're going to get what, what you deserve.

Ambulance I'm calling you now
Accidents bring the house down
Come on come on, you don't know me
Come on come on, you owe me nothing
Is this is it my love, turn it up turn it up I want to hear you scream.

So sing, I am my own worst enemy, that's what she said to me.
And I am living out your dream.
So sing, I am my own worst enemy
So we can just breathe, a little more safely.

I've got real big plans and such bad thoughts.---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
