And I stand
On shaken ground
The earth moves beneath my feet
And I shout forgive me
But theres no God listening
And these walls surround us
Always black and grays I see
And we found this time
On our weakness it will feed

Is this the end of the world
I cannot bare to watch it burn
But were crawling in the dirt
Is this the end of it all
Well we used to stand so tall
I barely recognize us anymore

I dont believe
In the things I cannot see
But this night is dead
Theyre all coming for me
I shout forgive me
But this proves Im now too weak
And I try to speak
But hope has been taken from me

Is this the end of the world
I cannot bare to watch it burn
But were crawling in the dirt
Is this the end of it all
Well we used to stand so tall
I barely recognize us anymore

Is this the end of the world
I cannot bare to watch it burn
But were crawling in the dirt
Is this the end of it all
Well we used to stand so tall
I barely recognize us anymore

Is this the end of the world
Is this the end of the world
Is this the end of the world
Is this the end
Is this the end of the world ---
