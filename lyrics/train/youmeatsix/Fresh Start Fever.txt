Everybody loves the original, everybody's got time to be cynical
Old enough to know better by now, its the greatest joke dont go letting me down
Hold my drink, this just got physical
Im on a new wave its getting visceral
Going toe to toe to see how you go
Im in pain say yes this is painful

Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song sing a sad song
Warning you
Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song

And its a fresh start fever
Who wouldnt want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

Cause for now I reserve judgments
Until these chains, chains are redundant
The brave die young and thats all right for some but I'm after something long term, long term
Lets make resolutions
Ive only got problems and no solutions
Youre just some one to the world but youre the world to someone else who told you

Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song sing a sad song
Warning you
Oh heart of mine
Sing a sad song

And its a fresh start fever
Who wouldnt want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

And its a fresh start fever
Fresh start fever
Welcome to the future
Dream a little big dream a little bigger

Youre a hard act to follow
So I stare down this empty bottle
There is no message at the bottom so how do I solve it
Im a hard act to follow
I know we sink so slo-o-ow
The shallow is as shallow does
Keep a track on all those scars

I said youve got a chip on your shoulder
Getting worse now youre older
It didnt hurt, now your sober
Its you life and now its over

And its a fresh start fever
Who wouldnt want to be here?
Welcome to the future
Dream a little bigger

And its a fresh start fever
Fresh start fever
Welcome to the future
Dream a little big dream a little bigger ---
