Verse:
I woke up this morning with a grudge satched story
Oh I feel, I feel so low
Let me start and end at the part I haven't figured out yet
Yes, I am I'm moving slow

You are playing the lead, the headache that and my anxious feet
Oh I only got myself to blame
This another test in which I would fail at my best
Oh always ending the same

Bridge:
If I were an honest guy
I'd give this girl another try

Chorus:
What are Iwe doing?
I am so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say
What are we doing
You have changed your ways this time
It's time

If I just save you
you could save me to
If I just save you
then you could save me to

dah da da dah x2

Verse:
I woke up the next morning and I didn't see it coming
Oh, your bags were packed and gone
Called all your friends they said they hadn't seen you yet
Oh, my heads going to explode

Bridge:
If I were an honest guy
I'd give this girl another try

Chorus:
What are we doing?
I am so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say
What are we doing?
You have changed you ways this time
It's time

If I just save you
you could save me to
If I just save you
then you could save me to

Verse:
I believe in the finer things and you dont't believe in me 
I said I believe in the finer things and you dont't believe in me 
I said I believe in the finer things and you don't

Chorus 2:
If I just save you
you could save me to
If I just save you
 you could save
you could save me to

Chorus 1:
What am I doing?
I am so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say
What are we doing
I am so in love with you
I forgot what I wanted to say

(If I just save you)
No one does it better
No one does it better
No one does it
No one does it better
(If I just save you)
No oned does it
No one does it better
No on does it better
No one does it
No one does it 

Woke up this morning with a grudge satched story
Which now I have told you all---Lyrics submitted by Eden.
