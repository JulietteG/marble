I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

Honestly I shouldn't waste time no more, eh yeah
'Cause all these little boys you're chasing, did they break your heart?
I know you've been down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I won't let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But girl when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, hey

I see you the same
I see it in the way that you behave around me
And I can't tell
What we have is different from anyone else
'Cause you stop doing what you're doing
When I call you come to me running
And I would do the same for you
So tell me that you feel it too, woah

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you (little crush on you)
I hope it's not too much, oh ho
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la (ooh yeah baby, my heart singing)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, oh

I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby
And I feel it too
I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby---
