If you're the bird, 
Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm, 
I know the part is such a bummer
But fair is fair
If my segments get separated I'll scream
And you'll be there

Close your eyes (close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine (feel the shine)
I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast the line (oh I'll try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends (it depends)
As they arrive (if they arrive)

You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well, who needs enemies?

da dat dah, da da da, da dat dah, da da dat dah,
da dat dah, da da da, da dat dah, da dat da dat dah,

If I'm your boy, 
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy, 
Pickin' apples in late September like,
We've done for years, then
We'll take a long walk through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you,
Between the ears

If you're my girl,
Swirl me around the room with feeling
And as we twirl,
The glow and the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room,
'Cause we tend to make each other blush (you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind
But I still have just one more question on my mind,
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well, who needs anenomies?

You're the bird, I'm the worm
And it's plain to see,
That we were meant to be
We were meant to be

da dat dah, da da da, da dat dah, da da dat dah
da dat dah, da da da, da dat dat dah

We were meant to be
If you're the bird
If you're the bird
Then i'm the worm
We were meant to be---Lyrics submitted by ki(:.
