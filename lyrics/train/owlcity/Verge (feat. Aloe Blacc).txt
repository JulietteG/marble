Ain't too sure what I believe in
I believe in what I see
And when I close my eyes
I see my whole life ahead of me

These are our hours
This is our time
These are our hours
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

From now on, theres no looking back
Full-steam ahead on this one-way track
From this day forth, I will make a promise
To be true to myself and always be honest

For the rest of my life
I will do whats right
I will do whats right
When I'm step out on the

Edging the edge and were touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives---
