Wake up on your own
And look around you cuz youre not alone
Release your high hopes and theyll survive
Cuz this is the future and you are alive

Dive in and swim away
From your loneliness and miserable days

And when you wake up on your own
Look around you cuz youre not alone
Let your hopes go and theyll survive
Cuz this is the future and you are alive
Youre headed home---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
