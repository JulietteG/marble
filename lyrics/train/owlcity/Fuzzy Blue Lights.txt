if i could look across the country
from california to new jersey
then i would count the parks and lake resorts
and number all the jets and airports
all those rather dreary rain clouds
still bother me,
cuz i look through the camera eye piece,
and cannot see.

if i could open up my window
and see from tampa bay to juno
then i would survey all those open miles
and line them up in single files
everywhere i look i see green
scenic sublime
and all those oceanic vistas
are so divine

if i was standing on the balcony
and you were walking down below
i'd feel rather depressed and out of place,
and lonely just to watch you go
if you were swinging from the highway overpass
within the western atmosphere
i'd feel rather affraid and insincere 
if you began to disappear

if i was walking through a sad art gallery
and you were driving through the night
i'd feel rather alone and ill at ease
beneath the brilliant showroom light
if i was flying on a plane above your town
and you were gazing at the sky
somehow i'd feel intact and reassured
if you began to wave goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by Lindsay.
