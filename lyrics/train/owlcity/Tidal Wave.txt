I wish I could cross my arms and cross your mind
Cause I believe
You'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
All my life I wish I broke mirrors
Instead of promises
Cause all I see
Is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely
Cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel
Or just the train
Lift your arms only heaven knows
Where the danger grows
And it's safe to say
There's a bright light up ahead 
And help is on the way
Help is on the way
I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me
Depression please cut to the chase
And cut a long story short
Oh please be done
How much longer can this drama afford to run
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties 
And breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then
All my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me
Then I was given grace and love
I was blind but now I can see
Cause I found a new hope from above
And courage swept over me
It hurts just to wake up whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside
So tired of looking in
The end is uncertain 
And I've never been so afraid
But i don't need a telescope 
To see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
