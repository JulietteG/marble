Welcome back, winter once again
and put on your warm fuzzy sweater
cuz you'll feel much better when
the snowflakes fall gently to the ground
the temperature drops 
and your shivers freeze all the rivers around
but i keep you warm

(vocals)

If speeds a pro, then inertia must be a con
cuz the cold wind blows at precise rates
when i've got my ice-skates on
if all the roads were paved 
with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
then on to Alaska and back
cuz you keep me warm

(vocals)

Peer over the edge, can you see me
rivulets flow from your eyes
paint runs from your mouth like a waterfall
and your lungs crystalize
I'll travel through sub-zero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
and that's just the tip of the iceburg
I'll do what ever it takes, to change

(instumental break)

farewell powdery paradise
we'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
fingers failed us before they froze
and the frostbite bit down on all our toes
snowdrifts build up and enfold us
as we wait out this winter storm
so we snuggle close in the darkness
and keep each other so warm---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
