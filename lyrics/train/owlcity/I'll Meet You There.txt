If we could sit together a moment and 
talk forever just to pass the time 
I would smile as the shivers and chills run down my spine 
and your eyes are locked on mine. 
oh we'll fill the metro skies with country air
and when you close your tired eyes, i'll meet you there
i'll meet you there
i'll meet you there
i'll meet you there

deep inside of you
there's a ruby glow, 
and it gets brighter than you and i will ever know

there's a rushing sound that surrounds us
when we walk alone
and it's everything we've never known

wander down the streets
and i will be the pavement beneath your feet.

if we can just be immobile for some time,
and finally figure out the way we feel
about the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks that still look a bit surreal 

oh i tend to disappear
here and there
so concentrate and you'll feel me
everywhere

and we'll fill the metro skies with country air
if you're lost when you close your eyes
i'll meet you there

i'll meet you there
you could be anywhere
i'll meet you there
you could be anywhere
i'll meet you there

open your eyes and see
(you could be anywhere)
everything you can be
i'll meet you there

open your eyes and see
(you could be anywhere)
everything you can be
i'll meet you there---Lyrics submitted by Dudeman.
