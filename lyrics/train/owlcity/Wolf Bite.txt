It's another bad dream
Poison in my blood stream
I'm dying but i can't scream
Will you show me the way?

It's another wolf bite
Howlin' in the moonlight
I wanna get my life right!
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

If the darkness falls, and my angel calls
In my despair
Will you be there?

In the darkest night
When I need your light
Will you show me the way?

If my time runs out
And the sky falls down
Despite my fear
Will you appear?

If the world goes blind
And i lose my mind
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

Will you show me the way, tonight
Will you show me the way, tonight

It's another nightmare
I swear there's something out there
So save me cause i'm so scared
Will you show me the way?

It's another werewolf
All dressed up in sheep's wool
And changing when the moon's full
Will you show me the way?

If the darkness falls, and my angel calls
In my despair
Will you be there?

In the darkest night
When I need your light
Will you show me the way?

If my time runs out
And the sky falls down
Despite my fear
Will you appear?

If the world goes blind
And i lose my mind
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

In my despair
Will you be there?
Tonight---
