i opened my eyes last night
and saw you in the lowlight.
walkign down by the bay,
on the shore,
staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore.
i was feeling the night grow old,
and you were looking so cold.
like an introvert,
i drew my overshirt around my arms
and began to shiver violently.
before you happened to look and see
the tunnels all around me,
running into the dark underground.
all the subways around create a great sound.
to my motion fatigue, farewell.
with your ear to a seashell
you can hear the waves,
in underwater caves,
as if you actually were inside a saltwater room.

time together is just never quite enough.
[when you and i are alone i've never felt so at home]
what will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[we need time, only time]
when we're apart, whatever are you thinking of?
[if this is what i call home, why does it feel so alone?]
so tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
[all the time, all the time]

can you believe that the crew has gone,
and wouldn't let me sign on?
all my islands have sunk in the deep,
so i can hardly relax or even oversleep.
i feel as if i were home, some nights,
when we count all the ship lights.
i guess i'll never know why sparrows love the snow.
we'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow.

[so tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? all the time.]

time together is just never quite enough.
[when you and i are alone i've never felt so at home]
what will it take to make or break this hint of love?
[we need time, only time]
when we're apart, whatever are you thinking of?
[if this is what i call home, why does it feel so alone?]
so tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
[all the time, all the time]

time together is just never quite enough.
when we're apart, whatever are you thinking of?
what will it take to make or break this hint of love?
so tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
all the time...---Lyrics submitted by Arianna.
