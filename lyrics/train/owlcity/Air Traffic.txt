the bird is here
and we are off
to where ever those wings take us
the atmosphere
is crawling with airlines
that wind through the clouds
and look down at the crowds

relax your back
and let the noise sing you to sleep 
in my arms
if you awake before we arrive
I will carry you down
and I won't make a sound

the scent is strong
as we move on
and breath in the pristine crime scene
the false veneer
is old like a substitute volunteer 
from, oh, some other year

I'm just a show as far as I can tell 
so I paint my eyes a light green
the silver beams are twirling and swirling 
throughout your dreams like air traffic streams---Lyrics submitted by Eloise.
