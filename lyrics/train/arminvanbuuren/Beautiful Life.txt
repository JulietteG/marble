Some people keep wondering
Some people long without knowing
Some people never found the answer
The answer

Come and step into the light
Let the beatings in your heart out

We finally know how to be free
Let it in, take off, youre with me
Its how I feel everything for the first time

Its such a beautiful, beautiful life
Well then your days will lead here tonight
Oh oh
Just close your eyes
And break a kiss from nights forever

Some people keep wondering
Some people long without knowing
Some people never found the answer
The answer

We finally know how to be free
Let it in, take off, youre with me
Its how I feel everything for the first time

A kiss that lasts, thats forever---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
