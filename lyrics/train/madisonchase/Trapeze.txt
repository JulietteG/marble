I used to think that all the problems in the world
Were mine to ignore.
By laying blame,
I hold reality to lie my life away.

[bridge]
So you leap until you fly until you drop.
The whole world loves a circus,
Be a star and find your spot.
So you preen until youre seen and catch the eye,
Of the ones who call you darling,
Love ya, honey, til you die.

[chorus]
Prune my eyes;
I hide the words that made me blind.
Penciled in my mind:
The tears and laughs of nothing left behind.

But now I see that all all the people in the world
Are helpless like me.
My twist of fate, a simple mask I wear
To hide behind my shame
And forever play your game.

[bridge]

[chorus] 2x

Alice, have you considered what youre going to do?
But now I see. . . 
Are you still dreaming?
What is this?
Release me. . .

[chorus] 2x---Lyrics submitted by Madison Chase.
