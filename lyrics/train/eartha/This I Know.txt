This beauty your hand created, Most High
Father indeed we beheld it, oh
From nothing you molded and shaped a great form
Where you did dwell making your home
I know Im not worthy of you come within
But that Life you created blotted my sins
I dont know what lies ahead of me
In the absence of you is a life I cant see

As you did then, please do again
Use me, make me your home, dwell within
You love me so, You told me so,
A life with you is true; this I know

You left your Word for me, Lord, its my guide
Leads me through lifes stormy weather
Youre the source of strength who will comfort my soul
Said youd be with me forever 
In all of my heartache and pain you will remain; 
On me fall from on high blessed rain 
Here I am Lord waiting to receive 
The gift of your presence within me

As you did then, youve done again
(Thank you) for choosing me, making your home to dwell within
You loved me so, You told me so 
A life with you is something beautiful

Lord I used to worry bout the future and what it held for me 
Until you proved that Youre my total security
You breathed on me and made your home inside of me
Gave me your Holy Spirit as my earnest guarantee

Should you call me home tomorrow, with you Ill ever be 
Departing from a world of sorrow, basking in joy eternally
But until you rapture me away, in you Ill constantly hope 
And every day as I awake, youre living in me, this I know---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
