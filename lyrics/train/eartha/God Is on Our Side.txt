God is on our side 
We shall not be afraid, we shall not be afraid
Though war shall rise against our souls
We shall not be afraid, we shall not be afraid

Though we get weary, we shall not fear
We shall be carried on eagles wings, oh oh

God is on our side we shall not be afraid, we shall not be afraid

Though the enemy shall come in, 
Like a flood the Spirit of the Lord 
Will lift up a standard against him
We shall not be afraid, we shall not be afraid

Dont you know that the Lord shall go before us
We shall not fear the enemy
We shall not fear the darkness
We shall not be afraid

No weapon formed against us shall be able to prosper
For when our God is for us He shall cause us to triumph, yeah

Im encouraged to know Hes on our side, Yeah
Hes more than the world against us
Though the enemy should come in, God is on our side
I know that Hes walking with me
I know that Hes talking with me
Hes on our side.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
