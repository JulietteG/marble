Im engaged in the craze, 
been doing it like this for days
Aint no way Im going to let up
Im going to get up every time I hear your name

No matter where I am, 
If I have to send a telegram
Ill find a way to deliver
Thats (just) how convinced I am

I hear you. You hear me. We agree.

I have vowed to give my best
Dont want to give you nothing less
If the test requires the same
Reservations under my name

Ive been giving my props to you
We know this aint nothing new
Ill admit every now and then
Ive gotta cut a fresh step for you

I hear you. You hear me. We agree.

Aint no questions about what Im going to do
Its my time to give up my all to you

Aint no questions about what Im going to do
Its my time to give up my all to you

I hear you. You hear me. Glad to know we agree.

Im engaged. This is the thing
I will admit it; Im all wrapped up in it
Im engaged. This is the thing
Im actively committed. Im all wrapped up in it 

Im engaged. This is the thing
I will admit it; Im all wrapped up in it
Im engaged. This is the thing
Im actively committed. Im all wrapped up in it 

Im engaged. This is the thing
I will admit it; Im all wrapped up in it
Im engaged. This is the thing
Im actively committed. Im all wrapped up in it 

I hear you. You hear me. Glad to know we agree.

Aint no questions about what Im going to do
Its my time to give up my all to you

Aint no questions about what Im going to do
Its my time to give up my all to you

Im engaged. This is the thing
I will admit it; Im all wrapped up in it
Im engaged. This is the thing
Im actively committed. Im all wrapped up in it---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
