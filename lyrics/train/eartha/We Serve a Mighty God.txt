We serve a mighty God, yes we do 
A big God, A great God Oh yeah
We serve a mighty God 
What a mighty God is He

Well He speaks just a Word and the winds obey His will
Hell speak in the middle of a storm, Peace be still
It aint nothing but a word
Well He moves in a windstorm making everything calm
Hes the great I AM; He performs mighty acts

We serve a mighty God, yes we do 
A big God, A great God Oh yeah
We serve a mighty God 
What a mighty God is He

Yes, Hes deeper than the deepest ocean, wider than any sea
He lights on the purple mountains majesties
But yet Hes not too busy to meet me on my knees
I know Hes right here to answer my prayers

Ive searched all over but I could not find
None to compare with this God of mine
He is indeed a mighty God
The God that I serve is a mighty God

Hes all He says He is; all that He says He is
Hes all that, all that and more, 
Hes all that one could ever hope for

Mighty in Word
Mighty in Deed
Mighty in Power---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
