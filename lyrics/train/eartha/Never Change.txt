Times change, seasons change, people change their minds
But I know someone who stays the same
Constant in changing times, Hell never change
He remains the same

And though the world should change 
He remains unfaltering, immortal and ever true, 
Faithful to His word and He never fails to fulfill his promises 
And brings to fruition the vision that He places 
Within the hearts of men

Secret things belong to God; 
Who can know His heart? 
Who can find Him out?  
In and of His glory, Hes quite a mystery 
Greatest controversy weve ever seen
Never changing, He is reigning sovereign
None else like Him, one should seek to find Him

As with prophets of old, visions unfold before us
He speaks still, He reveals Himself, He hasnt changed 
And He never will, Hell never change
In Him there is no shadow of turning, only faithfulness 
And who He was a million years ago, 
He was on yesterday and shall ever be

Hes Alpha, Omega Hes the beginning and Hes the ending
(and every episode) 
What a sight to behold
Oh, the depth of His person, His creation, manifestation 
Who can know?

The heavens of heavens cannot contain Him
Yet He still saw fit to dwell among men 
Before his creation, He stands ageless; 
Unlike four seasons, Hes never changing.  
Hell never change.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
