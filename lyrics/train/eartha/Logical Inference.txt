You say you have it all together
And everythings going your way
You say that nothings bothering you
But youre just camouflaging your pain

Everyday theres a struggle
And youre wondering if you should let it go
Because faking aint easy
When youre breaking into pieces

You say you have it all together
And everythings going your way
You say that nothings bothering you
But youre just camouflaging your pain

Youre smiling and youre gracious
Youre crying in private places
Feeling fair weathered
Trying to hold it together

But based on logical inference
Nothing is what it seems
Your life is much different
The hurt of a broken dream

Based on logical inference
In spite of what you say
Your life is much different
Than the one that you portray

You say you have it all together
And everythings going your way
You say that nothings bothering you
But youre just camouflaging your pain

Everyday theres a struggle
And youre wondering if you should let it go
Because faking aint easy
When youre breaking into pieces

You say you have it all together
And everythings going your way
You say that nothings bothering you
But youre just camouflaging your pain

Youre smiling and youre gracious
Youre crying in private places
Feeling fair weathered
Trying to hold it together

But based on logical inference
Nothing is what it seems
Your life is much different
The hurt of a broken dream

Based on logical inference
In spite of what you say
Your life is much different
Than the one that you portray

Remember all that glitters may not be gold
Your life is a story to be told
And if you think nobody sees you
Youre sadly mistaken, youve just deceived you

All that glitters may not be gold
Your life is a story to be told
And if you think nobody sees you
Youre sadly mistaken, youve just deceived you---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
