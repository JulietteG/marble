I will stand upon my watch
Set me upon a tower
I will watch to see what the Lord will say unto me 
He said write the vision, 
Make it plain upon the tables 
That he may run that readeth it, 
For the vision is for an appointed time, 
At the end it shall speak and not lie

I know that youve been waiting for a while
Seems like your blessings they just keep passing you by
Everybodys got something going on
Youre waiting for the dream that you can call your own

Though in the fire youve been throughly tried
God is not a man that He should ever lie, He wont ever lie
And if He said it just you surely wait
For the just man shall live by his faith

Ive got a word for you and it aint nothin new
This is what you oughta do - rehearse His promises to you
It is only by His grace that we have the patience to wait
You oughta give God His praise

Whatever Hes told you, whatever Hes shown you
Count it already done cause only He can do 
Dont stagger at his promise, just you believe
Like Abraham our father, you shall receive.---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
