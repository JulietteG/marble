When I found Id hurt you, I was heartbroken
Lord, this is true; I didnt know how to come to you
Could it have been my pride, that darkness in my life? 
I felt something way inside and I know I had to get it right

The first thing that Ill do is make amends with you
Didnt mean to hurt you that way
The day I walked away from you
Left you standing alone, it was shivering cold
Now I want to come back home

I wanna make it better, make it up to you
Tell me where youre gonna be, Ill be there real soon
I know Ive burned my bridge by all those things I did
I beg you to forgive
Youre the only way for me to live

The first thing that Ill do is make amends with you
Didnt mean to hurt you that way
The day I walked away from you
Left you standing alone, it was shivering cold
Now I want to come back home

I cant even front about my history
I cant seem to understand your love for me
Tell me why you think that I (even) deserve to be
And why do you always extend yourself to me?

The first thing that Ill do is make amends with you
Didnt mean to hurt you that way
The day I walked away from you
Left you standing alone, it was shivering cold
Now I want to come back home

So heartbroken
Its a shame the way Ive broken your heart, shame on me
I couldnt blame you if you didnt love me at all
Its a shame the way Ive broken your heart,
I couldnt blame you if you didnt love me at all

I am heartbroken
When I found I hurt you 
Heartbroken
Just didnt know what else to do
Heartbroken
I cried, I cried, I hurt inside
Heartbroken
Cant you see that Im trying to make it right?

Its a shame the way Ive broken your heart, shame on me
I couldnt blame you if you didnt love me at all
Its a shame the way Ive broken your heart, couldnt blame you
I couldnt blame you if you didnt love me at all

I was so heartbroken
When I found I hurt you 
Heartbroken
Just didnt know what else to do
Heartbroken
I cried, I cried, I hurt inside
Heartbroken
Cant you see that Im trying to make it up to you?---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
