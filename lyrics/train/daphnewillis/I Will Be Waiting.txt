I know the way you pull in the driveway
And I know the sound, yeah, the sound that the dog makes
And your footsteps fall soft on the walkway, hey
And I will be waiting...

When you get home, I'm gonna lock you in
I won't let you go, no, I won't let you leave again
And I bet you know, yeah, that I will be waiting

You know if it's dark, that I leave the light on
And you know the key is under the rock on the front lawn
And you know how lonely I get when you're gone
You know what I'm saying
that I will be waiting

When you get home, I'm gonna lock you in
I won't let you go, no, I won't let you leave again
And I bet you know, yeah, that I will be waiting...yeah, for you

I miss the way you fill in the spaces
And I miss us in our favorite places
And I miss you the way we turn the pages
And I will be waiting

When you get home, I'm gonna lock you in
I won't let you go, no, I won't let you leave again
And I bet you know, hey, that I will be waiting, oh
I will be waiting for you right here
I will be waiting for you right here
I will be waiting---Lyrics submitted by Deirdre.
