She's turning tricks to cover the rent while
Her children sleep on the street
She's neurotic and hopeless, impaired by the sun
Created sick and ordered to be well

Neurosis paranoid
Devolve, we change survive
Neurosis paranoid
We must evolve and change or die

She is raped and abused almost daily
Her children know misery
She's neurotic and hopeful to still find God
Created sick ordered to fuck for fun

Neurosis paranoid
Devolve, we change survive
Neurosis paranoid
We must evolve and change
Neurosis paranoid
Devolve, we must change survive
Neurosis paranoid
The change must come before we die

I searched for God and the answer changed
I re-evolve, take my sins away
I searched for God and no answer came
Just the victim of dying love
My addiction reigns

I searched for God
No answer came
Take my sins away---Lyrics submitted by serena.
