You sink your teeth in.
Bite the blood that drains the life inside of me and fills your soul with love and hate and all those things you need to breathe.
My body dies,
But still my soul remains eternally in search of Caspian waves and shallow graves.
Explain, why me?

This nightmare (wont last long) won't last long.
Are you scared? (sing this song) To sing this song.
I'm right there (by your side) by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.

I watched the sky bleed grey with see-through shades of violent
Bloody stains and felt the evil prime and wicked start a course straight through my veins.
I'm so alive
My skin so cold and fake.
I close my eyes
I know that now's the time to take my chance with death and realize.

Sunrise, sunset, will you wash away the rain?
Sunrise, sunset, can you wash away the pain?

This nightmare (wont last long) won't last long.
Are you scared? (sing this song) To sing this song?
I'm right there (by your side) by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.

This nightmare (wont last long) won't last long.
Are you scared? (sing this song) To sing this song?
I'm right there (by your side) by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.

So mute and beautiful to me
A promise kept on high
An angelic look at life through open eyes.
Don't be scared
We'll make it work.
We're right on time
Don't make things worse.
Now I'm right there by your side.

(Sunrise) I will avenge
(Sunset) I can't pretend
(Sunrise) I won't forget this vain
(Sunset) attempt and promise kept.
Just one more night to make up for the loss of love and time.
Here comes the sun to rid this world of see-through blood and swollen light.

Sunrise, sunset, will you wash away the rain?
Sunrise, sunset, can you wash away the pain?

This nightmare (wont last long) won't last long.
Are you scared? (sing this song) To sing this song?
I'm right there (by your side) by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.

This nightmare (wont last long) won't last long.
Are you scared? (sing this song) To sing this song?
I'm right there (by your side) by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.

Sunrise.
The last sunrise.
The last sunrise.
The last sunrise.---Lyrics submitted by Xante.
