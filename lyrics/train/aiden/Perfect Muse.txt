We live in fearless times
Revolution, we sing
We live in dying days
Evolution, we sing

We all go that insane
Sink the knife into the spine
The human disease
We all go that insane
Sink the knife into the spine
The human soul desires your belief

We live in a world of hate
Separate, we sing
We live in dying days
Evolution, we sing

We all go that insane
Sink the knife into the spine
The human disease
We all go that insane
Sink the knife into the spine
They have sold us your beliefs

I'll sing you die my perfect muse
My valentine alive
I'll sing you dare make the speakers bleed
In dying days we just don't care---Lyrics submitted by serena.
