We'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight

    So I've come
    To Complicate the dead
    Are you with me?
    I've written out all my vows again
    We're almost home
    To see the silence break
    On New Years Eve
    We're only 17
    So if love exists
    I will fall

    And we'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight

    Just one more kiss
    To soothe the pain
    That exists in a world of lies
    Misery take my shame and life
    Everything fills a violent death
    A smile you gave
    Visit me in hell tonight
    And say..and if love exists
    I will fall...

    And we'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight

    And we'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight

    So Im not inlove
    So Im not inlove
    So Im, Im not inlove
    So Im, Im not inlove

    I feel so alive
    (I feel so alive)
    I feel so alive tonight
    I feel so alive
    (I feel so alive)
    I feel so alive I cant stop this feeling
    I feel so alive
    (I feel so alive)
    I feel so alive tonight
    I feel so alive
    (I feel so alive)
    I feel so alive I cant stop this feeling

    If love exists
    I will fall...

    And we'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight

    And we'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight

    And we'll wait for this moment
    When our lips collide
    Almost stop the Earth
    Your in my arms tonight---Lyrics submitted by muy.
