Not long ago
When the atronauts discovered
That us down below
Were living on a little rock
With no place to go
So much that they'll never know
Oh boy
They just wanna be back at home

The elephant sees
The dangers of the jungle
The birds and the bees
Are homing in
They know which way to fly
If only I knew how to fly
Oh no
The moment they got me to try

Ah, Ah

The fish in the sea
Have many things to tell me
Well, what could they be?
I'll never know, I had to go
Because I don't associate with fish
And so I continue to roam
Oh boy
Looking to find me a home

Ah, Ah---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
