1, 2, 3, 4,

Girl you been looking at him, a little too long for me to be your friend
And boy youve been looking at her a little too sure for me to be yours

And Ive been a little too nice, I know
You probably thought that we were just a show
But you better listen up, you better listen close, I dont think so

I, I think I should go, I can feel your eyes look at me in the door
Oh I can take a hint, oh I can take a clue 
your given me the go, sir your given me the boot
And Ive been a little too nice, I know
You probably thought that we were just a show
But you left me utterly confused, I am not here for you to use
So you better listen up, you better listen close, I dont think so---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
