Here's a lullaby
For anyone who wants to fly
From there home town 
Where people drown
And where the townies die

This old library 
Has thirty books and one dictionary 
But, that's okay 
No one reads anyway
We all watch T.V.

So, here's your lullaby 
No, boy, don't cry 
Just rest your head and go to bed 
Your time will come to fly
Away
But never today
Just dream your life away
Sleep... 

All the dogs will die
They just can't seem to stay alive
Cause in this town
Our cop shoots him down
And we just let him go and sigh

Please, God, please
What happened to our dreams?
We're loseing hope
So we invest in dope
To feel our vacant feelings

So here's your lullaby 
No, girl, don't cry
Just rest your head and go to bed 
Your time will come to fly 
Away
But never today
Just dream your life away
Sleep...---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
