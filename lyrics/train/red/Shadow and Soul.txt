This is not for you 
You dont belong here 
Caught in my soul 
Caught inside the shadow 
Buried, I kept you 
Helpless, Im reaching out 
Waiting for me
Lost between 

Shadow and soul, my untold still waits 
Find me in the dark, Ill meet you below 
Shadow and soul 

My darkest love 
You live in secret 
My heart unknown 
It calls, it cries to reach you 
Hunger, abandon 
I hid you right beneath 
Dying darkly (suffer) 
Arise, my only 

Dark and light 
Caught between, caught between 
Endless night 
Underneath, underneath 
Hunger, my untold, Im waiting 
Find me inside, the endless night, our endless night 
My furtive soul 
A heart unknown 
Its buried alive 
The boundary fades between

Shadow and soul 
My untold I'm waiting
Find me inside 
The endless night 
Our endless night---
