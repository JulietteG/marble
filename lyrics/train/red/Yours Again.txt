I can almost feel you breathing
Like a whisper in my ear
I remember how you lost me
Or how I lost you
I stare into the darkness
It's staring back at me
Why did I try to live without you
I want you I need you

Open up my eyes I need your light again
Burning me inside I need your love again
I can feel our hearts collide
I can feel our hearts ignite
Open up my eyes
I'm yours again

Will I wake up from this moment
Will I see you slip away
Or is this a new beginning
Of beauty and rage
Where did I lose my passion?
Where did I start to fade?
Without you my world is darkness
I won't let go again

(whoa... whoa..)
I'm yours again
(whoa.. whoa..)
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting go
I'm yours again (whoa.. whoa..)
I'm yours again (whoa.. whoa..)---
