Now it falls all around me
Did I think I could run away
Now its coming to find me
This war that I deserve
Now it burns across this shattered earth
I lift my eyes to fire

Under a falling sky
Hopeless, theres nowhere to hide
The terror is real this time
Under a falling sky
Im under, Im under
A falling sky

There you are, so far away
Did you think I was fighting you
I only wanted to carry you so far away from here
The nightmare bleeds
The poison seeps
I hear you call
Youre screaming, screaming

My fate it rains, it rains like cinders
The cadent drums, the war it comes
Growing thunder, terror, wonder
Falling, falling
Its falling, falling

Under a falling sky
The terror is real this time
Its over now, its over now

The terror is real
Im under, Im under
A falling sky
Under a falling sky
Im falling, Im falling
The terror is real this time
Im falling, Im falling
Under a falling sky
Im falling, Im falling ---
