(Verse 1)
And this is how it feels when I ignore the words you spoke to me
And this is where I lose myself,
When I keep running away from you
And this is who I get when,
When I don't know myself anymore
And this is what I choose when,
It's all left up to me

(chorus)
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I still need you
I'm falling, falling
Breathe into me
Breathe into me

(verse 2)
And this is how it looks when I am standing on the edge
And this is how it breaks apart when I finally hit the ground
And this is how it feels when I pretend I don't feel any pain
And this is how I disappear when I throw myself away

(chorus)
(Breathe into me, breathe into me, breathe into me...)

(chorus)

Breathe your life into me
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me
Falling, falling, falling
Breathe into me(x4)---Lyrics submitted by Joey.
