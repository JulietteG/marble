Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
I thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
And still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some would say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find 
And as I try to find my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will rear us both apart."
Well now pride's hone out the window
'Cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What has happened to me?
Crazy, some would say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find 
And as I try to find my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some would say
Where is the world that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find 
And as I try to find my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

And I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Everyone is my world
I will learn to survive
Everyone, everyone
Somehow I have to find---Lyrics submitted by Drake.
