You pretend to what you say you feel
You pretend that you're something special
All your lies that you hide behind
I see right through you
See right through you

Paint it on, cover every inch
Any flaw will expose your weakness
I'm immune to your fantasy
I won't become you
Won't become you

You want a perfect, perfect life
Nothing wrong, nothing real inside
All I see is a perfect lie
I don't want your perfect life
I don't want your perfect life

So keep your dream with no consequence
You damage me just to feed your senses
All your fake for reality
I see right through you
See right through you

Take your pride, take your vanity
Can't you see that your ego's empty
I will turn, I will walk away
I won't become you
Won't become you

You want a perfect, perfect life
Nothing wrong, nothing real inside
All I see is a perfect lie
I don't want your perfect life
I don't want your perfect life

My eyes are wide open
I see the enemy, the hypocrisy
Your cover is fading
Secrets pouring out, castles falling down
Nothing to hide behind
I know who I am inside
I'm perfectly broken

You want a perfect, perfect life
Nothing wrong, nothing real inside
All I see is a empty lie
I don't want your perfect life
I don't want your perfect life

I don't want your perfect life
I don't want your perfect life
The perfect life ---
