Why don't you communicate?
I thought that everything was ok
But something ain't right between us
I see a little frown on your face
Communication is the key
With you is where I wanna be
So tell me what's on your mind
If you let me know we can work it out

It seems your love has strayed away
I never meant to cause you pain
It seems your love has strayed away 
Will I see you again? (Seems your love)
It seems your love has strayed away
I never meant to hurt you baby (no, no, never)
It seems your love has strayed away
Will you ever love me again

Boy you really got me thinking 
Did I show you enough attention 
Coz it's true that I get so...
"Gotta end up doin' what a gotta do"
Just let me know if there's a problem
If so I pray that we can solve them
Coz after all is said and done
There's no other man for me 
You're the only one 

It seems your love has strayed away
I never meant to cause you pain
It seems your love has strayed away 
Will I see you again? (Seems your love)
It seems your love has strayed away
I never meant to hurt you baby (no, no, never)
It seems your love has strayed away
Will you ever love me again

Nah nah nah
Eyou eyou
Nah nah nah
Eyou eyou
See you again

Nah nah nah
Eyou eyou
Nah nah nah
Eyou eyou
See you again
Ever love you again

It seems your love has strayed away
I never meant to cause you pain
It seems your love has strayed away 
Will I see you again? (Seems your love)
It seems your love has strayed away
I never meant to hurt you baby (no, no, never)
It seems your love has strayed away
Will you ever love me again---Lyrics submitted by Shaninne.
