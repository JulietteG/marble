Preacher, Preacher what you got for me save my soul
See beneath, and clip my wings Im not an angel
I try and try to be good, I bought my pride, I'm a 
crook
Turn the lights down, burning up the night now

Sign my life out, Im sick of living in a shell
If you can help choir boy ring the church bells
Id turn back if I could, erase the pain if I could
But Im an animal and I dont know if I can

Hey!!!
Cause Im the prodigal man of this avalanche
Im going down, Im going down, down

Hey!!!
And if you turn me in
Ill confess my sins
Im going down, Im going down, down

Before Im six feet deep
Im washing my hands clean
Just get me out of this avalanche 


You scared the junk out of me man
The Ghost Rider, hold my soul tighter
Jehovah take the ropes Im a 
Fly a plane out of the atmosphere 
Ive attacked this fear
This scar's still here 
Im going on to the end
Im holding on to a friend
Im going Im going
I dont care 
I cursed a lot 
The worst, the black sheep of the lot
Christopher Scott, prepare to meet God

Hey!!!
Cause Im the prodigal man of this avalanche
Im going down, Im going down, down

Hey!!!
And if you turn me in
Ill confess my sins
Im going down, Im going down, down

Before Im six feet deep
Im washing my hands clean
Just get me out of this Avalanche 

Get me out, NOW
Get me out, NOW
Just get me out of this avalanche
Get me out, NOW
Get me out, NOW
Just get me out of this

You guided me when I was
Blind with pride a right off
Knocked me off my saddle
Sabotaged and overshadowed
Watched you chase a man down
Watched you raise a man out
Mercy on me, forever Im free

Hey!!!
Cause Im the prodigal man of this avalanche
Im going down, Im going down, down

Hey!!!
And if you turn me in
Ill confess my sins
Im going down, Im going down, down

Before Im six feet deep
Im washing my hands clean
Just get me out of this Avalanche 

Get me out, NOW
Get me out, NOW
Just get me out of this avalanche
Get me out, NOW
Get me out, NOW
Just get me out of this---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
