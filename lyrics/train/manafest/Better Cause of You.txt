Mr. Manafest is back
Fists up in the air attack
This the year I almost cracked
Souvenir among the pack
Tour around because of rap
Wind me up and let me smash
Take me home and put me in
Turn me on and hear me sing
Post my picture on your wall
Read about me on the blog
Go online and get my songs
Buy them all and party on, 
Yo!!!!!
I wont be the one to fall 
Follow me I carry on
Hit you like a sabotage 
Kick it like Im at a park


Get em off, get me lost
Hide me in this room and lock
The door and toss the key away
Id rather be alone okay

A stow away, go away
Cant you see, dont bother me
Get out or Im gonna freak

Hey I need a place
To get composure

Now I need, your face
To get me over

Unbelievable how I stay sober

I can feel Alive,
I'm better cause of you


Round and round I tour the globe
Show to show, I flip the flow
I sip a soda hit the sauna
Chilling sober still a soldier 
Sister, mother, fatal father, 
Fist to sin I finish farther 

Its like Im treading water
Sinking and its getting darker 
Mr. Mana needs to manage his anger
His tantrums going bananas 
Its random hands in a panic
Hes standing
Ramping up to blow up
The gold rush, is so hush
Yo know what, 
I think Ive had enough
Pull me up
Im getting out here
Im out of control
Fear has taken its toll
Im going back to my home
Follow me if you want
Its not easy I warn
But it gets results baby
Wont you leave me alone
Oh

Hey I need a place
To get composure

Now I need, your face
To get me over

Unbelievable how I stay sober

I can feel Alive,
I'm better cause of you

I act like I dont know you
I crash youre the first I go to
When Im down and feeling alone
I'm better off with you

I act like I dont know you
I crash youre the first I go to
When Im down and feeling alone
I'm better off with you---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
