The weak stay weak 
the strong stay strong
all of the rest just try to carry on
sure could you some hope in this life
some kind of relief from the endless fight

Every now and again I think I see your face
In the that people love me and the way they show your grace
It's then that I understand, you came to bring your love to every women child and man

It's just like you to bring light to my darkness
just like you to be there, when I need 
all you do you bring glory to Father
and I want to be just like you

I been searching to satisfiy my soul
restless and lonley and out of control 
When I fell to knees
I finaly found the missing peice

And nobody else, nobody else 
could save my weary soul
nobody else, nobody else
no one like you
well nobody else, nobody else
I've looked high I've looked low
nobody else, nobody else
no one like you

Well there's no one just like you to bring light to my darkness, yeah
just like you to be there, when I need you
In all you do you bring glory to the Father 
and I want to be just like you.
(just like you)

And nobody else, nobody else 
could save my weary soul
nobody else, nobody else
no one like you
hey nobody else, nobody else
I've looked high I've looked low
nobody else, nobody else
no one like you
sing no one like you lord, no one like you

Cause there nobody just like you to my darkness
just like you to be there, when I need 
all you do you bring glory to Father
and I want to be just like you

Well I want to be just like you
Yeah I want to be just like you

oh no, everybody 
Just like you---Lyrics submitted by Kate Lynn Purdy.
