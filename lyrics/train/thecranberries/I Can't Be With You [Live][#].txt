Lying in my bed again, 
And I cry 'cause you're not here. 
Crying in my head again, 
And I know that it's not clear. 

Put your hands, put your hands, 
Inside my face and see that it's just you. 
But it's bad and it's mad and it's making me sad, 
Because I can't be with you. 

Be with you. [X 4]
Be with you, be with you, baby, I can't be with you. 

Thinking back on how things were, 
And on how we loved so well. 
I wanted to be the mother of your child, 
And now it's just farewell. 

Put your hands in my hands, 
And come with me, we'll find another end. 
And my head, and my head on anyone's shoulder, 
'Cause I can't be with you. 

Be with you. [X 4]
Be with you, be with you, baby, I can't be with you. 

'Cause you're not here, you're not here, 
Baby, I can't be with you. 
'Cause you're not here, you're not here, 
Baby, still in love with you. 

Still in love with you. [X 6]---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
