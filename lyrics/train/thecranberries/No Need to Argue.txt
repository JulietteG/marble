There's no need to argue anymore
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore
And the thing that makes me mad
Is the one thing that I had
I knew, I knew, I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me,
Special to me

And I remember all the things we once shared
Watching tv movies on the living room armchair
But they say it'll work out fine
Was it all a waste of time?
Cause I knew, I knew, I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
Special to me

Will I forget in time how
You said I was on your mind
There's no need to argue
No need to argue anymore
There's no need to argue anymore---Lyrics submitted by ciara.
