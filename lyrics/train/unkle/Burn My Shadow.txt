I have burned my tomorrows
And I stand inside today
At the edge of the future 
And my dreams all fade away


I have burned my tomorrows
And I stand inside today
At the edge of the future 
And my dreams all fade away


And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away


Fate's my destroyer
I was ambushed by a light
And you judged me once for falling
This wounded heart arrives


And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away


When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
Burn my shadow
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
Burn my shadow
When I see the light
True love forever
Away


And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away
oh how i loved you---Lyrics submitted by Ethan.
