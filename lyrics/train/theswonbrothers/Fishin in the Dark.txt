Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonite,
shinin' thru the trees,
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs
are floatin on the breeze
Baby get ready.....

Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stone road
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get ready.....OooooooOooo

You and me going fishing in the dark,
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows.
Down by the river in the full moon light,
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow...

Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you...

Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
the days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along
Baby get ready.....

And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get ready.....OoooooooOoo

[Repeat the CHORUS (x3)]

You and me going fishin in the dark! ---
