On the last night on earth when the horses run free
The scriptures foretell of a party in Hackney
In a dimly lit room crammed with loathing and hate
Theyre selling their souls and I just cant wait

I shrivel inside at the sight of her beauty
I fall to the floor as shes shaking her booty
The rain makes me shiver; the wind turns me blue
Oh  the things we get up to, to get through the night after you

I knew it was wrong; I began to suspect
When she reached over and pressed the eject
I was up to the gunnels against your advice
I felt so ashamed that I did it twice

From disco to disco; from Safeway to Tesco
Were shopping around from the cradle til death row
From Tesco its down to the 7-11
To chase through the night time, to chase through the night after you
After you

I cant explain why I need to be free
But if you need to be naked thats alright by me
Its the fast track express to the graveyard, I know
So what are you waiting for? Hey ho, lets go

From disco to disco; from Safeway to tesco
Were shopping around from the cradle til death row
Dont stop til the train has pulled into the station
Ill hold the door for you  no, I insist, after you
After you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
