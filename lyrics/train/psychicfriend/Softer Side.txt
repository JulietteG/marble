Got two in my hand and one up my sleeve
From breaking the bread to never say please
It sweetened to taste, whose side are you on?
You're winning a race, a king or a pawn

It's coming apart, apart at the seems
You know what I want, you know what I need
From zero to 10, an A to a Z
The hero again, with nowhere to be

Find the softer side of you, hide the softer side of me
Find the softer side of you, hide the softer side of me

From once in awhile to habitually
You do what you say, I know what you mean
From finding a fault to building a steam
From never again to living the dream

Find the softer side of you, hide the softer side of me
Find the softer side of you, hide the softer side of me

In the shadows keep your eyes closed
Build your microbes
Hungry eyes froze

Find the softer side of you, hide the softer side of me
Find the softer side of you, hide the softer side of me
Find the softer side, hide the softer side of you---Lyrics submitted by Chay.
