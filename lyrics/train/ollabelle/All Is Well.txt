What's this that steals,
Steals upon my frame?

Is it death?
Is it death?

That soon will quench,
Quench this vital flame.

Is it death?
Is it death?

If this is death,
I soon shall be
From every pain
And sorrow free.
I shall the King
Of Glory see.

All is well.
All is well.  

Weep not my friends,
Friends, weep not for me.

All is well. 
All is well.

I sense a pardon.
Pardoned! I am free.

All is well.
All is well.

There's not a cloud
That's got the right
To hide my Savior
From my sight.
I soon shall mount
The open sky.

All is well.
All is well.

In truth your heart,
Your heart is saved in glory.

All is well.
All is well.

I will rehearse
Rehearse the pleasing story.

All is well.
All is well.  

Bright angels are from glory, come,
Around my bed, they're in my room.
They wait to walk my spirit home.

All is well.
All is well.
All is well.
All is well.---Lyrics submitted by brian.
