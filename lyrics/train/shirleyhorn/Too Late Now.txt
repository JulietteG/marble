Too late now to forget your smile
The way we cling when we danced awhile
Too late now to forget and
Go on to someone new

Too late now to forget your voice
The way one word makes my heart rejoice
Too late now to imagine
Myself away from you

All the things we have done together
I relive when we are apart
All the tender fun together
Stays on my heart

How could I ever close the door
And be the same as I was before?
Darling, no, no I can't anymore
It's too late now

All the things we have done together
I relive when we are apart
All the tender fun together
Stays on my heart

How could I ever close the door
And be the same as I was before?
Darling, no, no I can't anymore
It's too late now

Too late now---Lyrics submitted by Invisible.
