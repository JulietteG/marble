She cuts you like razor
You know the devil's got his way again
And if you ever taste her
You will never be the same again

I need to wake up by her side
Just once before I die

The purest delight, baby
Is when your body's close to me
The purest delight, baby
You're everything I need to feel

Sweet addiction, baby
She's an offer that you can't resist
No restrictions, baby
She is everything you know you missed

I need to wake up in her world
Just once before I die

Workin' it till I drop
Sayin' I'll never stop
Till I get out on top
Lift me up where I belong girl---Lyrics submitted by Rossella.
