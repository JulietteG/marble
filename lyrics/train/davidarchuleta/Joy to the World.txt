Every year at Christmas
All I can see
Are pictures of the things I want
Around the tree
But this year's a little different
I'm not thinking of myself
So my prayer for this Christmas
Is for somebody else

So I pray...
Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl
Hope when life is hard
Light when everything seems dark

God I know you're listening
And you can hear
The need of every broken heart
And all their tears
I don't have a lot to offer
Just this one simple prayer
That this Christmas everyone would know
Somebody cares...

So I pray...
Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl
Hope when life is hard
Light when everything seems dark

I pray that every hungry soul
David Archuleta Joy To The World lyrics found on http://www.directlyrics.com/david-archuleta-joy-to-the-world-lyrics.html
Will be filled and will be warm
That not a single, solitary child
Would suffer harm

And Lord we find their ending
As we take another view
My hope is that this Christmas prayer
Would somehow come true

I pray...
Humanity would rise
And join with me
And together we'll sing

Joy To the World (To all the world)
Peace (Peace) for every boy and girl (for every boy and girl)
(Talking bout hope) Hope when life is hard (when life is hard)
Light when everything seems dark

I pray that (I pray) every hungry soul
Will be filled and will be warm
(Not a single child) That not a single, solitary child
Would suffer harm

And Lord we find their ending
As we take another view
My hope is that this Christmas prayer
Would somehow come true...

Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl---Lyrics submitted by melony.
