Well I don't know how to say this right
And the world's got me choking
I keep hitting this wall
It's never gonna fall
And we're still broken

This mountain we've been trying to climb
It's never ending
Just can't do nothing, gotta do something
Cause if we'd opened up our eyes,
We're just pretending

Well there's a time for giving up
Didn't wanna have to say it
All we do is build the walls
And now there's too many barriers

Here we are, now you're here
It's our last final goodnight
Just because it feels so good
No use pretending we're alright

Too many locks, too many crimes,
Too many tears, too many lies
Too many barriers,
Just too many barriers

Now we've been draging this whole thing out
But I can't wait any longer
Our love's burning down, creeping in the dawn
We're not getting any stronger
I hear you saying that we're doing OK, but baby I don't think so
Just can't do nothing, gotta do something
Cause if I don't get into my car, I won't go very far

Well there's a time for giving up
Didn't wanna have to say it
All we do is build the walls
And now there's too many barriers

Here we are, now you're here
It's our last final goodnight
Just because it feels so good
No use pretending we're alright

Too many locks, too many crimes,
Too many tears, too many lies
Too many barriers,
Just too many barriers

That we keep running into
Been trying, but we just can't break through
I know I'm gonna keep wishing that was with you
But we just gotta stop

Here we are, now you're here
It's our last final goodnight
Just because it feels so good
No use pretending we're alright

Too many locks, too many crimes,
Too many tears, too many lies
Too many barriers,
Just too many barriers---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
