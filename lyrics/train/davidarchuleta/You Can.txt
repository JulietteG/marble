Take me where I've never been
Help me on my feet again
Show me that good things come to those who wait

Tell me I'm not on my own
Tell me I won't be alone
Tell me what I'm feeling isn't some mistake
Cause if anyone can make me fall in love,
You can,

[Chorus]
Save me from myself, you can,
And it's you, and no one else
If I could wish upon tomorrow,
Tonight would never end
If you asked me, I would follow
But for now I'll just pretend
Cause if anyone can make me fall in love,
You can

Baby when you look at me, 
tell me what do you see
Are these the eyes of someone you could love?
Cause everything that brought me here
well now it all seems so clear
Baby you're the one that I've been dreaming of
If anyone can make me fall in love,
You can,

[Chorus]

Only you can take me,
sailing in your deepest eyes
Bring me to my knees, and make me cry
No one's ever done this
Everything was just a lie
And I know, yes I know

This is where it all begins
So tell me it'll never end
I can't fool myself, it's you and no else
If I could wish upon tomorrow,
Tonight would never end
If you asked me, I would follow
But for now I'll just pretend
If anyone can make me fall in love,
You can

Show me that good things come to those who wait---Lyrics submitted by Justine.
