I know you don't wanna say goodbye yet
But she can't survive here with just a petal (paddle?)
You still have one wish, but it'd be useless
More than roses have died in this desert
Child, it seems that younger and younger
They start to wipe your minds clean
But how, I wonder, just barely under your eyes
Continue sparkling

And I, never want to open up your eyes
Everything's broken
And I, never want to open up your heart
Everything's broken

I don't understand why they are gone
Or what reason there is to be strong
I still try to love, but I'm in a place
Where doing what's right is so wrong
But if you see (simply?), ignore the gun
We are still fighting for life
Here's our wish just to exist
In more than our eyes

And I, never want to open up your eyes
Everything's broken
And I, never want to open up your heart
Everything's broken

Do you see what I see?
Do you feel what I feel?
It doesn't matter until we see broken lives heal
Do you see what I see?
Do you feel what I feel?
It doesn't matter until we see broken lives heal

Oh (Oh... oh, woah)... Oh no (Oooohhh)... yeah

And I, find it hard to open up my mouth
(Will?) They hear what's spoken
But I, saw when I opened up my eyes
Invisible children

Broke, but not broken
Broke, but not broken ---
