I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside, it was a rush, what a rush
cause the possibility 
that you would ever feel the same way about me
it's just too much, just too much
why do i keep running from the truth
all i ever think about is you
you've got me hypnotized
so mezmorized, and i just got to know

Do you ever think, when you're all alone
all that we can be, where this thing can go
am I crazy or fallin in love
is it real or just another crush
do you catch a breath, when i look at you
are you holdin back, like the way i do
cause im trying and trying to walk away
but i know this crush and goin away
goin away

Has it ever crossed your mind, when we're hangin spending time girl
are we just friends, is there more, is there more
see its the chance we've gotta take 
cause i believe that we can make this into
something that will last, last forever
forever

Do you ever think, when you're all alone
all that we can be, where this thing can go
am I crazy or fallin in love
is it real or just another crush
do you catch a breath, when i look at you
are you holdin back, like the way i do
cause im trying and trying to walk away
but i know this crush and goin away
goin away

Why do i keep running from the truth
all i ever think about is you
you got me hypnotized
so mezmorized
and i just got to know

Do you ever think, when you're all alone
all that we can be, where this thing can go
am I crazy or fallin in love
is it real or just another crush
do you catch a breath, when i look at you
are you holdin back, like the way i do
cause im trying and trying to walk away
but i know this crush and goin away
goin away---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
