There she goes once again
She's the kind of gils who drives a poor boy insane
As she strolls down the lane
Every word prepared eludes my heart can't explain
Maybe this time I'll be brave
and tell her how I feel
Ooh, there she goes
You know I think it's time I let her know
Ooh, there she goes
I don't think I can wait another day
So in line, so it seems
That the piece she's got could make my puzzle complete
So in love, so serene
If she'd only see the man for her I could be
I don't care what cynics say
I'm going to make her mine
Ooh, there she goes
You know I think it's time I let her know
Ooh, there she goes
I don't think I can wait another day
There's something 'bout the look in her eyes
I'd give her anything, anytime
Well don't you know that 'till I have her in my arms
I won't be coming home
Ooh, there she goes
You know I think it's time I let her know
Ooh, there she goes
I don't think I can wait another day---Lyrics submitted by maria.
