I dont want you baby
I dont need you lately
Love is ever-changing
And I think youre crazy

Oh girl, Ive got to let you let you let you go

Let me touch your daisy
Give me what I cant be
Let tomorrow face me
Love me, kill me, change me

Oh girl, Ive got to let you let you let you go

Im a jumper, baby
Mama, dont forsake me
Madness cant contain me
If you love me, chase me

Oh girl, Ive got to let you let you let you go
Girl, Ive got to let you let you let you go

Girl, Ive got to let you let you let you go---Lyrics submitted by maria.
