Yeaheah
Mhhhmhhmhmh

I can not find you
When you're always hiding from yourself
Playing hide and seek with me
'Til it gets too dark
Too dark inside your shell
Why do I even try when 
You take me for granted
I should know better by now
When you call I already here that crashing sound
As it all falls down

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah i know you can't
Too many deals deep in the ground
When it all falls down
The only way is up up up
The only way is up

I watch your spirit break as it shatters into a million pieces
Just like glass i see right through you and your parade of excuses
Feels like round all day
When you say the same thing over and over
Is that look in your eyes
And i hear that crashing sound
As it all falls down

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah i know you can't
Too many deals deep in the ground
When it all falls down
The only way is up up up
The only way is up

Well it's your love that's strong
It's the only thing that keeps me holding on
It's your heart that's weak
But it's not too weak to bring you back to me

It's never too late to turn it back around
Yeah i know you can't
Too many deals deep in the ground
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
The only way is up up up
The only way is up

It's never too late to turn it back around
When it all falls down
The only way is up up up
The only way is up up up---Lyrics submitted by Marlene.
