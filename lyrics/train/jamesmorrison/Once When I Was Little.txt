I was the one, 
Who would always 
Jump in first
Didn't think twice 
To look behind
Got such a good feeling, 
Just from playing 
In the dirt
Once, 
When I was little

We could build a rocket, 
Fly to the moon
Leave tuesday morning, 
And be back for noon
There wasn't nothing, 
Nothing that we couldn't do
Once, when i was little umm
Once, when i was little

Yeah i could dream more then
Yeah i believed more then
That the world 
Could only get better
Yeah i was free more then
I could pretend more then
That this life could 
Only show me good times
Once, when i was little 
Umm ohh lalala

There was a time 
When i trusted everyone
Yes i did
There was no place 
That i would not go oh no
Spend a day on the hillside 
Next to the holly mo
Oh once, when i was little
Yea once, when I, I was little

Yeah i could dream more then
Yeah i believe more then
That this world 
Could only get better
Yeah i was free more then
I could pretend more then
That this life could 
Only show me good times
Once, when i was little

Used to feel so strong
Even when they tell me, 
Tell me i was wrong
That i can't live 
In a magic world
Cause it's time 
For me to grow up
That i got to be 
Like the rest of them
When i know 
There acting up ohh

I could believe more 
Then yes i could
I could pretend more then
That this life could 
Only get better
I could believe more 
Then yes i could 
I could pretend more then

That this world could 
Only show me good times
Once, when i was little
When i was little

So here comes the next one, 
The next in line
Stay as young you can, 
For the longest time
Cause those days flew by
Like a breeze 
Just passing through
Once, when i was little---Lyrics submitted by rens.
