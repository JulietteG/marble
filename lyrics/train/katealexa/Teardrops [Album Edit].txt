When ever I hear the bass .. remind me, baby of you
I break down and cry .. next time Ill be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance .. remind me baby, of you
I took a crazy chance .. next time Ill be true
Ill be true, Ill be true

Footsteps on the dance floor ..remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes .. next time Ill be true, yeah
Whispers in the bathroom .. she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music dont feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

Foot steps left to right
Foot, foot steps left to right
Foot, foot steps left to right
Foot, foot steps left to right
Now I can scream of sanity
But it wont bring back no memory
My music seems like a distant friend to me
And my music is how youll remember me

Telling me dont cry again
Maybe one day well try again
One day you might be mine again
But until that day bye-bye my friend

Tears of a clown running down your face
Dancing feet on, thats your place
Its where you belong your style and grace
Cause now Im gone without a trace

Im hurting deep inside .. she cries on every tune
I break down and cry .. she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune
Footsteps on the dance floor .. remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes .. next time Ill be true
Whispers in the bathroom .. she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

Oh the music dont feel like it did when I felt it with you .. teardrops
nothing that i do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

Oh the music dont feel like it did when I felt it with you .. teardrops
nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
