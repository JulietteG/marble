Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go, oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go, oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go

I I I I I I
All those tears I cry, I I I I
All those tears I cry, oh oh, I I
Baby, please don't go

When I read the letter you wrote me
it made me mad mad mad
When I read the words that it told me
It made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so
I can't let you go
I love you
Ooh baby I love you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Every breath I take, oh oh oh oh
Oh, every move I make
Oh baby please, don't go

I I I I I I
You hurt me to my soul, oh oh oh oh
You hurt me to my soul, oh oh-hoh
Darling please don't go

When I read the letter you sent me
It made me mad mad mad
When I read the news that it brought me
It made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so
And I can't let you go
I love you
Ooh baby, I love you
