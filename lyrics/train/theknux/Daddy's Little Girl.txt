This is me, party out in Paris
Luxury glamorous 
Party life
Listen here, treat me like a favor
Luxury glamorous party life
Ahhh, whoa
Youre Daddys little girl
(repeat)

I wake up in the a.m., with plans to get my day in
Who gives a damn what they said, they cant see what Im making
My mac lip gloss my baggy, while Keekee takes a nappy
Dont hang with Jen cause shes a bitch and she aint got no cashy
My daddy, my daddy he owns a hum 
who knows, who cares
All I know is Im the heir
And theres no floss up in my hair
Paris Dicky role model, 17 year old model
No i.d., know my dad, I party drink the whole bottle
Shopping sprees in Italy
These 6-inch heels are killing me
My daddy give me some new wheels so they can really envy me
The beamer drop my halter top Im hot
Now check my license plate
Rich girl, rich girl
You wished you had a life this great.

This is me, party out in Paris
Luxury glamorous 
Party life
Listen here, treat me like a favor
Luxury glamorous party life
Ahhh, whoa
Youre Daddys little girl
(repeat)

You never had a real job, you always like to peel off
Mannie hands mini benz
And Beamers with the wheels off
Aint it, aint it something, Im almost almost famous
In any club my VIP I cut um like Lorena
Bobbitt, Ive been bobbin my head to my own beat
Tony and Bronie just chillin with my homies
I want more body, give em checks
Popular, I wear a sweater
I dont know a thing about it
But we look real good together

This is me, party out in Paris
Luxury glamorous 
Party life
Listen here, treat me like a favor
Luxury glamorous party life
Ahhh, whoa
Youre Daddys little girl
