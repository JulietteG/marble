When all the bright lights shut down
And they have closed every door in town
Ill be around

When there is nobody left to call
And youre surrounded by these walls
Ill make them fall
I'll make them fall
Aaahhh, aaaah

When all the money has been spent
And youve thrown away every cent
Ill take you in
When you are drifting off to sleep
Maybe tonight in your dreams
Consider me
Consider me
Aaahhh, aaaah---
