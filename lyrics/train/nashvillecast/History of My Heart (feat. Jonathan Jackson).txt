Just when I think I've finally found a way
To up and get you off my mind
Just when I finally got a prayer to pray
Your memory creeps up from behind

It don't matter
How many miles down the road
It don't matter
How many times I let you go
You're always with me
Written in the history of my heart

I've a tried a little bit of everything
To start again with someone new
But every time a path seems promising
It leads me right back here to you

It don't matter
How many miles down the road
It don't matter
How many times I let you go
You're always with me
Written in the history of my heart

No way I'm meant to walk
This world on my own
Some words are only wind
Some words are etched in stone
In stone

It don't matter
How many miles down the road
It don't matter
How many times I let you go
You're always with me
Written in the history of my heart
Written in the history of my heart
The history of my heart---
