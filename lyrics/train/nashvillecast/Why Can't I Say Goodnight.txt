It's almost sunrise
Hours and hours gone by
Candles are burned down
Turned into morning light

The time to go has come and gone
Why can't I? Why can't I say goodnight?

The whole world is sleeping
And still I can't give in
It's a love story
I never want to end

The time to go has come and gone
Why can't I? Why can't I say goodnight?

I'm using up all my strength
I can't tear myself away
It only gets harder as night turns to day

There isn't one place
Honey, that I'd rather be
Right here in your arms
With your head lying on me

The time to go has come and gone
Why can't I? Why can't I say goodnight?---
