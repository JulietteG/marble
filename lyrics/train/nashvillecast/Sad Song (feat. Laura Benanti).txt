There's a bottle o' wine on the kitchen table
Yeah, just hanging around
I could open it up and light a candle
Just burn the whole thing down
I'll be damned if it ain't raining
Perfect chance to feel the pain

But I don't wanna write a sad song
I don't wanna sing a sad song
No, I don't wanna be a sad song tonight.
No, not tonight.

I've been broken, God knows all the stories I could tell
My guitar's so sick of me feeling sorry for myself
Same ol' heartache, you again,
Did you come to party?
Do me in?

But I don't wanna write a sad song
I don't wanna sing a sad song
No, I don't wanna be a sad song tonight.
No, not tonight.

Just one night find peace in knowing
Where I've been is where I'm going

And I don't wanna write a sad song
I don't wanna sing a sad song
No, I don't wanna be a sad song tonight.
No, not tonight.
Mmmm...
No, not tonight.---
