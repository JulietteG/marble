(feat. Laura Benanti)

It's complicated 
It's how you laid it out 
Everything is changing 
You say we're fader 
You say we're weighted out 
Oh baby, you should know by now 
That you can't stop me 

Do what you gotta do 
Say what you gotta say 
Go if you gotta go 
But I hope you stay 
Me, I'm gonna stand right here 
I guess I still believe in 
You and me somewhere out there 
So baby, I believe in 

You can't stop me 
You can't stop me 
You can't stop me 

Brokenhearted and how we started out 
That's where we are now 
But we can make it 
If you could just hold out 
And baby I can't just lay down 
And you can't stop me 
So 

Do what you gotta do 
Say what you gotta say 
Go if you gotta go 
But I hope you stay 
Me, I'm gonna stand right here 
I guess I still believe in 
You and me somewhere out there 
So baby, I believe in 

You can't stop me 
You can't stop me 
You can't stop me 

There's always one thing I can't seem to comprehend 
This ain't something I can just turn off 

Do what you gotta do 
Say what you gotta say 
Go if you gotta go 
But I hope you stay 
Me, I'm gonna stand right here 
I guess I still believe in 
You and me somewhere out there 
So baby, I believe in---
