Digging for diamonds but all you get is coal. 
All of your stories have already been told. 
You're treading water, you never get nowhere. 
Tide it keeps shifting and it don't seem fair. 
Don't you ever give up. 

Just follow your head, follow your heart 
Wherever it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes. 
Don't let it run from you 
Taking a chance, taking a leap 
Whatever you do, just you, just you believe
And it may all come true. 

Jumping through fire, and all you get is burned. 
All of life's lessons you never seem to learn. 
Heading towards something then you trip and fall. 
You're getting used to running into walls.
Well go on pull yourself up. 

Just follow your head, follow your heart 
Wherever it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes. 
Don't let it run from you 
Taking a chance, taking a leap 
Whatever you do, just you, just you believe 
And it may all come true. 
Just you believe and it may all come true.---
