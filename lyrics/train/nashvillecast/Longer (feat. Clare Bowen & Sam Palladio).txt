Alone
I'm home
I'm home in my head
And now that unknown
Has grown, so I want this instead

Longer
Could you stay a little longer
Longer
Longer

I forgot 'bout this room, and the view, way above the things I fear it towers
And it's you, feelin' you again, makes me, open up just like a flower

Longer
Could you stay a little longer
Longer
Longer

'Cuz I want to give you more for
Nothing in return
Oh I did wait for you darlin', did ache for your darlin' and now you're Here, I want you dear to stay

Oooooooooh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

Longer
Could you stay a little longer
Longer
Longer
And then... longer
Longer---
