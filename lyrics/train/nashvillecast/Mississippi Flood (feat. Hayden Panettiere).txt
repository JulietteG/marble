I've got flowers, but
There ain't no grave
You're still walking
'round like nothin's changed
I've stopped breathing, but
I'm still feeling the pain

Everywhere I go
I hear your name
What I get out, what I get off
Of this street, out of this place
You're still breathing
But you're not feeling the pain

Put out the fire
Can't kill the flame

I... I.... I
I know I'm free but
Still my hands are tied
Behind my back
It's like a Mississippi flood
This love won't give up
No, it don't run dry
Why-y-y
It's gone, it's gone
But it ain't dead and gone
It's gone, it's gone
But it ain't dead and gone

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
x2

I... I.... I
I know I'm free but
Still my hands are tied
Behind my back
It's like a Mississippi flood
This love won't give up
No, it don't run dry---
