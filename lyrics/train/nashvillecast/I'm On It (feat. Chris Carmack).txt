I know you're rollin' down the runway outta LAX
Takin' off to wherever you're goin' next
It doesn't matter that I'm nowhere near that jet
Baby I'm on it

You know this memory ain't gonna leave you alone
You can try to drown it out with your headphones
But it doesn't really matter what comes on
Baby I'm on it

Girl you thought I was gone when you left me
But it's gonna be hard to forget me
Keep tellin' yourself that it's over
The only over I'll be is over your shoulder
I ain't gonna fade away with the tail lights
Down with the moon, baby up with the sunrise
Any song, any scene, any old side street
When you think you're rid of me then I'll be

On the wind in the fall when the leaves turn brown
But it's still warm enough to put your windows down
Every cobblestone corner in that college town
Baby I'm on it
When you're out at a bar with some new guy
And you end up in his arms at the end of the night
I oughtta be the furthest thing from your mind
But baby, I'm on it

Girl you thought I was gone when you left me
But it's gonna be hard to forget me
Keep tellin' yourself that it's over
The only over I'll be is over your shoulder
I ain't gonna fade away with the tail lights
Down with the moon, baby up with the sunrise
Any song, any scene, any old side street
Baby I'm on it

Girl you thought I was gone when you left me
But it's gonna be hard to forget me
Keep tellin' yourself that it's over
The only over I'll be is over your shoulder
I ain't gonna fade away with the tail lights
Down with the moon, baby up with the sunrise
Any song, any scene, any old side street
When you think you're rid of me then I'll be
On any sunny summer white sand beach
Any prayer when you just can't fall asleep
Anywhere the road you're on might lead
Baby I'm on it---
