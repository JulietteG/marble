(feat. Hayden Panettiere)

What'cha hidin', where you runnin'
Baby you've been up to somethin'
Don't you tell me it's not what it looks like

You had my heart but you tore right through it
Had your chance but you went and blew it
I might've been nave, but I'm not blind

You done me in, oh you done me wrong
Got me good baby, good as gone

Don't you know you should know better than this
Than to cover up the truth with your poisonous lips
I'm not fallin' for it this time
Try and try too little too late
Better open up your mouth, you got somethin' to say
Don't keep me waitin'
Don't leave me hangin' on a lie

Think you made your great escape but
I'll be the one who got away when you
Finally figure it out, you won't find me

You done me in, oh you done me wrong
Got me good baby, good as gone

Don't you know you should know better than this
Than to cover up the truth with your poisonous lips
I'm not fallin' for it this time
Try and try too little too late
Better open up your mouth, you got somethin' to say
Don't keep me waitin'
Don't leave me hangin' on a lie---
