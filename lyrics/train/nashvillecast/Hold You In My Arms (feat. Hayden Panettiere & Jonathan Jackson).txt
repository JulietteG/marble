Dream the sweetest dream
Swing from star to star
When you wake I will be here
To hold you in my arms

Darling don't you cry
Tears will soon be gone
In the night I will be here
To hold you in my arms

Hold you in my arms
Hold you in my arms
All is well, all is right
I'll hold you in my arms

Hold you in my arms
Hold you in my arms
When you wake I will be here
To hold you in my arms---
