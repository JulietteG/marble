I will hold my head up high
You will never see me cry
I'll smile and say I'm good
But I will fall apart if I could

I'm inside out, shot through the center
Feel the scar up where you weather
Took my life and turned it upside down
I'm burn to ashes, split down the middle
If anyone ask, it hurt just a little
I died inside the day I let you go
But I will never let you know

All this time the sky was blind
They say that the moon would shine
It's just the light from the sky
Maybe that's the way we are

I'm inside out, shot through the center
Feel the scar up where you weather
Took my life and turned it upside down
I'm burn to ashes, split down the middle
If anyone ask, it hurt just a little
I died inside the day I let you go
But I will never let you know---
