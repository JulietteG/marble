I stood in the street in the pouring rain
Didn't give a damn about anything
I said take me,
Oh Lord, just take me

I went back in the house
Picked up this guitar
And somehow my fingers found
Their way to my heart
And it save me
Oh Lord, it saved me

I'm not proud of my mistakes
But thanks to you I've got so much to say

Cause the best songs come from broken hearts
From busted dreams and beat up guitars
From times like these
When I'm down on my knees
It's true
Ya gotta dig deep within
The well of your soul
To find the will to sing the words
That only you know
About going through hell and
Living to tell the truth
But the best songs come from broken hearts

I fell for a dream
It was not what it seemed
By the time I woke up
I had lost everything
Thought I'd die without you
But I came to life without you

Yeah cause God has a way of working things out
If not for the music where would I be now
I'm gonna write about you
You bet I'm gonna write about you

Cause despite the obvious mistake
Thanks to you, babe, I've got so much to say

Cause the best songs come from broken hearts
From busted dreams and beat up guitars
From times like these
When I'm down on my knees
It's true
Ya gotta dig deep within
The well of your soul
To find the will to sing the words
That only you know
About going through hell and
Living to tell the truth
But the best songs come from broken hearts

Yeah ya gotta dig deep within
The well of your soul
To find the will to sing the words
That only you know
About goin through hell and
Living to tell the truth
But I'm willing to tell the truth

Cause the best songs come from
Ooh the best songs come from
Yeah the best songs come from broken hearts---
