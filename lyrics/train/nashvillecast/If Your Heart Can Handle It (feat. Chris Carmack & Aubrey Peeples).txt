If I could when I would go back in time yeah baby
Back before he left you high and dry and maybe
I could show you a thing or two
About what good love is supposed to do
He left you scared to love again
But where you're at ain't where you've been

Let me dry your eyes
And heal the hurt inside
If you're willing to baby
Got a pocket full of promise
Got it if you want it
Got a whole lot more to give
If your heart can handle it

I've been broke, I've been used, can't take another go around honey
It's gonna take a little time, you know the right kind I'm loving
If you ain't in any kind of love
Baby that's the least of my worries
So now I plan and laid it all out there
If I'm gonna start I guess I've gotta start somewhere

You can dry my eyes
And heal the hurt inside
If you're willing to baby
Got a pocket full of promise
Got it if you want it
Got a whole lot more to give
If your heart can handle it

We have all the pieces
All the things we need
To put it back together again
I'm in
If you're in
Well I'm in

Let me dry your eyes
And heal the hurt inside
If you're willing to, baby
Got a pocket full of promise
Got it if you want it
Got a whole lot more to give
If your heart
If your heart
If your heart can handle it
If your heart can handle it
My heart can handle it---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
