It'll take you far
Fast and hard
Keep you longer than you thought you'd stay
Grab your soul
Won't let go
And be with you when you're wide awake

Dreams, dreams
Sometimes it seems I'm hunted by my dreams
Pray, oh, I pray
'Cause I know these dreams can carry me away

Well, would I be?
Lost or free?
Cost is cheap when you know you mean
The helping hand
A guiding light
Somewhere to go on my darkest night

Dreams, dreams
Sometimes it seems I've been saved by my dreams
Pray, oh, I pray
'Cause I know these dreams can carry me away

Uh, uh.

Dreams, dreams
Sometimes it seems I'm hunted by my dreams
Pray, oh, I pray
'Cause I know these dreams can carry me away

'Cause I know these dreams can carry me away.---
