 If you think you're gonna hear
how much I miss you
If you're needing to feel better 'bout yourself
If you're wanting to hear me
say I forgive you
'Cause tequila turned you into someone else

If you're looking for one more chance
A little stand by your man

Youve got the wrong song
Coming through your speakers
This ones about a liar and a cheater
Who didnt know what he had
'till it was gone
Youve got the wrong girl
Cause Ive got your number
I dont know what kind of spell
you think Im under
This ain't a feel-good,
"Everything's fine" sing-along
Youve got the wrong song

Tell me, boy,
Was she worth every minute ?
I hope you had the time of your life
You made your bed,
now go lie in it
All I got to say to you is goodbye

How'd you think I'd act
Singing "Baby, come back"

Youve got the wrong song
Coming through your speakers
This ones about a liar and a cheater
Who didnt know what he had
'till it was gone
Youve got the wrong girl
Cause I got your number
I dont know what kind of spell
you think Im under
This ain't a feel-good,
"Everything's fine" sing-along
Youve got the wrong song

Everybody makes mistakes
We can work it out
Wouldn't it be nice
If that's what I was singing now

But youve got the wrong song
Coming through your speakers
This ones about a liar and a cheater
Who didnt know what he had
'till it was gone, gone, gone
Youve got the wrong girl
Cause I got your number
I dont know what kind of spell
you think Im under
This ain't a feel-good,
"Everything's fine" sing-along

Youve got the wrong song
Youve got the wrong song
Youve got the wrong song, yeah---
