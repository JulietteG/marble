(feat.Hayden Panettiere)

So you think that you're the one who's up in score 
Just cause you're the first one walkin' out the door 
Well, take it when you leave 
I don't need your sympathy 

I'm gonna stay up, drunk on wine 
Hurt like hell 
Ugly crying black mascara tears 
I'm gonna lock my door 
Sleep with my phone 
Miss you bad for a month or so 
But let me tell you somethin', my dear 
I'm gonna be just fine, but you're never gonna find 
Another love like mine 

Oh no, no 

See, I think you think that "new" means "better off" 
But the proof's in the pudding once the shine is lost 
So go and get yourself 
A little taste of somethin' else 

I'm gonna stay up, drunk on wine 
Hurt like hell 
Ugly crying black mascara tears 
I'm gonna lock my door 
Sleep with my phone 
Miss you bad for a month or so 
But let me tell you somethin', my dear 
I'm gonna be just fine, but you're never gonna find 
Another love like mine 

It's starting to sound like the good idea 
The more we're standin' here 

I'm gonna stay up, drunk on wine 
Hurt like hell 
Ugly crying black mascara tears 
I'm gonna lock my door 
Sleep with my phone 
Miss you bad for a month or so 
But let me tell you somethin', my dear 
I'm gonna be just fine, but you're never gonna find, no 
I'm gonna be just fine, but you're never gonna find, no 
I'm gonna be just fine, but you're never gonna find 
Another love like mine 

Oh no, no 
Never gonna find another love like mine 
Oh no, no ---
