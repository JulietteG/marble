Well this bed feels better with nobody in it
Well thank god I don't have nobody blowing up my phone
Well it's a Friday night and i'm gonna spend it how I want
Cause I've always been a whole lot happier on my own

All the lies of the lonely
All the empty words of the solitary mind
A thin disguise, you think they don't see
Can't hide the lonely in your eyes

I don't wanna be no ball and chain
i don't wanna wear no heavy rings
I don't wanna be somebody's other
I got my friends, don't need no lover

Well, I love being single
I love my friend
I love telling everybody that we're not together anymore
And all of those love songs
Well, they can keep 'em to themselves
'Cause I'm so much better off than I was before

All the lies of the lonely
All the empty words of the solitary mind
A thin disguise, you think they don't see
Can't hide the lonely in your eyes

I don't wanna be no ball and chain
i don't wanna wear no heavy rings
I don't wanna be somebody's other
I got my my friends, don't need no lover

All the lies of the lonely
All the empty words of the solitary mind
A thin disguise, you think they don't see
Can't hide the lonely in your eyes
Can't hide the lonely in your eyes

The lies of the lonely
The lies of the lonely
Hey the lies of the lonely---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
