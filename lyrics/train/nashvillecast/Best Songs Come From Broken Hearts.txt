I stood in the street in the pouring rain,
Didn't give a damn about anything
I said take me, oh Lord just take me
Went back in the house picked up this guitar
And somehow my fingers found the way to my heart
And it saved me oh Lord it saved me
I'm not proud of my mistakes
But thanks to you I've got so much to say

Cause the best songs come from broken hearts,
From busted dreams and beat up guitars
It's times like these when I'm down on my knees it's true
Yeah, you've got to dig deep within the well of your soul
To find the will to sing the words that only you know
about going through hell
and living to tell the truth
Oh But the best songs come from broken hearts

I fell for a dream, it was not what it seemed
By the time I woke up I had lost everything
Thought I'd die without you
But I came to life without you
Yeah cause God has a way of working things out
If not for the music where would I be now
I'm gonna write about you, you bet I'm gonna write about you
Despite the obvious mistake 
Thanks to you now I've got so much to say

Cause The best songs come from broken hearts
From busted dreams and beat up guitars
It's times like these when I'm down on my knees it's true
Yeah you've got to dig deep within the well of your soul
To find the will to sing the words that only you know
About going through hell
And living to tell the truth
Oh, but the best songs come from broken hearts

Yeah you've got to dig deep within the well of your soul
To find the will to sing the words that only you know 
About going through hell (going through hell)
And living to tell the truth (living to tell the truth)
But I'm going to tell the truth
Cause the best songs come from, the best songs come from,
The best songs come from broken hearts
Yeah broken hearts---Lyrics submitted by Susan Le Vin.
