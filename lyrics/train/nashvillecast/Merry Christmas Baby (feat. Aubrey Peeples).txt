Merry Christmas, baby
You surely treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby
You surely treat me nice
Gave me diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe

Oh, Santa came down the chimney
About half past three
Left all this pretty presents 
that you see before me

Merry Christmas, pretty baby
You sure look good to me
Ain't had a taste this morning
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
