Like a flowers got a field
and the clouds got the rain;
Like a night has got the stars
and a fires got a flame;
Like a moon has got the tide
the rivers got the sea;
Oh, I've got you and you've got me

Oh somethings are guaranteed
Oh somethings will always be
mhmm mhmm hmm
Oh, I've got you and you've got me

Like a singers a song
and a song has got a rhyme;
Like I know you've got a smile
when I can't get to mine;
Like every soul has got a heart
and a heart has bot a beat;
Oh, I've got you and you've got me

Oh somethings are guaranteed
Oh somethings will always be
mhmm mhmm hmm
Oh, I've got you and you've got me

Oh somethings are guaranteed
Oh somethings will always be
mhmm mhmm hmm
I've got you and you've got me
Oh, I've got you and you've got me
Yeah I've got you and you've got me---
