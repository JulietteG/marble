Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me 
Been an awful good girl, santa baby 
And hurry down the chimney tonight 

Santa baby, a '52 convertible, too, light blue 
I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby 
And hurry down the chimney tonight 

Think of all the fun I've missed 
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed 
Next year I could be twice as good 
If you check off my Christmas list 

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot 
I've been an angel all year, santa baby 
So hurry down the chimney tonight 

Santa honey, there's one thing I really do need, the deed 
To a platinum mine 
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight 

Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex, and checks 
Sign your 'X' on the line 
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight 

Come and trim my Christmas tree 
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's 
I really do believe in you 
So let's see if you believe in me 

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing 
A ring 
I don't mean on the phone, santa baby 
So hurry down the chimney tonight 
Hurry down the chimney tonight 
Oh hurry santa baby tonight---
