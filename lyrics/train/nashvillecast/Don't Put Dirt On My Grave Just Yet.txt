(feat. Hayden Panettiere)

I thought things couldn't get much worse
But guess what they did
You hit my heart upside with a wrecking ball
Oh but that's what I get
But I'm not going nowhere
I can live on my prayers
'Cause I'm done playin' nice
I'm done running for life
'Cause you think that you got me scared

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell - come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Oh, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Everyone can save their breath
They can spare me the change
You can point your finger somewhere else
If you're looking to blame

I'll give you something to believe
Nothing on me says defeat
No I'll never look back-
So you better think fast-
If you think you can cut me deep

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell - come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Hey, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Hey!
Well it's going to take more, going to take more, going to take more, to pull me under
Going to take more, going to take more, going to take more than that to pull me under!

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell - come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Oh, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Don't put dirt on my grave just yet.
