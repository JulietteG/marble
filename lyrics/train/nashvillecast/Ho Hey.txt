(Ho!) 
(Hey!) 
(Ho!) 
(Hey!) 

(Ho!) I've been trying to do it right 
(Hey!) I've been living a lonely life 
(Ho!) I've been sleeping here instead 
(Hey!) I've been sleeping in my bed, 
(Ho!) I've been sleeping in my bed 
(Hey!) 

(Ho!) 

(Ho!) So show me family 
(Hey!) All the blood that I would bleed 
(Ho!) I don't know where I belong 
(Hey!) I don't know where I went wrong 
(Ho!) But I can write a song 
(Hey!) 

1, 2, 3 
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart 
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet 
(Ho!) 

(Hey!) 
(Ho!) 
(Hey!) 

(Ho!) I don't think you're right for him 
(Hey!) Look at what it might have been if you 
(Ho!) Took a bus to China Town 
(Hey!) I'd be standing on Canal 
(Ho!) And Bowery 
(Hey!) 
(Ho!) And she'd be standing next to me 
(Hey!) 

1, 2, 3 
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart 
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart 

Love  we need it now 
Let's hope for some 
So, we're bleeding out 

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart 
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet 
(Ho!) 

(Hey!) 
(Ho!) 
(The last one) 
(Hey!) ---
