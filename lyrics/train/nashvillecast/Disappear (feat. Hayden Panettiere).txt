I've seen love fade from a lovers eyes
Saw a ship sailed away on an evening time
As the sun was slowly going down
I've searched my heart and I wondered why
Does everything I love slip through my hands like water, like sand?
It reminds me of the waves, they crash and roll away

Farewell to the setting sun
Goodbye just seems to come for everything and everyone that I hold deep
Lord knows I prayed and cried before I see the other side
I hope I find the answer and it's finally clear
Before it all just disappears

Like a drop of rain falling in the sea
Or an ocean full of memories
I've seen this life take what I love
And had the wind blow it so far from me
Like everything I love slips through my hands like water, like sand
It reminds me of the waves, they crash and roll away
And they just disappear

Farewell to the setting sun
Goodbye just seems to come for everything and everyone that I hold deep
Lord knows I prayed and cried before I see the other side
I hope I find the answer and it's finally clear
Before it all just disappears

We've all faced an angry sky, with no safe place we could hide
Watched the dark clouds turn to lie with all our fears
All these years, they just disappear
They just disappear
I'll just disappear---
