Ray..Yeah It's Yung Berg
Sexy can I
Yeah, Yeahhh
All we wanna know is....

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, Sexy can I, Sexy Can I, hit it from the front,
then I hit it from the back.
know you like it like that.
then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
then we chill for a second, then we're makin love some more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.

[Young Berg:]
What up lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin
G5 dippin, lui vuitton luggage (ay)
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (ohhh) when a nigga go by.
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with cha boy in the chi.
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
so boyfriend, she ain't missed him since.

[Ray J:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.
Sexy can I, keep it on the low.
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo.
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo.
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo.
(Oh,ohh,ohh) go shawty, go shawty.
Baby when we make love it's like, (Oh,ohh,ohh)
(I don't know what your man is like but shawty all I want to know is:)
sexy can I.

Sexy can I, visit you at work
When you sliding down the pole
no panties,no shirt
Then you climb back up the pole,
then you drop and do the splits.
How you make that booty talk,
Baby damn, u workin wit it
(Oh,ohh,ohh) go shawty, go shawty.
I make it rain in the club like (Oh,ohh,ohh)
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is:)
Sexy can I

Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.

Young Berg:

I don't care who's ya boy doin, or who Ray's nailing
When I give it to her, i know that she ain't tellin'
See i'm a go getta and she'll go get it
You already know shit...
(Sexy can I)
Sexy can I send for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool no towel
let it air dry.
And if you ain't doin tonight
then you can watch that tour bus go by

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (oh baby)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.
Sexy can I, hit it from the front,
then I hit it from the back.
know you like it like that.
then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
then we chill for a second, then we're makin love some more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I.
