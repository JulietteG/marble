Lenas been burning both ends of her candle.
Shes over her head in complication and scandal.
But Lena takes her troubles in stride.
As she runs to the bottle,
To confess and confide,
Lena surrenders.

Lena has taken to flaunting her passions
Offers herself in the boldest of fashion
But Lena says its under control
As she looks to the bottle,
To calm and console,
Lena surrenders

Lena,
Surely you dont believe,
By hiding in bottles youll ever relieve 
All the pain love has brought you:
The fire and the cold.
Lena,
Take heart,
Take heart

Lena,
Surely you dont believe,
By hiding in bottles youll ever relieve 
All the pain love has brought you: 
The fire and the cold.

Lena,
Take heart.
Take heart.
Take heart.
Take heart.
Lena!
Lena!
Take heart.
Lena!
