If it's on it's on for good
Cuz when it's gone it's gone for good, let me tell you
And if you stayed over, you know we would, if we could
Put it back together piece by piece
Put it back together 
Make it good

If I
Breathe in the future, breathe out the past
Savour this moment as long as it lasts, let me tell you
Put it back together piece by piece
Put it back together 

Make it good

If you stayed over I'd make it so sweet
I'd make you remember, baby, from your head to your feet
If you go now babe we'll never know
If you go now babe we'll never know
If you go now babe we'll never know
How It Ends

So

Make it good---Lyrics submitted by MTemnyalova.
