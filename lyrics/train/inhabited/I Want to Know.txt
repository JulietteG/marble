Are you here, you here, you here with me
Are you here, you here, you here with me
I need yo feel you here, feel you here with me

Are you here, you here, you here with me
Are you here, you here, you here with me
I need yo feel you here, feel you here with me

You're everywhere I go
You are the water that heals the broken soul
You're the whisper that moves tyhe leaves
You're in a stranger's smile I meet on the streets
But I need You here, I need You here

I want to know
I want to feel
I want to see You move underneath my skin
I want to hear, speak to me
I want to feel You breathe
I want to feel you breathe through me

You're everywhere I go
You are the fire that burns and takes control
You're the words that bring me life
You're the starlit sky that sings in the night
But I need You here, I need You here

I want to know
I want to feel
I want to see You move underneath my skin
I want to hear, speak to me
I want to feel you breathe
I want to feel you breathe through me

Won't You come and breathe through me
Won't You come and sing through me
I'll wait, I will wait for You

And there's nothing that can change my mind
I've seen Your face a thousand times
I believe in You
I believe in You
And there's nothing that can change my mind
I've seen your face a thousand times
I believe in You
I believe in You

I want to know
I want to feel
I want to see You move underneath my skin
I want to hear, speak to me
I want to feel you breathe
I want to feel you breathe through me

(I want to know)
(I want to feel)
Breathe through me, yeah yeah
(I want to see you move underneath my skin)
Breathe through me, yeah
(I want to hear, speak to me)
Breathe through me, yeah yeah yeah
(I want to feel you breathe)
Breathe through me
I want to feel you breathe through me

I believe
There's nothing that can change my mind
I've seen your face a thousand times
I believe
I believe---Lyrics submitted by Katy Burks.
