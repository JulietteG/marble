He packed his bags he was only ten
Had to face the world and be a man and,
Sometimes things just don't make since

It was two years later, met him at a show
He said excuse me miss but is there hope and,
Tears were rollin' down his face

He said,
Is Jesus there and does he really cause
No ones really ever cared and,
Is this all my fault?

I said,

God will never walk out on you
He'll be the father that you never knew
He loves you
More than words can say, yeah
He won't leave you when you need him the most and,
His love is unconditional, and you know,
You put a smile upon His face

She went outside like any other day
Just wanted to go out and play
Saw the paper on her way

Saw daddy's picture on the front page
He wasn't comin' home wouldn't be the same
She grew up only knowing his name

One day she cried,
Jesus if you're really there
I need you now 'cause no one cares and,
Is anybody even listening?

I said,
God will never walk out on you 
He'll be the father that you never knew
He loves you
More than words can say, yeah
He won't leave you when you need him the most
And His love is unconditional,
and you know, you put a smile upon his face

God will never walk out on you
He'll be the father that you never knew
He loves you
More than words can say, yeah
He won't leave you when you need Him the most
And his love is unconditional, and you know,
You put a smile upon His face

Ooo, how He loves you, loves you, loves you
How He loves you, loves you, loves you
How He loves you, loves you, loves you
More than my words can say---Lyrics submitted by Katy Burks.
