Searching the world,
The lost will be found.
in freedom we live,
As one we cry out.
You carried the cross,
You died and rose again,
My God,
I'll only ever give my all.
....
You sent your Son,
From heaven to earth,
You delivered us all,
It's Eternally heard,
I Searched for Truth
and All I found is you
My God,
I'll only ever give my all.

Chorus:
Jesus, we're living for Your name,
We'll never be ashamed of you, woo,oh,oh
Our praise
And all we are today
Take, take, take, it all.
Take, take, take, it all.

You sent your Son,

We'll never be ashamed of you, woo oh oh
Our praise
And all we are today

Running to the one who heals the blind.
Following the shining light
In Your hands the power to save the world
And my life.

And my life.
