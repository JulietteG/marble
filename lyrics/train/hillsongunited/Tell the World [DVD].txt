Dont want to stand here and shout Your praise 
And walk away and forget Your Name 
Ill stand for you if its all I do 
Cause there is none that compare to You 

Cause all I want in this lifetime is You 
And all i want in this whole world is you 

Tell the world that Jesus lives 
Tell the world that, tell the world that 
Tell the world that he died for them 
Tell the world that he lives again 

No longer I but Christ in me 
Cause its the truth that set me free 
How could this world be a better place? 
But by thy mercy and by thy grace 

Cmon, cmon well tell the world about You 
Cmon, cmon well tell the world about You 

Tell the world that Jesus lives 
Tell the world that, tell the world that 
Tell the world that he died for them 
Tell the world that he lives again 

Cmon, cmon well tell the world about You 
Tell the world that 
Tell the world that
Cmon, cmon well tell the world about You 
Tell the world that
Tell the world that 
About You---Lyrics submitted by deybid.
