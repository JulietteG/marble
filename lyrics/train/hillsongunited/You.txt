Invading all my weakness
You wrapped me up in grace
The worse of me succeeded
By the best of You

My heart is overtaken 
My soul is overwhelmed
The worse of me succeeded
By the best of You

My dreams have found their purpose
My future in Your hands
This life would have no meaning
If it weren't for You

So I lay me down for Kingdom come
Steal all that is within me
'Cause all I want in this world
Is more of You

And the less of me it is You
Increasing as I fade away
Your life for all the world to see
God, it is You who breaks the chains
It is You who lights the way
And everything I am cries out for You

Oooooh, Oooooh, Oooooh
So I lay me down, So I lay me down---Lyrics submitted by Angel Alfaro.
