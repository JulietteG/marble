Oh whooaa oh oww [2x]

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody yeah
You know that I could use somebody yeah

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody yeah
You know that I could use somebody yeah

Someone like you whoaa ow whoaa ow [2x]

Off in the night while you live it up
I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice yeaah
I hope it's gonna make you notice yeah

Someone like me ohh whooaa oh
Someone like me oooh whoaaa whoow

I'm ready now [repeat]

Someone like you
You know that I could use somebody yeeaaah
You know that I could use somebody yeaeah
whooa oh

I've been roaming around up
Looking down at all I see ---Lyrics submitted by zeina abouward.
