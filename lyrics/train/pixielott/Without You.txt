I don't know what to say 
I don't know what to say 
Anymore cause its all've been said before 
And I don't know where you are 
All I know is your far 
And your not coming back 
If this is how it goes 
I tried but I dont know 

I don't know if I like it 
Without you, without you, without you, 
Tell me how I'm supposed to make it 
Without you, without you, without you 
You got me crying tonight 
Is this what it's gonna be like 
I try and act like im fine but I will never be right 
Without you, without you, without you
Without you I don't know 

I'm not sure how to feel 
I'm not sure what I feel 
Anymore cause I never felt that big 
Sometimes It's hurts me so bad 
Its the words gotta say 
And I cant live like that 
I don't wanna be alone 
I tried but I don't know 

I don't know if I like it 
Without you, without you, without you, 
Well me how I'm supposed to make it 
Without you, without you, without you 
You got me crying tonight 
Is this what It's gonna be like 
I try and act like im fine but i will never be right 
Without you, without you, without you 
Without you I don't know 

The one thing I do know 
That I'm so sure of 
Cause with you gone I'm lost 
And I'm so confused I cant deal with it no more 
Without you I cant see it, take this pain from me 
So I can make room for you, 
Cause you've been gone from me for too long 
I don't know 

I don't know if I like it 
Without you, without you, without you, 
Tell me how I'm supposed to make it 
Without you, without you, without you 
You got me crying tonight 
Is this what it's gonna be like 
I try and act like I'm fine but I will never be right 
Without you, without you, without you 
Without you I dont know
