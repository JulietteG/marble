Dear friend of mine
I've got to leave all this behind
I've outgrown all I know
Our time is borrowed
Guess it wasn't ours to own
And after the clouds have lifted
We are drifting apart

Chorus (1):
But I'll go on, go on the world's before me
Time to write a different story
Finally know that nothings in my way
I'll go on, go on to chase the sunset
Take whatever chances I get
Face the most of every single day
I'll go on, in my own way

Sweet friend of mine
This thing you've wanted
I know you'll find
We faked it we can't hide
You know it's hard for me
But can't you see
This is the way it's got to be
So let's think of happy times we've had

Chorus (1)

Chorus (2):
I'll go on, go on the world's still spinning
Time to live, I'm just beginning
Finally know that nothings in my way
I'll go on, go on to chase the sunset
Think of all the chances I get
Making the most of every single day
I'll go on, in my own way

I know that I'm scared
That I may fall
But I know it's time to leave it all behind
I'll wake up, wake up more
Yeah

Chorus (1)
Chorus (2)

Dear friend of mine
It's getting late
This letter's taking so much time
I wanted you to see
I'll go on, I know, even if you're not with me---Lyrics submitted by Leena.
