[chorus:]
A-a couple gran, p-p-price tag on ya head leave ya layin were ya stand
A-a couple gran, p-p-price tag on ya head, on ya head, on ya head
A-a couple gran, p-p-price tag on ya head, price tag on ya head
A-a couple gran, p-p-price tag on ya head leave ya layin were ya stand

[verse 1:]
Watch him die slow, and then his eyes roll
In da back of his head now his body cold
A couple gran, a couple shots, a couple drip drops, now ya leakin won't stop
Bitch i'm da man, just ask block, shots rain out, u can hear em from a couple blocks
Bitch wats my name? Call me yung joc, i got a great aim, all i need is one shot
Errbody talkin in my neighborhood, i got great lawyers, cause my paper good,
Leave ya body riddled, weazin and coughin, hear bout it live, fox 5, and monica coffman
U fuck with mine, i cross ya lifeline, i'm a graffiti artist, paint chalk out outlines
And the worst part, is i'm not a coward, visit yo wake and give ya momma dead flowers

[chorus]

[verse 2:]
This is not a movie, no reruns, all sales final, no refunds
Once i make the payment, the hits out, i'm not jeezy i ain't swappin shit out
First i tell him, were i want it done, in the backyard right in front of his son
Then i tell him, were to drop him off, in the chattahoochie with his dick chopped off (damn!)
Yes dats harsh, but it's well deserve, feed his ass to the sharks for orderves
No remorse, no pity, this can happen to you in new jock city

[chorus]

[verse 3:]
I got a couple killas, got a great choppa, blast through ya fool, shit ya guts leak out,
The sheriff call ya momma, and she freak out, got a hit meant fo her, dial yo momma speed dial
Oooo it ain't nutn, but a call away, come home and find yo baby sista in the hallway
9-1-1, but it's too late, she lookin like a maxi-pad bleeding through da duck tape
