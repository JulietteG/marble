Caught again
Your faithless friend
Don't you ever tired of hearing 
What a fool I've been.
Guess I should pray
What can I say,
Oh it hurts to know 
The hundred times I've caused you pain
The "forgive me" sounds so empty
When I never changed
Yet you stay and say "I love you"
Still forgiving me time and time again.

Chorus:
It's your stubborn love
That never let go of me
I don't understand how you can stay
Perfect love embracing the worst in me
How I long for your
Stubborn love.

Funny me
Just couldn't see
Even long before I know You
You were loving me
Sometimes I cry, you must cry to
When you see the broken promises I've made to you
I kept saying that I trust You
Though I seldom do
Yet you stay and say 
You love me still knowing someday 
I'll be like you.

Chorus:
It's your stubborn love
That never let go of me
I don't understand how you can stay
Perfect love embracing the worst in me
How I long for your
Stubborn love.---Lyrics submitted by Yes de Pedro.
