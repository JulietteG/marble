Here is my car, my phone and my TV
I've got it all but you can see through me

But am I here?
It's kind of hard to tell
I do a good impression of myself
But what's normal now anyhow?

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way they wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way they wish away each day

Prescription drugs they help me through the day
And that restraining order keeps me well at bay
But what's normal now anyway?

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way they wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way they wish away each day

Wish I was old and a little sentimental
You gotta see the waves, looking for the bottle in the waves now---
