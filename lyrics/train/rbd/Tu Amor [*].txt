Mi amor
I'm not sure of the right words to say
Maybe these simple words will do best to best explain
What I feel in my heart 
What I feel more each day ohh
How to make you see how to let you know
How to see how to say how I love you so

With words you understand 
Words that get right through to your heart
Here's the place to start

Tu amor
I will always be tu amor
Means the world to me
Estaras siempre en mi corazon
You're the one in my soul and I live for 
Tu amor
Tu amor

Mi amor
Love you more with each look in your eyes
Maybe these simple words will do best to best describe
What I feel in my heart
What I feel for all time time ohh
How to make you see how to let you know
How to see how to say how I need you so

With words you understand 
Words that get right through to your soul
Words that let you know

Tu amor
I will always be 
Tu amor
Means the world to me
Estaras siempre en mi corazon
You're the one in my soul and I live for 
Tu amor

You're the one that I need in my arms
Believe me these words I say 
Are words that come straight from my heart
How do I make you believe
Nothing else means as much as what you mean to me

Tu eres la unica en mi alma
(Tu eres el unico en mi alma)
Yo te quiero 
(Yo te quiero)
Te adoro 
(Te adoro)
Tus labios 
(Tus labios)
Tus ojos 
(Tus ojos)
Mi amor
(Mi amor)

Tu amor 
I will always be 
Tu amor 
Means the world to me
Estaras siempre en mi corazon 
You're the one in my soul and i live for
Tu amor
Tu amor
Tu amor
Tu amor
Yo te quiero
Te adoro
Amor
Mi amor
Estaras siempre en mi corazon
Estaras siempre en mi corazon
Estaras siempre en mi corazon
Estaras siempre en mi corazon
