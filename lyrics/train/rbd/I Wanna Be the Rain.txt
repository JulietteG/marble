The rain rain rain...
It's not enough to be the one who holds you
It's not enough to be the one your close to
I want to be so much more
The love that your living for
The air you breath
I wanna be everything that touches you everything

[Chorus:]
I wanna be the rain that falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the sun that shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

It's not enough for me to be around you
I wanna be everything that surrounds you
The sun to light up on your skin
Each breath that your breathing in
Or that you need
I wanna be everything that touches you everything

[Chorus:]
I wanna be the rain that falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the sun that shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

And even in your sleep
when your dreaming
I wanna be the only thing you see
won't you be there in everything

[Chorus:]
I wanna be the rain that falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the sun that shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

I wanna be the... rain
Rain..
