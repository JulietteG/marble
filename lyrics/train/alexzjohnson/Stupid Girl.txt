You pretend you're high
You pretend you're bored
You pretend you're anything
just to be adore

And what you need
Is what you get

Don't belive in fear
Don't belive in faith
Don't belive in anything 
that you can't break

You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had you wasted
All you had you wasted

What drives you on
Can drive you mad
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had

Don't belive in love
Don't belive in hate
Don't belive in anything 
that you can't waste

You stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't belive you fake it
Can't belive you fake it

Don't belive in fear
Don't belive in pain
Don't belive in anyone 
that you can't tame

You stupid girl
Oh, you stupid girl
All you had you wasted
All you had you wasted

You stupid girl
Oh, you stupid girl
Can't belive you fake it
Can't belive you fake it

You stupid girl 
You stupid girl
Can't belive you fake it
Can't belive you fake it

You stupid girl
you're just a stupid girl
You stupid girl---Lyrics submitted by Christel.
