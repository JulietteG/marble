I won't deny,i faked it
Dont wanna lie,i'm jadded
I wanna scream when inside i'm breaking down
I left the stone i was under
I'm running home,you won't find her
She walks alone all through this broken town

(Chorus)
Going the wrong way down a one way street
Where the feeling is criminal
Nobody helps me out when i believe
Just a look,look,looking for someone like me
When the feeling is mutual
Can anybody see what i see,Cause i don't see me

I blow away the ashes
I clear space to look at him
He stole my name while i waited lost and found
I'll find a place where i'll keep you
Cause i won't live through you or beneath you
I walk this way where these winds won't bring me down

(Chorus)

Don't...Let me be me...Save it all...Dont waste it on me
Cause if i take a chance and if i hurt again
And if i let you leave,Be my reconing
Ooooo,Hey!

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Ramonita.
