I was born right here,
November '43.
Dad was a Captain in the Army,
fightin' the Germans in Sicily.

My poor little Mama, 
didn't know a soul in LA,
She went down to the Union Station, made her get-away.

Got on a Dixie Flyer,
Bound for New Orleans,
Crossed the State of Texas to the land of dreams.
On a Dixie Flyer, 
Bound for New Orleans,
Back to her friends and her family in the land o' dreams.

And her old mother came down to the station to meet us,
Dressed as black as a crow in a coal mine.
She cried when her little girl got off the train.
Brothers and sisters came down from Jackson, Mississippi,
In a great green Hudson driven by a gentile they knew.
Drinkin' rye whiskey from a flask in the back seat.
Trying to do like the gentiles do. 
Christ they want to be gentiles, too!
Who wouldn't down here, wouldn't you?
An American Christian! God damn!

On a Dixie Flyer,
Bound for New Orleans,
Crossed the State of Texas to the land of dreams.
On a Dixie Flyer, 
Bound for New Orleans,
Back to her friends and her family in the land o' dreams. 
Back to her friends and her family in the land o' dreams.---Lyrics submitted by Sid Lehr.
