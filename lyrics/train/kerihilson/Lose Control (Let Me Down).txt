I know I've been telling you not now
But baby, come and give it to me
'Cause I can tell by the way that you move
That you're the one who could give it to me, yeah

So come on let's move through the crowd
So we can find ourselves some privacy
And when I get you all to myself
I promise it's gonna be hard to breathe

When you watch me shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Put your hands on my body
I love the way you make my body say, I, I, I

Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Shake, wind and roll, shake, wind and roll

Looking like you've seen a beautiful ghost
She must have been a sight to see
As you got your mouth wide open
And you're sweating like a hundred degrees

But it's not a ghost
You're body can't handle you watching me
And one more move
I'mma make you drop to your knees

Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Put your hands on my body
I love the way you make my body say, I, I, I
Shake, wind, and roll, let's lose control

Baby, I'm loving how it feels, looking in your eyes
Ooh, it sends me chills all down my spine
But now the song is done you can have another one
But first you've got to pay to see me

I gotta pay, how much?
Hundred thousand dollar, two hundred thousand, you name it
Beemer, Benz, or Bentley, Bugatti body, you claim it
And all of it depends on the way you shaking your anus
Had to valet park it to red carpet, I'll make you famous

You looking fancy, huh?
Lil' mama have reindeer bambi, huh?
I stay my game, my lazy, huh
I'm sixty nine, right mind, nasty ma, nasty ma

Now you can play with it, play with it and you gon' get it
Now you explain it, you say get it
Let me see you shake it, wind it, control it, bring it around
Take your side bone, we say it now and it's going down

Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control
Put your hands on my body
I love the way you make my body say, I, I, I
Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control

Shake, wind, shake, wind and roll, I, I, I
Shake, wind, shake, wind and roll, I, I, I
Shake, wind, shake, wind and roll, I, I, I
Shake, wind, shake, wind and roll

Maybe you didn't really need my loving
Not the way I needed yours
I was only try to keep it open
How you gonna slam the door?

Led me to believe we were together
You were on a different plan
Just when things were changing for the better
You became a different man

If I was you
I would have never left you in the cold in the first place, oh baby
And If I was you
I'd be really trying to make it you turned down a one way

Oh babe, said you let me down
Said you let me, let me, let me, let me, let me down
Yeah, you let me, let me down
Yeah, you let me, let me, let me, let me, let me down
Said you let me, let me down, let me down

A real man wouldn't have done it like that
