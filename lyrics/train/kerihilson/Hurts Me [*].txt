I'm standin' at the fork in the road, and I 
Don't really know which way to go, it's like 
17 years ago all over again, and I, I 
I'm a little girl lost alone, and yes 
I wanna know what lies ahead, and, yeah, my 
Feet are planted & I don't wanna take a step 

Cause I won't make it any further with you on my back 
Carry your burden, I can't do it this time, goodbye 
But then again, do I listen to my heart, are you crying for help 
I keep second guessing myself, why 
Does it have to be so (Be so) 
Hard to let you go (Whoa-ouh) 

It's almost sun down (Ahh) 
I gotta put my foot down 
And I know if I do 
It's gonna hurt me 
More than it hurts you (Uhh) 
I know how much you need me 
Breaks my heart, believe me (Ahh) 
And I know what I gotta do 
But it's gonna hurt me 

More than it hurts you 
More than it hurts you 
More than it hurts you 
But it's gonna hurt me 
More than it hurts you 
More than it hurts you (I said it's gon hurt you babe) 
More than it hurts you 
But it's gonna hurt me 

Now ordinarily I wouldn't give up, I'm no quitter 
But under the circumstance, 
I think it's better that I wash my hands of ya, love ya (I) 
But I'm thinkin' that I can't live with ya 
Can't live without ya, 
It's something about ya 
That makes me wanna stick around & stay settled down 
Even if it kills me but I can't 

Cause I won't make it any further with you on my back 
Carry your burden, I can't do it this time, goodbye (Do it this time, goodbye) 
But then again, do I listen to my heart, are you crying for help (Ahh, ey) 
I keep second guessing myself, why 
Does it have to be so (Be so) 
Hard to let you go (Whoa-ouh) 

It's almost sun down (Ahh) 
I gotta put my foot down 
And I know if I do 
It's gonna hurt me 
More than it hurts you (Uhh) 
I know how much you need me 
Breaks my heart, believe me (Ahh) 
And I know what I gotta do 
But it's gonna hurt me (It's gonna hurt me) 

More than it hurts you (Hurt you) 
More than it hurts you (Hurt you) 
More than it hurts you (More than it hurts) 
But it's gonna hurt me 
More than it hurts you (Hurts you, yeah) 
More than it hurts you (I said it's gon hurt you babe) 
More than it hurts you (Ouh, why?) 
But it's gonna hurt me (I'm walkin away like) 

Goodbye 
You got me walking away like 
Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by megan.
