Everyday while sitting around,
My feet stuck in the muddy ground,
Who will find my fossilized feet?
Youre absorbed with the need to replete.

I prolong the insane sensation,
To deplete earths complications,
I turned the page and I heard a sound,
Extraterrestrials have been found.

CHORUS
Lost at sea thats made of sand,
Cradled by a corpses hand,
Crimson skies above my head,
I laugh cause youre the ones that dead.

Extraterrestrials on the rise,
Dead bodies piled up to my eyes,
Corpses lying across the land,
Thats where I found your lovely hand.

CHORUS---
