Hey Hey Hey Hey
Damn shawty
Look at you
Im just saying man
Is it just me or you got too much ass in them jeans
Come here

Hey
I been watchin you a while now
And i just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing, forget about them other guys now
I know you aint trying to tell me that you shy now
I realize that youre beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you aint got no business for them anyway
With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline..
I wanna grab from behind to the bass line.
Have a great time, pull yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know youre probably used to deal with them wannabes
But honestly I gotta say, im who they wanna be.
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
Now we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave
I could guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind, we can try them tonight

[Hook]
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like that)
We sippin on patron, somethings on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
Its been killing me all night long, and I wonder(Misses shawty let me tell you what Im thinking bout)
Oh girl I wonder (for real shawty let me tell you what Im thinking bout)
Its the end of the night, and Im thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star

Yes, Id love to hear about your interests
I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed
See youre pantys, do your dress like a silhouette(look at that)
Patrone got me thinking sex, did you feelin that
All due respect though, a simple yes- no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty lets go (lets go)
Pull you to the crib, get you to the dress show
Kiss you from your pretty lips till you red toes
Im thinking its the end of the night
Hey you could leave with your friend if you like
But Im saying no (Im saying no)
Hey we could ride out
Back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once Im in you aint gon want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gon wanna try out
A lil more lets loosen you up
What we cant do in the club we can do in the truck (lets go)

[Hook]
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like that)
We sippin on patron, somethings on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
Its been killing me all night long, and I wonder (Misses shawty let me tell you what Im thinking bout)
Oh girl I wonder.. (for real shawty let me tell you what Im thinking bout)
Its the end of the night, and Im thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star

Hey would you..stay
Could you..play with it, with your tongue just a..little
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if its sentimental shouldnt rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if youd like that (bad girl)
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty yous grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing

[Hook]
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like that)

Its been killing me all night long, and I wonder(misses shawty let me tell you what Im thinking bout)
Oh girl I wonder (for real shawty let me tell you what im thinking bout)
Its the end of the night, and Im thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star

Oh yeah sitting here
We sippin on patron, somethings on my mind
Its been killing me all night long, and I wonder
Oh girl I wonder
Its the end of the night, and Im thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a [porn star (echoes out)]---Lyrics submitted by jalissa.
