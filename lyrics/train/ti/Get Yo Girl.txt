She all in my space
Backing her ass all in my face
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty won't leave
How could she be... When she all on me
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty so ugghh
Looking like trash i ain't saying nothing to her
Come and get your girl
Ey shawty can't stay
We brought real women and she all in they way
Come and get yo girl

I don't want her
Soliciting that pussy like she standing on the corner
Her breath smell like corona and patron and mar-na
She giving me her number i ain't gonna telephone her
Shawty listen come and get your girl
She trippin
Pissy drunk and won't listen
When i tell her get to gettin
Did you hear me cause sittin there still while we chillen
And you illin
Actin silly like you too high on a peal
And i'm feeling if that's yo girl
You should go get her
Me and my partnas arent gonna be bothered with her
Listen nigga come and get your girl

I'm try to be nice but i'm a get to disrespectin
In a second get yo girl
In a hurray she very unattractive
And i'm asking you to grab her
Boy you have to come and get yo girl
What's her problem?
Them chicks with us gonna jump her and i ain't finna stop 'em
I done told you get yo girl

Come and get yo girl
She all in my space
Backing her ass all in my face
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty won't leave
How could she be... When she all on me
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty so ugghh
Looking like trash i ain't saying nothing to her
Come and get your girl
Ey shawty can't stay
We brought real women and she all in they way

Hey shawty really come and get yo chick
She on me like the horses on polo
In here tryin to get a photo
Please come do somthin with yo...
I rather leave solo
Cause she ain't even so-so
What the fuck she got on they ain't air vs on her logo
When she with me she got a green light
She more like a no go
She could'ntride with me in my two seater or in my photo
She aiming at the star tryin to holla at it
What she thinkin bout i got elevated figure
Man they took the car money in the bank
Black a mile smoke her breath so stank
I came in the club swag sharper than the shank
Then she throwin ass at my head bigger than a tank

Come and get yo girl
She all in my space
Backing her ass all in my face
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty won't leave
How could she be... When she all on me
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty so ugghh
Looking like trash i ain't saying nothing to her
Come and get your girl
Ey shawty can't stay
We brought real women and she all in they way
Come and get yo girl---Lyrics submitted by katrina.
