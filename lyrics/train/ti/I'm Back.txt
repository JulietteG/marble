[T.I - Chorus]
I never let you down Ima shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town Im at
And I flash like that
Recognise IM BACK!
Strike a match catch a fire

[Verse 1]
Any moment I decide thats enough of all your lies
Noy your buzz just died
Step inside super fly to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the b-tches like we always do
My desire to retire growing every new coupe
Cause these guys just dont ride like mi n-gga you too
Tight jeans, funny hair, cuz dancing on the screen
Its about the real n-ggas in the game so it seems
Just pretending holla pimpin get a sh-t a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head Im like why
Be yourself, you aint gotta pimp on in your body
I can tell ya aint never bought a key or caught a body
N-gga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, Me and Boosie all go to prison
And they flip their whole image n-gga tripping
Listen, do for you that aint in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but over all its in your heart
Nowadays I dont know wassup with n-ggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating, I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
Im disappointed in you dog you aint hold it down at all
But I aint going in your jaw just gon show ya how to ball
Standin tall thru the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for em

[Chorus]
I never let you down Ima shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float

Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town Im at
And I flash like that
Recognise IM BACK!
Strike a match catch a fire

Catch a fire see T.I add gas
Whats a molotov cocktail to never break a glass
Scary ass n-gga wanna come for me you better bring it
I aint mad I forgive em, God I know they aint mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hey, Im popping and they aint
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they cant
Aint that lame but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
Im no longer being callous so Im gon let you n-ggas have it
Wont be satifsied till somebody dies and Im patient
Waiting on me and the reaper on a first name basis now
Imma let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood, cuz, guess its just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organise a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I aint hearing your voice
Keep it up and Im gon send your ass to (?)
Hey, you can the bottom partner Im gon bring the sky box
I got sh-t locked down n-gga why stop now
Im so above you hover over suckers why drop down
Im so profound its goes down and I never let you down

[Chorus]
I never let you down Ima shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town Im at
And I flash like that
Recognise IM BACK!
Strike a match catch a fire
