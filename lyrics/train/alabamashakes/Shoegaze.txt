Can't wait for night to come
That's when the fun really begins
My band cools off when that day is done
And then I tuck myself in

It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not truly lonely
And I'm beginning to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Let's all make memories
Precious and temporary
Of all the people I meet,
I want to take it all with me

It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not truly lonely
And I'm beginning to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Jesus is waiting on me
Just as he always does
Something will be coming up
Just like it always does

It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not truly lonely
And I'm beginning to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Why can't I?---
