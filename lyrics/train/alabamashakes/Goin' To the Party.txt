The night is good when you feel like a child
And when people tell us we need to straighten out
Im gonna walk right across this town
Yelling your name and Ill wait for you to come on down
Have you had yourself a good time for a while lately now
I just cant understand what youre so worried about

Youre goin to the party by the end of tonight
Theres gonna be dancing and theres gonna be a fight

Guess whos gonna be there for you
When youre too drunk to know what the heck ya doin
Im right here to carry you on home
And it wont be long
Gotta take me home now, I know you aint drinking water
You gotta take me back cause
Im still somebodys daughter, alright

Youre goin to the party by the end of tonight
Theres gonna be dancing and theres gonna be a fight---
