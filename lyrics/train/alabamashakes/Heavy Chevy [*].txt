He asked me not to go so fast 
Slow your roll down baby 
He said he got him a little girl 
She ain't no cruiser like I am 
Well you know she ain't the one 
You got to run boy run 

Now why you wanna do it dirty? 
If it was me, how could ya hurt me? 
Oh baby, please please please 
How could you keep me down here on my knees? 
Well you know she ain't the one 
You got to run boy run 

Ooh, ooh daddy ooh 
You know my heart's not outta room 
You wanna love that little girl 
By all means, honey do 
Well you know she ain't the one 

He said now lemme take ya out 
Buy you new appliances 
I wanna take ya out 
Better home 
I wanna take ya out 
I wanna meet ya kids 
I wanna take you home baby 
Tell me where it is 
I come back when I want and 
Don't ask no questions 
Me and you forever baby 
We could be together baby 
I love ya babe! 
And no I really do 
I wanna take ya out 
And take ya kids too 
I wonder if you'll let me 
We're stuck in the heavy Chevy 
I wonder if you'll let me 
Baby Baby do ya get me 
I wonder if you'll ever 
Eh-eh-eh-ever be jealous 
I wanna be with you together baby 
You and me throughout eternity---
