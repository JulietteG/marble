Never had a doubt, in the beginning, never a doubt.
Trusted you, true, in the beginning, I loved you right thru.
On and on we laughed like kids at all the silly things we did.

You made me, promises promises, knowing I'd believe.
Promises promises, I knew you'd never keep.

Second time around, I'm done retrieving and losing my ground.
This time around, there's no belief in what you wanted, you found.
You were saying you and me, are not your style, your cup of tea.

You made me promises promises, I knew you'd never keep.
Promises promises, why do I believe?

On and one, we laughed like kids at all the silly things we did.
Now you're saying you and me, are not your style, your cup of tea.

You made me, promises promises, you knew you'd never keep.
Promises promises, why do I believe?
All of your promises, you knew you'd never keep.
Promises promises, why do I believe?
Promises, promises, promises, promises, promises, promises, promises---Lyrics submitted by C Baron.
