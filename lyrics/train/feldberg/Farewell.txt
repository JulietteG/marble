Summer gone and we've had our fun
It's been a long ride 
Seems like we just begun
Winter is near 
Right at the end of the year
With promises made 
We will go our ways

If you say run, I will run
But I'll never run too far
If you say hide, I will hide
But I don't wanna say goodbye
If you say hide, I will hide
But I'll never hide for long
Follow your strife
Take my take
'cause I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye

Open your eyes 
And see the leaves start to fall
You'll realize this is your last call
The grass must be greener
On the other side
But spring won't be near
You've got to wait for the tide

If you say run, I will run
But I'll never run too far
If you say hide, I will hide
But I don't wanna say goodbye
If you say hide, I will hide
But I'll never hide for long 
Follow your strife
Take my time
'cause I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Joona Koukku.
