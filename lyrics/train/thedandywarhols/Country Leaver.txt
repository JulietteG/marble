Well, I'm going to see you soon in Amsterdam
I can't believe I can get there, but I can, man.
I hope when I see you, that you'll still like who I am, I am.
But if you don't, baby, I'll still tell you that I understand.
I'll tell you I, I, I understand.
I'll tell you I...

I'm going to see you in a foreign land
I've packed my bags, oh lord, I'm a traveling man, man.
I hope when I see you, you'll still like who I am, I am.
But if you don't baby, I'll still tell you I understand.
I'll tell you I, I, I understand.
I'll tell you I, I, I understand.
I'll tell you I....

If you don't baby, I'll still tell you I understand.
I'll tell you I, I, I understand.
I'll tell you I, I, I understand.
I'll tell you I...---Lyrics submitted by Marko.
