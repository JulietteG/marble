Wherever you are, you know that I adore you
No matter how far, well I can go before you
If ever you need someone, what not that you need help in
But if ever you want someone, you know that I am willing

I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across an angel, out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye

Wherever you go, I can always follow
I can feed this real slow, if it's a lot to swallow
If you just wanna be alone, I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go, I am more than willing
'Cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across some angel, out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye

I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across some angel, out among the danger somewhere
In the stranger's eye

I-I've never been with anyone in the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun, then it's doomed
'Cause water races, water races down
The waterfalls, water races, water races down
The waterfalls!

I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across some angel where there is no danger
Where love has eyes, it is not blind---
