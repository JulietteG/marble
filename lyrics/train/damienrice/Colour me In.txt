I tried to repress it
Then I carried its crown
I reached out to undress it
And love let me down
Love let me down

So I tried to erase it
But the ink bled right through
Almost drove myself crazy
When these words led to you

And all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone

So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then colour me in

Well I tried to control it
And cover it up
I reached out to console it
It was never enough
Never enough

So I tried to forget it
That was all part of the show
Told myself I'd regret it
But what do I know

About all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone

So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then colour me in

Come let me love you
Come let me take this through the end
Of all these useless dreams of living
In all these useless dreams
All these useless dreams of living
In all these old noes

Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
