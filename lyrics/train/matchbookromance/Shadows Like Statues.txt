lights out and my seat back as far as it will go 
casting shadows like statues 
i'm right outside your window
there's no such thing as second chances 
there's no such thing don't bother to explain 

you're so beautiful did you hear a word i said 
you're so beautiful i guess this is what i get 

[Chorus]
we trust and believe so easily in words they speak
we seek security in one another but there's no way to cover this 
and these tragic nights and afternoons wreak disaster 
and i can still feel you as if you were in the room
where does our story end where does it start 
i buried you along with my heart 

entertain me and tell me "it didn't mean anything"
it's vengous worth my tolerance and i could be careless
but i promise you'll feel everything 

you're so beautiful did you hear a word i said (don't bother to explain)
you're so beautiful i guess this is what i get (don't bother to explain)

[Chorus]

i guess this is what i get
(i know i know i know i know i know i know i know)
[x2]

[Chorus]

did you hear a word i said [x2] [background screaming]---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
