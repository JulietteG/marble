More than just a dream [2x]

[Verse 1]
Forty days and forty nights
I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
Recall the days I waited for you
You know the ones who said, "I'd never find someone like you."

[Chorus]
You were out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

[Verse 2]
From time to time I pinch myself
Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else
And every time she takes my hand
All the wonders that remain become a simple fact

[Chorus (2x)]
You were out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream
