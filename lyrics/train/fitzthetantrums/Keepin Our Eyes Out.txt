We walk the streets, we are stars
We look for signs to point the way, oh
Cause we're not invisible, no
Not gonna let them get away with this, oh

Yeah we're keepin' our eyes out, keepin our eyes out
Yeah we're keepin' our eyes out, keepin our eyes out

Passin' out the airwaves
Callin' out the last toll
Screamin' past the atmosphere
We won't be long!
Shakin' up the games played
Callin' out to everyone
Reachin' out, reachin' out, oh

We crossed the lines, we are one
We hold the bricks and built the way, oh
Cause we're not invisible, no
Not gonna let them get away with this, oh

Yeah we're keepin' our eyes out, keepin our eyes out
Yeah we're keepin' our eyes out, keepin our eyes out

Passin' out the airwaves
Callin' out the last toll
Screamin' past the atmosphere
We won't be long!
Shakin' up the games played
Callin' out to everyone
Reachin' out, reachin' out, oh

Hear all the voices, reach out
Stand up, all the ones they forgot
Break through the silence, reach out
We won't be the fallen, stand up!
Hear all the voices, reach out
Stand up, all the ones they forgot
Break through the silence, reach out
We won't stay silent 'til they break, break, break, break

Passin' out the airwaves
Callin' out the last toll
Screamin' past the atmosphere
We won't be long!
Shakin' up the games played
Callin' out to everyone
Reachin' out, reachin' out, oh---
