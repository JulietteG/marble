My cars in for a brake job
Be ready in a while
Something about the waitress
Made me think about your smile
I tip her a ten spot
And I try to read her name
Im just an old long hauler
A grinder at the game

Heaven knows the highways
Since weve been apart
But my heart dont feel like leaving
Or you wont leave my heart
Now and then I might take
A little something for pain
But theres nothing much for heartache
And my heart has never changed
My heart has never changed

Now theres no more rough and tumble
Down Highway 199
Nothing lasts forever
I just miss it sometimes

She comes to pour more coffee
But its time to see more world
I pick up my check and keys
And go and pay the girl
My minds in Hells Half Acre
And the rooms along Exchange
And the scenes are always shifting
But my heart has never changed
My heart has never changed---
