Come my love Ill tell you a tale
Of a boy and girl and their love story

And how he loved her oh so much
And all the charms she did possess

Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex
How he worshipped the ground she walked
And when he looked in her eyes he became obsessed

My love is like a storybook story
But its as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But its as real as the feelings I feel
Its as real as the feelings I feel

This love was stronger than the powers so dark
A prince could have within his keeping

His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast but only sleeping

My love is like a storybook story
But its as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But its as real as the feelings I feel
Its as real as the feelings I feel

Now he said, dont you know I love you oh so much
And lay my heart at the foot of your dress? 
She said, dont you know that these storybook loves
Always have a happy ending? 

Then he swooped her up just like in the books
And on his stallion they rode away

My love is like a storybook story
But its as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But its as real as the feelings I feel---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
