On the road again in cabaret
Grey hair and Fenders
Old ghosts revisited today
No original members

Pick out a pretty one and toss your hair
Seems foolish when youre older
You always felt you never had your share
A chip on both your shoulders

Youve been faking it so long
Now you dont know right from wrong
Or what the future has in store for you
In the terminal of tribute to

Every day you take the bitter pill
The minibus driver says and you are who
You never made it and you never will
In the terminal of tribute to

Where your plans are forever falling through
And your dreams are movies never shot
And youre someone, a shadow passing through
Nobody ever knew, so nobody forgot

Your bag has fallen from the carousel
They say one day it could come back to you
Exactly when nobody can tell
In the terminal of tribute to

Youve been faking it so long
Now you dont know right from wrong
Or what the future has in store for you
In the terminal of tribute to

Youve been faking it so long
Now you dont know right from wrong
Or what the future has in store for you
In the terminal of tribute to---
