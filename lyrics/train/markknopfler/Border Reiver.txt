Southern bound from Glasgow town
She's shining in the sun
My Scotstoun lassie on a border run
We're whistling down the hillsides and tearing up the climbs
I'm just a thiever stealing time in the Border Reiver

Three hundred thousand on the clock and plenty more to go
Crash box and lever - she needs the heel and toe
She's not too cold in winter but she cooks me in the heat
I'm a six-foot driver but you can't adjust the seat in the Border Reiver

'Sure as the Sunrise'
That's what they say about the Albion
'Sure as the Sunrise', that's what they say about the Albion
And she's an Albion
She's an Albion

The Ministry don't worry me my paperwork's alright
They can't touch me
I got my sleep last night
It's knocking out a living wage in 1969
I'm just a thiever stealing time in the Border Reiver

'Sure as the Sunrise'
That's what they say about the Albion
'Sure as the Sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
And she's an Albion
She's an Albion---Lyrics submitted by Cyril.
