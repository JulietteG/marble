No Love. No Peace. 
Spend your days, counting sheep.
When you're dead you're done, you're dead you die. 
But life goes on.
No love, no lies.  
Wasting your days. Waiting to die. 
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality. 
Today is the day you see the consequence. 
May you never wake up again. 

I will long even if theyre all Dead
I will bring the dead to life. 
When they put a price on your head. Say goodbye to your wonderful life.
I have seen the lying face of god. I have seen the edge of the earth. 
We have already lived to fucking long.
may we regret our birth. 
I was born a monster. I will die the same.
No one can live forever. I will become a household name.

No love, no lies. 
Wasting your days. Waiting to die. 
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality. 
Today is the day you see the consequence. 
May you never wake up again. 

We will choke the ones we love.
Your admiration means nothing to us.
When push comes to fucking shove.
We never do whats expected of us. 
We all wanna be a part of something. But I see you want none of this.
We live our lives, afraid to die, But these dreams are selfish.

I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.

No love, no lies. 
Wasting your days. Waiting to die. 
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality. 
Today is the day you see the consequence. 
May you never wake up again.---Lyrics submitted by Alec.
