You say the sweetest things and I
Can't keep my heart from singing 
along to the sound of your song
My stupid feet keep moving 
to this 4/4 beat, I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 4/4 beat I would die for you (die for you)

(Someone stop this)
I've gone to far to come back from here, 
but you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song, 
so I won't sing along
Someone stop this song, 
so I won't sing..

I never let love in 
so I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea, the more I sink into this 4/4 beat
I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 4/4 beat I would die for you (stop this song)

I've gone to far to come back from here, 
but you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me
I've come to far to get over you, 
and you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Can't someone stop this song, 
so I won't sing along
Someone stop this song, 
so I won't sing

Your lovesick melody 
is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me if I don't sing

It creeps in like a spider
Can't be killed, although I try and try to
Well, don't you see I'm falling?
Don't wanna love you, but I do

(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song, so I won't sing along?
(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song, so I won't sing?
Your lovesick melody 
is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me, no
You won't get to me 'cause I won't sing---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
