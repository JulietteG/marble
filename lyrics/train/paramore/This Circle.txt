Take this time to realize
That you always shut your eyes
In the midst of trial
And everything is always right
(and I think that it's time)
this battle must be won
(but you pushed it aside)
Pushed it aside
Pretend that it's gone

This circle never ends
And it's time you 
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you 
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over

Take this time to realize
That you always force a smile
In the midst of trial
And everything is always right
(and I think that it's time)
This battle must be won
(but you pushed it aside)
Pushed it aside
Pretend that it's gone

This circle never ends
And it's time you 
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you 
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over

And it never ends...
It never ends...
And it never ends...
(and it never ends)
No, it never ends

this circle never ends
and it's time you 
just face it, don't pretend
that it's over
this circle never ends
and it's time you 
just face it, don't pretend
that It's over
It's over---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
