Well she lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell 
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure, the lens I told her
The angles were all wrong now
Now she's rippin wings off butterflies

keep your feet on the ground
when your heads in the clouds

Well go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle 
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle 
Bury the castle
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da

So one day he found her crying coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest she can figure out
But it was a trick and the clock struck twelve
Well make sure to build your house Brick By Boring Brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

keep your feet on the ground
when your heads in the clouds

Well go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle 
Bury the castle

Well you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah you built up a world of magic

Well if it's not real you can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah!

Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba ba da ba ba

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba ba da ba ba---Lyrics submitted by Adrianna.
