I don't mean to run,
But everytime you come around I feel,
More alive, than ever
And I guess it's too much,
Maybe we're too young,
And I don't even know what's real,
But I know I've never wanted anything so bad,
I've never wanted anyone so bad,

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored,
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way? (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for?

Help me come back down,
From high above the clouds,
You know I'm suffocating,
But I blame this town,
Why do I deny,
The things that burn inside,
Down deep I'm barely breathing,
But you just see a smile,
And I don't wanna let this go,
Really, I just want to know

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored,
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way? (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for?

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored,
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored,
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way? (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for?---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
