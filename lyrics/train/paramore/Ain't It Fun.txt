I don't mind letting you down easy
But just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while

You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't in good being all alone

Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well you can ring anybody's bell to get what you want

Ain't it easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't in good being all alone

Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one

Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't in good, ain't it good being all alone

Ain't it fun living in the real world
(Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't in good, ain't it good being all alone (oh)

Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
(Down to your mama)
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
(Don't go crying to your mama)
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
(Oh, this is the real world)
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
(Don't go crying to your mama)
This is the real world
This is the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama cause you're on your own in the real world ---
