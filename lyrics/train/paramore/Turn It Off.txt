I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
And just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

I wanna know what itd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light but turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite Ill turn it off

And the worst part is before it gets any better were headed for a cliff
And in the freefall I will realize I'm better off when I hit the bottom

Tragedy it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
Were taking short cuts and false illusions just to cut out the hero

Well I can see behind the curtain
The wheels are creaking, turning
It's all wrong the way were working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent, 
Its nonexistent but we just keep believing

And the worst part is before it gets any better were headed for a cliff
And in the freefall I will realize I'm better off when I hit the bottom

I wanna know what itd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light but turn it off in all my spite, 
In all my spite Ill turn it off
Just turn it off again
Again, again, again.

And the worst part is before it gets any better were headed for a cliff
And in the freefall I will realize I'm better off when I hit the bottom
And the worst part is before it gets any better were headed for a cliff
And in the freefall I will realize I'm better off when I hit the bottom---Lyrics submitted by Tam.
