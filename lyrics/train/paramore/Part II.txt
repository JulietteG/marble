What a shame, what a shame
We all remain such fragile, broken things
A beauty half portrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places
Deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light
Now there's a tiny spark

Oh glory
Come and find me
Oh glory
Come and find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own
In a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Loving all the simple things
Running to forgive
Even when it wasn't our mistake
I question every human
Who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed
Patterns in my mind

Oh glory
You will find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own
In a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

Like the moon
We borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night

So if you left me
I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine---
