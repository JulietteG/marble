You say the sweetest things
And I cant keep my heart from singing
Along to the sound of your song
My stupid feet keep moving

To this 4-4 beat Im in time with you, ohh
To this 4-4 beat I would die for you (die for you)
(Someone stop this)

Ive gone too far to come back from here
But you dont have a clue
You dont know what you do, do to me

Wont someone stop this song
So I wont sing along
Someone stop this song
So I wont sing

I never let love in
So I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea
The more I sink in

To this 4-4 beat Im in time with you, ohh
To this 4-4 beat I would die for you
(Lets stop this song)

Ive gone too far to come back from here (ohh)
But you dont have a clue
You dont know what you do, do to me (ooh)
And Ive come too far to get over you (ohh)
And you dont have a clue (ohh)
You dont know what you do, do to me

Wont someone stop this song
So I wont sing along
Someone stop this song
So I wont sing a lovesick melody
Its gonna get the best of me tonight
But you wont get to me
If I dont sing

It creeps in, like a spider
Cant be killed, although I try and try to
But dont you see Im falling
Dont wanna love you
I do

(Lovesick melody)
Someone stop this song
So I wont sing along
(Lovesick melody, ohh)
Someone stop this song
So I wont sing a lovesick melody
Its gonna get the best of me tonight
But you wont get to me (no, you wont get to me)
Cause I wont sing---Lyrics submitted by Daryl.
