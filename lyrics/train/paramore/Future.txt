I'm writing the future 
I'm writing it out, loud. 
We don't talk about the past 
We don't talk about the past, now 

So I'm writing the future 
I'm leaving a key here 
Something won't always be missing 
It won't always feel empty, here 

Just think of the future 
And think of your dreams 
You'll get away from here 
You'll get away eventually 

So just think of your future 
Think of a new life 
Don't get lost in the memories 
Keep your eyes on a new prize---
