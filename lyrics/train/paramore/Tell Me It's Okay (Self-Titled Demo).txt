Maybe its been years
Since I genuinely smiled
And maybe its been years
Since I wanted to be a part of anything

Well, lately Ive been good
You know, Ive actually been great
Man, I even laughed a little today
Oh, so strange, so strange

Tell me its okay to be happy now
Because Im happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now
Because Im happy now

Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)

I thought it was my right
To be as sorry as I wanted to be
I wasted all my teenage years
Being a misery factory

But something had to give
I had to finally see light
I think at 23
Its time to practice what I preach

And what I preach is

Tell me its okay to be happy now
Because Im happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now
Because Im happy now

Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)

All my wasted hope
I let go when I shouldve held tighter
And now when the sun is out
I let it burn, not afraid to feel it shine on me

Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)

Tell me its okay to be happy now
Because Im happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out, so

Tell me its okay to be happy now
Because Im happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out, so

Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)
Tell me its okay, tell me its okay (ay)---
