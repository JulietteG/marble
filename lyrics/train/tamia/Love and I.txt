Love has not been 
That great of a friend to me, lately. 
Over and over, again and again 
Love has proved that she is tired of me, my enemy. 

Repeating thoughts 
of the pain that its caused. 
And the tears that I've cried is probably why... 

Love and I are breaking up tonight. 
Love will go its way then im sure to find my... 
Love, goodbye, but can you leave a trail behind 
Because I know myself and I will change my mind 
And want to love again 
And want to love again

I really wish we were made to be 
happy with our love in our life. 
To know that I have total control 
Over being happy, happy of reality 

I cannot live without love 
But I will try tonight 

Ohhh, love and I are breaking up tonight. 
Love will go its way and I'm sure to find my... 
Love, goodbye, but can you leave a trail behind 
Because i kno myself and I will change my mind 
And want to love again 

Ohhh, love and I are breaking up, we're breaking up. 

Love and I are breaking up tonight. 
Love will go its way and I'm sure to find my... 
Love, goodbye, but can you leave your trail behind 
Because I know I'll change my mind 
And want to love again
And want to love again---Lyrics submitted by Tanisha.
