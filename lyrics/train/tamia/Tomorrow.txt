Jesus said here I stand
Won't you please let me in
And you said I will
But tomorrow

Jesus said I am he
Who supplies all your needs
And you said I know
But tomorrow

Tomorrow, 
I'll give my life 
Tommorow,
I thought about today
But, it's so much easier to say
Tomorrow,
Who promised you,
Tomorrow,
Better choose the lord today
For tomorrow very well might be today

Jesus said here I stand
Won't you please take my hand 
And you said I will
But tomorrow

Jesus said I am he
Who supplies all your needs
And you said I know
But tomorrow

OOOOOOOOOOO
Tomorrow, 
I'll give my life 
Tommorow,
I thought about today
OOOOOOOOOOO
But, it's so much easier to say
Tomorrow,
Who promised you,
Tomorrow,
Better choose the lord today
For tomorrow very well might be today

And you said, your tomorrow would ever come for you...
Still you laughed and played and continued on to say...

Tomorrow.... forget about....
Tomorrow
Won't you give your life today
OOOOOOOOOOOO
PLEASE
Don't just turn and walk away
Tomorrow, tomorrow is not promised
Don't let this moment slip away 
WHOOOOOO
Your tomorrow could, could very well be here TODAY---Lyrics submitted by jamese.
