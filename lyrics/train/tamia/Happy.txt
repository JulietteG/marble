hmmm hmm yeah yeah yeah uhh uhh uhh
what happened to the roses
and the little phone calls we made throghout the day
and silly little games we played
some how things have changed 
how i miss the old
got my feelings thrown 
we barely holding on 

CHORUS
why cant we you and me be happy
(why cant we just be so happy)
why cant we just chill and be happy
(why cant we just be so happy)

the arguing seems to win 
over loving
used to be hugging
kissing and rubbing 
now every day is something new
sepearting me and you
i thought that we could get through any thing

CHORUS
why cant we you and me be happy
(why cant we just be so happy)
why cant we just chill and be happy
(why cant we just be so happy)

baby
lets start over again
lets get back to being friends 
and lets try harder this time 
ooo baby tell me 
(YYYYYYYYY)

CHORUS (2x)
why cant we you and me be happy
(why cant we just be so happy)
why cant we just chill and be happy
(why cant we just be so happy)---Lyrics submitted by Chania.
