In a prehistoric dried up lake,
a million years after the last earthquake,
there lived a little girl who loved to bake.
The only thing she made was cake,
and all she used was salt.
That's all she had, it's not her fault.
Saline the Salt Lake Queen

She used a rudimental substance for
an ingredient that she could pour
into a chalice she carved out of stone.
her only friend, it was a big black crow
who flew with love,
he would fly high above,
look back at her below.

Oh Saline, only seventeen
swollen up with pride.
Oh Saline, under desert's skies
She's a bromide.
She makes green fire
In a tunnel of thorns
and she's got yellow eyes. 

She'd cook alone amid a brutal ruin.
It's hard to tell exactly what she's doin'.
An incantation and a crow flew in
Oooooh Oooooh
And then she took a taste
The black crow looked into her face
Saline the Salt Lake Queen

Oooooh, oooooh
Oh Saline, the desert queen

Oh Saline, only seventeen
swollen up with pride.
Oh Saline, under desert's skies
She's a bromide.
She makes green fire
in a tunnel of thorns
and she's got yellow eyes.---Lyrics submitted by Marleen.
