I'm made of hair and bone and little teeth
I think I cannot speak
I come on like a crippled plaything
My spine is just a string

I wrapped our love in all this foil
Silver tight like spider legs
I never wanted it to ever spoil
But flies will lay their eggs

Take your hatred out on me
Make your victim my neck
You never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet

Prosthetic synthesis with butterflies
Sealed up with virgin stitch
If it hurts baby please don't cry
Preserve my innocence
I never wanted it to end this way
But flies will lay their eggs

Take your hatred out on me
Make me your victim tonight
You never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet

What I wanted, what I needed
I tried to get for me
Nothing wanted, nothing needed
No one comes for free

Take your hatred out on me
Make your victim my neck
You never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet

You never ever believed in me
You never ever believed
You never ever believed in me
You never ever believed---Lyrics submitted by Jill.
