You had plenty money,1922
But you let other women make a fool of you.
Why don't you do right, like some other men do?
Why don't you get out of here and bring me some money, too?

You're sitting there wondering what it's all about.
If you ain't got no money they gonna put you out.
Why don't you do right, like some other men do?
Why don't you get out of here and bring me some money, too?

I fell for your jive and I took you in.
Now all you got to offer me's a fifth of gin.
Why don't you do right, like them other men do?
Why don't you get out of here and bring me some money, too?---Lyrics submitted by Celeste.
