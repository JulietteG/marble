[Spoken] 
Hi, doll! How you doing today? You look pretty...

[Sung]
This little piggy went to market
This little piggy stayed home
This little piggy had roast beef
And this little piggy had none
This piggy cried wee wee wee
All the way home home home
This piggy cried wee wee wee
All the way home home home
All the way home

Where oh where was the market
What'd the piggies call home
Who made the roast beef for the piggies
And how come they're crying all alone
This piggy cried wee wee wee
All the way home home home
This piggy cried wee wee wee
All the way home
All the way home home home
All the way home home home
All the way home home home

Barber, barber shave a pig
How many hairs does it take to make a wig?
Four and twenty should be enough
Give the barber a pinch of snuff

This little piggy went to market
This little piggy stayed home
This little piggy had roast beef
And this little piggy had none
This little piggy cried and cried and cried
Wee wee wee all the way home
This little piggy went to market
This little piggy stayed home
This little piggy had roast beef
And this little piggy had none
This little piggy cried and cried and cried
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee all the way home

Wee wee wee all the way home

Wee wee wee all the way home---Lyrics submitted by Jill.
