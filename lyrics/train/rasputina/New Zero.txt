He has agreed 
To take me 
To the Ice Hotel from the magazine 

What we will need 
Is a gleaming key 
Made of ice as well 
By the finest ice machine. 

It's there that no one will stare 
At your jaws and your long fur 
The claws in your fingers. 

It's in the past when the passerby laughed 
At your strange way of speaking 
Your batteries leaking 
Oh no 

Oh God no 
They don't know 
The New Zero. 

Uniforms worn 
So leisurely. 
The reindeer skins 
The privacy 

How was he born? 
He's asking me 
Flapping his fins 
Very impressively. 

It's there that no one will stare 
At your jaws and your long fur 
The claws in your fingers. 

It's in the past when the passerby laughed 
At your strange way of speaking 
Your batteries leaking 
Oh no 

Oh God no 
They don't know 
The New Zero. He has agreed 
To take me 
To the Ice Hotel. 

I really don't care and neither does he 
If this hotel melts into the sea 
Polished and so rare, this is the way that we see. 
The coldness helps, it's our favorite remedy. 

It's there that no one will stare 
At your jaws and your long fur 
The claws in your fingers. 

It's in the past when the passerby laughed 
At your strange way of speaking 
Your batteries leaking, oh no! 

Oh God no 
They don't know 
The New Zero. He has agreed 
To take me 
To the Ice Hotel---
