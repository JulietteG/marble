Some days when I was young, and I was dressed up as I do
Not looking like the rest, but what I felt as cool
They said I was the one who was playing a fool
for attention I'd stand out the way that I do

They use to pick and tease, not take me seriously
But see I did not care, cos we were only kids
So back then they did laugh and make fun out of me
But developing my style, looking right as I did.

They say that I don't eat
And that I don't get no sleep
They say that I ain't cool and that I look like a freak
I said I ain't you and you are not me
We are who we are, let us be

Years on reunion and I meet them same old kids
Don't recognise their friends but do remember me
So back then they did laugh and make fun out of me
But developing my style looking right as I did.

They say that I don't eat
And that I don't get no sleep
They say that I ain't cool and that I look like a freak
I said I ain't you and you are not me

They say that I don't know and say my mind is too weak
They say my body's slow and say I ain't got no beat
I said I ain't you and you are not me
We are who we are, let us be

So my story to you is stand up and be proud
If you're quiet then that's cool
If your not shout it loud

They say that I don't eat
And that I don't get no sleep
They say that I ain't cool and that I look like a freak
(It's all about foolish kids)
I said I ain't you and you are not me

They say that I don't know and say my mind is too weak
They say my body's slow and say I ain't got no beat
I said I ain't you and you are not me
We are who we are, let us be

They say that I don't know and say my mind is too weak
They say my body's slow and say I ain't got no beat
I said I ain't you and you are not me
We are who we are let us be
