Cant explain it 
Even though its true
I still think of almost every day
You know we tried it
I guess were through
What am I to do with these yesterdays?
Though that we would both see tomorrow
In each others hearts
Why did the loving ever have to start?
Dont want to believe its ended
Now that the love is over
Now that night is through
Why am I still loving you?
Now the love is over
What will I do to get over you?
Eyes are streaming
Could not see 
You need some time to be on your own
See the distance
The time that sets us free
But I dont want to be here all alone
Thought that we would find all the answers
We were destined to be
Dont you know you want to love me?
That we belong together
Now that the love is over
Now that night is through
Why am I still loving you?
Now the love is over
What will become of you and I?
You said the same
But now that the song is over
Now that the dance is through
There will be no more singing
Now the night is over
What will I do to get over you?
Now that the love
Now that the love is over
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone
Now that the love
Now that the love is over
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone
I thought that we would find all the answers
We were destined to be
Dont you know you want to love me?
So why do I keep on trying?
Now that the love
Now that the love is over
Now that the love
There will be no more singing
Now that the love
Now that the love is over
Now that the love is gone
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone
There will be no more singing
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone
Now that the love
There will be no more singing
Now that the love is gone
Now that the love
Now that the love is gone---Lyrics submitted by Ben J. Cote.
