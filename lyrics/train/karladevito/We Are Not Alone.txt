Things look clear in black and white 
 The living color tends to dye our sight 
 Like dynomite 
 Just imagine my surprise 
 When I looked into your eyes and saw 
 Your disguise 

 If we dare expose our hearts 
 Just to feel the purest parts 
 That's when strange sensations start to grow 

 We are not alone 
 Find out when your cover's blown 
 There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
 We are not alone 
 'Cause when you cut down to the bone 
 We're really not so different after all 
 After all 
 We're not alone 

 Flying high above the sky 
 The battles down below look simplified 
 With no place to hide 
 But on inspection of the dust 
 I came upon this thing called trust 
 It helps us to adjust 

 Just imagine my surprise 
 When I looked into your eyes 
 I knew right then I'd never let you go 

 We are not alone 
 Find out when your cover's blown 
 There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
 We are not alone 
 'Cause when you cut down to the bone 
 We're really not so different after all 
 After all 
 We're not alone 
 Not alone 
 After all 
 Not alone 

 If we dare expose our hearts 
 Just to feel the purest parts 
 That's when strange sensations start to grow 

 We are not alone 
 Find out when your cover's blown 
 There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
 We are not alone 
 'Cause when you cut down to the bone 
 We're really not so different after all 
 After all 
 We're not alone 

 We are not alone 
 Find out when your cover's blown 
 There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
 We are not alone 
 'Cause when you cut down to the bone 
 We're really not so different after all 
 After all 
 After all---Lyrics submitted by Carla Pion.
