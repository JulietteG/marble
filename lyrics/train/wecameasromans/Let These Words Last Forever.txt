Let this love
Carry on, carry on
When we turn to dust
Let these words last forever
Make this life
About something bigger than all of us
All of us
Let this love
Let this love carry on

I will not
Hold the shame of my mistakes like a newborn child
Pressed against my chest
They will not hold me down
Tighter than the straps
Waiting for a needle to put my head to rest
I am who I am because of the things I've done
The things I've done
I'm not proud of them all, but I'm ashamed of none

I've lived for love in hopes that it never dies
I've lived for love in hopes that it never dies
I've lived for love, love

I'd rather have my words remembered and not my name
I'd rather have this message remembered and not my face
Let this love carry on

Let this love
Carry on, carry on
When we turn to dust
Let these words last forever
Make this life
About something bigger than all of us
All of us
Let this love
Let this love carry on

We are who we are because of the choices we make
We are who we are because of the choices we make
Would you destroy this life, to live out, remember your name
Would you destroy this life, to live out, remember your name
I will have this love carry on until the end of my days
I will have this message remembered before my face

Let this love
Carry on, carry on
Let this love
Carry on, carry on
Let this love
Carry on, carry on
When we turn to dust
Let these words last forever
Make this life
About something bigger than all of us
All of us
Let this love
Let this words last forever

Let this love
Carry on
Let this words
Last forever
Let this love
Carry on
Let this words last forever!!! ---
