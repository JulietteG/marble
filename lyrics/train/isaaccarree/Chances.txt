Why do I do things that won't bring me closer to You
 No reason or excuse for most of them so I do them
 Responsible for my part in pushing You away
 And when I deserve to be left alone, You stayed

Couldn't help but notice something
 That just keeps happening
 Doesn't make much sense to me
 But He does it again and again

Lord, I promise this is really the last time
 (We've all said these words)
 Sorry for not praying, it must have slipped my mind
 (I never wanted You to hurt)

If You get me out of this one
 I'll never do it again
 When will I learn my lesson?
 What would life be if I ran out of chances?

My closet so full of things I don't want You to see
 If You knew all about me You'd question my belief
 I know I haven't paid for each of the mistakes I make
 So, thank you for keeping secrets, Lord
 Let me just say

Couldn't help but notice something
 That just keeps happening
 It doesn't make much sense to me
 But He does it again and again

Lord, I promise this is really the last time
 (We've all said these words)
 Sorry for not praying, it must have slipped my mind
 (I never wanted You to hurt)

If You get me out of this one
 I'll never do it again
 When will I learn my lesson?
 What would life be if I ran out of chances?

Uncover, expose me
 That's the only way that I'll be free
 Make me uncomfortable
 Even if there's something I don't wanna see

I don't wanna live outside Your will, oh no
 I've said it a thousand times
 And I really wanna get it right

Lord, I promise this is really the last time
 (We've all said these words)
 Sorry for not praying, it must have slipped my mind
 (I never wanted You to hurt)

If You get me out of this one
 I'll never do it again
 When will I learn my lesson?
 Where will life be if I ran out of chances?---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
