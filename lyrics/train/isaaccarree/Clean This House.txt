Oh yeah, Lord I thank you 
for forgiving me over and over again yeah 

I'm calling on you heavenly Father, 
I'm down on my knees, 
you said call on you no matter the hour
Lord I'm in need. 
I've been messing up, done lost my house, 
done lost my job, wife walking out?
these church folk say they my friends
but I'm all they talking about
I've been doing wrong, I'm so sorry 
Lord please forgive me

We confess to him he'll remove all wickedness
the blood from Your son will wash me from my sins 

Chorus:
Clean this house, from the inside out 
restore me, take away my impurity
Lord I need you to 
clean this house, from the inside out 
restore me, take away my impurity

I said if you got me out that last situation, 
I wouldn't do it again, 
what can I say but I'm only human and Lord here I stand 
I've been smoking a lot, and drinking a lot, 
and all up in the club, 
I've been doing this, I've been doing that 
and I had no business doing it, 
no church or no Bible study ain't been in my word 
now i know better than this, 
cant live my life in sin

We confess to him he'll remove all wickedness
the blood from Your son will wash me from my sins 

Chorus:
Clean this house, from the inside out

Listen
Now if it wasn't for your grace and mercy 
I don't know where I would be 
'cause you brought me out, brought me out 
without a doubt, without a doubt,
you're more than a friend, more than a friend 
you're a confident, thank you Lord for cleansing me 
I will always serve thee.

[Chorus:]

(Break it down, break it down, break it down) 

Now everybody need a little cleaning sometimes 
and yeah, I can introduce you to the best cleaner alive 
mh, every now and then we all go through a little strife
but if you let him he will change your life,
now I can hear you saying, 
that life's been rough, you've been going through a 
whole lot of stuff, 
God specializes in the impossible 
just trust and believe 
his grace is more than enough 

(Choir included):
Clean house
In out ( 3 times )
Restore me
