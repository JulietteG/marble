On the Streets of the Bronx is where I wanna be...
Standing on the corner singing good old harmony...
Waiting for the man to come along and discover me...

My father preaches "son please get a job"...
"But I dont wanna work I wanna be a singing star"...
Drive up and down the Bronx in my brand new shiny car......

On the., on the...Streets.....is where I wanna be......thats's where I wanna be, singing good old harmony...

On the, on the...Streets.....is where I wanna be..."Thats where I wanna be, go 'way don't bother me"...

On the Streets of the Bronx is where I wanna be...
On the corner of Belmont and 187 street...
Waiting for the man to come along and discover me...

On the Streets of the Bronx  //  On the Streets of the Bronx 
On the Streets of the Bronx //   On the Streets of the Bronx 
On the Streets of the Bronx  // On the Streets of the Bronx 
On the Streets of the Bronx  // On the Streets of the Bronx 

Streets of the Bronx  is where I wanna be!---Lyrics submitted by Daniel Loria.
