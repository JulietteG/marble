You're worth so much
It'll never be enough to see what you have to give
How beautiful you are
Yet seem so far from everything you're wanting to be
Wanting to be

Tears falling down again
Tears falling down

Chorus:
You fall to your knees
You beg, you plead
Can i be somebody else for all the times i hate myself?
Your failures devour your heart in every hour
You're drowning in your imperfection

You mean so much
That heaven would touch the face of humankind for you
How special you are
Revel in your day
You're fearfully and wonderfully made
Wonderfully made

Tears falling down again
Come let the healing begin

Chorus:
You fall to your knees
You beg, you plead
Can i be somebody else for all the times i hate myself?
Your failures devour your heart in every hour
You're drowning in your imperfection

You're worth so much
So easily crushed
Wanna be like everyone else
No one escapes
Every breath we take dealing with our own skeletons
Skeletons

Chorus:
You fall to your knees
You beg, you plead
Can i be somebody else for all the times i hate myself?
Your failures devour your heart in every hour
You're drowning in your imperfection

Won't you believe, yeah? 
Won't you believe, yeah?
All the things I see in you
You're not the only one, you're not the only one drowning in imperfection.---Lyrics submitted by Fank.
