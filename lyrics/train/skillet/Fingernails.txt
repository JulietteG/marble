Chorus: Never reaching what I want to reach. 
            Never being who I want to be. 
            Blaming me when I fall and fail. 
            All my dreams splintering under my fingernails.

Verse 1: I'm empty, lonely and accused.
            Accused without a word.
            My fingernails, are chipping down,
            from crawling in the dirt.
            I'm so lost, lost and confused.
            I threw it all away.
            How can I be beautiful, when I am so afraid??

*REPEAT CHORUS*

Verse 2: I watched it all slip through my hands.
            My brokeness revealed. I'm so proud,
            I'm so proud, I;m crying to be filled.
            I'm killing, destroying the plague,
           That's killin me away.   
           I've got to live. I've got to love,
           Like I am unafraid.

*REPEAT CHORUS* 

Bridge: I'm waisting, waisting every moment.
           I want to be tasting, tasting every moment, with you.
           I'm suffering, I'm bleeding, on my knees,
           Who's gonna save me? Suffering, bleeding, save me from this pit of frality.
