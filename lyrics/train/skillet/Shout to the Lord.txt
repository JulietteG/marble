My Jesus My Savior
Lord there is none like you
All of my days I want to praise
the wonders of your mighty love
My comfort My shelter 
Tower of refuge and strength

Shout to the Lord
All the Earth let us sing
Powers and Majesty
Praise to the King
Mountains bow down
and the seas will roar
At the sound of your name

I sing for Joy
At works of your hands
Forever I'll love you
Forever I'll stand
Nothing compares 
to the promise I have in you

Shout to the lord 
All the Earth let us sing 
Shout to the lord
All the Earth let us sing
Shout to the Lord
All the earth let us sing

Shout to the lord 
All the earth let us sing
Power and Majesty
Praise to the King
Mountains bow down 
and the seas will roar 
at the sound of your name

I sing for Joy
At the work of your hands
Forever I'll love you
Forever I'll stand
Nothing compares 
to the promise I have
Nothing compares 
to the promise I have
Nothing compares 
to the promise I have
Nothing compares 
to the promise I have in you---Lyrics submitted by Rebekka.
