All Alone, lost in this abyss
 Crawling in the dark
 Nothing to wipe my longing clips
 And I wonder where you are (Where you are)

 Are you far? (Are you far)
 Will you come to my rescue?
 Am I left to die
 But I can't give up on you

 I feel you keeping me alive
 You are my salvation
 Touch you, taste you, feel you here 
 (Oh oh yeah yeah)
 I feel you keeping me alive
 You are my salvation
 Hold me, heal me, keep me near
 (Oh oh yeah yeah)

 My heart will burn for you, 
 it's all I can do.

 Salvation (Salvation)
 Salvation 
 Keeping me alive
 Salvation 
 Keeping me
 Salvation 
 Keeping me alive

 Been out from under who I am
 and who I wanna be
 Held you tightly in my hand
 While we ungraveling
 Was it me?
 Will you come to my rescue?
 Or did I push too far, 
 When I turned my back on you

 I feel you keeping me alive
 You are my salvation
 Touch you, taste you, feel you here 
 (Oh oh yeah yeah)
 I feel you keeping me alive
 You are my salvation
 Hold me, heal me, keep me near
 (Oh oh yeah yeah)

 My heart will burn for you, 
 it's all I can do.

 Salvation (Salvation)
 Salvation 
 Keeping me alive
 Salvation

 Touch you, taste you
 feel you, need you
 Give it all just to find you
 Hold me, heal me
 I will find you

 Keeping me alive
 You are my salvation
 Touch you, taste you, feel you here 
 (Oh oh yeah yeah)
 Our love will never die
 You are my salvation
 Hold me, heal me, keap me near
 (Oh oh yeah yeah)

 My heart will burn for you, 
 it's all I can do.

 Salvation (Salvation)
 Salvation (Salvation)
 Touch you, taste you
 feel you, need you
