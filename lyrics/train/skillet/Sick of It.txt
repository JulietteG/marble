If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!

When everything you do
Don't seem to matter.
You try but it's no use
Your world is getting blacker.

When every time you fail
Has no answer.
Every empty promise made
His own reminder.

No one can make this better
Take control, it's now or never!

Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands,
Get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance.
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands...

If you're sick of it!
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!
If you're sick of it!
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!

Every single day
I chase my own tail
Like the bad inside of me
Has gotta get, gotta get, get away

I'm running out of time
For me to break this.
I'm tired of feeling like
I'm never gonna make it.

No one can make this better
Take control, it's now or never!

Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands,
Get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance.
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands...

If you're sick of it!
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!
If you're sick of it!
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!

I'm tired of it
I'm over it
I'm bored to death

Gotta face this
I'm sick of it!

Raise your hands
If you're sick
If you're sick of it
Raise your hands
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Sick of it!
Raise your hands,
Get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance.
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands...

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!

Get rid of it!
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!

Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands...

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

If you're sick of it
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it---
