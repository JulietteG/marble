Love is all around you now, so take a hold
Hidden in our words, it sometimes ain't enough
Don't suffocate day after day , it's building up
Cause when your feeling weak , you know I'm strong enough

Just one more day, one more day

Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

Love is indestructible , so take a hold
Sometimes hard to find a reason good enough
I'll stand beside you, never leave through it all
Faith will bring a way to the impossible

Just one more day, one more day

Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

You can find me, you can find me, you can find me anywhere
Take a look over your shoulder, I'll be standing there 
Standing there

Love is all around you now , so take a hold
 And faith will bring a way to the impossible

You can find me, you can find me, you can find me anywhere
(Just one more day, one more day)
You can find me, you can find me, you can find me anywhere
(Just one more day, one more day)

Let the world crash, love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

A little more
Take a little more
Take a little more
Go and take it
A little more---Lyrics submitted by Elliot.
