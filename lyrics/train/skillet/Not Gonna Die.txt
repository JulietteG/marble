Death surrounds
My heartbeats slowing down
I wont take this worlds abuse
I wont give up or refuse
This is how it feels when youre bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignitys stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
Weve gotta stand and fight forever
(Dont close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We gotta fight for us together
No, were not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
Because I wont be controlled
The cant keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesnt kill you makes you stronger

The last thing I heard is you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
Weve gotta stand and fight forever
(Dont close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We gotta fight for us together
No, were not gonna die tonight

Dont you give up on me
Youre everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

No, not gonna die tonight
Weve gotta stand and fight forever
(Dont close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We gotta fight for us together
No, were not gonna die tonight
No, were not gonna die tonight

Not gonna die
(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die
(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die tonight---
