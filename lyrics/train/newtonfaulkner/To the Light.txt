I'm taking a break because I'm losing it again 
And I wanna relate without you thinking I'm insane. 
Oh, it's the same another train. 
Just sitting around with record in my brain. 

You could have everything you wanted 
But you would still be wanting more. 
Cos the sun is always in your eyes.
You search for stillness on a rock. 
Thats spinning round and round and you're surprised. 

Take a break from all i know 
Just sit back and let it flow. 
Then I find I've broken through. 
To the light again. 

Everytime I find I'm thinking about the things I wanna.
That is the time I have nothing to sing. 
And everytime I'm thinking about things that don't matter. 
That is the time I see everything. 

I want to know lord why it's got to be so hard. 
I want to know lord why it's got to be so hard. 
I feel like a muppet with a drunken puppeteer but I'll survive.
I will survive. 

Take a break from all I know 
Just sit back and let it flow. 
Then I find I've broken through. 
To the light again. 
To the light again. 

Take a break from all I know. 
Just sit back and let it flow. 
Then I find I've broken through. 
To the light again.---Lyrics submitted by jessey.
