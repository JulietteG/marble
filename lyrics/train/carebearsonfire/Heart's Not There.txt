You used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Heart's not there

Do things just to say you did them
Think things cause they say it's right
Do whatever you need to please them
Like breaking heart's all day and night

You used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Heart's not there, heart's not there

You act so strong but feel so broken
You knew it was a matter of time
Before I realized what you were doing
Your friends were laughing, feeding you lines

You used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Heart's not there, heart's not there

I look back and I see
Another girl, no longer me
Standing still
Watching you, pretending

You said my name and I was taken
Had me thinking you were the guy
I saw through your fake adoration
Called you up and said goodbye

You used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Used me then, now I don't care
Can't use me if my heart's not there
Heart's not there, heart's not there
Heart's not there---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
