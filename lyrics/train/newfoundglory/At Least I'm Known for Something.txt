I'm in and out of conversation
It's hard to keep my attention locked down
So don't take offence to anything i say
I tried so hard to keep you coming back my way
But you don't know the half and the one to blame for it

Cause I'm best known for failure
Best known for giving up
There's nothing that I can say that can matter that can matter enough
Cause I'm best known for failure (hey)
Best known for giving up (hey)
There's nothing that I can say that can matter that can matter enough

I've figured out my situation
I am an endless source of useless information
Give me bad news 'cause it's already been expected
I let my front down
And i know i will regret it
But you don't know the half and the one to blame for it

Cause I'm best known for failure
Best known for giving up
There's nothing that I can say that can matter that can matter enough
Cause I'm best known for failure (hey)
Best known for giving up (hey)
There's nothing that I can say that can matter that can matter enough

Lets get down to business now
I'm saving myself the trouble in the end
So lets get down to business now
I'm saving myself the trouble in the end
(Saving myself the trouble)
But you don't know the half and the one to blame for it

(hey) Cause I'm best known for failure (hey)
Best known for giving up (hey)
There's nothing that I can say that can matter 

I'm the one to blame for this
Yes I'm the one to blame

Best known for failure
Best known for giving up
There's nothing I can say that can matter
That can matter enough---Lyrics submitted by Jorge.
