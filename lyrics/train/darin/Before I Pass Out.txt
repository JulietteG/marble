Party time, yeah
Darin, Lil Jon
Lets see if you can keep up with us drinking tonight

Its getting late
But damn, its getting harder to leave
The more I drink
The prettier she gets to me

Im saying one shot, two shots, three shots, four
Tell the DJ turn it up just a little more
Turn up the bass, the music is intoxicating
Woah-oh, yeah

I know when Ive had enough
Think I might have had too much
Maybe I should slow it down
Before I, fore I, fore I

Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
(Lets go)

Its getting late
But damn its getting harder to leave
The more I drink
The sexier she gets to me

Im saying one shot, two shots, three shots, four
Tell the DJ turn it up just a little more
Turn up the bass, the music is intoxicating
Woah-oh, yeah (Lets go)

I know when Ive had enough
Think I might have had too much
Maybe I should slow it down
Before I, fore I, fore I

Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
(Here we go)

Got sick, hey
Bottles on deck, deck
Put your drinks up
If you love having sex

We got trays full of shots
Done holler from the block
Now make some fucking noise
Cause this party dont stop

Its your birthday, hey
Its your birthday
Gimme, gimme shots
We gon party like your birthday

Sexy girl, I wanna slay your body girl
You so cray, Damn Im in
You ma fay
Thats one thing I gotta say

I know when Ive had enough (Hey)
Think I might have had too much (Too much)
Maybe I should slow it down (Slow it down)
Before I, fore I, fore I (Yeah baby)
(Before I pass out)

When Ive had enough (Hey)
Think I might have had too much (Too much)
Maybe I should slow it down (Slow it down)
Before I, fore I, fore I

Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out
Before I pass out, out, out

Pour me another one, motherfucker
