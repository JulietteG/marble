This blood is on your hands
Now no one can save my heart
And the scar you left can't be repaired
The knife is in your hands
Is that a smile on your face
It's so clear to me

You're a lovekiller
You're a love lovekiller
You're a lovekiller
You're a murderer

You're a lovekiller
You're a love lovekiller
You're a lovekiller
You're a murderer

You're a cold blooded murderer
Baby never did I think you could,
Be such a cold blooded murderer
You're a lovekiller you're a murderer

I see your strategy
I bet you've been here before
You won't stop until you're victims crawl
Just like a criminal
You've stolen love away from me
It's so clear to me

You're a lovekiller
You're a love lovekiller
You're a lovekiller
You're a murderer

You're a cold blooded murderer
Baby never did I think you could,
Be such a cold blooded murderer
You're a lovekiller you're a murderer
You're a murderer---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
