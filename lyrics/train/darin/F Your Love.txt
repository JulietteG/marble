Baby, you is the diamond that lasts forever
And I just cant take a single step without you
Baby, to you Ill always be a faithful lover
Cause my heart cant make a single beat without you

You make me fly, you get me high
You turn my world to such a better place
Your crazy touch, the sweetest rush
Is something that saved my life

I wanna spend my nights and days between your arms
Every day breathing your love
And even in my dreams I wanna be kissing your lips
Baby, breathing your love

Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love
Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love

Baby boo, only you can make me recover
The lost parts of me I thought theyd gone a long time ago
With you life rhymes like the best love letter
I was just an empty soul until you stepped in to my show

You make me fly, you get me high
You turn my world to such a better place
Your crazy touch, the sweetest rush
Is something that saved my life

I wanna spend my nights and days between your arms
Every day breathing your love
And even in my dreams I wanna be kissing your lips
Baby, breathing your love

Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love
Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love

I wanna have that crazy love
Want it running in my blood
I want it taking over me, over me, over me

I wanna spend my nights and days between your arms
Every day breathing your love
And even in my dreams I wanna be kissing your lips
Baby, breathing your love

I wanna spend my nights and days between your arms
Every day breathing your love
And even in my dreams I wanna be kissing your lips
Baby, breathing your love

Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love
Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love

Breathing your love, love, love
Baby, breathing your love, love, love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
