Dont look for me now,
i m safe where i am
happy and listed under unknown name
and his a good dream
and she is gorgeous
and they love me 
and i adore them 

If this were a book
It'd start with a line
I once knew a man
I was his and he was mine

So predictable
So confused
I'm at a loss for words
to explain my mood

I stitch this bow
into the bottom of my dress
The one that touches me
directly on my legs

And I wear that gold ribbon till
It sits over my heart
And I hold it tight
And dream

Baby, won't you help me be my best
Help me find a way back to our nest
And dreams---Lyrics submitted by its.
