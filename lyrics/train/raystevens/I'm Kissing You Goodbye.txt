Well, the first time we met dear
You flashed that come on smile
Your steamy-eyed glances
Nearly drove me wild
So we drove out to the country
And parked beneath the stars
Where you fogged up my windshield
And set my soul afire

Well, you moved into my place 
That very same night
I was so happy
It was love at first sight
But one day I came home early
The very next week
Found a man in my closet 
Says he's playing hide and seek

Now I may be stupid
But I'll never understand
Why he was playing Hide and seek
With all his clothes in his hand

So get your feet off of my table
Get your shoes from under my bed
Get your hat off my hatrack
And put it on your head
Get you coat out of my closet
And put it on your back
And get your Ferlin Husky records darlin'
It's time for you to pack
Get your arms from around me
It ain't no use to try
And get your tongue out of my mouth 
'Cause I'm kissing you goodbye

CHORUS:
(get your tongue)
Out of my mouth and wipe off that silly grin
(get you tongue)
Out of my mouth, ain't no tellin where it's been
(get you toungue)
Out of my mouth, and don't try that again
(get your tongue)
Out of my mouth, 
Get your tongue out of my mouth
Lets just say adios with a kiss and a sigh
And get your tongue out of my mouth 
'Cause I'm kissing you goodbye

Well, the flame has flickered
And the passion has cooled
I hate to lose you darling
But I won't be a fool
"cause you just can't be true dear
Your spreading it around
You've shattered all that mattered
Gonna have to put you down

So get your dog out of my doghouse
You cat out of my tree
Get your bird out of my birdcage
I'm setting you free
Get your toothbrush out of my bathroom
Your stockings off my line
Get your curlers off my dresser, darlin'
You ain't no friend of mine
And get your arms from around me
I won't believe your lies
And get your tongue out of my mouth
'Cause I'm kissing you goodbye
