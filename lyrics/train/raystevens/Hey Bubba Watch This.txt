Well you can always tell 
Somethin' bad's 'bout to happen
To a good ol' boy Down South
'Cause the worst four words
I've ever heard 
Come out of a redneck's mouth
Are "HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
And you know lightnin's 'bout to strike
And the next thing you see
I gaurentee, won't be a pretty sight
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!'
"Junior get down off that barn."
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
And then he broke both of his arms
With a big bath-tile and a safety pin
Captain Marboro's airborn again!
(SHAZZAM!)

"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
Words that are cause for alarm
There was a good ol' boy named Junior
Who lived just down the road
Junior ran three quarter's of a ton 
Shy of a half ton load
You've heard of folks who's elevators
Don't go all the way to the top
Junior didn't have no elevator
And his stairs went halfway and stopped
Now Junior thought he was Zorro and 
Captain Marborro rolled into one
And I can't begin to tell you
All the stupid things he's done
When Captain Marborro sai "SHAZZAM!"
A lightnin' bolt would flash
Junior'd say "Hey Bubba watch this!"
And somethin' would explode or crash

"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
Junior drop that Cherry-Bomb
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
There went a finger, and a thumb
Whether it's at work
Or it's at play
Whenever you hear a redneck say:
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
It's a good idea to run!

Now growin' up with Junior
I saw some crazy days
But the worst of all
Had to be his Evil Kenevil phase
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
Junior you can't jump those cars!
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
Then all Junior saw where stars
He though for sure he was gonna clear
But you can't jump nothin' on a big John Deer
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"
And I watched him crush his momma's car
And his daddy's truck
And the ramp he built
From the chicken coop he had to blow up
'Cause it'd been weakend by the fire
Started by the spark
From the barn
Where he use to make gun powder
With the chemistry set
Next to the propane tanks
"HEY BUBBA WATCH THIS!"---Lyrics submitted by saturn.
