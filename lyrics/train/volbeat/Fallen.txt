Feel the sadness burning in my heart
You left too early father love
So many things I should have said
But in your mind you knew it well
Holding on to what i gotta love
But things still seem so dark and cold
The fire burning down my happiness
But i will rise

So proud and strong you truly were
I took it with me as a tool
A gift from father to his only son
Watching over me with eagle eyes
You gave me freedom too a life
Where dreams are born and truly became real

See me falling,yeah down and lonely
Are the angels on their way, im in the dirt
Hear me screaming, see me bleeding
Cause the days are no more the same
Without you

Promise me, my son, you always will
Cherish what you love, believing in
Never lose your values, stand up for the day
Oh dear father I thank you for this
Im writing this song on your desk
Together we can make it through the day

See me falling, down and lonely
Are the angels on the way im in the dirt
Hear me screaming, see me bleeding
Cause the day is no more the same
Without you

See me falling, down and lonely
Are the angels on the way im in the dirt
Hear me screaming, see me bleeding
Cause the day is no more the same
Without you

See me fallen, down and lonely
Are the angels on the way im in the dirt
Hear me screaming, see me bleeding
Cause the day is no more the same
Without you---Lyrics submitted by Vili.
