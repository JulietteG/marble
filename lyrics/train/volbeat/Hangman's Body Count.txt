[Verse 1]
Hear his boots and see the figure dressed in black...
Echoes of him have been heard, spiritually he's all intact
Guided by the raven since his eyes don't see
Hear him drag the rope that goes up to the hangmans tree

The wind calls your name, get out of your bed
Go out to the rail's, the window will leave
Just when we prevail, the hangman is here.

[Verse 2]
You smell the rain, and as you walk the final [?]
Pictures of them grabs my past, but not forgotten in this world
See the valley turn to darkness on your way
The only friend you have is dangling at the gallows end

The wind calls your name, get out of your bed
Go out to the rail's, the window will lead
Just when we prevail, the hangman is here

Put on the rope, you knew the day was coming
Say your prayers once more; you are a part of the Hangmans Body Count

[Verse 3]
Hear his boots and see the figure dressed in black...
Echoes of him have been heard, spiritually he's all intact
The wind calls your name, get out of your bed
Go out to the hills, the wind will lead
Just when we prevail; the hangman is here

Put on the rope, you knew the day was coming
Say your prayer once more; you are a part of the Hangmans Body Count ---
