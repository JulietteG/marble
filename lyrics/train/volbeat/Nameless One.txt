Wake up baby and taste the dirt
we're six feet under and still in love
the day has come
we belong with the living dead of the night

Hear the outlaw ghoul and his cane
crashing our casket to find his way
the day has come
we belong with the living dead of the night

Hold on to me baby
his bony hands will do you no harm
it said in the cards we lost our soul to the nameless one

The outlaw ghoul:

wake up my darling your time is up
follow my riders into the dark
the day has come
we belong with the living dead of the night

The outlaw ghoul:

long time ago
you called upon the tombstones
gambling with your soul for nothing
and now you're walking through the valley of the death
but see how beautiful you are
skinny blue and grey in love
you'll walk among the outlaw bandits
until you meet the nameless one

The day has finally come ---Lyrics submitted by Bo Davis.
