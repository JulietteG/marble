Dear wind of Mississippi can you call him by name
I have followed his wings on a sunny day

I like to believe he's the chosen one
I like to believe he's the fallen one
Dead but rising

I raise the fist with power and fate
and wishing that his claws will grab on to my hand

I like to believe he's the chosen one
I like to believe he's the fallen one
Dead but rising

I have been to the end of waters
I have been to the end of earth
I've been over mountains and riding the storms
dear son your words have reached me
and for that I can carry on
I'll guide you in spirit
today I'll be home

I like to believe he's the chosen one
I like to believe he's the fallen one
the rebirth of man heals a bleeding heart
the eagle of kings wears my fathers soul

Dead but rising ---Lyrics submitted by Bo Davis.
