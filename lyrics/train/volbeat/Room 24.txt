(feat. King Diamond)

Caught in the darkness
the room is getting colder my body is on hold
lying in bed and unable to move

The darkness in 24
former guests who live no more
so many hands to hold you down

My mind is awake
I open my eyes but it's so hard to breathe
something is in here to silence my screams

The darkness in 24
steal your breath away once more
oh it's happening again yeah

See the old hag sitting over me
the smell of rotten breath and blasphemy
no way out only darkness here
feel my eyes filling up with fear
will someone hear me crying out for help in room 24
in room 24... in room 24

Sadness is falling tear
turning into liquid fear
who killed who we'll never know
oh we'll never know
never tell... never tell... never tell... never tell...

See the old hag sitting over me
the smell of rotten breath and blasphemy
no way out only darkness here
feel my eyes filling up with fear
will someone hear me crying out for help in room 24
in room 24... in room 24 ---Lyrics submitted by Bo Davis.
