A man appeared before Wells Fargo
Wells Fargos stage driver man
wearing a long white linen
and a dust flour sack over his head

Pointed a double barreled shotgun
at the driver and forced him to halt
please throw down your box sir
and madame please I dont need your money or pearls

They call him Black Bart PO8
the highway bandit po8try man
leaving his poem disappeared
like a ghost on his own all on his own
the road he owns

Rise Black Bart rise Im calling
calling your spirit out
dust off your hat and hatchet
there are boxes out there with your name and mark

The road has been cold and lonely
the road has been out of good tales
lets shake up some dust
well be opening the box like before just like before
and leave a poem

(Black Bart 1877):
For honor and for riches
Ive labored long and hard for the bread
but on my corns too long you tread
you fine haired sons of bitches---Lyrics submitted by Bo Davis.
