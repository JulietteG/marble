Well my mama told me: son you better wach out,
All those nasty women gonna rip you dime for dime,
But I got my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode (guitar mode),
And the story keep on a rollin', out from a sad man's tongue

Yeah, Left my mama and papa's nest,
I got the rebel fever rambling my bones,
Papa said: my boy, take my Johnny Cash vinyls and go,
Well I fot my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode (guitar mode),
And the story keep on a rollin', out from a sad man's tongue

Strollin' down the highway with uncle sam roaring: rebel kid get your ass home,
Your ass belongs to me, 
Leave your Johnny Cash songs and get home,
But I got my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode (guitar mode),
And the story keep on a rollin', out from a sad man's tongue

Singing in cell 1.40.9.5,
No way should I wear guns, I'm sitting my time

Yeah, Left 1.40.9.5 with plenty Rock'n'Roll songs painting the road,
Education sucks, so I sing my song for you
And I got my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode (guitar mode),
And the story keep on a rollin', out from a sad man's tongue.---Lyrics submitted by Silke.
