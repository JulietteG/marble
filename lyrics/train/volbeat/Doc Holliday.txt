An outlaw walking through the valley of men
Glared with a sunken eye of death
Moved his head from side to side and said
Come on you gutless slugs fight like a man
State your name and business, let's see what you got
Another body for the hangman's count
Show me the bar, and show me the cards
Hold on to your guns

Filled with bug juice
The moonshine in his hand
Hot headed with a temperament
The speediest, deadliest man with a gun
A bloody gambler but a gentleman dog
A frontier vagabond who charms all the dames
Hello ladies, how's your day today?
Let me introduce you to myself
Doc Holliday

The outlaw man's roar
The outlaw man

A friendly man but without a friend
Fought grievances is here I am
Supported Wyatt Earp to the very end
Cemented brotherhood
Don't get in his way
You cannot shake his boots
You cannot scar his fate
Down under you will hear him grin
Greet the man the outlaw himself
Doc Holliday

The outlaw man's roar
The outlaw man

Filled with bug juice
The moonshine in his hand
Hot headed with a temperament
The speediest, deadliest man with a gun
A bloody gambler but a gentleman dog
A frontier vagabond who charms all the dames
Hello ladies, how's your day today?
Let me introduce you to myself
Doc Holliday
