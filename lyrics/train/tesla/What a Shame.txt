Did you think it wouldn't show, you're here with me, but I'm so alone
And now this house don't feel like home, I can't believe how much we've grown
So far apart, so far away, you just can't hide something as plain as day
I think it's safe to say, that's it's just no good

And I don't need you in my life, the way you cut me like a knife
You burned me once, but now that it's done, you'll never burn me twice

Now that it's all been said and done, do you like what you've become
Now that it's all but over, you haven't changed, and what a shame

I know you think you're always right, and just because, you've got God in your life
But he don't appreciate the way you lied, he can't believe how hard you tried
To take me down, to take it all, hanging around, and making sure I fall
Then say it was me to blame, and I was, for trusting someone like you anyways

And I don't need you in my life, the way you cut me like a knife
You burned me once, but now that it's done, you'll never burn me twice

Now that it's all been said and done, do you like what you've become
Now that it's all but over, you haven't changed, and what a shame
Now that it's all been said and done, do you like what you've become
Now that it's all but over, you haven't changed, and what a shame

And I don't need you in my life, the way you cut me like a knife
You burned me once, but now that it's done, you'll never burn me twice

Now that it's all been said and done, do you like what you've become
Now that it's all but over, you haven't changed, and what a shame
Now that it's all been said and done, do you like what you've become
Now that it's all but over, you haven't changed, and what a shame---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
