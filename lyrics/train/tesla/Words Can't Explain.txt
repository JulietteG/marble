once upon a day, love walked away
Soon after, I would learn, only never to return
feeling life was through, like it was `til you
Saved me before I drowned, put me up on drier ground
and I meant what I said, when I told you 
I`ll never love like this again, I wanna hold you
In my arms, wrap my legs, around your pretty self

If only words could explain, I`d surely tell you now
how I feel about everything, I`ll never let you down
And you better believe, you can count on me
I couldn`t ask for a better friend, I`ll never love like this again...oh no

This love is real, so much I feel it
So deep inside, as though our hearts were synchronized
Now, since you came, and colored up my life
I`ll never make it, in black and white
All pales, or shades of gray
You come around, they go away
And I meant every word I said, when I told you
I`ll never love like this again, I wanna show you
You`re in my heart, you`re in my soul, you`re all I wanna know

If only words could explain, I`d surely tell you now
How I feel about everything, I`ll never let you down
And you better believe, you can count on me

What does it really mean, I`ve never known for sure
Don`t know what to believe, only know what I`m feeling
I going to a place, I`ve never been before
I just can`t help myself, can`t help what I`m feeling

If only words could explain, If only words could explain
If only words could explain, If only words could explain
Maybe how I feel---Lyrics submitted by jason.
