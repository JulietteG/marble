Nailed dead and risen, a perfect life divine sacrifice.
A despised savior-despise only me.
Silenced by the mislead who mock the God they never met.
The evil of men's minds knows no limits, who chooses hell over forgiveness.
You try and try to obliterate my fathers name, it sickens me!
I stay silenced no more.
A despised savior-despise only me.
You try and try to obliterate my fathers name, it sickens me!
I stay silences no more.
Send me to the depths of hell, and I'll bring back risen souls.
Despise our savior-just remember, nailed, dead, and risen.---Lyrics submitted by Benjamin.
