City Of Refuge: Songs in the night are sung in the city of refuge. I call you out to choose your side. Find the truth amongst the lies. Find the truth amongst the lies. I want to see your tears. I want to see anger. bring out your fears. Take them out on me. Songs in the night are sung in the city of refuge.---Lyrics submitted by ben.
