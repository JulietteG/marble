 I do believe, but perverted religions they all spread like disease, untrusting and deceived.
 Governments leading the blind (leading the blind), controlling societies with:
 Noise! Peace! Illusions! Riots fill our streets. Noise! Peace! Illusions!

I have said nothing new, Im not a revolutionary,
 Im not the worlds leader, but Im a part of holding it together.
 I have such a different view of this place; it seems that the faces of evil always seem to change.

Im not a revolutionary, Im not the worlds leader, but Im a part of holding it together.
 I have such a different view of this place; it seems that the faces of evil always change.

In this generation over and over again something has to be said, this is not a threat.
 Noise! Peace! Illusions! Death is in the air. Noise! Peace! Illusions! Illusions!
 Noise! Peace! Illusions! Riots fill our streets. Noise! Peace! Illusions!

Peace is an illusion, death has come! Yeah...
 Peace is an illusion, death has come! Peace is an illusion, death has come!---Lyrics submitted by Cookie.
