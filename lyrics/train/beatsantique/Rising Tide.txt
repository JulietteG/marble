You're an island of a girl
Adrift in the world
With the Rising Tide
You know that the coming storm 
Is gonna be a crazy ride.

With you altars made of trash,
The aftermath
Of disposable dreams,
You know that you were born
For more than what machines provide.

I will write you a song 
That sounds like
A faded photograph
Of your favorite night.
Just a little something
To remember me by.

You can sing along,
If you like it enough.
Play it on your phonograph,
It sounds kinda rough.
Just a little something
To remember me by.

You're an ocean of a girl.
Surrounded a world
With the blackening tide.
You know that the coming storm
Is gonna be a crazy ride.

With your altars made of bones,
The aftermath
Of disposable wings,
You know were born
For more than what machines provide.
Machines provide.

I will write you a song
That sounds like
A faded photograph
Of your favorite night.
Just a little something 
To remember me by.

You can sing along, 
If you like it enough.
Play it on your phonograph,
It sounds kinda rough.
Just a little something
To remember me by.

You can sing along,
If you like it enough.

Just a little something
To remember me by.---Lyrics submitted by Shelley Wright.
