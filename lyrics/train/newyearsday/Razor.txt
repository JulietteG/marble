Razor
Making headlines and headstones
Breaking hearts and breaking bones
Your whole life's a performance, so let the cameras role

Razor
You know it's all too good to last
If it's not too much to ask
Slow down before you crash

Razor you're such a fatal attraction
Your friends are only for fashion
We may last for a while, but we'll go out of style

Razor you know it's all too good to last
If it's not too much to ask
Slow down before you...

Crash into my arms
Put down your guard disarm, disarm
You think this whole world's against you
It's never your fault, we're the ones with the issues

Crash into my arms
Put down your guard disarm, disarm
You think this whole world's against you
It's never your fault, we're the ones with the issues

Crash...
Slow down before you...

Crash into my arms
Put down your guard disarm, disarm.
You think this whole world's against you.
It's never your fault, we're the ones with the issues
Crash into my arms put down your guard oh disarm, disarm You think this whole world's against you
It's never your fault, we're the ones with the issues
You think this whole world's against you It's never your fault, we're the ones with the issues---Lyrics submitted by kate.
