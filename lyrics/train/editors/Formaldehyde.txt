Would you butcher my love
To understand it
To know where it lies?
Cut a hole in my heart
Fill a hole in your life

I'm yours to dissect
Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood?
Formaldehyde

The tissue and bone 
And my soul has on loan
Begs to be near you
Are you listening carefully?
Then we shall begin

Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood?
I hope it doesn't matter
I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (nothing on my mind)

Smother my love, entertain it
My mind's gonna wander
Are you listening carefully?
Then we shall begin

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (nothing on my mind)

I'm lost in a love that's a mile wide
Drowned in a bath of formaldehyde

Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood?
I hope it doesn't matter
I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (nothing on my mind)

I'm lost in a love that's a mile wide
Drowned in a bath of formaldehyde---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
