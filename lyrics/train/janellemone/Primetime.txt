(feat. Miguel)

Tick-tock, I'm watching the clock
I can't wait 'til we get to rock
I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade
Is that okay?

Tonight it's me and you alone
Won't make a call, won't even write a song
See I've been waiting and waiting for the time to say
Now listen baby

When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby I know we'll always keep it real and true

Cause baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
And heaven is bettin' on us

Bang bang, I'm calling your name
You're like a fire the world can't tame
I wanna riot 'til the stars come out and play
Is that okay? (Okay)

Tonight it's me and you alone
Won't take a call, won't even write a song
This'll be a personal kind of day
Listen baby

When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby my love is always right here for you
Yeah

Cause baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
And heaven is bettin' on us

It's a primetime for our love (yes it is)
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
And heaven is bettin' on us

Cause baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
And heaven is bettin' on us ---
