If you love the life you live
Then you'll get a lot more done
Be more inclined to take the reins
Than turn away and run
It's very rare it seems to get a lifetime guarantee, 
So I suppose self satisfaction be the key
My father is a wealthy, self made man
But his wealth does not consist of riches or acres of land
Instead he has a family who are
His biggest fans
That's something that I one day hope to have
So I'll cherish the simple things
The easy took for granted things
Like going round my Mum's house for my tea
And argue with my sister, 
Only God knows how I missed her
It's the simple things that mean the most to me

Argh, he gets up each day at five
Starts the car and makes the drive
Shutters up, starts the fryers
Serves out food to all the buyers in the town
As they stand there in the same old line
Get there every day at the same old time
No, you never hear him grumble and groan
Cause they're the people in the line that he built it on
And like me he cherished the simple things
The easy took for granted things
Like going round his Mum's house for his tea
And argue with his sister, 
Only God knows how he missed her
It's the simple things that mean the most to... him---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
