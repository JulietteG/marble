1, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Ive got a sheet for my bed
and a pillow for my head;
Ive got a pencil full of lead;
and some water for my throat
Ive got buttons for my coat; and sails on my boat
So much more than I needed before
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
Now its getting hotter;
Oh its only getting sweeter
I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
Pot and a pan
And some shoes on my feet;
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock;
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothings gonna bring me down

I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I got most of the means; and scripts for the scenes
Im out and about, so Im in with a shout
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
Food in my belly and a license for my telly
and nothing's going to bring me down

Nothings gonna bring me down
But best of all (best of all)
Ive got my baby (x2)
Shes mighty fine and says shes all mine
And nothings going to bring me down

Best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby (x2)
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down (x3)
Not today...no, no---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
