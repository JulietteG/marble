Its all about him 

Chorus (2x)
Cause Im all about him him, him, him, him
And hes all about me, me, me, me, me
And we dont give a dang dang, dang, dang, dang
About nobodyeeee

Well, we had him shooting for me like a ball team
Every guy was a knock out, Don King
But none of em had smarts, thats my thing
Its not enough to have balls, Spalding ha

One day by star bucks
I bump into a guy rocking black chucks
He said, Excuse me beautiful I said aww, shucks
And then he asked, Well, ay, wanna grab a lunch?

Pre-chorus
Never ever met a guy so fly
Got me hooked like apple pie, I
Think Im falling and I dont know why
But I wont fight this butterfly

[Chorus]

And I swear what we have is super cool
The way hes always in my head like a blue tooth
I got a text from him, he said come through
Told me he wants to kick it, kung fu

Dont do nothing much at all
Just we and his boys watching football
He asked for a kiss (muah)
So I gave him two
He said, Well, thank you baby. I said, Youre welcome boo

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

No I dont need fancy cars
And I dont need no diamond rings
My baby is all I need and more
Cause I dont need those extra things

Its not about you (ohohohoh its not about you)
Its not about them (ohohohoh its not about them)

Its all about me (ohohohoh its not about me)
Its all about him (ohohohoh its not about him)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Said its all about him, yeah

[Chorus]

(Ohohohoh) its all about him
(Ohohohoh) its all about him
(Ohohohoh) its all about him
(Ohohohoh) and we dont give a dang, dang, dang

(Ohohohoh) its all about you
(Ohohohoh) its all about you boy
(Ohohohoh) its all about you
(Ohohohoh)---Lyrics submitted by jhannah.
