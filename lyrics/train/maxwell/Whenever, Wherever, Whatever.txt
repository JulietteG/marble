Lead me on girl if you must
Take my heart and my love
Take of me all that you want
And if there's a thing that you need
I'll give you the breath that I breathe
And if ever you yearn for the love in me
Whenever, wherever, whatever, baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever, ba-ba-baby

Wish I knew if I could
Be the one that you want
Love forever and a day baby, oh yeah
And if there's a thing that you need
For you and your blood I will bleed
And if ever you yearn for the love in me
Whenever, wherever, whatever, baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever, ba-ba-bay
(Oooooo, ba-b-baby, ba-ba-baby)

And if there's a thing that you need
I give you the breath that I breathe
And if ever you yearn for the love in me
Whenever, wherever, whatever, baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever---Lyrics submitted by leander.
