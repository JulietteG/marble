Rolling in my 'Lacky with a twisted cap.
And in the Gs back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the back seat, P
Just do it rolling top down, 
Ready to fly on the streets,
Ready to fly on the streets

Back in a twisted cap,
Rolling in my 'Lacky with a twisted cap.
And in the Gs back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the back seat, P
Doing rolling top down,
Ready to fly on the streets,

Rolling in my 'Lacky with a twisted cap.
And in the Gs back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the back seat, P
Just do it rolling top down, 
Ready to fly on the streets,
Ready to fly on the streets

Back in a twisted cap,
Rolling in my 'Lacky with a twisted cap.
And in the Gs back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the back seat, P
Doing rolling top down,
Ready to fly on the streets,

Rolling in my 'Lacky with a twisted cap.
And in the Gs back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the back seat, P
Just do it rolling top down, 
Ready to fly on the streets,
Ready to fly on the streets

I love you---Lyrics submitted by Ritesh Jeswani.
