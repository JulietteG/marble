Murderers day in and day out
Murderers in this town right now
Would blow your brains out
For enough money for a fix of crack cocaine
Its never crossed their murdering minds
That they're gonna burn in hell
They never thought The fact they're going to burn one day

The cops have left their posts
And ran home to their wives
Today is the last day of all of our lives
There's bullets in the air
I can hear glasses breakin
There's no mistaking
The fucking earth is quaking
A man is on fire running down my block
I put him out his misery and blast him with a rock
Explosions going off sirens and alarms
I'm ready for death grippin my hatchetman charm

Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world

Apocalypse

Armageddon came now
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Let the fire
Let it rain down

Water mines blow up
And shoot out the dirt
A stranger punch me in the mouth but it ain't even hurt
I'm seeing families run
No need to be gunned down
By some psychopathic killer with automatic rounds
A burning chopper crashing
To the house next door
The pilot got shot I fuckin shot him some more
It's mass mayhem pandemonium and armageddon
People are killing each other, themselves and raping neden

Swarms of insects are attacting the city
I see a man fucking a headless corpse when it hit me
This is Babylon the devil is alive on earth
I pulled the clip in my Uzi and killed for all it's worth

I shot an old man on his bike
A clown on his trike
A fuckin whore named Sally
And a pirest named Mike
They're all dead now
I put gun to my head, too late
A little kid shot me instead---
