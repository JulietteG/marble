Intro

There comes a time.
Every So Often.
When the dark carnival begins to swell with the countless souls awaiting judgment.
When the thriving mob begins to tear at each other.
To find a place in lines that streach out of veiw.
And as attractions open wide to accomidate crowds frantically clawing their way inside.
He will come to perform the cleansing.
As the seething masses due to witness him growing near, their eyes attempt to make out his face, forming within the looming smoke.
Suddenly. BANG! Like a continious explosion he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury, enveloping the masses in darkness.
The POW! A deep resonating explosion of unparalled intensity, those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin. Which they soon realize is the blood of the shreaded victums.
They can only lay screaming in pure stark terror.
When BOOM! An earthshaking implosion of catastrophic porportions erupts. Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant horrific energy. 
You may call him. BANG! POW! BOOM!---Lyrics submitted by Rabid.
