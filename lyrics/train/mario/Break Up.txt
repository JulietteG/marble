Intro
I love you, but I don't think I can love you anymore
When I kiss you so good Why would you wanna break up?
When this loving is so good why would you wanna break up?
When I hit that so good Why would you wanna break up?
When this feeling is so good Why would you wanna break up?


Chorus
Loving you, Loving you, Loving you, When I'm, When I'm Loving you,  Loving you Why would you wanna break up?
(Do anything for you) 
Why would youwanna break up?
See I be driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?


Verse ( Gucci Mane)
Now baby girl have dumped me
She no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired
She says that I've been fired
On to the next one
More fish in the sea
Girls are like buses
Miss one, Next fifteen one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, No more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL
She used to be my soulja

Verse (Mario)
(Don't) Don't I lace with the Gucci?
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louis?
(Don't) Don't I make your air look free?
(Don't) Don't when my diver dive deep?

I know I be gone, I know I be gone, I know I be
(flirtin' with those girls)
I know I be, Sayion Id be right back but take too long
I know I be, Saying I be faithful but I don't
I know I be, Making you them promises
Then breaking your heart again
Telling you she wasn't , Who she was,Then we arguing
But babyyy, I love you
OH

Chorus 2x

Verse (Mario)
You might be from the hood
But to me, You're a model
Everything that I-I-I ever seen in a model
If you're leaving baby, Don't leave me til' tomorrow
Tonight we gone get a lil tipsy, With bottle
You gone get me up
I'm go take em' down
I'm gonna change my ways
We gone work it out
Girl I wouldn't be the same if you were with somebody else
Girl it wouldn't be the same if I was with somebody else

I know I made mistakes before
Promise you won't get hurt no more
I got what you like it,You know
Once you lay down, It's on


Chorus 2x

Verse (Gucci Mane)
Why you wanna leave me?
You should wanna tease me
Being icey aint' easy

OH

So would you break up (break up) yeah
