[Verse:]
How do I breathe yeah
How do I breathe yeah
Feels so different being here
I'm so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
Theres no-one to talk to
Don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

[Hook:]
I just had a wake up calls,
Wishing that I never let you fall,
Baby you are not blame at all.
Remember when I pushed you away?
Baby if you knew I cared,
You'd have never went nowhere,
Girl I should've been right there.

[Chorus:]
How do I breathe,
Without you here by my side?
How will I see,
When your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go,
When your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me,
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

[Verse:]
Girl I'm losin' my mind.
Yes I made a mistake.
I thought that you would be mine.
Guess the joke was on me.
I miss you so bad I can't sleep.
I wish I knew where you could be.
Another dude is replacing me,
but this can't be happening.

[Hook:]
I just had a wake up call,
Wishing that I never let you fall,
Baby you are not blame at all.
when I was the one that pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared,
You'd have never went nowhere,
Girl I should've been right there.

[Chorus:]
How do I breathe,
Without you here by my side?
How will I see,
When your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go,
When your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me,
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

[Verse:]
I can't get over you no, (ooooh)
Baby I don't wanna let go.
Girl you need to come home,
Back to me,
Cuz girl you made it hard to breathe,
When you're not with me.

[Chorus:]
Tell me how do I breathe,
Without you here by my side?
How will I see,
When your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go,
When your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me,
How do I breathe?
