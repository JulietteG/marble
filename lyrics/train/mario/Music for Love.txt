Right about now... 

[Chorus]
Girl turn me up and let me come through your speakers
Blow the sound out of between us
Cause babygirl this is the music for love
Shawty don't be scared, just let the bass line hit you
Boom boom, all up in your system
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love
Girl, let my frequency just flow through your body
Get this party started, cause baby, babygirl
This is the music for love
Put me on repeat girl, let's go again and again
No matter AM or FM 
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love

[Verse 1]
Wow, we could play the music loud whenever nobody's around
Cause if the sound, it starts to wake up the neighbors 
We're gonna have to turn it down, down, down, down
I'm about to have a real eruption, there's gonna be no interruption
Baby come push my buttons, I'll show you all my functions
Press play and let me start, fast forward to your favorite part
After we done, hit rewind and we'll go back to the top

[Chorus]
Girl turn me up and let me come through your speakers
Blow the sound out of between us
Cause babygirl this is the music for love
Shawty don't be scared, just let the bass line hit you
Boom boom, all up in your system
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love
Girl, let my frequency just flow through your body
Get this party started, cause baby, babygirl
This is the music for love
Put me on repeat girl, let's go again and again
No matter AM or FM 
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love

[Verse 2]
Girl right about now
I'll keep you moving your body
I'll be the DJ, that turns this private party out
I'll play your favorite song
(From my I-Tunes to your I-Pod girl) 
Girl I know how to put it on
(Computer Love)
And we'll do this all night long
And you can sing along
Just as long as you sing in my microphone
Oh, you ain't gotta worry about parental advisory
Cause girl we're grown
And the music we're making baby, we're making for love

[Chorus]
Girl turn me up and let me come through your speakers
Blow the sound out of between us
Cause babygirl this is the music for love
Shawty don't be scared, just let the bass line hit you
Boom boom, all up in your system
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love
Girl, let my frequency just flow through your body
Get this party started, cause baby, babygirl
This is the music for love
Put me on repeat girl, let's go again and again
No matter AM or FM 
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love

Boom boom, all up in your system
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love
Girl, let my frequency just flow through your body
Get this party started, cause baby, babygirl
This is the music for love
Put me on repeat girl, let's go again and again
No matter AM or FM 
Cause babygirl, this is the music for love
