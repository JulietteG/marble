Ain't nothing like
A pair of fresh all white air force ones.
And I said to my self. I got to have.

Got to have her like Nikes fresh out the box.

[Verse 1]
Everybody want to know her name
Its like she walked right out a dream
A fantasy unreal
Did God send me an angel?
She's like no one I ever seen
no one I ever met
Someone ill never forget.
Looking at her is good for my health.
She got me singing to myself.

[Chorus]
I see her
I want her
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I'm fining
Day dreaming
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I wont scuff her up. I'll lace her up right.
Treat her real good like a pair of fresh white hi top or low tops.
I got to have the white Nikes fresh out the box

[Bridge]
ay yay ay (ay yay ay)
ay yay ay (ay yay ay)
ay yay ay yay ay (ay yay ay yay ay)
ay yay ay yay ay (ay yay ay yay ay)

[Verse 2]
I don't want to waste time
trying to hook up wit a dyme
because I'm checking out a dollar
thats making me want to holla
shes like no one I ever seen
no one I ever met
Someone I'll never forget
Looking at her is good for my health
She got me singing to my self

[Chorus]
I see her
I want her
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I'm fining
Day dreaming
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I wont scuff her up. I'll lace her up right.
Treat her real good like a pair of fresh white hi top or low tops.
I got to have the white Nikes fresh out the box

[Verse 3]
I got to have the (Nikes fresh out the box)
Ain't nothing like seeing a new pair of kicks (Ain't nothing like seeing those jeans on her hips)
Ain't no feeling like it once you got em on (Ain't not feeling like it when her on the phone)
O when you (when your the first one to have em)
everybody want to know where did you get em.
(Next question is do they have my size)
No disrespect to my guys but all I know is

[Chorus]
I see her
I want her
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I'm fining
Day dreaming
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I wont scuff her up. I'll lace her up right.
Treat her real good like a pair of fresh white hi top or low tops.
I got to have the white Nikes fresh out the box

So the next time you see a girl that reminds you of pair of J's
And you want to get her attention this is what you got to say

[Bridge]
ay yay ay (ay yay ay)
ay yay ay (ay yay ay)
ay yay ay yay ay (ay yay ay yay ay)
ay yay ay yay ay (ay yay ay yay ay)

[Chorus]
Nikes fresh out the box
I see her
I want her
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I'm fining
Day dreaming
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I wont scuff her up. I'll lace her up right.
Treat her real good like a pair of fresh white hi top or low tops.
I got to have the Nikes fresh out the box---Lyrics submitted by Chatavia.
