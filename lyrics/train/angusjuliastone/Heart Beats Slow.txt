Well I hear you were (you were a lion)
About how brave you are
Well I hear you were (you were still trying)
Trying to get back to the start

And we wont let it into the kitchen
No we wont let it into the house
No we wont let it through the front door
'coz its burning our pretty little heart

I'm gonna miss you
Gonna miss you girl
And all of the things we should have done

You say I move so fast
That you can hardly see
You say I move so fast
How could you notice me?

But my heart beats slow [x4]

Well I wish you, wish you well
All the best
Well I wish you, I wish you well
All the best

But we wont let it into the kitchen
No we wont let it into the house
No we wont let it through the front door
'coz it's burning a pretty little hole

You said I move so fast
That you can hardly see
You say I move so fast
How could you be with me

But my heart beats slow [x8]---
