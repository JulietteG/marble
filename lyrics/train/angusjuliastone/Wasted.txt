I don't know just what I'll do
everytime you walk into the room
oh my head is spinning round
and I can't see clearfly right now

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted 
I'm so wasted on you

I don't know if i'll survive
in this magical land behind your eyes
and there's all these funny little man
all asking me to dance and sing

i'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you
I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you 

red and yellow
pink and green
purple and orange and blue
oh, oh all the colours I see my love, everytime I see you

I'm wasted
i'm so wasted on you
i'm wasted
i'm wasted on you
i'm wasted
i'm so wasted on you---Lyrics submitted by amy.
