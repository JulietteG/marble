So rest your head
you're all mine
and I stay awake
I won't go home
Let's go on holidays
to burn this town

she's my babylon

So rest your heart
you're all mine
cos if you walk away
I'll fall on down
and bleed red as blood
red as wine

she's my babylon

No I don't wont to see you gone.
No I don't want to be a year long.

So rest your head
you're mine
I can't stay awake
as far down
so I dreamed a dream 
that you walk round

she's my babylon

No I don't want to see you gone.
No I don't want to be here a year long
No I don't want to be here a year long
No I don't want to be here a year long---Lyrics submitted by amy.
