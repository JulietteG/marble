Pack up your things 
your work here is done
A slave to the beast
your mercy with time
oh, mercy with time

They brand you with the fire
and push you into the sun 
they want the free land to expire
they want everyone to be known
The worl's drinking from the cup
that no one wants to share
words from the king
that no one wants to hear

Don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want time to die
cos don't be running line 
and you want time to die

Trench me because of machines
kids trading roses for guns
The track marks under the sleeve
I can't talk I need to run
Life stole away the rain 
not knowing what to say
Mama won't you sing
It's like your cut by the blade

Cos don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want time to die 

Don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want time to die
don't be running line
and you want itme to die---Lyrics submitted by amy.
