Im running out of patience, but then you say, its over baby, so go on, we both need you to say this to us, you are, the only one for me.

Every night you stay with her.
I pretend it doesnt hurt cause the hardest part of this is wondering when all this is.
Its like its getting worse; shell always have had you first.
You know the hardest part of this is wanting the two of us to begin.

Every single night I wait for you, every single day you say its through, you promised me the night at 2 am that its happening.
Youre gonna tell her what she needs to hear.
You gotta be the one to make it clear you promised me that night at 2 am that its happening.
That its happening. That its happening. That its happening.

Im so anxious that Im shaken, were so close to being together, boy I, have almost giving up on this before, but its worth it, if it is forever.

Every night you stay with her.
I pretend it doesnt hurt cause the hardest part of this is wondering when all this is.
Its like its getting worse; shell always have had you first.
You know the hardest part of this is wanting the two of us to begin.

Every single night I wait for you, every single day you say its through, you promised me the night at 2 am that its happening.
Youre gonna tell her what she needs to hear.
You gotta be the one to make it clear you promised me that night at 2 am that its happening.
That its happening. That its happening. That its happening.

Like winter turns to summer, like night turns into day, been missing you like the dessert needs the rain, the hardest part of this is wanting, the two of us to begin.

Every single night I wait for you, every single day you say its through, you promised me the night at 2 am that its happening.
Youre gonna tell her what she needs to hear.
You gotta be the one to make it clear you promised me that night at 2 am that its happening.
That its happening. That its happening. That its happening.

You gonna make it happen baby---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
