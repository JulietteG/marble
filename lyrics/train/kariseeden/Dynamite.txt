I know I shouldn't show my face tonight
I gotta give you time just to say goodbye
To let go, let it go
You're dancing with her but we're eye to eye
Why can't I be on the other side
But I know, my day will come

So can you tell me why
If the fuse is lit
And the sparks are alive
Why you're holding back? 
Holding back?

What's it gonna take, take, take
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
Just explode into my life like dynamite
What's it gonna take, take, take
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
Just explode into my life like dynamite
Like dynamite

It's all that you say really how I feel
Am I just another heart you can steal?
If a soul is not enough

So can you tell me why
If the fuse is lit
And the sparks are alive
Why you're holding back? 
Holding back?

What's it gonna take, take, take
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
Just explode into my life like dynamite
What's it gonna take, take, take
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
Just explode into my life like dynamite
Like dynamite

I belong just to you
For all this time
If I'm no good
Why am I even trying anymore?
I'm not gonna be the fool no more

What's it gonna take, take, take
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
Just explode into my life like dynamite
What's it gonna take, take, take
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait
Just explode into my life like dynamite
Like dynamite---
