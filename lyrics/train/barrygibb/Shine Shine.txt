I've never been sorry for the way I was raised
The enemy fewer
And the love that I made was a symbol of the times
A celebration of the wine
I made a memory in you
I'll still be the reader of the letters you write
I'll never be lonely for the rest of my life
There's a corner in my heart
We can never be apart
No, we can never be apart

No tomorrow 
You be gone tomorrow
We can dance the night away
I can bestow to you all my love on your wedding day

Shine shine
For how much longer you'll be mine
There'll be no vows to be broken 
You mean the world to me
Someone else that we both call love in your eyes
I believe together you'll shine

I was born to be with you on the day you were born 
A beautiful angel with her face in the sun 
She was searching for the moon in every sparkle in the spoon
You haven't changed
I'll still be the face in everybody you see
A light in the night if you need me to be
In every corner of the world 
If any smile becomes a tear I will shelter you from the rain 

No tomorrow
You be gone tomorrow
We can dance the night away
I can bestow to you all my love on your wedding day

Shine shine
For how much longer you'll be mine
There'll be no vows to be broken 
You mean the world to me
Someone else that we both call love in your eyes
I believe together you'll shine

And I - I love you
There's no one else I place above you
Life is a road before you
And while he can show the way for you 
My darling I will pray for you

Shine shine
For how much longer you'll be mine
There'll be no vows to be broken 
You mean the world to me
Someone else that we both call love in your eyes
I believe together you'll shine---Lyrics submitted by Joaquin Azanza.
