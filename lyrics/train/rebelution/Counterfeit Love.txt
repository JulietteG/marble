Well alright

Speaking my mind
Speaking my mind

Your a counterfeit love 
Stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
Your a counterfeit lover 
Say you love me, but I don't trust you no

I never thought it would end this way
Whatever happened to my dream girl
Whatever happened to your baby
I always say there's a way
But this time you changed it to my money
And you took my time
You took my heart and my soul my whole life

You're a counterfeit love 
Stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover 
You say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love 
Stay back from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover 
You say you love me, but I don't trust you no

When I was a child I would dream
I dream for the day when I had money
I'd buy my baby all these little precious things just for me
But when dreams they become reality
She took me for my money
Took me for my time
Took me for my heart and my soul my whole life
I never thought I'd say it I can't live a lie
Well I was wrong and now I got to say goodbye

You're a counterfeit love 
Stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover 
You say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love 
Stay back from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover 
You say you love me, but I don't trust you no

Yeah well alright
Speaking my mind
Speaking my mind

You're a counterfeit love 
speaking my mind
You're a counterfeit lover 
Speaking my mind
You're a counterfeit love 
Stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover 
You say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love... ---
