We're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feelin alright, yeah yeah yeah

Oh it's about that time for us to look around and meet somebody new
Well let's all welcome in familiar faces, perhaps somebody who
Has a conflict in their life, oh alright
Tell them you're sorry but there's ways to change the wrong to right

See we can sit in a distant haze and watch rain clouds
Pour thoughts of greatness to help our troubles sail real far away
Oh yeah

Well it's a struggle, every day we're stressin
But what's a life without dedication
I'm, I'm gonna pick up that soul's intention to soak in music relaxation

Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah yeah yeah

In a moment I'll be on my way to better days, while life is changing
And even though I've had my share of pain
I've been sympathizing and realizing
I've got a feeling we could be a better friend
Simply complementing every now and then
Cause in the morning I wake up and miss the night before
Cause I love the music more and more

Yeah we can sit in a distant haze and watch rain clouds
Pour thoughts of greatness to help our troubles sail real far away
Oh yeah

Well it's a struggle, every day we're stressing
What's a life without dedication
I'm, I'm trying to pick up that soul's intention to soak in music relaxation

Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by sadie.
