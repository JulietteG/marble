Try and test me now, watch out
Listen you ain't a thing to me, You ain't exactly yourself
Come here and get shut down, listen
I ain't a fool to you, to me, to anyone else
She says "Hi, sleep with me tonight. I wont say a thing. I can even tell a lie"
Lady in White, resist me your right
I'm in love with you, you're the spark in my life, yeah
So treat me like your own kind
I been tryin' to fight my mind against whats real
And I can see the road sign
Telling me to stop, I'm searchin' through the hills yeah
Whats that? You say I'm a real chump losin' it
Well that's ok cuz I know you're wrong
Either way Ill be ten times better then
Wave your hands say Goodbye, So long

Watch who you're talkin' to
Watch who you're talkin' to
Watch who you're talkin' to
Watch who you're talkin' to

Surprise! Give me a kiss and hold me tight
Just like old times, just a couple lines
My, well you and I are so alike
Tingle in the body, sparkle in the eye
"I may not be a saint but I'm sexy"
"Ill put you in a daze cuz I'm pretty"
And I should see the sign, but you never let me
Line after line, sometimes too many
So who am I to blame?
I point the finger at a lady I cant tame
Shes got me handcuffed, locked up and chained
And addiction is the name of the game, woah

Ill try to walk away like I know I should
Ill try to slip away like I know I should
Ill try to walk aw-aaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy
Like I know I should ---
