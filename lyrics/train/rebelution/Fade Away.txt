When all of this is said and done
You will be alone
Cuz I know this wont last forever
Heres a toast to your unknown
Mother of us all
You and I are one together

I know this wont last forever
But I wish this would last forever

Waking up to your eye
I dont have an answer
And so I think I know you better
Waking up to your eye
And multi-colored sunsets
Youre the one who gives me shelter

I know this wont last forever
But I wish this would last forever

Keeping it calm
Until we all fade away and move on
Keeping it calm
Until we all fade away you live on ---
