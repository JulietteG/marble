So where are you going?
Not asking where you have been,
I see this reason is growing,
I'm asking you to give in
So this is what you call home?
Is this what you think you've done right?
So is this what you call love?
My Savior's in sight.
I will wait for you to understand,
I will take your hand,
My God is ever true

Too many times I have gone astray
(Astray)
Too many days have passed away
(Away)

You never asked me to
Repay the price you paid
(You'll see the person you're supposed to be)

So you say it's okay, you've called my name,
(He lived and died for all and everything)

Love is, in store,
This is an open door[x2]

Gut the lights out,
Down out and on the floor,
This love is just like an open door,
He is waiting right here,
This is your chance to step inside
He is right here waiting,
Lose your lifetime debating.
What you thought was right,
Has been wrong all this time.
This is a gift for you,
Unwrap your life.---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
