I'm alone in a crowded room
Conversations that I'll never remember
Trapped in a reality
That shouldn't be, that shouldn't be

Show me the way allow me to see cause my heart is broken
Be my escape allow me to hear with a word unspoken
Oh I am separated from the one I was made to love

I'm pathetic and lost
They are so separating
I am the one who had control
You are upon me

This darkness closing in
Is just beginning
This darkness closing in
Is just beginning

Show me the way allow me see cause my heart is broken
Be my escape allow me to hear with a word unspoken
Oh let me feel this love again let me feel this love again
Oh I am separated from the one I was made to love

What is this life void of love
It's not a life at all
What is this life void of love
Can you feel your heart as it hits the ground
Can you feel your heart as it hits the ground

This darkness closing in, is just beginning
This darkness closing in, is never going to end

How do you expect me to trust you when everything you say is a lie
I'm sticking up for my friends I can count on
This is loyalty this is a family
This is a family

This is a family---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
