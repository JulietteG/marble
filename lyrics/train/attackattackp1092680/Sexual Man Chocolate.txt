I'm searching for the meaning
You said you'd be my everything
I guess your words mean nothing
So go and prove your loyalty

Go ahead, and bury it deep down inside
Cage that longing in your heart
Hold that thought just for a moment
Let your heart feel numb

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you said you'd be my everything

So go and prove your loyalty

This is what you want
You'll never take this
This is what you'll get, the seperation
This is who I am, you'll never change me, 
Loyalty

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you said you'd be my everything

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you said you'd be my everything

So go and prove your loyalty

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you said you'd be my everything

So go and prove your loyalty---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
