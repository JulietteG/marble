I've given all that I have to give,
taking all of the lives that I have.
Will this be my last?
(theres no end in sight)
when will all of my brothers know,

I'll fight this war alone,
if that's what it takes to get home to you.
I'll fight this war alone.

I've lost control again
and the night is closing in.

How do I keep my feet on the floor,
When I'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
Cause I have you, to come home to.

Take a step back and finally think for yourself,
you're living a life full of lying.
I'm over this process
of letting my life be lived by your desire.

I'll fight this war alone,
if thats what it takes to come home to you.
I'll fight this war alone

I've lost control again
and the night is closing in.
I've gotta be whole within
so my life is mine again.

How do i keep my feet on the floor,
when i'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
'cause I have you, to come home to.
('cause I have you, to come home to.)
('cause I have you, to come home to.)

I'm never gonna give up hope.
I'm never gonna give up hope.
I'm never gonna give up hope.
I'm never gonna give up
until I'm dead.

and if you wan't me to you'll have to take my life.

i'll fight this war alone
i'll fight this war alone
i'll fight this war alone
i'll fight this war alone---Lyrics submitted by Kourtnie McCoy.
