Come with me 
Into the trees 
We'll lay on the grass 
And let the hours pass 

Take my hand 
Come back to the land 
Let's get away 
Just for one day

Let me see you 
Stripped

Metropolis 
Has nothing on this 
You're breathing in fumes 
I taste when we kiss

Take my hand 
Come back to the land 
Where everything's ours 
For a few hours

Let me see you 
Stripped

Let me hear you 
Make decisions 
Without your television 
Let me hear you speaking 
Just for me

Let me see you 
Stripped

Let me hear you 
Make decisions 
Without your television 
Let me hear you speaking 
Just for me

Let me see you 
Stripped---Lyrics submitted by giorgi.
