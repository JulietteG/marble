Never have I heard 
A more disturbing word
Holdin' out for long
I never felt so quite disturbed.

I get up in the morning now, I don't know
Waiting for the evening now, I don't know
Been lookin' for whats comin' now, I don't know
Would somebody please, help me.

Lookin' back at me
There's more than mystery
Letters and pages of 
Ancient history, yeah.

I get up in the morning now, I don't know
I've been waiting for the evening now, I don't know
I've been lookin' for whats comin' now, I don't know
Would somebody please, help me.

I don't know, help me. 
I don't know, I don't know, help me.

I don't know, help me. 
I don't know, I don't know, help me.

I don't know, help me. 
I don't know, I don't know, help me.---Lyrics submitted by Duckie.
