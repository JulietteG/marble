(It's) Time to wake up, every morning
when your summer is all gone
where on the run, born in two halves close as one
searching for another to love
yeah, but it's alright

Hear her screaming from above you
come back down now, by my side
where on the run, born in two halves close as one
searching for another to love
yeah, but it's alright
it's alright, it's alright. it's alright...---Lyrics submitted by Jack Boot.
