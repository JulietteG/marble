If I have no words 
its a road that winds 
Cause you to travel 
hard on the search 
you left to find 
Oh, its in my mind 

Carry by the surf 
You were washed
by the tide
I came upon you,
some might say,
in the nick of time
Oh, its in my mind 

Stop wasting time
It was all in my mind 
An oasis of fear 
It was just me in mind 
Gotta leave it behind 
It was all in my mind, 
in my mind 

I put it in a song
but the words they lie
The memories unravel
raising a heaping
bushel of shine
Oh, its in my mind

Stop wasting time
It was all in my mind
An oasis of fear
It was just me in mind
Got to leave it behind it
It was all in my mind,
in my mind

If I have no words 
its a road that winds 
Cause you to travel 
hard on the search 
you left to find 
Oh, its in my mind 

Stop wasting time
It was all in my mind 
An oasis of fear 
It was just me in mind 
Got to leave it behind 
It was all in my mind, 
in my mind---Lyrics submitted by Wirebender.
