Are you close to mine
Or could you blow my mind
Cause the heat is up
Already passed over time
Well I'm here to say
I got a better way
Nothing brings me down 
With how I feel today

Feelin' Good oh like you know I should
Got the pressure beat just like you know I would
Feelin' good oh like you know I should
Got the pressure beat
Yeah! 
Back and forth again 
With my rememberin'
Tell me who, or what, why, or where and when?
Comin' back this time
I gotta know the rhyme
And I feel the clear
Never gon' take what's mine

Feelin' Good oh like you know I should
Got the pressure beat just like you know I would
Feelin' good oh like you know I should
Got the pressure beat
Yeah! 

Back and forth again 
With my rememberin'
Well I guess loser go
Money will make amends
Well I'm here to say 
I got a better way
Nothing brings me down 
With how I feel today.

Feelin' Good oh like you know I should
Got the pressure beat just like you know I would
Feelin' good oh like you know I should
Got the pressure beat
Yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
