Well can't keep looking backwards
There's a lot for me to learn
And I'm looking forward overly
There's a lot for me to burn
There's a one outside the window
There's a lot for me to learn
Hear less than half of what I see
There's a lot for me to burn

All these small talk conversations
There's a lot for me to learn
And Facebook Invitations
There's a lot for me to burn
All the mystery is over
There's a lot for me to learn
But I keep coming up empty handed baby
There's a lot for me to burn

Well they come in greater numbers
There's a lot for me to learn
They enjoy the mediocre
There's a lot for me to burn
I try to stick my piece in the air
There's a lot for me to learn
But I keep coming up ended handed baby
There's a lot for me to burn

I came up to a shadowy figure
There's a lot for me to learn
Who tried to treat me to all the secrets
There's a lot for me to burn
Yeah, I said that way is not for me
There's a lot for me to learn
I guess I ll languish right here in obscurity
There's a lot for me to burn

Well can t keep looking backwards
There's a lot for me to learn
And I m looking forward overly
There's a lot for me to burn
There's a one outside the window
There's a lot for me to learn
I guess I ll languish right here in obscurity---Lyrics submitted by Blake.
