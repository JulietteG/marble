Feel like I'm stuck, somewhat in a rut.
If no one took care for me.
I been in this house, don't wanna leave out, and it's been several weeks.
The couples that I see, when I'm watching TV tells me what it used to be.
Friends say move on but dammit they're wrong.
And I just need you to know (Ohh woah)

I was on an ego trip but I've changed sense, never meant for you to get away.
I was listening to friends, baby never again, I never meant the things I said.
If you want me to apologize I will, anything you want me to.
I'll do it all for you.
I'm sorry cause I broke you down, made you cry.
Girl I apologize.

Started throwing out your things to erase the memories but it didn't work at all.
Seeing the pictures in the frames is driving me insane when I pick up the phone and call.
Girl you are a crucial part in my life and I just won't accept this goodbye.
I know i got one shot, but girl you mean a lot to me.
And I can't let you leave.

I was on an ego trip but I've changed sense, never meant for you to get away.
I was listening to friends, baby never again, I never meant the things I said.
If you want me to apologize I will, anything you want me to.
I'll do it all for you.
I'm sorry cause I broke you down, made you cry.
Girl I apologize.

Girl you mean the world to me (to me)
And you are like the air that I breathe (Oh yes you were)
And now that you're gone, I can move on.
And end it like this,
Hey girl I need you, right here by my side, just can't make out and I.

I was on an ego trip but I've changed sense, never meant for you to get away.
I was listening to friends, baby never again, I never meant the things I said.
If you want me to apologize I will, anything you want me to.
I'll do it all for you.
I'm sorry cause I broke you down, made you cry.
Girl I apologize.

If I could re-wind time, if I could take it baby back.
If I could take back the lies, turn back the (?) of the world.
If I could re-write time (Ohh, yeah)
If I could take back the lies (Ohh girl, I apologize)

(Baby I love you..)---Lyrics submitted by nathan.
