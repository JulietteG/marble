At the west end of town     
On the top of a hill
Stands a free enterprise
Known as Arrogant Mill

And there's not a bit of smoke
Coming out of the stacks
The pollution controllers
Are such maniacs

Chorus:  And the only sounds you hear 
Are the president's growls 
The vice president's shrieks
The executives' howls

The efficient machines are so quiet you can hear
The heartbeats of the workers, speeded up from fear
That a new "trade agreement" of somebody's greed
Will take away their jobs regardless of their need
]
Chorus

Now the Arrogant Mill may soon move to Singapore
They hired 15 PR men to say that at their door
The would rather pay workers 20 cents an hour
And in Singapore there is no high cost nuclear power

Chorus

There has never been a union in an Arrogant Mill
They fight unions to the death, you can bet your life they will
But the life they'll take is yours, they'll call you a food stamp bum
And give millions of dollars to Re publicans

Chorus

Still the Arrogant Mill has hung on until the end
With an uncertain future as they try to kill the past
But the building will stand in a future without end
When it's bankrupt there;ll be no cash to tear it down

Chorus

Final chorus   The only sound you hear once the old mill's  hut down
Is a hot toxic wind running all through the town
You must listen quite closely, the song may never end
As it fades out still saying, PR men, PR men---Lyrics submitted by wells eddleman.
