mmm yeaahh yeaeaa yeaaa

I was born off an old dirt road 40 acre farm no highway no interstate
& I drive an old rusted out Chevrolet, the boys all rubber neck while their out makin' hay.

Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine, soakin' up the way of life I was raised in, runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I cant help it I-I'm a wildflower.

oooo yeahh oooo yeahhh

Theres a little cotton dress hangin' in my sisters closet, I think I'm gonna borrow it, and wear it this weekend. Painted my toes, bought some cherry lip gloss. No rose, No daisy, can touch what I got

yeaah

I'm a wildflower, growin in the sunshine, soakin' up the way of life I was raised in, runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I cant help it. I-I'm a wildflower.

oooo yeaah oooo yeahh


I'm just a girl that needs a little sun, a little rain, an open field to play

Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine soakin' up the way of life I was raised in, runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I can't help it. I-I'm a wildflower.

I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine soakin' up the way of life I was raised in, runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I can't help it. I-I'm a wildflower.

oooo yeah oooo yeahh I-I'm a wildflower

oooo yeah oooo yeah I'm a wildflower

yeaahh yeaeaa yeaaa I'm a wildflower---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
