Any place, any time
You could be mine
Any night, any day
Anything we say (Anything we say)

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
We can just get away 

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
If they all look away

Any place, any time 
Anything we like 
Any ties, any collars 
Anything we want (anything we want)

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
We can just get away 

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
If they all look away (only if they look away)


So lets look at this handout 
not at this one
So lets look at this handout 
not of what weve done
So lets look at this handout 
not at this one
so lets look at this handout
not of this world

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
We can just get away

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
If they all look away (only if they look away)



You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
We can just get away (only if they look away)

You can get away with that 
I can get away with this 
If they all look away (only if they look away)---Lyrics submitted by Joey Weinberg.
