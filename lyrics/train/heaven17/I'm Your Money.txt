Chemical love bank within your grasp
Social partners without a past
Buy the pleasure commodity
Invest in personal industry

I'm your money (x4)

Order now our emotional life
I'm offering you the post of wife
Plus the overnight treasury
It'll work for you if it works for me

She's the voice that'll make you stop
First encounter with the man at the top
Pay with personal credit slip
Express American censorship

I'm your money (x4)

Buy that
Sign here

Wine and dine now that you're the boss
There's no hotel to break your loss
Admit relationship unresolved
Chemical love bank has been dissolved

I'm your money (x4)
