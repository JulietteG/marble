I can see only rare champagne
Castles built in ancient Spain
Its been a dream thats not in vain
Everytime I think of you

I can hear a rhapsody
Plaintive haunting melody
As a nightingale sets free
Everytime I think of you

Finding you was such a good thing
For to me youre a blessing
Never thought Id be singing
In a world of dreams come true

I can feel your sweet caresses
Close my eyes in happiness
Its the thrill of love, I guess
Everytime I think of you

Everytime I think of you---Lyrics submitted by Lyana Hernandez.
