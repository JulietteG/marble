Male voice:

The city shimmers above me in a thousand points of light
and above it the stars
countless in number
some kind of "illion" maybe...

Gillian Anderson:

Atom by atom
Molecular beings
Transport me away
To the place of my dreams

A point in space
Where time is still
Colliding worlds
In limbo until...

Extremis

A melding of minds
A cerebral mesh
A union of liquid
And virtual... flesh

Automaton love
Your caress is pneumatic
I'm a slave to your touch
My response automatic

The circuits burn out
And the paradigm shift
Dissolution
My emotions drift

Clarity fades,
And my faculties haze
Deep down in t*****, (I can't quite get this word. She seems to say something like "traums" (!!!???). I'm certain the first letter of this word is a "t".)
Hound me for days.

Extremis

Your reasons are noble
A quintessence of lust
In the arms of angels
My dreams turn to dust dust dust dust...
Extremis.

I don't want to hear about the future
I want to see it
I want to feel it
I want to taste it

Male Voice:

There is a tendency to believe that the darkness automatically brings about fear in in one.
But I have already got a piece of the darkness. Trouble begins in the light, if you come around here.

Gillian Anderson:
