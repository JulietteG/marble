Its anyone there?
Play! 

Who survives?
Somebody knew?
Anyone else that knew. 
On a lonely night, 
Once the burning light...

Chorus: 
And though I know, since youve awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you!
Should go on, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you!
And though I know, since youve awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you!
Should go on, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you!
Play! 

I dont know much about your life beyond these warm walls.
The fleeting sense of love within the[se god for saken ... (hearts / homes? i'm not sure about this)]
I dont hear it in his voice, in every call 
Lets go much flat, a hundred years had something lift the wall
Chorus: (x2)
Im going home since youve awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you!
Should go on, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you!
Im going home since youve awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you!
Should go on, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you!
Play!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
