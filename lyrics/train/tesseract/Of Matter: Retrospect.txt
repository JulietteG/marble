Burning bridges as I cower beneath
Trying to salvage the debris
My devotion tied around your waist lest you fall
no one seems to sense the strain
No one seems to know

I don't begin to proclaim that I know
I can't continue down this road

Dwelling on what has come to pass
no force alive will bring it back
I would know
I can feel the pressure getting steeper with every life lost
You hope that I won't see the light of day in time to come
With no conviction founded
Just judgement contorted based on lust
Give me strength
Your assumption brings to a conclusion of no consequence
and I refuse to play into your hands for your appeal

Inadequate, Inadequate
I know
I know
I know
I know
I've hoped
I've hoped
you'll see me---Lyrics submitted by Kerr Mclellan.
