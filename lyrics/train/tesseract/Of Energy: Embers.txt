[feat. Christopher Barretto]

 I think I've seen a million sights
 And then I see that I'm still a child
 How could I have been so blind to firmly believe there is no choice
 I'm so aware that you are just as equally cauterized as I
 Is this for me?
 Another flame to tarnish my every chance

 Wait inside the fire---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
