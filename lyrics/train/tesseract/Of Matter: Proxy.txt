I'm a surrogate
 I'm our type of land in civil rest
 I'm your excuse to know
 For our superior
 I will undertake
 I will overcome...

 Imperfection you will find
 They're close to us
 They're after us
 They're right here

 This endeavor is not mine
 It's a deadly trip
 The damage at our feet

 I'm stronger than I was before
 No, sir-ee, I push these walls
 Like I found you holding on

 Direction by the open door
 All the chances I ignore
 Like I stand still holding on...

 The day is done
 Nothing left to say
 Pressing hand in hands
 Wishing I had known my place
 To take a stand
 The year under the fall
 That's a reprimand
 I'm here to help you through...

 Is there for like it seems
 Living in this secret through a dream
 It's dark and I can't see
 Gather broken shards of self-esteem..---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
