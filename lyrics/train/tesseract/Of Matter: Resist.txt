Turn back time
 Reason why
 Break neck speed
 History

 Waiting (waiting)
 Waning (waning)
 Exasperating
 Unstrung
 Tethered
 Hoping forever

 No! I tried to settle bets with my own soul
 Bless my lips for the first time before you don't
 Gripping to the last touch of your hand I grow to loathe
 Hope that you remember just how far I'll go
 I'll spend the rest of my life wishing I'm enough

 Resist.
 Resist.
 Resist.

 Resist.
 Resist.
 Resist.---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
