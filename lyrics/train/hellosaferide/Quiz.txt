You look nice alright, 
and i like the way you nod after everything i say
Like it actually means something to you

And i like your record collection Thompson Yence with a hint of Ricky Lee
and you cleaned up the bathroom, made a really nice soup
But a bit to much Sci-Fi in your shelf of DVDs

But there are things you need to know about me,
I am weak right now, so weak right now, I need proof or a beer to open this heart 
So i prepared a quiz for you...

Would you freak out if i said i liked you, do you walk the line?
Is your IQ higher than your neighbors, and is it very much higher than mine?
Can you sleep when i grind my teeth, do you look away if i slop when i eat?
Will let you be myself, can you at all times wear socks because im still scared of feet?

Chorus-
and if i'd fall, would you pick me up
and if i'd fall, would you pick me up

Do you talk in the middle of Seinfeld, do you read more than two books a month?
Do you get raceist and sexiest when you've had a few, Is it fine if i make more money than you?
Have you slept with any people i work with, is there anyone you'de rather wish i'd be?
Do you still keep pictures of old girlfriends, are they prettier than me?

Chorus-
and if i'd fall, would you pick me up
and if i'd fall, would you pick me up
and if i'd fall, would you pick me up
and if i'd fall, would you pick me up---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany Taylor.
