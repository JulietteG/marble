Tempting lies
With bloodshot eyes
It's not who I wanted to be
It's not who I wanted to be
Buried deep in a song I keep
Are words that I needed to say
But words never come out right
We believe our hearts are pleased
Well, I don't feel good enough
I don't feel good enough

We learn along the way
(That life has meaning)
Inside we feel the same
(Still we lack the will to change)
All this time we know what's right
And we can make it out alive
If we learn from the night

Say goodnight
With hurt inside
I guess I had something to prove
But your heart would not move
Terrified of the fear we hide
And words that we needed to say
But words never come out right
We hope at best our hearts will rest
Well, that's not good enough
That's not good enough

We learn along the way
(That life has meaning)
Inside we feel the same
(Still we lack the will to change)
All this time we know what's right
And we can make it out alive
If we learn from the night

I see now that you won't give up
(You never)
Close your eyes 'cause we mean too much

We learn along the way
(That life has meaning)
Inside we feel the same
(Still we lack the will to change)
All this time we know what's right
And we can make it out alive
If we learn from the night---Lyrics submitted by Clay S.
