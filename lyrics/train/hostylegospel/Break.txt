Toss your hands up to the ceiling, 
Lord we need your healing, 
theres stars here in this building, 
Jesus Christ here can you feel it,
I know its bout to be on, 
breaking through the chains, and bowing to the throne, 
focus on the one who shatter his bone, 
Jesus Christ who carry me home, 
Im gone, torn flesh, leaking blood, 
prince of peace, no name above, 
Jesus Christ, King of King, 
the one who conquered our sins with love,
he paid the price, remove my strife, 
he battle Satan, while saving lives, 
testify, glorify, he die, now hes alive,
he rose up on that weekend,
preacher keep preachin, 
plant a seed and started reapin, 
the Holy Ghost teachin, 
I got to clear my throat, 
the seven of us we had to learn like most, 
we battling waves and trying to guide this boat, 
and winning the race and now its time to coast, far,
its hard man, we beating this demons regardless, 
hanging on Jesus like Tarzan, 
now Satan about to be pardon, 
die hard man, remember Satan you started it, 
your soul is bout to be change man, 
this sword about to start carving. 


I think its time that we break free
In Jesus name we can break free
We breakin free on the count of 3
1-2-3
Break 4x
In Jesus name we can break free
Break 4x
In Jesus name we can break free



I'm throwing away my sinful ways and I'm chasing after this Christ,
Im resurrected my flesh is dead and I'm chasing after this life,
I ain't the same no mind games, I'm busting through I'm lineman,
I'm offense when I'm rhyming, so I'm eating demons I'm primate,
I'm deion I'm Optimus, prime time, shine time,
Transform won't conform, can't afford to be luke warm,
When you lift the name of Jesus, the reason the season,
The bleeding, believe when we see any legion,
We spazzing on em, cyclone praise we tazzing on em,
Expose them fools like facebook pics we tagging on em, spit hot fire dragon on em,
Take that cross and drag it on em, they grabbing on me I smashing on em,
Holy Ghost I catch it on em, that double edge and I'm slashing on em,
Evil spirits I'm snatching on em, get out or get ripped out,
Trying to fight in this school of life, but this life is Christ you get kicked out,
Cause you ain't saved, can't win, no shaking, I hate sin,
Pop locking, windmilling, no dancing I'm just breaking.



I think its time that we break free
In Jesus name we can break free
We breakin free on the count of 3

Break 4x
In Jesus name we can break free
Break 4x
In Jesus name we can break free



Fightin all of these demons,
In Christ name I defeat em,
Strongholds got no hold on me,
No chains Im talkin bout freedom,
Circumstances dont matter anointed 
By the Holy Ghost the yoke shatter,
Scatter demons like Im blastin a cap in the air
Like Im tryna hit a satellite,
Soul black, blood red, came out, snow white,
This aint a movie dont try to move me,
Satan loosin, we runnin through him,
Praise a weapon and yup im shootin,
Incite a riot and yup we looting,
Broken arms, broken teeth,
Flexin devils like Zangief,
We King Kong and yall spider monkeys,
He King of King and still ride a donkey,
Blood soaked flesh torn,
No clothes crown of thorns,
3 nails feet and palms one man,
Son of God,
Go hard we cant stop,
DHBs in tank tops,
Arms out ready to aim,
No more fear, no more shame,
No more tears and no more pain,
No more storms, no more rain,
No more play and no more games,
No more shackles and no more chains.



I think its time that we break free
In Jesus name we can break free
We breakin free on the count of 3
1-2-3
Break 4x
In Jesus name we can break free
Break 4x
In Jesus name we can break free---Lyrics submitted by Allen.
