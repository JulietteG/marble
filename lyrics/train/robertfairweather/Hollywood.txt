Im talking bout Hollywould
They told me she wouldnt
But I knew she would
They told me she couldnt
But I knew she could
Im talkin bout Hollywould
they told me she shoudnt
But I knew she should
 Yes I liked it   Yes I liked it  In hollywould

Im gonna pack my suitcase
Im gonna make it uptown
Meet with my girl Hollywould
Were gonna have a good time
Oh Hollywould    Your so divine
I love it Yes I Love it  In Holly would

solo
repeat  verse chorus
