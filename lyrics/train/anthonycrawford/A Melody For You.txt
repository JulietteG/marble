Standing by your window,
listening to the sounds of the city below;
watching raindrops fall on rooftops
and the moon's looking like it's a stone's throw away

And if I were a poet,
then my words would be revealing
all I'm feeling for you tonight

But if my thoughts could be played just like notes,
then I'd play you a melody.
I'd play you a melody
play you a melody so fine
to wish you love all the time

And the hours we've spent together
made us feel so much closer than I've ever felt before

And the times that we just lay silent
feeling so good to be in each other's company

And if I were an artist,
then I'd sketch you in colors
how I long to show you how I care

But if my thoughts could be played just like notes,
then I'd play you a melody.
I'd play you a melody
play you a melody so fine
to wish you love all the time

Yes, if I were an artist
then I'd sketch you in colors
how I long to show you how I care

But if my thoughts could be played just like notes,
then I'd play you a melody
I'd play you a melody
play you a melody so fine to wish you love all the time---Lyrics submitted by franc flores.
