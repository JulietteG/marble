My day one rule
Is keeping my cool
Even if I'm broken up
If you blow my high
You won't see me cry
Gotta whistle while you work it
That's why you gotta
Never let dem see you down
See you down
Whoa o whoa
Yeah
Gotta smile while you're hurting
And whistle while you work it

Whistle while you work it
Gotta smile while you're hurting
Just whistle while you work it

Rain rain
Go away
I can feel a cloud hangin' over me
Over me
Same shit different day
Do they get a kick outta pushin me
Pushin me

Got lost in my head
Then my brother said
Take a breath, don't you worry child
Cuz ya know where ya from
So keep moving on
And go throw on a Chelsea smile

Brush brush
Brush it off
I will never let this shit weigh me down
Weigh me down
Don't cry
Dry your eyes
Keep your chin up
And leave it all behind
All behind

Tune out of your darker side
Regret
Revenge
Will eat you up inside
Head up
Work that dignity
Let it bounce
Let it fly
And make them history

If you put in work
Whistle while you work it---
