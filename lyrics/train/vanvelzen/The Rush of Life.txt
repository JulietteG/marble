It's like thunder, lighting up my skies
Just like sugar, keeps my spirits high
They're saying slow down, watch your step now
Don't you stumble, don't you fall,
But it's useless, it's the only way I know

I need the rush (rush, rush, rush, rush)
I need the push (push, push, push, push)
I need the rush, you know I just can't get enough of it
I need the rush (rush, rush, rush, rush)
I need the push (push, push, push), and move on
I need the rush, you know I just can't get enough of it

I need the rush of life, I need the rush of life,
I need the rush and I can't get enough of it, no

It moves the body, it fires up the brain
It lifts me up as I feel it running through my veins
So I can't slow down, watch my step now
I won't stumble, I won't fall,
I can't help it, it's the only way I know

I need the rush (rush, rush, rush, rush)
I need the push (push, push, push, push)
I need the rush, you know I just can't get enough of it

I need the rush of life, I need the rush of life
I need the rush and I can't get enough of it, no
I need the rush of life, I need the rush of life
I need the rush and I can't get enough of it

It's not that I'm in a hurry, it's not that I'm missing out
It's not that I never worry, I'm in the here and now
I need to keep pushing forward, I need to feel lows and heights
And I can go on forever, I just enjoy the ride

I need the rush of life, I need the rush of life
I need the rush and I can't get enough of it
I just enjoy the ride, ride
I just enjoy the ride, ride, yeah

I need the rush of life, I need the rush of life
I need the rush and I can't get enough of it, can't get enough
I need the rush of life, I need the rush of life
I need the rush and I can't get enough of it---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
