You wont find him drinking at the table
Rolling dice and staying out til three
You wont ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, youll find him next to me

You wont find him tryna chase the devil
For money, fame, for power, out of greed
You wont ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, youll find him next to me

Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
You will find him, youll find him next to me

When the moneys spent and all my friends have vanished
And I cant seem to find no help or love for free
I know theres no need for me to panic
Cause Ill find him, Ill find him next to me

When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, Ill find him next to me

Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
I will find him, Ill find him next to me

When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When weve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, youll find him next to me

Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
You will find him, youll find him next to me

Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
Next to me  ooh hooo
You will find him, youll find him next to me ---
