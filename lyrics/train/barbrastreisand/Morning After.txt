The sky is black
The ground is red
The streets of hate
Are charred and dead
The war stand out
Against the sky
And crowds appear
To wonder why
The morning after
We ask for right questions
The morning after
We make the suggestions
We've gotta make changes
When I'm going to wait
But the morning after is too late
The shell that's left
is still a cage
The flames have not
consumed the rage
And men who souls are
trapped and slumped
Will wait until the
next time comes
The morning after
We ask for right questions
The morning after
We make the suggestions
We gotta make changes
When I'm going to wait
But the morning after
Is too late...---Lyrics submitted by theresa.
