At least one moment everyday
I hear the echo of your voice
And though it's only in my mind,it stays with me
I have no choice

I reached for you as if you're here
Your tender touch, your warm embrace
And though it's been so many years
I still can see your face

We're all just prisoners of time
The days go rushing by
With memories we've locked away
There may not been much I regret
But there were things we couldn't say
Maybe the ending came too soon
You are the one I can't replace
And though it's been so many years
I still can see face

Somehow we knew another love will find us
We'd carry on ,leave yesterday behind us
Sometimes I find, the quiet nights
I close my eyes and realize
I've never let you go.

And if by chance we meet again
We meet again
A sudden crazy twist of fate
A street where we have never been
And with the hours getting late
You're running to my open arms
Like all the years have been erased
And every shadow of the past
I still can see your face
And every shadow of the past
I still can still your face---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
