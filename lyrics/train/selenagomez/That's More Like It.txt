When, I, wanted you
You would not reciprocate
When, I, needed you
You would always show up late

But thing's have changed
And I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating
Out of my hand

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it X2

Yeah that's more like it X2
I see where and when it happens 
That's more like it X4

When, my, birthday came
You would not remember it
When, I, talked to you
You were never listening

But tables turn
And it's great to be on top
Got you great to appreciate
The good that you've got

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it X2

Yeah that's more like it X2
I see where and when it happens 
That's more like it X4

I like chocolate 
And I like daises
Maybe you better write this down

I love cashmere
And I want diamonds
I'm ready for my massage right now
Oh right now

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it X2

Yeah that's more like it X2
I see where and when it happens 
That's more like it X4---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
