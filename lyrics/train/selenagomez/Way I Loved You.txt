Everythings cool, yeah
Its all gonna be okay, yeah
And I know,
Maybe Ill leave and
laugh about it someday

But not today, no
Cause I dont feel so good
Im tangled up inside
My heart is on my sleeve
Tomorrow is a mystery to me

(Chorus)
And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything Ive waited for,
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
with someone new
It could never be the way I loved you

Letting you go is
making me feel so cold, yeah
And Ive been trying to make
believe it doesnt hurt

But that makes it worse, yeah
See, Im a wreck inside
My toung is tied and my
whole body feels so weak
The future may be all I really need

And it might be wonderful, yeah
It might be magical, uh oh
It might be everything Ive waited for,
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
with someone new
It could never be the way I loved you

Like a first love,
the one and only true love
wasnt directly all over my taste, yeah
I loved you like you loved me (oh)
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced

And it was be wonderful,
It was magical,
It was everything Ive waited for,
A miracle
And if I should ever fall in love again
with someone new
Oh, It could never be the way
No, It will never be the way
I loved you---
