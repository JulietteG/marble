It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

I'm a make you bend your back
Oh my God this beat is crack
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

I'm a bring the party back
We gon blow the thermostate
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat, beat, beat, beat...

Automatic, dance-natic, I can get enough
I can get enough, I can get enough, of that beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face
Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face ---
