ooo-ooo-ooo
Can u feel me when i think about you
with every breath i take
Every minute no matter what i do
My world is a empty place
Like ive been wondering the dessert for a thousand days
Dont no if its a mirage but i always see your face-e
Baby

Im missing you so much cant help it im in love
A day without u is like a year without rain
I need you by my side dont no how ill survive
A day without is like a year withut rain------
(oh) wooooooah

The star are burning i hear you voice in my mind
Cant you here me calling
My heart is yerning like the ocean running dry
Cacth me im falling
Its like the ground crumbling underneath my feet
( won t you sae me )
Theres going to be a morson when you get back to me
(ohhhhhhhh baby)

Im missing you so much cant help it im in love
A day with u out is like a year without rain
I need you by my side dont no how ill survive
A day without u is like a year without rain------
(oh ) woooooooah

So let this drought come to an end
and make this desert flower again
Im so glad you found me 
Stick around me baby baby baby
oh
Its a world with wonder with you in my life
so hurry baby dont worst my time
But i need you here i cant explain
but a day without you
is like a year without rain-------
oh


Im missing you so much cant help it im in love
A day without u is like a year without rain
I need you by my side dont no how ill survive
A day without u is like a year without rain
(oh) wooooooah

uhhhhhhh
