If time could tune in today and we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back what would we want to change? but nows the time to take a chance
Cmon, we got to make a stand
What if we gotta lose the choices in our hands
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to

Live like theres no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like its all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and itll never die.
So never let this life pass us by.
Live like theres no tomorrow.

It never was a night at day and then the week will fade away
Let it be. nothing less. and let the dreams remain.
Take a leap and fade and hope you fly, feel what its like to be alive
Give it all, what weve got and lay it all on the line
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to

Live like theres no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like its all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and itll never die.
So never let this life pass us by.
Live like theres no tomorrow.

Will you be by my side? Well do this together.
Just you and Me. Nothing is impossible. Nothing is impossible!

Live like theres no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like its all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and itll never die.
So never let this musicjuzz.blogspot.com life pass us by
Live like theres no tomorrow.

Live like theres no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like its all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and itll never die---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
