I was lookin in the mirror 
tryin to find a new reflection wanna take the road lets travel down 
a different direction make some new mistakes 
forget the one's i made 
cry some tears of joy and dress more like a boy 
i come as a blonde try a every lipstick on, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
Id be ever so incising, take a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight. 
Yeah when Im gone, 
Im gonna come back as a blonde. 

I wanna I meet myself, 
as someone else, 
just to see what it feels like. 
Take a walk, 
on the other side, 
cause you know that I just might. 
Break some different hearts, 
finish what i start. 
Im not gonna wait, 
and mess around with fate. 

(Chorus) 
And come back as a blonde, 
try a every lipstick on, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
Id be ever so incising, take a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight. 
When Im gone, 
Im gonna come back as a ... 

(Bridge) 
Im tainted, Im tired, of being the same yeah. 
Im desperate, Im bored, Im begging for change. 
What if youre normal and wanna be strange? 
Come back, come back, come back. 
I wanna come back, come back, come back. 

(Chorus) 
As a blonde, try a every lipstick on, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
Id be ever so incising, take a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight. 
Yeah when Im gone, 
Im gonna come back as a blonde. 
Wave my magic wand, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
Id be ever so incising, down a lot of ice cream, never need to wash my face. 
Yeah when Im gone, 
Im gonna... 
Come back, come back, come back. (i'm Gonna come back) 
Come back, come back, come back. (I'm Gonna come back) 
Come back, come back, come back. 
As a blonde.---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlyn.
