You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'cause you're never gonna take me there

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

One day I want you and then I don't.
I'm gonna leave you and then I won't.
I can't live with or without you
I can't live with or without you.

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head
(Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you (it's you...)
It's you, it's you, it's you

My-my-my dilemma---
