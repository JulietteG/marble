Dont like waiting (x2)
Lets go right now!
Gotta hit the ground
Dancing before the music
Slows down

What Im sayin (x2)
If theres something to fix
take it to another level,
This is the remix

Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor

Make a scene (x2)
Nobody can ignore
Dont knock it, til you rock it
We cant take it not more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Shake it up!
Break it down (x2)
Ive got something to say
When youre dancin whit me,
Its like we go MIA

Make a scene (x2)
Nobody can ignore
Dont knock it, til you rock it
We cant take it not more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Sh-sh-sh-Shake it up,
You gotta change it up!
And if the days not right?
Just brush it off tonight!
Put on the attitude!
Your in my pocket mood
And when youve had enough,
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
