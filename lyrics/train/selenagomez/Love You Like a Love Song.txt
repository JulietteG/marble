It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of em
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A center full of miracle, lyrical, you saved my life again
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat

Constantly, boy you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do and it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free, I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful, you are
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat

No one compares, you stand alone
To every record I own, music to my heart
That's what you are, a song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I love you, like a love song---Lyrics submitted by Ida'Nathalie.
