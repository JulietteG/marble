Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in, there's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feeling
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreaming

I hear it every day, I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, oh!

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

How many inches in a mile, what it takes to make you smile
Teach ya not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Tell me, tell me something I don't know
Tell me, tell me something I don't know

Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing
This life I'm pursuing, the odds I'll be losing
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million
More like one in a billion or one in a zillion

I hear it every day, I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, oh!

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

How many inches in a mile, what it takes to make you smile
Teach ya not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

So here's the track
Like Katrina make you work like machine
And make 'em say I'm ready!'

Are you ready for it?
Yeah, I'm ready for it
Really ready for it?
Yeah, I'm ready for it!
Let's get ready for this

I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say
It won't be easy!

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

How many inches in a mile, what it takes to make you smile
Teach ya not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

How many inches in a mile, what it takes to make you smile
Teach ya not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
