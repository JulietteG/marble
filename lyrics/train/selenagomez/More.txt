Friday night and we're just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I 

We don't need to over think this
Nothing is going to bring us down
Show them what we're all about

All the way, one hundred one percent touch down
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack 
Gon' take this town

Let's go, what you wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell them what we want
More
More
More
I want more

Let's go, take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say
More
More
More
I want more
I want more

Take my hand and pull me closer
Whisper nothings in my ear
Till the walls just disappear

Feel the music
Take you higher
Feel my heart beat like a drum
Baby you're the only one

All the way, one hundred one percent touch down
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack 
Gon' take this town

Let's go, whatch ya wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell them what we want
More
More
More
I want more

Let's go, take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say
More
More
More
I want more

Come on everybody, lets go party
Till' they kick us out now

I don't care
(I want more)

Once we get it started, we won't stop
Until we get it all out
Take me there
Take me there
More
More
I want more

Let's go, whatch ya wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell them what we want
More
More
More
I want more

Let's go, take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say
More
More
More
I want more

More
I want more
More more---Lyrics submitted by alice.
