Everything's cool, yeah
it's all gonna be okay, yeah
and I know
maybe i'll even laugh about someday
but not today, no
'cuz I don't feel so good
i'm tangled up inside
my heart is on my sleeve
tomorrow is a mystery to me

(chorus)
and it might be wonderful
it might be magical
it might be everything I've waited for
a miracle
oh, but even if I fall in love again 
with someone new
it could never be the way I loved you


lettin you go ,yeah
makin me feel so cold , yeah---
