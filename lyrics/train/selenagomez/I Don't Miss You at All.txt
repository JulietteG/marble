Verse 1:
It doesn't hurt when i think of you, 
And all the things we'll never get to do. 
I don't dream at night about the way we were.
I tore up the pictures and crossed out all the words. 
Don't be fooled right on my tears cause everything is fine,
And you can pick up all the pieces that you left behind.

Chorus:
Cause i never think about you, I'm better off with out you.
I don't miss you at all, I don't miss you at all. 
You don't spin around in my head, It's like you never existed.
And i hope you don't call, I don't miss you at all. 
And i'm not trying to fight it, no i'm not trying to fight it. 
So you can cross my name right off the wall.
I don't miss you at all. 

Verse 2:
I go out 7 nights a week, It feels good to finally be free.
And i party like a never did before, what in the world what was I waiting for?
Everything is perfect now without you in my life.
You can pick up all the pieces that you left behind. 

Chorus:
Cause i never think about you I'm better off without you.
I don't miss you at all, I don't miss you at all. 
You don't spin around in my head, It's like you never existed.
And I hope you don't call, I don't miss you at all. 
And I'm not trying to fight it, no I'm not trying to fight it. 
So you can cross my name right off the wall.
I don't miss you at all. 
I don't miss you at all.
I don't miss you at all.,

Bridge:
I'll just tell myself we'll forget the past, 
No time for regrets, no more looking back. 
I'll forgive you more every single day.
Every step i take is getting better.

Chorus:
Cause i never think about you, I'm better off without you. 
I don't miss you at all, I don't miss you at all you. 
Don't spin around in my head, Its like you never existed. 
And I hope you don't call, and I don't miss you at all. 
And I'm not trying to fight it, no I'm not trying to fight it. 
So you can cross my name right off the wall. 
I don't miss you at all.
I don't miss you.
I don't miss you.---Lyrics submitted by Chelsea.
