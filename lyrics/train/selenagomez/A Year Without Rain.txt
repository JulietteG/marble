Can you feel me
When I think about you
With every breath I take

Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place

Like I've been wonderin the desert
For a thousand days

Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love

A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side

Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

Whhoooaaa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me

There's gonna be a monsoon
When you get back to me baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

So let this drought come to an end
And may this desert flower again
And I need you here
I can't explain
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain---Lyrics submitted by jj.
