Dust it off,
break it down
Get to what we're talking about
To what we're talking about...
Don't try to hide it now..
Why keep on working it out?
You can't keep working it out...

'Cause I see how it's putting you down
I just can't be around
What ya doin' this for
'Cause the light in you started to fade
Don't let it get away girl 
you're worth so much more

Don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take don't give it away
Don't waste the pretty on life
Soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way you got to see
Don't waste the pretty Heyy.

Sit back and breath it in 
Look at how lucky we are
Look at how lucky we are 
This life we're living in,
You got to follow your heart
You know I'm never too far...

Away from the pain in your eyes
I can see your disguise
But it's not too late...
'Cause I know you can turn this around
Don't be scared work it out
And listen when I say 

Don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take don't give it away
Don't waste the pretty on life
Soon it's gonna fly on by
whatever way you got to see;
Don't waste the pretty

And just in case you need reminding
Well, you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And there ain't no use in you hiding 
'Cause you're beautiful, you're beautiful You're beautiful

Don't waste the pretty on him 
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take 
don't give it away 
Don't waste the pretty on life 
Soon it's gonna fly on by
whatever way you got to see; Don't waste the pretty

Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty Don't, Don't, Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty Don't, Don't, Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty Don't, Don't, Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty Don't, Don't, Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty Don't waste the pretty---Lyrics submitted by Brenda Tollison.
