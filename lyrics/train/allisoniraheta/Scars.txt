Did I say something stupid? 
There goes one more mistake 
Do I bore you with my problems? 
Is that why you turn away? 
Do you know how hard I tried 
To become what you want me to be? 

Take me 
This is all that I've got 
This is all that I'm not 
All that I'll ever be 
I've got flaws, I've got faults 
Keep searching for your perfect heart 
It doesn't matter who you are 
We all have our scars 
We all have our scars 

You say don't act like a child 
But what if its a father I need? 
Its not like you don't know what you got yourself into 
Don't tell me I'm the one who's naive 
Do you know how hard I've tried 
To become who you want me to be? 

Take me 
This is all that I've got 
This is all that I'm not 
All that I'll ever be 
I've got flaws, I've got faults 
Keep searching for your perfect heart 
It doesn't matter who you are 
We all have our scars 
We all have our scars 

Come on, just let it go 
These are things you can't control 
Your expectations, your explainations 
Don't make sense to me 
You and your alternatives 
Don't send me to your therapists 
Deep down, I know what you mean 
And I'm not sure that's what I wanna be 
No 

Take me 
This is all that I've got 
This is all that I'm not 
All that I'll ever be 
I've got flaws, I've got faults 
Keep searching for your perfect heart 
It doesn't matter who you are 
We all have our scars 
We all have our scars 
Oh no no no 

Did I say something stupid 
There goes one more mistake..---Lyrics submitted by mathew.
