So it's over and you're heart is on the floor
And you need a way to run and hide
Now you're knocking on my door
Trying to pick it up and save your pride
You can say it but I've heard it all before
How I never should've said good-bye 

            (chorys)    

you are the one who let me down
You are the one who fooled around
Now i'm your lost and found
 Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that  

Sorry really doesn't mean a thing
When i can't believe a word you say
I'm not a puppet on a string
Left aside until you want to play

            (chorys)    

you are the one who let me down
You are the one who fooled around
Now i'm your lost and found
 Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that

So it's over and your heart is on the floor
And you need a way to run and hide
Now you're knocking on my door
Trying to pick it up and save your pride

aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that
aa-aah,aa-aah,aa-aah, Don't gimme that

Don't gimme that,Don't gimme that...---Lyrics submitted by Christina.
