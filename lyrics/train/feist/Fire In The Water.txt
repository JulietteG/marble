Love's as sweet as feelin',
Openly believin'.
No matter what we find there,
Come back in through the ice lair.
Sole and born creation,
The Lion's in the house,
Flowers are up in the air,
Question against the dark...
Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh... Ohh, ahh ah ha ah ooh..
Fire In the Water,
Is the body of our love.
Nobody should see this,
The fragrance of the light...
Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh... Ooh, ahh ah ha ah ooh..
Fire In the Water,
Is the body of our love.
Ooohh....---Lyrics submitted by Hazel Valerie.
