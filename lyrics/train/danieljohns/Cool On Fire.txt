It was getting a little hard
Not to think about each other
It was getting a little cold
Trying to act like I never need no one
It was getting a little harder
Trying to keep it undercover
But I was feeling insecure
Trying to get your body close to mine

Its getting a little hard
Not to talk to one another
But Im sick of playing it cool
In the end everybody needs someone
Its getting a little late
Wanna tell you something honest
When I'm feeling insecure
Wanna feel your body close to mine

I get higher
You keep getting better
And Im trying
But I can't see nothing else
'Cause together
Nothing matters
Were on fire
Cool on fire

I got no chance to keep my cool baby
Im caught on fire

It was getting a little hard
Not to think about each other
It was getting a little cold
Trying to act like I never need no one
It was getting a little harder
Trying to keep it undercover
But I was feeling insecure
Trying to get your body close to mine

I get higher
You keep getting better
And Im trying
But I can't see nothing else
'Cause together
Nothing matters
Were on fire
Cool on fire

I got no chance to keep my cool baby
Im caught on fire
We got a chance to rule the world baby
We're cool on fire

I get higher
You keep getting better
And Im trying
But I can't see nothing else
'Cause together
Nothing matters
Were on fire
Cool on fire

Were on fire
Were on fire
Cool on fire---
