The word is ''faithful,'' look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around behind my back
Like you ain't gettin' enough

How 'bout ''forever''
Just look it up
It means through thick and thin and pitchin' in
Even when the times get tough

The word is ''easy''
Look it up
And you'll see a picture of that peice of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pick up truck

Let's try ''liar''
Just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk

It's like you could be so clueless 
Cause you never thought I'd do this
I say go, goodbye, got lost, get out
Get gone the word is ''over''
Look it up

You say you're ''sober''
Look it up
It's right next to hell is freezing over flyin pigs 
And all that stuff

And how 'bout ''baby''
Look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Everytime I call your bluff

It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your wining and your crying
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out
Get gone the word is ''over''
Look it up

The word's ''forgiveness''
Look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't, no matter what

Quit your beggin' and your prayin'
Cause you can't hear what I'm sayin
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out
Get gone the word is over
Look it up

Asshole
Look it up, look it up---Lyrics submitted by lidia.
