I've got a cold beer in me right hand
in my left I've got my weddin' band
I've been wearing it round now for wayy too long
and I'm more than ready to see it gone
and I'm the only one who can set myself free
so I'm taking off this pain you put on me

i remember when you gave me that ring
it was supposed to mean something
instead this means a whole lot of nothin
you don't even ever talk to me
i just get to do your laundry
you sit there and you watch the t.v even when I'm lookin sexy

but now I've got a cold beer in me right hand
in my left I've got my weddin' band
I've been wearing it round now for wayy too long
and I'm more than ready to see it gone
and I'm the only one who can set myself free
so I'm taking off this pain you put on me

and right now I'm feelin so right
hey I'm havin a ball tonight
and I'm being noticed for the first time in a long time
how you doing sitting at home?
i hope you feel lost and alone
and i hope you miss me every second that I'm gone

well, I've got a cold beer in me right hand
in my left I've got my weddin' band
I've been wearing it round now for wayy too long
and I'm more than ready to see it gone
and I'm the only one who can set myself free
so I'm taking off this pain you put on me

yea I'm the only one who can set myself free so,
I'm taking off this pain you put on me
well, I've got a cold beer in me right hand
in my left I've got my weddin' band...---Lyrics submitted by Nicki.
