[Verse 1:]
Take my hand, I got a place for you
Out on the dance floor
One more time, I wanna rendezvous
Out on the dance floor

[Pre-Chorus:]
Feel the night
In a fall from time
As I, lose my mind to you, again
If I ever said goodbye
I would, lose my mind to you, again

Turn the lights, down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)
Lights down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)

[Chorus x2:]
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

(Just take the ride, Girl take a ride and dance with you)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Turn the lights, down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)
Lights down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)

[Chorus x2:]
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)---
