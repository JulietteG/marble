(with Susan Tedeschi)

Theres been some hard feelings here
About some words that were said
Been some hard feelings here
And what is more
Theres been a bloody purple nose
And some bloody purple clothes
That were messing up the lobby floor
Its just apartment house rules
So all you partment house fools
Remember: one mans ceiling
Is another mans floor
One mans ceiling
Is another mans floor

Theres been some strange goins-on
And some folks have come and gone
And the elevator man dont work no more
I heard a racket in the hall
And I thought I heard a fall
But I never opened up my door
Its just apartment house sense
Its like apartment house rents
Remember: one mans ceiling
Is another mans floor
I tell you, one mans ceiling
Is another mans floor

And theres an alley
In the back of my building
Where some people congregate in shame
I was walking with my dog
And the night was black with smog
When I thought I heard somebody
Call my name
Remember: one mans ceiling
Is another mans floor---
