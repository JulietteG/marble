Tell me where you going and where you been / 
Take me away from the world Im in / 
Cause when its filled with sin, crime, strife, and danger / 
And everybody seems a little bit stranger / 
I cant seem to find my right of way, I say / 
Its getting harder every day, in every way / 
Its hard to explain how I feel, but I know the feeling is real / 

CHORUS: 
Whenever my ship sets sail, Ill be on the shore / 
Dancing with the ocean like I never did before / 
And watch it as it comes and goes / 
Cause I know that someone knows / 
This is the life for me / 

And whenever my ship sets sail / 
Ill be on the beach / 
Waltzing to the water with the sand beneath my feet / 
So I can watch another sunrise / 
You know I cant deny / 
This is the life for me, the life for me / 
Whenever my ship sets sail / 
The water be my daughter / 
Take it all away, leave me waiting for the slaughter / 
After the fact its that this is my habitat / 
This is the life for me / 
And wherever the water runs deep / 
You are not alone / 
Look up in the sky, let the stars take you home / 
After the fact its that, this life is where its at / 
This is the life for me / 

Tell me where you going and where you been / 
Take me away from the world Im in/ 
Cause when Im giving in to all the pain and pressure / 
And everybody out there is coming to get you / 
Ill never let them come and take my soul away, I say / 
Its getting harder everyday, in every way / 
Its hard to explain how I feel but I know the feeling is real / 

CHORUS / 

Everybody, all the time / 
Everybody, get right now / 
Everybody, all the time / 
Everybody, get right down to it / 

CHORUS /
