Quinn:
Watching every motion in my foolish lovers game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame

Santana:
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Both:
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to cry
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

Santana:
My love

Both:
Take my breath away

Santana:
Through the hourglass I saw you, in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you and turned to hear you say

Quinn:
If only for today, I am unafraid

Both:
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way

Santana:
And say
Both:
Take my breath away
Quinn:
My love
Both:
Take my breath away
Quinn:
My love

Both:
Take my breath away, ooohh
Away
Take my breath away

Santana:
My love
Both:
Take my breath away---
