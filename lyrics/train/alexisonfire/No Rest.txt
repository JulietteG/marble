We greet each day with bloodshot eyes
The dirt of our labor still clingin to our hands
Filled with our warped intentions
The tread of our shoes filled with foreign sands
The sun laughs in all our faces
It shows a world that we cant save
So now, armed with blades in hand
We cut a path from birth to grave

We dont know where were going
But we know, we will get there

No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked

We dont think like you think
And we move like no one moves
With a song on our lips, across the land
Born to traverse
We dont think like you think
And we move like no one moves
With a song on our lips, across the land
Born to traverse

We dont know where were going
But we know, that we'll get there

No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked

Like a car crash
Like a landmine
Like mixing drugs, we are dangerous

Like a snakes tooth
Like thin ice
Like mixing blood, we are dangerous

No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked
No rest for the blessed
Long life for the wicked---Lyrics submitted by Devan.
