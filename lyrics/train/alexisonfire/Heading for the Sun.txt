They are the nameless victims of a generation lost
Searching for somewhere to exist
Held captive by our mistakes
Weak and unable to resist

Resentful minds have ruled too long
You get old, we get strong

We will drag our hindsight through the twilight of this era
To where our freedom reigns and the old thought is laid to dust
Let the philistines wallow in their decadence
While the enlightened minds usher in the dawning of a new

We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun

Time will come when we are all condemned
For the damage we have done
Held accountable for all
Battles lost, battles won

We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun

And the earth will coil each year, getting closer to its end
What will our lesson be, when we are all ablaze?
That our benevolence was the start of our decay
Or that we did not learn from the mistakes of the past?

We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun
(We are)
We are heading for the sun---Lyrics submitted by Devan.
