Old crows ride in the mouth of the beast
sleep beneath its tongue,cradled by its teeth
we roam from shore to shore
from the open sky,to the ocean floor
the more we move,the less we are ourselves
and when we finally stop,we've changed to something else.

as rapid as a river flows
as frigid as the cold wind can blow
as devious as the devil's grin
our blood is cold and we've shed our skin.

now,we are not the kids we used to be
stop wishing for yesterday.

the crows are calling-seems the end is near
they're spelling out their names,yet we have no fear
oh,the damage the man can do
when ambition takes over his search for the truth 
sometimes life just gets the best of us
some things in life will get the best of us.

now,we are not the kids we used to be
stop wishing for yesterday.

every skyline beats in my chest 
somewhere between love and sadness
this is our fate,this is our test
we ride in the mouth of madness.

as rapid as a river flows
as frigid as the cold wind can blow 
as devious as the devil's grin
our blood is cold and we've shed our skin.

We are not the kids we used to be
stop wishing for yesterday.---Lyrics submitted by Angus.
