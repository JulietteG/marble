America blaring in my ears all day
America, I don't see the glory in your eyes
The oldest money flows through the bloodline
We'll see if your empire stands the test of time
Don't wanna
I don't wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privlige

Sweet lady liberty -
You are the lost, though you are the free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell wolves from the sheep

America, grins and bare the resentment of the world
With all of your ugliness amd arrogant self-worth
Desperate to grease the gears of the hideous machine
The swine, they writhe and praise the infallible regime
Don't wanna
I don't wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege

Sweet lady liberty -
You are the lost, though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep

Lost through you are free
In America
It's time to justify your pride

Sweet lady liberty -
You are the lost, though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep---Lyrics submitted by John.
