(feat. Talib Kweli, Ali)

[Talib Kweli:]
Life, what is it for real? I don't know.
Yo It's like hate taking over the whole world,
What is it over?
Suicide man that's the devil trying to control us,
They told us
But we didnt notice
The pain was sittin on they shoulders
The world is just to polar
They'd rather live in the solar
System got us hopeless, and focused on foreclosures
Wake up and smell the folgers
Obama bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9 11 was bogus
Now we right back at em
Say the world is our motive come on.

[Nelly:]
Hey wake up early in the streets of the block,
Streets of the block.
He posted up on the corner like a soldier
In the drill but he wouldn't stop
Living life in the battlefield, battlefield
Trying to survive every day and every night,
It's the same deal
Lifes strange (Lifes strange)
Times change (Times change)
But karma always finds the way
Stay strong (Stay strong)
Hold on (Hold on)
Don't let all your dreams fade away

Yeah life can beat you down
What goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground
It's how fast you get back up
And go,keep going
Sometimes it feels like I'm giving my life away
It gets hard, and harder
Happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way!
Cause on my own is a better way!

A lot of mothers they just don't understand
(They just don't understand)
They think we're hard on our sons
But we gotta teach our boys how to be A man
They only know when they walk out the door
(When they walk out the door)
See we can show em how to fire,
But they gotta teach themselves how to reload
Cause unenployment is harder than its ever been
Sometimes it feels like i cant win
And even through all the rules keep changing
I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

Yeah life can beat you down
What goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground
It's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going
Sometimes it feels like I'm giving my life away
It gets hard, and harder
Happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way!
Cause on my own is a better way!

[Ali:]
Hey Hey going through the back streets
Like we got beef
Carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
They animalistic that's why we call the cops beast
We're on the hunt
Cause they're hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping to my heart beat
Brain is the base
My heart is the drum,
Give the drum some
Promise of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, I'm trying to live

Cause all I want is a better way, Hey
If you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show
Just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real and never let it go

And go, keep going
Sometimes it feels like I'm giving my life away
And it gets hard, and harder
Happiness is worth the wait
Cause all I want is
A better day
Cause all I want is
A better way

Go! Keep going
Sometimes it feels like I'm giving my life away
And it gets hard, and harder
Happiness is worth the wait
Cause all I want is
A better day
Cause all I want is
A better way---Lyrics submitted by Keyson Mackomack.
