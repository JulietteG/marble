(feat. Trey Songz)

[Chorus:]
There's no place I won't go
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'll never find another you, baby
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful (leggo)

[Verse 1:]
Been around, been around the world
Lookin for you
Seen so many, many pretty girls
Left it on ya
Been to Tokyo with no luck
I left France with no luck
Found nobody in Toronto like you uh uh

[Pre-Chorus:]
Seen a million pretty faces
Still ain't found one like yours
With a walk mean as yours,
New shades, clothes Victor
I've been a million different places,
Still ain't found one like you
It's the little things you do
That make you so beautiful

[Chorus:]
And there's no place I won't go (where I won't go)
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'll never find another you, baby
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful

[Bridge:]
So tell me have you seen her?
(Have you seen her? have you seen her?)
The one I used to know
Tell me have you seen her?
(Have you seen her? have you seen her?)
The one like you

[Verse 2:]
I've been so many cities lookin for you girl
L.A. to London
I can't find nobody lookin like you girl
I ain't feel something
Left St. Louis with no luck
Paris with no luck
I found nobody in Chicago like you uh uh

[Pre-Chorus:]
Seen a million pretty faces
Still ain't found one like yours
With a walk mean as yours,
New shades, clothes Victor
I've been a million different places,
Still ain't found one like you
It's the little things you do
That make you so beautiful

[Chorus:]
And there's no place I won't go (where I won't go)
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'll never find another you, baby
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful

[Bridge:]
(Tell me)
So tell me have you seen her?
(Have you seen her?)
The one I used to know
(The one I used to know)
Tell me have you seen her?
(Seen her)
The one

[Verse 3:]
Hey girl where you hidin?
I want someone I can confide in
I'm the only you need
Girl, let me just remind you
I've been around, I've been around the world
(Come on)
And I still ain't found, still ain't found my girl

[Chorus:]
There's no place I won't go (just to find you)
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, (I'm searchin) all around the world
I'll never find another you, baby
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful ---
