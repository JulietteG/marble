Got a hole in my heart that stretches form coast to coast
constantly ripper apart from what I want the most
and if I could find whoever designed you
there'd be so much I wanna know
since I don't like my shape it takes time to prepare
a chronic illness comes in the form of despair
do you wanna know something?
you are the one thing that keeps me up (because I care)
hello please to meet you
I am fumbling with myself cause I am just too scared to greet you my love
goodbye
nice to know you 
I am leaving unexpectedly before I got to show you...
how month's go by and I only feel worse
try to forget the ones who forgot you first
and you don't need him and she don't need you
gotta stop hanging around 
because the waiting hurts
gotta hole in my head that stretches from ear to ear
I dug it out because I couldn't take the fear
and if I can't think
well I guess I can't sink down
and I won't waste another year---Lyrics submitted by deedee marie.
