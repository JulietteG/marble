We all wait for the snow to fall
And I hate this time of year because it kills us all but we
Run around like kids on the loose
Chasing dreams like the babies play duck, duck, goose and I
Wait by the window cause she said she would call
And when you finally do I watch the words fall out of
My mouth and stick to my shirt
The summer's always lovely but the winters always hurt
And maybe next year you could find me somewhere in the dirt

Who could forget
It was almost 2003
We kissed under your Christmas tree
While your parents were asleep

I was 15 
On top of the world
I was 15
And you were my girl
And all I'm saying is for Christmas this year I would kinda like to see you

Happy holidays, let's hope for the best
And I'll try to ignore the feeling that I get in my chest when I
Think about all the time that we missed
Being caught up growing up and acting selfish and pissed but I
Wait by the airport cause you said you'd come home
And by now my hands are glued to my phone as you
Walk on a plane to fly home from LA
I'm missing you on Christmas in the worst kind of way
And maybe next time it won't be so easy for you to stray

Who could forget
It was almost 2003
We kissed under your Christmas tree
While your parents were asleep

I was 15 
On top of the world
I was 15
And you were my girl
And all I'm saying is for Christmas this year I would kinda like to see you---Lyrics submitted by Starr White.
