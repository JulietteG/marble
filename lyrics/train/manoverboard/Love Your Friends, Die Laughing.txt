Well the night gets old so Im back again.
The day just started because Im up with my old friends,
the fat smoke and funny joke.
Sitting like a sponge, letting everything soak.
And I just got the nerve get in the cage so bite me now.
We made love tonight as the result of a fight.
When you put your arms around me the whole worlds alright.
And a days worth of bitching goes down the drain
when you lay in my bed and pick my brain.
Shut up! Its my turn to talk.
Dont try and run before you learn to walk.
Because a days worth of bitching goes down the drain
when you lay in my bed and pick my brain.
I left my heart with my phone in my center console.
I left my feelings with my wallet and my keys
I feel so stupid because I came here without anything
But Im finally at ease---Lyrics submitted by geoff.
