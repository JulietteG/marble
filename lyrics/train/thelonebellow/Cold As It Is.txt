Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby doll
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby doll
I wouldn't leave my baby doll, I wouldn't leave

Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave my baby doll
Cold as it is, I wouldn't leave

I saw you walking under water
While I was drowning underneath
I'm just like any other damned
Pulling me into the deep

Your name was written on the air though
I cut my name up to that tree
You're cold, but darling it's all natural
Way you bring me to my knees!

Water take me in
Calling me instead
While I speed, wash me
Singing sorrow songs
Lock before the dawn
Waiting for the midnight
Waiting for the midnight

Waiting
Waiting---
