They say it gets better
But it's bittersweet
You don't know how it feels
To sleep like we used to be
And your smell used to linger
I ain't need to wash my sheets
They stay with memories
I wonder if you think of me

Pre-chorus :
Forever really don't (don't)
Last too long
Cause all I had to give (give)
For us has not been enough

Chorus:
Oh love,
Just left me lonely
I ain't got nobody to call my own!
Oh, love
Just made my heart ache
Our way is a mistake
Oh, love only leaves you lonely.

I sleep with my TV on and write the saddest songs
Cigarettes and alcohol
Had become my only escape!
I dream of my favorite child
No, I won't have to wait while
It hurts so much to smile
But even the strongest can break

Pre-chorus :
Forever really don't (don't)
Last too long
Cause all I had to give (give)
For us has not been enough

Chorus:
Oh love,
Just left me lonely
I ain't got nobody to call my own!
Oh, love
Just made my heart ache
Our way is a mistake
Oh, love only leaves you lonely.

I'm left with nothing but a twisted dream
It must be someone out there who won't abandon me
Cause I give so much, but all they ever do is take

Chorus:
Oh love,
Just left me lonely
I ain't got nobody to call my own!
Oh, love
Just made my heart ache
Our way is a mistake
Oh, love only leaves you lonely.
Love just left me lonely,
Love just left me lonely
To call my own!
Oh, love just made my heart ache
Our way is a mistake
Oh, love only leaves you lonely.---
