prophet took my hand on all saints day
He preached the value of deception
Changing shadows by a shapeshifter rules
Tales are never just for fools

the court of concience came before me
presenting me with a heavenly angel
you took my hand and ask me truth aside
to his questions i replied 

Do you want the truth or something beautiful ?
Just close your eyes and make believe
Do you want the truth or something beautiful ?
I am happy to decieve you

He stood as tall as redwood trees
Drank tea from a seamstress thimble
I didnt want to speak the honest truth
so i split out lies that aimed to soothe 

Do you want the truth or something beautiful ?
Just close your eyes and make believe
Do you want the truth or something beautiful ?
I am happy to decieve you

secrets, lying, falling veils
I can be who you want me to be
sacred, lies in, telling tales
I can be who you want me to be
But do you want me ?

Do you want the truth or something beautiful ?
Just close your eyes and make believe
Do you want the truth or something beautiful ?
I am happy to decieve you

sacred, lies in, telilng tales
I can be who you want me to be x2

I can be who you want me to be
but do you want me?
But do you want me?---Lyrics submitted by magda.
