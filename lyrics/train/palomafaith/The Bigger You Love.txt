When you love someone deep, they can't do no wrong
But when when you love too hard, it's a different song
You got to take the time, and build it strong
And get it all together, and watch it grow

The bigger you love, the harder your fall
Just take it from me, girl
You got to slow down, be

The bigger you love, the harder your fall
Just take it from me, girl
You got to slow down, be

You got to start love right from the ground
Cause when you start from the top you only come down
When you keep on all your love and get no return
And that's the only way you got to love

The bigger you love, the harder your fall
Just take it from me, girl
You got to slow down, be

The bigger you love, the harder your fall
Just take it from me, girl
You got to slow down, be---
