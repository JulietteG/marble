I am collecting people's tears , they cried because they miss you
they feel the seas and over lakes with memories of windblew
I ranout of doves before the second good past
didnt have enough time with you to turn the hour glass
pictures in my head suddenly appear
why do you have to go away , its all now very clear
goodbye sweet angel
sail away on teary seas
tattoo the times we had , on my memories
My legs are weak

When I close my eyes i see you 
the dimples in your cheeks
I forgot to thank you for things but i didnt see you for weeks
woke up this morning and hoped for a dream
But reality sat next to me and forced me to believe
knocked down too soon like the skittle on the lane
the man who took the wrong stop from the lives fast moving train
goodbye sweet angel!
sail away on teary seas
tattoo the times we had , on my memories
Ohh , funeral flowers wont make me believe
 they can carry every casket
 and i still expect to see you
Oh you, you come around tomorrow and tell me all your news
I wont ask for much from you
Sleep to my lullaby
 only give me one more chance
to say my last goodbye

goodbye sweet angel
sail away on teary seas
tattoo the times we had, on my memories
Oh goodbye sweet angel
sail away on teary seas
i tattoo the times we had , on my memories
yeah , oh , oh , oh
i'll I will never forget you
wish you didnt have to leave

goodbye sweet angel
take your boat and sailaway

My Legs are Weaaaaaak !---Lyrics submitted by Florenctino.
