Help me
How would you gon' do, no this way
I work so hard for you everyday
While you out, late night
Girl, what you do?
Chillin' with who?
While I'm sitting at home
Come on with it!

(I don't know what this world is coming to...)

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you
Just can't rely on you

Oh Lord
How am I to ever explain?
I'm a melted awkward and right down the drain
'Cause if you don't want me
(Release)
Repeat
(Believe)
Want some
(Want some)

He will take right out your way
Come on with it!

(I don't know what this world is coming to...)

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you
Just can't rely on you

Time to go
Really
You can say what you want
But I'm not that dull
Can't stop me
Oh my man
Oh Lord

(I don't know what this world is coming to...)

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you
Just can't rely on you

Just pulling in like it is
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Change your ways
You don't deserve it babe
Look at here
Cause that's why you drove me out of my mind

I just can't rely on you
I just can't rely on you
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you
Just can't rely on you---
