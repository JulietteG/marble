It happens every time I look in your eyes
I can feel the love in your heart
It's a mystery but my love just won't set me free

It only happens 
when I look at you (oh babe) 
It only happens oh darling
When I look at you

How can I say the way I feel about you now
Don't you know my love depends on you
How can I explain 
When time and time again it starts yeah

It only happens oh darling 
When I look at you know you (you make me wanna sing)
It only happens 
When I look at you 

I just wanna tell ya
It only happens 
When I look at you (oh babe)
It only happens (yeah)
When I look at you

Guess you know the way I feel about you now
You must know my love depends on you
Now that your by my side
I can forget about my foolish pride yeah
oh baby

It only happens (I wanna tell you)
When I- look at you
It only happens (it only happens oh people)
When I look at you---Lyrics submitted by Charlene.
