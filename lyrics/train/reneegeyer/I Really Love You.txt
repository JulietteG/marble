Well the sun wont shine if you throw me away
But now it doesnt matter, that you want me back someday. 
Youve been thinking bout the way, I used to care so much for you
And I was there by your side like, somebody gave me a cue.

I love you
I really do.

I remember how you told me that you found somebody new
And I know that you werent easy, so just do what you wanna do
Till youre knocking on my door, you know that I wont make one sound
And Im feeling pretty soon that you might want me around.

I love you, baby I love you.

(Really really really really really really really love you) x 4. 

Look into the mirror do ya, see your other side? 
Well you know that all you think about baby is your foolish pride
Think about this womans lips, I used to kiss you all night long
When you are feeling lonely, just remember the name of this song.

I love you, oooh I love you.

(Really really really really really really really love you) x 4.---Lyrics submitted by Kim Donnelly.
