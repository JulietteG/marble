This world is paper thin
But goes on when you give in
With a beauty for the living
This land's been less forgiving
There's a cloud that holds no rain
It just hangs in constant pain
A relentless reminder, of what lies on the horizon

Snow on these hills
This tree by the bank
Lights for the falling
Give you their thanks
Lives on the way
Are breaking my heart
Tell me your ok, son

Hey now, don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
And don't stare
And don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
And don't stare
And don't stare

I still hear her singing now
Small voice my soul devoured
Yet her song is everlasting
Just a tale to ease her passing
Sing it loud my child for me
For I swear I do believe
If I stare after you too long
I'll lose the strength to move on

Snow on these hills
Tell me how far
We've come to find this
Find who we are
light on this beach
Has broken my heart
Lives on the corner
Crawl!

Hey now, don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
And don't stare
And don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
And don't stare
And don't stare

Now don't stare...

Still I search for things to say
Words to cannonize these days
Can I ever hope to capture, the horror and the rapture?

She fights with her will
And Crawls through the dark
Laughs at the warnings
Cries when it's hard
Leaving alone
Is breaking your heart
Tell me you're ok
crawl!

Hey now,hey now,
Hey now don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
And don't stare
And don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
Hey now, don't stare
And don't stare
And don't stare....---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
