Mrs. Bartender you say it's my last shot
When I got up on in that game
You was my number one mascot
You was the one that I was flying out.

We was the one that everyone just
Kept on lying about
Now you tell me, stop, back it up
Girl, I think you're tripping,
It's no wonder why you packing up.

I'm out here doing numbers,
But you say it's not adding them
Cause I told you
You plus me it's all I need and that's enough.
You say that I'm Hollywood
Well you're one acting up.

I'm trying to make history
But you say that we're history,
Girl, I know that you're missing me.

Aleesia

They say that a picture's worth a thousand words
So how come I can only think of two
When I look at yours
We used to be three yeah,
Used to be me, us along
I get lost in those petty brown eyes.
So look me in the face and beg me to say
Cause this could be the very best last time.

Chorus

If I'll take one more step out the door
And if you let one more tear hit the floor
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye, byeee

One last chance boy,
This is no joke.
You should know I'm sorry
Don't cut it no more
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye,
Bye bye bye byeee

They say you don't know what you have
Till it's gone, no, no, yeah
But I say that you knew it on and on.

No matter what I get caught up in your issues
Why do I try when I know I can't fix you
To listen up, messing up
Boy I mean that when I say

Chorus

If I'll take one more step out the door
And if you let one more tear hit the floor
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye, byeee

One last chance boy,
This is no joke.
You should know I'm sorry
Don't cut it no more
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye,
Bye bye bye byeee

Bridge

If you want me to stay,
I want you to cry,
I want you to beg boy,
Don't ask why
When I say jump,
You say how high,
And I say don't stop till you touch the sky.

Maybe then I'll start to believe
Everything that you say you mean,
So come and kiss me,
Make it better baby please.

Chorus

If I'll take one more step out the door
And if you let one more tear hit the floor
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye, byeee

One last chance boy,
This is no joke.
You should know I'm sorry
Don't cut it no more
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye
You can kiss it bye bye,
Bye bye bye byeee

You can kiss it bye bye. ---
