Drawn to the violence of change,
Charmed by the sentimental brave.
I hear the door slam,
I look the other way.
I hate the small talk and the empty days.

(chorus)
Silver Lining
I bathe in your light
I'll always believe in your place in my life.
Silver Lining
I know that I'm right.
I'll always believe in your right to shine.

Scared of the things that people say,
Knowing my confidence might fail.
I feel the world's weight upon my breaking back.
I see the uncertainty and the visible cracks.
