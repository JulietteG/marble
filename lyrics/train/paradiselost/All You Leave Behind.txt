On and on it rains
On and on no shelter
On and on it rains
The sun has gone forever

Let the sin go, let the sin go
For all you leave behind
Let the sin go

On and on abstrain
All the more suppression
On and off with strain 
All the more deception

Let the sin go, let the sin go
For all you leave behind
Let the sin go

It's all a state of mind
It's all a state of mind
It's all a state of mind
For all you leave behind

Let the sin go, let the sin go
For all you leave behind
Let the sin go, let the sin go
For all you leave behind---
