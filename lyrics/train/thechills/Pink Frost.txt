I want to stop my cryin'
I want to stop my cryin'
But she's lyin' there dyin'
How can I live when you see what I've done?
How can I live when you see what I've done?

What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she's lost?
Just the thought fills my heart with Pink Frost

I thought I was dreaming -
so I didn't heed her screaming
I'm so scared
I'm so scared
She won't move and I'm holding her head
She won't move and I'm holding her head

She's lost...Bye Bye Bye
She's lost...Bye Bye Bye
She's lost...Bye Bye Bye
Pink frost...Bye Bye Bye

I'm really not lying
I'm so scared
But I'll have to stop my crying
Now she's dead

What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she dies?
What can I do if she's lost?
Just the thought fills my heart with Pink Frost.---Lyrics submitted by Public.
