This isn't another new fashion, or a new wave plastic trend.
Everybody's searching for something but in the meantime let's all just pretend.
I've got this feeling and I don't know what it is.
This room is overcrowded, man, and I need air to breathe, yeah.
Big bang, big crunch, you know there's no free lunch.
Kneel down and pray, here comes your judgment day.
Big crunch, you know, it's gonna be quite a show.
What goes around always comes around, yeah.
A million hopeless faces dwell within protected walls,
All waiting for a moment in life when they can heed the clarion call.
And it's all so oppressive my mind feels like a sieve.
This city's overcrowded, man, and I need room to live.
Big bang, big crunch, you know there's no free lunch.
Kneel down and pray, here comes your judgment day.
Big crunch, you know, it's gonna be quite a show.
What goes around always comes around, yeah.
I think of the countless shadows that have all come and gone,
All suffering in the notion of better things to come.
If you share these beliefs you know I wish you well,
'cause there's no room left in heaven and there's sure no room in hell, yeah.
Big bang, big crunch, you know there's no free lunch.
Kneel down and pray, here comes your judgment day.
Big crunch, you know, it's gonna be quite a show.
What goes around always comes around.---Lyrics submitted by pero.
