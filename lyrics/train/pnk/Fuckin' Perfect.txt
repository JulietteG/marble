Made a wrong turn
Once or twice
Dug my way out
Blood and fire
Bad decisions
That's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "no way it's all good"
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken
Always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around... 

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like your less than
Fuckin perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like your nothing
You're fuckin perfect to me

You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself
You are wrong
Change the voices
In your head
Make them like you
Instead
So complicated
Look how big you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It's enough
I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons
See you do the same
Whoaoooh

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like your less than
Fuckin perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like your nothing
Your fuckin perfect to me

The world's scared so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in lying and we tried tried tried
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, cuz they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Stringe ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Ooh, pretty pretty pretty, 
Pretty pretty please don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, fuckin' perfect
Pretty pretty please if you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing you're fuckin perfect to me

You're perfect
You're perfect
Pretty, pretty please don't you ever ever feel like you're less than, fuckin perfect
Pretty, pretty please if you ever ever feel like you're nothing you're fuckin perfect to me---Lyrics submitted by liz.
