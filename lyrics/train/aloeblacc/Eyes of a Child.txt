You think you're so sophisticated
With your lady-like ways
Your life is so complicated
Do you remember the days?

Looking through

You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe

I remember the things you hated
All the two-faced lies
The people that smiled and cheated
Looking back on your life

You're looking through

You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe

Act like a lady
Subscribe to all the magazines
Cry like a baby
At all that you have seen

Through the eyes of a child

You think you're so sophisticated
With your lady-like ways
Your life is so complicated
Do you remember the days?

Looking through

You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe

Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe

Through the eyes of a child
Through the eyes of a child
Through the eyes of a child---
