Two black horses, one black driver
I chose you as my woman, because you're a survivor
After everything we have been through and what's to come
For all the things I've did, and haven't done
For every time that you called that I didn't answer
I want to take this moment that I've got the chance to
(Say) That I love you
(Say) That I care
(Say) That I need you
(Say) Right here
For the whole world to see

In my red velvet seat
You can sit next to me
Got a bouquet of lilies and daisies and roses
For you to keep
In my red velvet seat

A box of chocolates and a little champagne
And burning a hole in my pocket, is this rang
That I stave in head, a long time ago
I wanted to give you, but I wasn't sure
If you was going to stick around, to let it go
But you never left my side, so now I know
(Hey) That you love me
(Hey) That you care
(Hey) That you need me
(Hey) Right here
And that you want to be

In my red velvet seat
You can sit next to me
Got a bouquet of lilies and daisies and roses
For you to keep
In my red velvet seat

Girl close your eyes and open your ears
Let the sound of the city ease your fears
This carriage is made for king and queen
You can have everything that you dream
In my red velvet seat

You can have anything
That you want
If you're with me
(Lilies and daises and roses)
In my red velvet seat ---
