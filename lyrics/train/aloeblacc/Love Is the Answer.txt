Broken hearts everywhere
From stepping on them, we don't care
Somebody tell me what we gonna do
Even though it's plenty to share
People hungry on the streets, it ain't fair
But you don't think about it until it's you

Now I'm gonna say how I feel
And what I wanna say is love's the only thing that's real
I won't tell you what to do
Just believe that love the only thing we have that's true

'Cause love is the answer
It's the answer to the questions in your mind
Love is the answer
It's the answer, if you're looking you will find

The answer is love
Yes, indeed
The answer is love
Say it again
The answer is love
I'm telling you now
The answer is love

Friends nowhere to be found
To help you when you are down
But you know you are the one to blame
You know what's wrong from what's right
Nobody wins in a fight but still we play the game

I'm gonna say how I feel
And what I wanna say is love's the only thing that's real
I won't tell you what to do
Just believe that love ' the only thing that's real and true

'Cause love is the answer
It's the answer to the questions in your mind
Love is the answer
If you're looking it's the answer you gonna find

Love is the answer
It's the only thing that everybody needs
Love is the answer
It's the only thing that makes us truly free

Just look around the whole wide world
So many beautiful things to see
Take my hand and come along
Spread some love with me

'Cause love is the answer
It's the answer to the questions in your mind
Love is the answer
If you're looking it's the answer you gonna find

Love is the answer
It's the only thing that everybody needs
Love is the answer
It's the only thing that makes us truly free

The answer is love
Yes, it is
The answer is love
Now say it again
The answer is love
The answer is love
The answer is love
The answer is love
Yes, it is
The answer is love
Now say it again
The answer is love ---
