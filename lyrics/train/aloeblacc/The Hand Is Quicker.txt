The hand is quicker than the eye
And sometimes the truth ain't no better than the lie

I'm gon' tell you a story about how things changed and why
One day you owe tax for the world and the next day you owe the grey
I was the one that all of the ladies wanted to see
And now words upon no the fellas wanted to be
(The bigger they come then the harder they fall when they're falling down)
(The bigger they come then the harder they fall when they're falling down)

The hand is quicker than the eye
And sometimes the truth ain't no better than the lie

But the hand is quicker than the eye
Sometimes the truth ain't no better than the lie

Are you waiting for something better
You face up and gonna come your way
You never was gonna stick around
You never meant to stay
I see you looking and keep on staring at the front door
But I hope you found what you're looking for
(The bigger they come then the harder they fall when they're falling down)
(The bigger they come then the harder they fall when they're falling down)

The hand is quicker than the eye
The truth ain't no better than the lie

I thought you were my lover
I thought you were my friend
How dare you find a lover
Now I'm alone again
You used to call me sweetheart
You used to hold my head
You'll get what's coming to you
I'll get my sweet revenge
Sometimes you'll find the situation in exactly what is meant to be
You can't always believe in what you hear and everything that you see
Keep you dear friends and your enemies even closer
Because not everything is gonna turn how you make it is supposed to

The hand is quicker than the eye
The truth ain't no better than the lie ---
