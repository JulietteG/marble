Come on lift your spirit
And toast a cheese
To all the good times
Through after years
And just remember

It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know it's whose got your back

Times have changed
Everything's strange nothing is what it seems
Here a friend's someone who drops in
A face on a telephone screen
When my chips are down and I'm feeling low
Who impose to come
Who's gonna happen to know my feet after I fall

So ladies and gentleman
And boys and girls
This one goes out to the people
That helped me most in the world

So lift your spirit
And toast a cheese
To all the good times
Through after years
And just remember

It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know it's whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back

It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
and whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back

It ain't who you know but who knows you
And whose got your back

I told my secret to a friend I thought I can trust
He swore he'll keep it on his momma and The Lord above
All the time I've come to find my bitterness all in the street
I still try to forgive that low down double crossed nerdy J

So ladies and gentleman
And boys and girls
This one goes out to the people
Who helped me most in the world

Hey brothers and sisters
Hey women and men
I dedicate this to the people
Whose down since way back when

So lift your spirit
And toast a cheese
To all the good times
Through after years
And just remember

It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know but who knows you and whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back

It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
and whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back

It ain't who you know but who knows you and whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back

It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
and whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back
Whose got your back ---
