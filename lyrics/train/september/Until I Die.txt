So every single day begins and ends the same. 
I see them pushing to get on board a crowded train. 
Out of the pouring rain, to face another pain.. 
Why you so afraid of the other side? 
It's just a big parade, it's people on display. 
If one should stumble, imagine what the rest would say. 
They're making harmless sounds. 
Their heads go round and round. 
Why do you stay away from the other side? 

Now you have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 
You have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 

Until The Day I Die 

You'll see me in the clouds, laughing a bit too loud. 
You'll see me crying 'cause I'm too crazy to be proud. 
Today I'll celebrate, tomorrow is too late. 
I'll be out there pushing the boderline. 
Postponing is a crime, who knows if I have time. 
When this is over I hope I never walked the line. 
So call me immature, at least I know I'm sure. 
I'll be crossing over the boderline. 

Now you have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 
You have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 

Until The Day I Die 
(Have to Believe...) 

I hear everybody say that today is the day and 
Sooner or later my luck is gotta change. 
Well, that day is never near if you're 
Living by you're fear. 
Stand up and shout You're Alive 

Until The Day I Die 

Now you have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 
You have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 

Now you have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die. 
You have to believe in me. 
I'll live Until The Day I die.---Lyrics submitted by Sophie.
