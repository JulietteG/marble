Say, say anything, your eyes tell all that you wont show, you wont show
The records spinning while you dance with your temporary ghost, your temporary ghost
Familiar words bid you farewell, your hands are empty and what you held 
Has left you here with nothing but a name, but a name

Say, say everything, Ill try to give you what you need, what you need
Falling, so much second guessing, 
it hurts to watch you bleed, it hurts to watch you bleed
You try to sing a different song, so hard to know where it went wrong, 
The faces change but pictures stay the same, stay the same

Hold your place, when the words are on the wall and you cant find your fire
escape, I'm running for you now so dont let go 
and trees hang low and clouds suffocate the sun so you cant see, 
Put a signal in the sky for me

Dont, dont say a thing cause darling I already know I already know
Yeah love is waiting, this is all just a temporary ghost, a temporary ghost
Familiar words will greet you well, your hands will hold more than you held,
Youll see the sunshine when you hear your name, hear your name

Hold your place when the words are on the wall and you cant find your fire
escape, I'm running for you now so dont let go 
and trees hang low and clouds suffocate the sun so you cant see, 
Put a signal in the sky for me

ooohhhhhhhoohhhhhhhh

Hold your place when the words are on the wall and you cant find your fire
escape, I'm running for you now so dont let go 
and trees hang low and clouds suffocate the sun so you cant see, 
Put a signal in the sky for me, put a signal in the sky for me, for me---Lyrics submitted by Chi Jie.
