I wake up in the dark
The silence brings me to my senses
I wonder where you are
Then I feel the pain
The pain in my heart
Coz I'm living without your love
I'm all - alone for the first time
And it doesn't seem to be a dream
A dream that will be over

All the words you said
Weren't enough to fool this heartache
The memories in my head
Are they enough to stop me falling apart?
Coz I'm living without your love
Maybe it won't be the last time
I don't know how much more I can take
Hopeless wide-awake and here I go....

Calling your name again
Thinking of all that we two had before
There's got to be more
This I know
Calling your name again
Remembering all the love you gave to me
And how it used to be...

I think of what's to come
Then I turned and see your picture
The tears began to fall
And soon again they sense of nothing at all
Coz I'm living without your love
Won't think that I'll make it this time
Something tells me this is not the end
Wish I could pretend but here I go

Calling your name again
Thinking of all that we two had before
There's got to be more
This I know
Calling your name again
Remembering all the love you gave to me
And how it used to be...

Calling your name again
Remembering all the love you gave to me
And how it used to be...

How it used to be... ---Lyrics submitted by rose urbano.
