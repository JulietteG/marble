This part's for my love of old
How the rose in your heart you hold
Still all the water in your wells won't make it grow

Oh the call of the nightingale
How I love beneath the ghostly sails
We move like gypsies 'neath the mist and beneath the gloom

Oh how the river flows
Under the ice and snow
The keeper of the flame
The rose captain knows my name
This perfume breath I breathed
For you my dear, my love will never leave

This part's for my love of new
How the bulbs in my heart are true
They send the shoots through my fingers into your bones

Oh the call of the collared dove
How I long to be your one true love
We'll move like gypsies 'neath the stars and beneath the moon

Oh how the river flows
Under the ice and snow
The keeper of the flame
The rose captain knows our names
This perfume breath we breathed
For you my dear, my love will never leave

Oh the rose captain knows, knows our names
Oh the rose captain knows, he knows our names---Lyrics submitted by Sophia.
