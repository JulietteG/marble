Don't you lie, don't lie to me
That you're not afraid my love
I know you well enough to know
You can't be alone

If you were to roll, to roll down your window
You'd find
The wind, the ice, the trees
That sway like skeletons outside

But when the cold, the dark and the silence come
It's like a sudden rush of water
Through your heart and lungs

Please don't fight, don't fight with me
and fold your arms like it's the end
Can you smell the sweetness of the soil and snow
In the wind

So we're lost
We're lost out here on the planes, my love
It's only wind and ice and trees that wave from above

But the cold, the dark and the silence come
It's like a sudden rush of water
Through your heart and lungs

When the cold, the dark and the silence come
It's like a sudden rush of water
Through your heart and lungs

Don't lie
Don't cry
It's over
It's only
The leaves, the trees
I'll never leave you alone 
In this car
In the dark, with the air getting so much colder
It's so clear, outside here in the moonlit winter air

But when the dark and the silence come
It's like a sudden rush of water
Through your heart and lungs

When the cold, the dark and the silence come
It's like a sudden rush of water
It's like a sudden rush of water
It's like a sudden rush of water through your heart and lungs

The cold, the dark and the silence.
The cold, the dark and the silence.
The cold, the dark and the silence.
The cold, the dark and the silence.
The cold, the dark and the silence.
The cold, the dark and the silence...---Lyrics submitted by Fiona.
