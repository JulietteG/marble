A pretty angel flew too close to the ground.
angel crashed and was never found.
singed her wings on the neon lights. 
A deadly love affair with the night.

Pretty baby scream, sing me a lullaby.
Little Halloween girl in a Halloween world.
Pretty baby scream, sing me a lullaby.
You let fantasy become reality Pretty baby scream.

Went to the movies I seen your scene.
Took off your clothes and acted obscene.
You felt the needle you feel the prick. 
You broke your mirrors cause they made you sick.

Pretty baby scream, sing me a lullaby.
Little Halloween girl in a Halloween world.
Pretty baby scream, sing me a lullaby.
You let fantasy become reality Pretty baby scream.
Rock a bye baby reached for the top, when the mind blows you're in for a shock. 
When the bank breaks, the bottom will fall an down will come baby on anyone at all.

Trick or treat won't you let me in.
tonight we'll swoon the eternal sin.
Unlock the window let me visit your bed.
we're riding on electra-glide in red

Pretty baby scream, sing me a lullaby.
Little Halloween girl in a Halloween world.
Pretty baby scream, sing me a lullaby.
You let fantasy become reality (Pretty baby scream.)2x
Pretty baby scream (a little Scat) scream me to death.
Scream pretty baby won't you scream me to death.
Let me hear, let me hear you scream---Lyrics submitted by John.
