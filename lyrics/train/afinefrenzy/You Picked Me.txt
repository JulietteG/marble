One, Two, Three
Counting out the signs we see the tall buildings
Fading in the distance only
Dots on a map

Four, Five, Six the two of us a perfect picture
All mine, All mine.
And all i can say is you blow me away.

Like an apple on a tree, hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach but you picked me.
Like the shell up on the beach, just another pretty peace.
I was difficult to see but you picked me
Yeah you picked me

So softly the rain against the window and the strong coffee,
warming up my fingers in this fisher mans house.
You got me, searched the sand and climbed the tree's
Brought me back down.
And all i can say, is you blow me away

Like an apple on a tree, hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to see but you picked me.
Like a shell up on a beach, just another pretty peace.
I was difficult to see but you picked me
yea you picked me (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Yvonne.
