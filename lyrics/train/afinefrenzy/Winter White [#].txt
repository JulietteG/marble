The smoke, of memories in my eyes
The real misleading kind
it comes in winter white
and holiday disguise
to sabotage my mind

Dismiss, the urge to reminisce
to miss your stupid kiss
A shot at happiness
It never did exist
And I don't care if it did

Cause I wont cry
and theres no turning back
Merry Christmas, happy god damn new year

I see you everywhere I see
you everywhere I breath
you are the devil king 
get the hell out of my dreams
you're poisoning my sleep

And I won't cry
And there's no turning back
But it's mighty sad

And this year is going to be
just like you never knew me
peace and quite, happy home
how I love to be alone
Merry Christmas, happy god damn new year---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
