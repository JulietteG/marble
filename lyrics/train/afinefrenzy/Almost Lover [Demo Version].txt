your finger tips across my skin
the palm trees swayin' in the wind images
you sang me spanish lullabies 
the sweetest sadness in your eyes clever trick.

I never want to see you unhappy i thought you'd want the same for me.

goodbye, my almost lover
goodbye, my hopeless dreams
i'm trying not to think about you 
can't you just let me be?

so long, my luckless romance 
my back is turned on you 
should've  known you'd bring me heartache almost lovers always do...

we walked along a crowded street 
you took my hand and danced with me images
And when you left you kissed my lips 
you told me you would never never forget these images
 no...

I never want to see you unhappy i thought you'd want the same for me.

goodbye, my almost lover
goodbye, my hopeless dreams
i'm trying not to think about you 
can't you just let me be?

I can not go to the ocean
 I can not drive streets at night
 I can not wake up in the morning.without you on my mind 
so you're gone and I'm haunted and i bet you are just fine. 
did I make it that easy to walk in and out of my life? 

goodbye, my almost lover 
goodbye, my hopeless dream 
i'm trying not to think about you 
can't you just let me be? 
so long my luck less romance 
my back is turned on you 
should've known you would bring me heartache almost lovers do.---Lyrics submitted by Regina.
