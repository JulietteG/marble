We acted like children
Now don't tell me that you're sorry
Darling, I'm as much to blame as anyone
It's over and done
Darling, I'm so glad to have you home
Welcome home, my baby
Welcome home, my darling

'Cause this time we'll make it
We'll give love as well as take it
And we'll let pride be something we have
In our love, not just in ourselves
Baby, it's so good to have you home
Oh, welcome home, my darling
oh, Welcome home, my baby

Into my arms, into my heart
Into my life, as man and wife
forever

'Cause we acted just like children...
Forgive me, cause I fee that I'm sorry---Lyrics submitted by Tremayne Primm.
