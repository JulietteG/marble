Pennies
in a stream
Falling leaves 
of sycamore
Moonlights in Vermont

Icy
finger waves
Ski trails falling down the mountain side
Snow alights in Vermont

Telegraph cables, 
they sing down the highway
traveling every every, every, every, every, every, every, bend in the road

the people that we meet
running around this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized
by the lovely, lovely

Evening 
summer breeze
Warbling of those meadowlarks
snow alight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, 
they sing down the highway
traveling every every, every, every, every, every, every, bend in 
the road
the people that we meet
running around this romantic setting
are so hypnotized
by the lovely, lovely

Evening
summer breeze
warbling of those meadowlarks
snow alights in Vermont

You and I
and
Moonlight
in 
Ver---mont---Lyrics submitted by Tremayne Primm.
