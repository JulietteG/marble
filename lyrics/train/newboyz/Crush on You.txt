I went over pick-up lines in front of mirrors all the time
Vanitary, cause I s-s-stuttered every time I tried
If it's only one that's fit for you I bet that I'm the guy
You my heart, if you leave me then I bet that I'ma die
She wish that I had to get you from your man
The b*tch told me that you said he's just a friend
A drug dealer hardly spends cheese with a hobo
His checks keep bouncing as bees in a pogo
What you say know the rumor 
You either date me a general you want a lame this intruder
I wanna make a new move for your benefit
It isn't that hard to pick my sex outta this world she call me martian pit
I don't mean to diss yo man but I like your shit has been less since I was ten 
I'm just tryna get a chance she won't even give me that I swear, you know what
Think I came off wrong, here I'll start over

Like wassup, 
I don't really mean to be rude but last time I seen you two,
I heard ya'll broke up (bummer)
I mean if it's cool right, we can go and chill this song cause straight I
Got a crush on you, crush on you
Got a crush on you, crush on you
Got a crush on you, crush on you

Shit what you waiting for check yes or check no

Uh, it started out I had a party at my house
Drinks and everybody and a couple girls on the couch
Look at them they burned out they got they skirts all up
Another chick talkin bout she got a blunt rolled up
And so I did the done that, I think I'm 'bout to make it happen 
If she had another friend so I'm 'bout to get it crackin'
Smoke a blunt outside no lighter but some matches
And I only hit the blunt cause I knew she was givin' action
You can't pass on that bro plus she was blonde
And she got some nice hips the girls get it from they momma
I hit the sex room then we gotta change up the drama
This girl gone wild I think I'm loving her persona
She like to wear Prada Louie V. & Gabbana
Street clothes over lingerie on her bottom
I can't stop staring adrenaline rush
But I had to suck it up and tell this cutie wassup

Like wassup, 
I don't really mean to be rude but last time I seen you two,
I heard ya'll broke up (bummer)
I mean if it's cool right, we can go and chill this song cause straight I
Got a crush on you, crush on you
Got a crush on you, crush on you
Got a crush on you, crush on you

Shit what you waiting for check yes or check no

[New Boyz:]
What's your name, where you goin' baby
Can I come let you empty out my bank account, insufficient funds
Fo'real, I know you wanna hang like wet clothes
She whispered in my ear like let's go
We can hop in the beamer or the Lexus
I'm tryna bust and I ain't talkin' bout the metro
I'm nasty yup I don't give a f*ck
It's a target on your pussy bet I hit it up
Can't stop won't stop like the young ones
I got some thing me and you can do for fun fun
So what's the deal, is you with the business?
She can't the the d*ck she won't let a n*gga finish
She back it up, back it up and take a pose
She doin' shit that make me wanna take her home
I'm like get it get it get it get it get it girl
I smack her on the ass and tell her to get it some more

Like wassup, 
I don't really mean to be rude but last time I seen you two,
I heard ya'll broke up (bummer)
I mean if it's cool right, we can go and chill this song cause straight I
Got a crush on you, crush on you
Got a crush on you, crush on you
Got a crush on you, crush on you---Lyrics submitted by Brooklyn.
