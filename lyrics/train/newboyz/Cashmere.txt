You want a buff Nick Cannon 
Or a young LL 
That's the point I'm tryna make 
Cause he dumb ass hell 
And I could make you fall in love after one quick meal 
Then she stopped, paused, stared in my eyes 
And for the first time moved her mouth to reply 
She said that she kissed a girl and she liked it 
And ever since then I knew she was a full blood dike chick
Whaat,wha,wait did she just,what she say,wha 
Hell nah 

Cashmere (cashmere) Cashmere (cashmere) 
That's why yo breath stink 
Cashmere (cashmere) Cashmere (cashmere) 
What the hell's wrong with yo teeth? 
Cashmere (cashmere) Cashmere (cashmere) 
When I said that I liked you I lied 
Cashmere (cashmere) Cashmere (cashmere)

Ayyo don't get me wrong though. We love lesbians...Just not you.
