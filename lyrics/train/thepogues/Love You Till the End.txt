I just want to see you, when you're all alone,
I just want to catch you if I can.
I just want to be there when the morning light explodes.
On your face it radiates.
I can't escape.
I love you 'till the end.

I just want to tell you nothing you don't want to hear.
All I want, is for you to say:
Oh, why don't you just take me where I've never been before?
I know you want to hear me catch my breath.
I love you 'till the end.
I love you 'till the end.

I love you 'till the end.
I love you 'till the end.

I just want to be there, when we're caught in the rain.
I just want to see you laugh, not cry.
I just want to feel you when the night puts on its cloak.
I'm lost for words, don't tell me - 'cause all I can say:
I love you 'till the end.
I love you 'till the end.

I love you 'till the end.
I'll love you 'till the end.
I'll love you 'till the end.
All I can say:
I'll love you 'till the end.
I'll love you 'till the end.
I'll love you 'till the end.
It's all I can say.
I'll love you 'till the end.
I'll love you 'till the end.
I'll love you 'till the end.---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
