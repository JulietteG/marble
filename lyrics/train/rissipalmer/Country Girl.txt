It's the way I think not how I talk -- oh no
It's a pride you feel that makes you walk the walk -  uh huh
Come Sunday morning palms up in praise -- yeah
It's all about my mama'nem
And how I was raised -- uh huh

It's a state of mine no matter where you're from
Living like your grandma done
Cause good home training ain't a common thing - no
If this is who you are, let me hear you say

oh

CHORUS:
MMHMM
You don't have to be a Georgia peach from Savannah Beach to say
MMHMM
From Arkansas to appreciate a southern drawl
MMHMM
Don't need no kin from West Virginia to have it in ya
MMHMM
Show the world --
You're a country girl

I'm the kind of girl says it with a smile -- oh yeah
That sweet as molasses down home style
I'm watcha might call real corn fed
Oh yeah I'm a country girl born and bred

It's a state of mine no matter where you're from
Living like your grandma done
Cause good home training ain't a common thing -- no no
If this is who you are, let me hear ya say

oh

MMHMM 
You don't have to be a Georgia peach from Savannah Beach to say 
MMHMM 
From Arkansas to appreciate a Southern drawl 
MMHMM 
Don't need no kin from West Virginia to have it in ya 
MMHMM 
Show the world-- 
You're a country girl 

Ladies if you understand 
Let me hear you all clap your hands 
(clap, clap your hands) 
if you hear me and you know you're bad 
Let me hear you all clap your hands 

Ladies if you understand 
Let me hear you all clap your hands yeah

All you country girls clap your hands 

MMHMM 
You don't have to be a Georgia peach from Savannah Beach to say 
MMHMM 
From Arkansas to appreciate a Southern drawl 
MMHMM 
Don't need no kin from West Virginia to have it in ya 
MMHMM 
Show the world-- 
You're a country girl

MMHMM 
If you wanna be a Georgia peach from Savannah Beach to say 
MMHMM 
From Arkansas then sing it with a Southern drawl 
MMHMM 
Don't need no kin from West Virginia to have it in ya 
MMHMM 
Show the world-- 
You're a country girl---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
