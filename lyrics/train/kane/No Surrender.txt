I was up, I was down I felt almost everything
I was lost been around still know hardly anything
Get my feet on the ground in the heart of everything
That is just the way that i want it
That is just the way that i want it

Like a shark for the bait, you been always waiting there
Every time just too late, now at last you are standing there
What a fool what a shame in the heart of everything
That is just the way that i want it
That is just the way that i want it

Tonight is the night
Time to leave the pressure behind
But there is no surrender
No no

In the heart of the root there is always something else
In the skies understood and the blame for someone else
And in time i guess we're fine was the heart of everything
That is just the way that i want it
That is just the way that i want it

I don t know why
I guess its just a matter of time
But there is no surrender
No, no surrender

That is just the way that i want it
That is just the way that i want it

Tonight is the night
Time to leave the pressure behind
But there is no surrender,no
There is no surrender no
There is no surrender
No surrender

I was up I was down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
