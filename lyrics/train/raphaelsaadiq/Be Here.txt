(You should be here)
You should be here with me babe
You should be here with me babe
(You should be here)
Girl you know you drive me crazy
Girl you know you drive me crazy
(You should be here)
You should be here with me babe
Girl I wish you were here
You should be here in the mornin time when I'm makin my breakfast 
You should be here beneath me to feel me to heal me 
You shoul be here to wrap me, to trap me, and climb me 
You should be here I'm a good man and I work hard on my night job
(You should be here)
Let me show you what your missin everyday
(You should be here)
Once I get you you aint never gonna walk away
(You should be here)
But I got more than just a big stick and some money
Oooh girl I wish you were here
(You should be here)
(You should be here)
You should be here in the evenin get to sleezin, teasin, 
forget the reason why you should not
Or maybe you should see the tricks that I got...for you momma
Especially if you be my lady lets get lazy and make some babies you get me hot
(You should be here)
Let me show you what your missin everyday 
(You should be here)
Once I get you you aint never gonna walk away
(You should be here)
Cause I got more than just some good d**k and some money
Oooh girl I wish you were here
(You should be here)
(You should be here)
I dont like to be lonely
You should be here with me babe
You should be here with me babe
Girl you know you drive me crazy
Girl you know you drive me crazy
You should be here with me babe
You should be here with me babe
I just wanna drive you crazy

You should be here (Oooohhhh Yeah)
You should be here (Oh Oh Oh Oh Yeah)
You should be here (Oooohhhh Yeah Yeah)
Girl I wish you were here
I wish you were here with me baby
(You should be here)
You don't know what your missin everyday
(You should be here)
In my dreams last night I think I had you everyway
(You should be here) 
Well, I got more than just a big stick and some money
(You should be here)
Oooh girl I wish you were here
You should be here
You should be here
I said I really want you babe
I said I really want you babe
I wish you were here with me
I said I really want you babe
I said I really want you babe (I said I really want you alone with me)
I said I really want you babe
I said I really want you babe (I said I really want you alone with me)
I said I really want you babe---Lyrics submitted by Arcelia.
