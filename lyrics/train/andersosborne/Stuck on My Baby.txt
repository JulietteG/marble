Everybody knows I'm stuck on my baby
Kissin' me dizzy, huggin' and lovin' 
Sweet on my baby for sure 

Tall grass grows, their ain't no maybe
Diggin' the groovin', movin' real slow
Sweet on my baby for sure

She love me all good
Rain or shine
Just like a diamond in a silver mine

Hello everybody, I'm sweet on my baby
I don't gotta tell, you already know
I'm stuck on my baby for sure

Jump around singin' and dancin' all day
She got me all silly, writin' this ditty
I'm dumb for my baby you know

Birds and the bees keep hummin' away
Bumpin' and buzzin', flyin' the sky
I'm high on my baby for sure

She love me all right
Come dusk till dawn
Sun and the moon baby you're the one

Come on everybody, look at my baby yeah yeah
Sweeter than this, don't happen you know
I'm stuck on my baby for sure

She love me all fine
Sweet and hot
Stirin' all around in that honey pot

Hello everybody I've found my baby, yeah yeah yeah
The world's gotta know, I ain't lettin' go
I'm stuck on my baby for sure
Yeah I got my wish, she sealed with a kiss
My baby said yes yes yes
Put on that dress, and gimme that hand, and I'll be your man
I'll love you the best, and then some more
I'm stuck on my baby for sure

Stuck on my baby!
Stuck on my baby for sure---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
