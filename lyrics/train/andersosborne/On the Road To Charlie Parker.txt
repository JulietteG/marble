Yeah you're a mighty mighty fool tryin' to keep up your cool
You're livin' on a ledge, afraid of the edge
You never think ahead, you don't get involved, you're messin' round with trouble that you can't solve
You're like a diamond without any shine
You're like a Rolex that don't show time
You point you're little finger and wave your little fist
You're driving like a dog through the cold cold mist

On the road road road
On the road road road
On the road to Charlie Parker

On the road road road
On the road road road
On the road to Charlie Parker

Yeah you're kickin' it to the floor
You're runnin' into people
Acting like a Porsche but you're sittin' in a Beetle
You're packin' in your paces there's a wallowing, swallowing
In everybody's skepticism

On the road road road
On the road road road
On the road to Charlie Parker

On the road road road
On the road road road
On the road to Charlie Parker---Lyrics submitted by Jason Anderson.
