Love on an atom, love on a cloud
To see the birth of all that isn't now
Can you imagine a love that is so proud?
It never has to question why or how
Total abandon the love in my dreams
When I wake up I'm soaking in my sheets

Breathe, breathe
Believe, believe, believe, believe

For all of our youth
We have craved them
Their beauty and their truth

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Believe, believe
That we are loud like

Love on an atom, love on a cloud
To see the birth of all that isn't now
Can you imagine a love that is so proud?
It never has to question why or how

For all of our youth
We have craved them
Their beauty and their truth

So we name them
And somehow they pull us through
We have craved them
For all of our youth

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
