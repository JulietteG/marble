It's hard to see you again
Now that you're back from the death
It's hard to see you again
so bored being you

It's hard to see you again
Now that you're back from the death
It's hard to see you again
so bored being alive!

Alive!! bye...

It's hard to see you again
acting like you're on some kind of a cross
It's hard to see you again
an emotional retard
It's hard to see you again
unaware that I'll mean not be lost

It's hard to see you again
so bored being alive!

Alive!! bye...

It's hard to see you again
Walking around with that ego on your face
It's hard to see you again
So full of barbarity
It's hard to see you again
Caught in a trap like you can not scape
It's hard to see you again
so bored being alive

Alive!! bye..---Lyrics submitted by Beto.
