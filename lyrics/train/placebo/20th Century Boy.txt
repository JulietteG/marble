Friends say its fine, friends say its good
Everybody says its just like Robin Hood
I move like a rat, talk like a cat, sting like a bee
Babe Im gonna be your man
And its plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
Im your toy your twentieth century boy

Friends says its fine, friends says its good
Everybody says its just like Robin Hood

Fly like a plane, drive like a car, hold out your hand
Babe Im gonna be your man
And its plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
Im your boy your twentieth century toy

Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy

Friends say its fine, friends say its good
Everybody says its just like rock n roll
I move like a cat, talk like a rat, sting like a bee
Babe Im gonna be your man
And its plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
Im your toy your twentieth century boy

Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy I wanna be your toy---Lyrics submitted by fruitcake.
