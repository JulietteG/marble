Say what you believe...

Woke up this morning I was laid out flat on the dark side
With the moon and the room on the wrong side 
I took a needle, sewn myself right back at the seams
I saw my universal gleam
I see the wonder of life and look for the wall
Just taking a walk in the sun
In time...
In just a second like the ghost of a bad idea
I feel myself getting the fear
C'mon...
Have we decided if we like being part of the plan
The sands are shifting and theres nowhere to land
It's on...
It doesn't matter if all the best tickets are sold
and all the old stories are told 
I know...
You're gonna tell me that you hear every word I say
But the future gets written today 
Yeah the future gets written today

[Spoken:]
Don't be deceived when our revolution has been finally stamped out and they pat you paternally on the shoulder and say that there's no inequality worth speaking of and no more reason for fighting, because if you believe them, they will be completely in charge in their marble homes and granite banks from which they rob the people of the world under the pretense of bringing them culture...
Watch out, for as soon as it pleases them, they'll send you out to protect their gold in wars, who's weapons rapidly developed by servile scientists will become more and more deadly, until they can, with the flick of the finger, tear a million of you into pieces---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
