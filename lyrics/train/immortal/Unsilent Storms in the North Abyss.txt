Delight of the moon is burning inside
Spiritless I lay on cryptic stones
Mesmerising snow wait silent above me
And my yearn for frost grow strongly.
I am demon

A demon with a shadowed face
Entering to my wintercoffin
Awaiting to see the dawnless realms
Staring into a ground of glass
A perfect view I could failed into my eyes
The unsilent storms in the north abyss---Lyrics submitted by upendra.
