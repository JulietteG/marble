That seem uncrossable?
And have you any mountain
That you cannot tunnel through?

God specializes
In things thought impossible
And He will do what no other
No other power but holy power can do

 (God specializes)
God specializes
 (God specializes)
When your body
 (God specializes)
Is full of disease
 (God specializes)

And your medicines
 (God specializes)
It don't give you no ease
 (God specializes)
God specializes
 (God specializes)
Yeah, God specializes
 (God specializes)

Are you friendless?
 (God specializes)
Are you friendless and in despair?
 (God specializes)
And nobody, nobody, nobody
 (God specializes)
Nobody seems to care
 (God specializes)

God specializes
 (God specializes)
Oh, He'll be right there
 (God specializes)
Oh
 (God specializes)
God specializes
 (God specializes)

Have you any rivers
 (God specializes)
That seem uncrossable?
 (God specializes)
And any mountain
 (God specializes)
That you cannot, you cannot
 (God specializes)
You cannot tunnel through?
 (God specializes)

Ay, hey, He specializes
 (God specializes)
I still, I still believe
 (God specializes)
Oh, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord
 (God specializes)
Hey, hey

And He will do
(And He will do)
Oh, what no other power
(No other power)
No other power but holy power
(No other power)
Yeah, can do---Lyrics submitted by Lamont Gilliam.
