You got the love that every girl needs
You got the kind of love I want
I dont want you to set me free
Ooh no, baby dont

I gotta have your looks
To get up in the morning time
Sun is about to shine above and yonder
Come on and give me whats mine

Come on and do (do)
Do your duty (do your duty)
Come on and do (do)
Do your duty (do your duty)
Waa do (do)
What youre supposed to do (do your duty)

Do what youre supposed to do
Do what you know you got to do

Do your duty

[sax solo]

You cant deny it, baby dont try it
Come on and give it on up
I gotta have it, cant do without it
Ooh eeh, shown off
Your love is all I need
And I cant help myself
You baby only you
I dont want nobody else

Come on and do (do)
Do your duty (do your duty)
Come on and do (do)
Do your duty (do your duty)
Do (do)
What youre supposed to do (do your duty)

Do what youre supposed to do
Do what you know you got to do

Do your duty
Do your duty

Come on and do (do your duty)
Do your duty (do what you got to do)
You better do (do your duty)
Do your duty (do what you got to do)
If you dont do it (do)
Somebody else will (do what you got to do)
Come on, baby (do)---Lyrics submitted by Michael Mayors.
