I love to know when you are lonely
I love to know when you are blue
If I can't see that look in your eyes
The look I hope to see in you
I hope some day you say you'll love me
That would mean so much to me
But in the meantime I'll make you happy
I'll sing a love song to you

CHORUS:
I'll sing a love song to you, babe
I'll sing a love song to you
I take away the sadness and put a smile on your face
I'll sing a love song to you
I'll sing a love song to you, baby
I'll sing a love song to you
I take away the sadness and put a smile on your face
I'll sing a love song to you

There will never be a moment
When you don't cross my mind
If that old saying is really true
All things in time
But I just, I just keep on hoping
That someday you'll look my way
But in the meantime I'll make you happy
I'll sing a love song to you

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Michael Mayors.
