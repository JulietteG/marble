Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said that you'd stay forever
But if you must go, darling I'll set you free
But I know in time, we'll be together
I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cuz' in my heart, i know

[CHORUS]
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong, i'm sure,
Sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days, oh,
Love will lead you back

One of these nights
I'll hear your voice again
And you're gonna say
How much you miss me
You'll walk out this door,
But someday you'll walk back in
But darling I know,
I know this will be
Sometimes it takes
Sometime out on your own now,
To find your way back home

[CHORUS]

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cuz' in my heart, I know.......

[Repeat Chorus x 2]---Lyrics submitted by Rantanya.
