For my whole life
I have been burning down bridges
My only problem was foresight
I was standing on them
I never looked down
And now I am knee deep in your bullshit
If you're ready for battle then I'm ready for war
So we can dance if you want lies

How easily we are deceived
How easily we believe lies

I will not run out of ammo
No more bowing my head
If every day is another slug
I will pull them out of my
I will not run out of ammo
No more bowing my head
If every day is another slug
I will pull them out of my chest

So raise your voices
And hold your hopes up high
Tell your stories
Run your mouth
And tell your lies

After all this time
Don't wash my blood off of your hands
Let it crack and stain you
So the outside can match the in
Oh
Does it make you the fucking toast of the town
To pull yourself up
On those you're always putting down

So raise your voices and hold your hopes up high
Tell your stories
Run your mouth
And tell your lies
So raise your voices and hold your hopes up high
Tell your stories
Run your mouth
And tell your

You curse my name
Burn down my house
As I bare my soul you cast your doubt
And I can live without

You're passing judgement
You're passing judgement
With side long glances
With side long glances
Am I splitting hairs or 
Do I dare to say 
You've had your chances
You're passing judgement
With side long glances
Am I splitting hairs or 
Do I dare to say
You've had your chances

So raise your voices and hold your hopes up high
Tell your stories
Run your mouth 
And tell your lies
So raise your voices and hold your hopes up high
Tell your stories
Run your mouth 
And tell your lies

Curse my name
Curse my name
Curse my name
Curse my name
