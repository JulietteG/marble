you took me home
i drank too much
'cause of you my liver turns to dust
cold rust takes cold creeping cold pain
do you understand what i mean?
will you feel your soul drop to the floor?
like a hole, like an open bleeding sore
then you'll have bled like i bled
and you'll have wept as i wept

suck me down and time  to rock and roll
let's hit the bar
let's lose control
one false move, you took me home
one false move, you run alone

but looks so good and feels so nice
I've paid the price, I'll cut you out
just to hear you scream
get away from, get away from me

and i can feel my heart beat racing
wasn't real, wasn't like myself
but get away from, get away from
get away from you

should have turned and ran like hell
last time i got a taste of you
i should have turned and ran like hell
but I'll see it through 

should have turned and ran like hell
last time i got a taste of you
i should have turned and ran like hell
but I'll see it through 
but i'll see it through

you-have got me like a plague
weakness- with weakness
but i degress wrapped around this
you're just like all the rest

suck me down and start to rock and roll
let's hit the bar
let's lose control
one false move, you took me home
one false move, you run alone---Lyrics submitted by Hipi.
