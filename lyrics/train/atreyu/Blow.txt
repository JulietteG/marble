So fuckin' blow those words out the back of your head,
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit,
You tell me lies, and you get what you get,
so blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.

Oh my god did you just hear
lies are coming back in style?
Oh my god this seems so real that they find you,
and confine you

So shut your mouth, we've heard it all.
Hypocrite's and critics all
can fuck off we do this for our souls,
our souls.

What they say, won't make us go away.

So fuckin' blow those words out the back of your head,
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit,
You tell me lies,
and you get what you get,
so blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.

We're not sorry and we won't conform.
It's not our choice but something inborn.
If we fail followin' are hearts
can you blame us? (No, no, no)

A square peg in a black hole
We don't fit in that's the way it goes.
You should of not thought you're better than us,
no, you're not.
(No, no, no)

What they say, won't make us go away.

So fuckin' blow those words out the back of your head,
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit,
You tell me lies,
and you get what you get,
so blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.

So fuckin' blow those words out the back of your head,
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit,
You tell me lies,
and you get what you get,
so blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.
(Blow, blow, blow)
Blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.

Tell yourself yourself you're not alone at all.
(Looking out your window, know you're all alone)
Oh, tell yourself you're not alone at all. (At all)
(Staring out your window, know you're alone)

What they say, won't make us go away.
Go away, go away, go away.

So fuckin' blow those words out the back of your head,
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit,
You tell me lies,
and you get what you get,
so blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.

So fuckin' blow those words out the back of your head,
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit,
You tell me lies,
and you get what you get,
so blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.
(Blow, blow, blow)
Blow those fuckin' words out the back of your head.
(Of your head, of your head, of your head)
Yea!---Lyrics submitted by Anne.
