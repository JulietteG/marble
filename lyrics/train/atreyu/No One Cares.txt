All Welled Up
I Can Taste The Winter
I Would Shut Up If
I Thought That It Mattered
That What It Feels Like
When Your Stitched Into This Skin
I feel Stuck
And No One Thinks Somethings Missing
Somethings Missing

No One Cares
No One Listens
Screaming Words
That You Fake Hearing
No One Cares
No One Listens Anymore

My Eyes Burn
As Im Bury How Im Feeling
Close My Eyes
Its My Life That I Have Been Stealing
Its Alright Why Do I Feel
A Senses Of Wronging
I Had It All!
And Yet I Thought That Somethings Missing
Somethings Missing

REPEAT 2x
No One Cares
No One Listens
Screaming Words
That You Fake Hearing
No One Cares
No One Listens Anymore

So Paranoid
Iv Been Hiding From The Sun
Im Tired Of Being Afraid Of Everything
And Everyone
Im So Tired!

REPEAT 3x
No One Cares
No One Listens
Screaming Words
That You Fake Hearing
No One Cares
No One Listens Anymore---Lyrics submitted by holly.
