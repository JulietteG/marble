It's so hard, to see when your eyes are rollin',
In the back of your head. It's even harder to
speak when everything youv'e said just comes
out wrong.
Gutted like a pig, all you want is the world to
bleed,
someone somewhere stole your desire
The pain akin to, being punched in the throat,
and stabbed in the chest
You would rather bleed than be without her
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your
ears
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry,
your screams play in your empty room
It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling
in the back of your head its even harder to speak when everything youv'e said just comes out wrong
Your bed swallows you whole as the days
bleed together, torment on the lips
Of a loved one, and if you try hard enough,
you can almost taste her, feel her pass and
Scream, OH GOD WHY ME
You would rather bleed than be without her
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your
ears It's so hard to see when your eyes are
rolling in the back of your head
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your
ears
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry,
your screams play in your empty room
It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling
in the back of your head
It's even harder to speak when everything you
say just comes out wrong---Lyrics submitted by Hailee.
