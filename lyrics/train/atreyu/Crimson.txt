I feel it welling up inside 
And Robert Smith lied, 
Boys do cry and with 
Blood tears in my eyes Im an Anne Rice novel come to life. 
I cant hide the monster anymore. 
One can, only feel desolate for so long until 
One starts to change into 
Something the mirror doesn't recognize. 
Metamorphosize. 
The darkness has been biding its time
To claim its latest victim, 
Fresh meat for carnal desires, 
To become, what I became. 
I viewed the sun for the last time. 

Will you still hold me when you see what I have done? 
Will you still kiss me the same, 
When you taste my victim's blood? 
So crimson and red,
I feel it flowing from your lips. (Crimson and red)
My heart is dead and so are you. 

And it pulses through, 
The desire to change, to deconstruct 
All of my,
All of my, past failings. 
But where to begin, because when you live in sin
Its hard to look at saints,
Without them reflecting your jet black aura back on you. 
And all I have is hope
My inner burns not fading, 
Ill wipe the blood from my cheek and get on with my day. 

Will you still hold me when you see what I have done? 
Will you still kiss me the same, 
When you taste my victims blood? 
So crimson and red, 
I feel it flowing from your lips. (Crimson and red)
My heart is dead and so are you.

And all I have is hope 
And all I need is time 
To bury in pine under six feet of time 
The lies I told me about myself. 
Claw my way out, 
Pick the splinters from under my fingernails. 
I wont lose hope, 
I wont give in. 
Just live and breathe, try not to die again.
Just live and breathe, try not to die again.
Just live and breathe, try not to die again.
I try not to die again.

Will you still hold me when you see what I have done? 
Will you still kiss me the same, 
When you taste my victims blood? 
So crimson and red, 
I feel it flowing from your lips. (Crimson and red)
My heart is dead and so are you.

Will you still hold me when you see what I have done? 
Will you still kiss me the same, 
When you taste my victims blood? 
So crimson and red, 
I feel it flowing from your lips.(When you taste my victim's blood)
My heart is dead and so are you.---Lyrics submitted by Akshay.
