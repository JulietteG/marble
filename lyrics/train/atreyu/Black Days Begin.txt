We're all hell bent on destruction
Trying to erase black spots on our souls
Hide from a violent eruption
Cataclysmic engulfing us all.

Lay down (lay down)
Tonight (tonight)
In front of the things
That conquer us all.

Your body, it taunts me
Your flesh is, oh so haunting.

Chorus:
Children of the night.
Throw your hands up in the air.
We all know we've lost the fight.
Hope dies out and we can see the end.
Black days begin.

Walk down this path of temptation
Deny the flesh ignore whats crawling below.

Stay true (stay true)
Stay cold (stay cold)
In front of the things
That conquer us all!

Your body, it taunts me
Your flesh is, oh so haunting.

Chorus

Solos

Your body, it taunts me
Your flesh is, oh so haunting.---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
