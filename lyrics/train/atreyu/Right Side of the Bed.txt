Come on!

I can see her now.
Dancing round, her drink in hand
all her baggage in tow
i just wanna fucking let it go

all my luck has turned to pain
i take your guilt and reflect it into me
and now i kiss it goodbye
my last dance, and a fatal lie

Who's sleeping on my right side of the bed tonight
have you ever cried so hard, maybe you'll just die
Who's sleeping on my right side of the bed tonight
have you ever cried so hard, have you ever cried so hard

there she goes again
another masquerade of our circumstance
she'll fuck you just for the taste
i just wish that i could replace
all the memories of
what makes my blood run cold
let the blood run through me
i say goodbye to a word we hate

Who's sleeping on my right side of the bed tonight
have you ever cried so hard, maybe you'll just die
Who's sleeping on my right side of the bed tonight
have you ever cried so hard, have you ever cried so hard

She came and went
and on through my hands
but i stared in her eyes and saw some pieces that say goodbye
sometimes when your holding on, you never see the light

With flowers in her hair
gazed upon with dead lovers eyes
she never looked so good, and i never felt so right x2
i never felt so WRONG

(solo guitar)

With flowers in her hair
gazed upon with dead lovers eyes
she never looked so good, and i never felt so right

Who's sleeping on my right side of the bed tonight
have you ever cried so hard, maybe you'll just die
Who's sleeping on my right side of the bed tonight
have you ever cried so hard, have you ever cried so hard---Lyrics submitted by mimzi.
