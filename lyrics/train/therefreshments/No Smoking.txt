When I started out they told me it was cool.
But times have changed.  Now I'm the fool.
Two packs a day.  Without a doubt 
I'm truly hooked.  I can't put it out.
Ain't gonna stop until I drop.

Now I've owned this habit for thirty years.
I'm feeling just fine, so don't shed no tears.
I oughta think about the money I could save
The doctor just talking about an early grave.
Lungs as black as coal.  I'm a lonesome soul.

Well, we can't smoke here, can't smoke there.
I can't smoke anywhere.
It's getting tough.  I ain't joking.
Signs everywhere sayin "no Smoking"

Well we can't smoke here, can't smoke there.
I can't smoke anywhere
It's getting tough.  I ain't joking.
Signs everywhere sayin "no Smoking"

Well ashtrays as rare as a rocking horse.
Everywhere I go, people slammin' their doors.
Everybody's after me.  Soon there's no place left to be.
Now it's sweeping right across the nation.
Its poor ol' me in a non-smoking generation.

They got me standing on the balcon' just my kitchen fence.
When I ask for a light, there ain't no chance.
I am all alone in the smoking zone.

Well we can't smoke here, can't smoke there.
I can't smoke anywhere
It's getting tough.  I ain't joking.
