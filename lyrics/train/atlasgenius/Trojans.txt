Take it off
Take it in
Take off all the thoughts of what we've been
Take a look
Hesitate
Take a picture you could never recreate

Write a song
Make a note
For the lump that sits inside your throat
Change the locks, change the scene
Change it all but can't change what we've been

Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head

It's ok if it's gone
The thoughts that you had that it was the one
And oh what is left?
For all those times is that what you get?
Oh regardless
The walls get painted anyway
Oh you're guarding
The gates, but it all got away

Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head

Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head

Take it off
Take it in
Take off all the thoughts of what we've been
Take a look
Hesitate
Take a picture you could never recreate
Write a song
Make a note
For the lump that sits inside your throat
Change the locks, change the scene
Change it all but can't change what we've been

Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head
Your trojan's in my head

Take it off
Take it in
Off all the thoughts of what we've been
Take off all the thoughts of what we've been---
