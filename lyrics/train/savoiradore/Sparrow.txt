Tell me again how we got the way we are
I just can't watch you push it so far

Watch your back
I want you to not do that
To not let it show

Cause if you're mine
I can't be with you all the time
You just didn't know

Don't you believe a word I say
I can't get you far enough away
All a lie, it's all a lie

I didn't know how we got the way we are
It doesn't show but it's not so far away

Watch your back
I worry you won't do that
Whenever you go

Cause if you're mine
You won't forget it any time
You just didn't know

Don't you believe a word I say
I can't get you far enough away
All a lie, it's all a lie

Don't you follow me to the ground, ooh oooooooh
Don't you follow me to the ground, ooh oooooooh

Don't you believe a word I say
I can't get you far enough away
All a lie, it's all a lie---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
