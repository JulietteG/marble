We were nothing when alone
Mountain top became the throne
Even in the darkest night
We could always make the light
And find a shelter in the stone

We set our secret world on fire
Travelers of burning miles
Gotta keep moving on
If we want to stay along
On this caravan tonight

I've said it once, I've said it twice
My hand is your hand tonight
I can see a world complete
Our empire of light

Pretty child, follow me
You always know where you should be
Even in the darkest night
We could always make the light
Show me what I need to see

I've said it once, I've said it twice
My hand is your hand tonight
I can see a world complete
Our empire of light---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
