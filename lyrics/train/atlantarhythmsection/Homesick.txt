Guitars ring through the dead of night
Scream so blue sound so right
Make You Homesick
Listen close to the guitar man
A native son in a foreign land
The boy is homesick
Homesick four days gone by

Where were you in '69
Smokin dope and drinkin wine
Just a outlaw
Distant drums beat an old refrain
Shakes the feet pounds the brain
Like a buzzsaw
In the darkness down the hall
Blacklight posters on the wall
Jimi Hendrix
Someones lost in yesterday
Hazy dreams of Monterey.... and Woodstock

Homesick
Four days gone by
To kiss the sky
Guitars ring through the dead of night
Sing so blue sound so right
Makes you Homesick
Listen close to the guitar man
A native son in a foreigin land
The boy is homesick---Lyrics submitted by Jimmy Traylor.
