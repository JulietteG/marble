I am a man, on the verge of extinction.
I am broken, but not beaten.
My heart still beats, and when it beats, it beats for you.
You don't even know what you did, when you did what you did to me.
You don't even know how it feels to feel that you just won't feel for me.

I am a man, on the edge of an ice age.
I am frozen, but still twitching.
My blood still flows and when it flows, it flows to you.
You don't know what it sounds like, not to hear your voice.
You don't know what it smells like, to wake up without your smell.

I am a man, on the verge of destruction.
I am shattered, but still whole.
My breath still breathes and when it breathes, it breathes for you.
