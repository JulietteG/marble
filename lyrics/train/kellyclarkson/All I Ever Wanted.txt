(verse 1 )
Tear out the photographs 
but yesterday won't let go
everyday everyday every minute
here comes the emptiness
just can't leave lonely alone
everyday everyday hey hey
this second chancin's really getting me down
you give and takin' everything i dreamed about

(chores 1)
It's time you let me know
let me know just let go
all i ever wanted
all i ever wanted
was a simple way to get over you
all i ever wanted 
all i ever wanted
was an in-between to escape this desprate scene
where every lie reveals the truth
baby cause all i ever wanted 
all i ever wanted was you

(verse 2)
I'd rather walk alone
don't want to chase you around
everyday everyday every minute
i tought a thousand times
for i let you drag me down
everyday everyday hey hey
your new beginning was a perfect ending
but i keep feeling we've already been here before

(chores 1)

(verse 3)
Tell me with so many out there
why i always turn to you
your goodbyes tear me down every time
and it's so easy to see that the blame is on me

(chores 2)
All i ever wanted
all i ever wanted
was a simple way (simple way) to get over you
all i ever wanted 
all i ever wanted
was an in- between to escape this desprate scene
all i ever wanted
all i ever wanted
was a simple way to get over you
all i ever wanted 
all i ever wanted
was an in- between to escape this desprate scene
where every lies reveals the truth
baby cause all i ever wanted 
all i ever wanted was you---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
