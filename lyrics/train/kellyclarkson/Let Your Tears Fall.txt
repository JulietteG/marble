Watch a tear fall, let them fall, fall and I'll
Make the seas calm, take you in my arms, you cry
Let your tears fall, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall
It's not a crime to fall apart sometimes
It's not a crime to ask why, to ask why you cry
Let your tears fall, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall

I will come, no I won't run
I'm not scared to care
Come to me when you're in need
Set it free, let the truth breathe

Tell me all your secrets, tell me your fears
I won't push you away, I'll only pull you near
I won't judge you
I'ma help you through
Tell me all your secrets, sharing the pain
Confess it all to me, no matter, tell me anything
I won't judge you
I'ma help you through
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
I won't judge you
I'ma help you through

So give it all, give it all to me
And you can call whenever you need me, you cry
Let your tears fall, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall

I know you've been on your knees
I run to your side, baby, I run to your side, baby
I know you've been on your knees
I run to your side, baby, I run to your side, baby---
