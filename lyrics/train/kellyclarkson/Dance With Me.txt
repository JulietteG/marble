Lights of London, lights of Spain
Lights of New York, light of LA, LA
Streets of laughter, streets of pain
The morning crashes, still the night remains
The night remains

And when the music starts and the lights go down
We will all be found
No one's fighting anyone, we're all dancing on the ground

C'mon and dance with me
C'mon and dance with me
Feel the music like a lover's kiss
Feel the rhythm like a warm embrace
C'mon and dance with me
C'mon and dance with me
C'mon and dance with me
I'm wide awake

It's 4 AM and the room won't stop
My heart is pounding, how your body rocks
Your body rocks
My lips, they quiver on your skin
Let's take this dance and just breath you in
Breathe you in

Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me

C'mon and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah---
