our love story
could be kinda gory
far from boring
we'd meet at a post- apocalypse.
ya I'd be slowly walking
in a group stalking you,
you'd be the only man alive
that I could not resist.

(chorus)
than all of your friend would try to kill us
but only because they'd be jealous
that our love is deeper than Edward and Bella's, oh
  if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brains
I'd just want your heart,ya I'd want your heart, just want your heart, yeah oh
 if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, I'd want your heart just want your heart cuz I want ya

you'd be hiding in a second floor apartment
knockin all the stairs down to save your life, from the undead
double-barrel shotgun, takin out the slow ones
than you'd see the passion burning in my eye
and I'd keep my head

(chorus)
than all of your friends would try to kill us
but only because they'd be jealous
that out love is deeper than Edward and Bella's, oh
if I were zombie I'd never eat your brains
I'd just want your heart ya I'd just want your heart, just want your heart yeah oh
if I were a zombie I'd never eat your brains
I'd just want your heart ya I'd just want your heart, just want your heart cuz I want ya.

and I'd try, not to bite and infected you because I respect you too much and thats why I'd wait until we got married oh
and our happiest day would be spent
picking off all your friends
then they would see a love this deep won't stay buried

if I were a zombie I'd never eat your brains
I'd just want your heart ya i'd just want your heart, just want your heart, ya oh
if I were a zombie I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart ya I'd just want your heart just want your heart cuz I want ya.---Lyrics submitted by Tasha Dearden.
