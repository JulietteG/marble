Safety net, don't hold me now
In this hole I've fallen down
Secret home I made and found
And you wait to breathe

Skin of all, skin of all
I've had enough, ooh ohh
Skin of all
And in the sickness, you have faith
And in the thickness you find me
Finally
In the city, you find pain
And the people you see there
That remind you of your role
Let me go

Skin of all, skin of all
I've had enough, ooh ooh
Skin of all
And in the sickness, you have faith
And in the thickness you find me
Finally, finally
That's what they say (?)
Finally---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
