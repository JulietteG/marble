It's a lovely night for dancing
And I get this feeling from a love song
And oh, from sunset to sunrise
You know the feelin' from the music turns me on
And oh, from the twilight to the blue skies
You know I feel like dancin' all night long

Such a lovely night for dancing
And I get this weakness from a love song
And oh, from sunset to sunrise
No more weakness for the music turns me on
And oh, from the twilight to the blue skies,
You know I feel like dancin' all night long

Get up and dance with me
Get up and dance with me
Get up and dance with me
Get up and dance with me---
