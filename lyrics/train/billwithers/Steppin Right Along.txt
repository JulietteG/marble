Steppin' right along
Like it ain't nothing, baby
Something just, something blew your mind
Something come along
To make you stronger, baby
But you know it got to take time

Talk a little deep
To make you wonder, baby
And it's not that same old line

Whoa, look out now

Something some time
Come along and blow your mind
Watch out, girl
Somebody hot (hot!)
Make you give up everything you got

Steppin' right along
Like it ain't nothing, baby
Something just, something just blew you mind
Something come along
That kick like thunder, baby
You know got to give it up for them
Right on time

'Would it be wise or weak?'
You wonder, baby
Goodbye Reason, Hello Rhyme
Look out, girl

Something some time
Come along and blow your mind
Watch out, girl
Somebody hot (hot!)
Make you give up everything you got

Steppin' right along
Like it ain't nothing, baby
Something come along
And just blew your mind
'Some kind of magic spell?'
You wonder, baby
Make a drink of muddy water
Taste like wine

And 'Would it be wise or weak?'
You wonder, baby
Goodbye Reason, Hello Rhyme
'Love made me do it!'

Something some time
Come along and blow your mind
Watch out, girl
Somebody hot (hot!)
Make you give up everything you got

Said I will followthe Lord in Heaven
I wanna bethy holding angel
'Til the Kingdom come
Thy will be down
Down here on earth
Just like it is in Heaven
Give us this day
Ourdaily bread
Give us our sins
We forgive our brothers
Lead us far away, every day,
From temptation
Heavenly Father
Deliver us from evil
Thine is the kingdom
And the Power
And the Glory
Forever!
Heavenly Father
Sweet Heavenly Father
Heavenly Father
Sweet sweet Heavenly Father
Sweat ol' Heavenly Father---
