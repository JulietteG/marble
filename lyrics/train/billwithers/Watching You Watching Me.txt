Watching you watching me 
It's so easy to see 
That it's my loving you 
That puts the starlight in your eyes 

Watching me watching you 
It's so obviously true 
That it's your loving me 
That makes my life a paradise 

When lovers meet 
And light a spark 
Their eyes give the game away 
Somehow it's a feeling you can never hide 
No matter how hard you try 

When lovers speak 
It's from the heart 
And all of the things they say 
Are part of the magic and the mystery 
You hear in a gentle sigh 

Watching you watching me 
Girl, ain't it easy to see? 
That it's my loving you 
That puts the starlight in your eyes 

Watching me watching you 
Girl, I believe that it's true 
That it's your loving me 
That makes my life a paradise 

The times we had 
The fun and games 
The things that I can't forget 
We share in those very special memories 
All lovers do smile about 

I'm so glad you feel the same 
There's nothing to regret 
It's free for the simple love is there for you 
To bring all the feelings out 

Watching you watching me 
Girl, ain't it easy to see? 
That it's my loving you 
That puts the starlight in your eyes 

Watching me watching you 
Girl, I believe that it's true 
That it's your loving me 
That makes my life a paradise 

There's a language 
Spoken only by lovers 
Words and phrases 
That they make with their eyes 
You might try it 
But you'll never change things 

No one comes 

Let's celebrate what life's about 
Let's sing out the melody 
The words and the music to our song of love 
Are sweeter than anything 
'Cause if we wait 
We might lose out 
On things that were meant to be 
With all of the secrets that the heart can hold 
Left dangling on a string 

Watching you watching me 
Girl, ain't it easy to see? 
That it's my loving you 
That puts the starlight in your eyes 

Watching me watching you 
Girl, I believe you know that it's true 
Sweet girl, that I love you 
You make my life a paradise---
