Kingston ey ey
Face drop oooooh oh oh oh

Kingston
I see ya face drop drop drop

You touched my heart and disappear
I never knew how much it hurt here

Ooohh my girl girl girl girl girl

First came trust then came love but
This was none of the above I'm aware

Ooohh my girl girl girl girl girl

But your the one who said that I'd be
Lost without you (no no no no)

You had your fun, couldn't ridethis one
Without you baby (and i know know know)

And now I see ya face drop I told you
Not to leave me
Alone and now that I got my own

I see ya face drop I told you not to count
Me out
Cuz you always tried to fill me with doubt

Sayin that I'd look better if I was
Thinner but you know you

Should of loved me for my inner
When I left you yo I came out a winner

Oh oh, oh oh

If you don't like him I understand
That every girl do for their man

Ooohh my girl girl girl girl girl

I cut it short cuz you got caught
Your not the girl you used to be no more

ooooooh my girl girl girl girl girl

But your the one who said that I'd be
Lost without you (no no no no)

You had your fun, couldn't ride this one
Without you baby (and i know know know)

And now I see ya face drop I told you
Not to leave me
Alone and now that I got my own

I see ya face drop, I told you not to count
Me out
Cuz you always tried to fill me with doubt

Sayin that I'd look better if i was
Thinner but you know you

Should of loved me for my inner
When I left you yo I came out a winner

Oh oh, oh oh

Telling hey come on back who would I be for that I would
Still
Still be yours if you knew how to act

But you wanted less of me a dude like
Me
And I love it when I see your face drop

And now I see ya face drop I told you
Not to leave me
Alone and now that I got my own

I see ya face drop I told you not to count
Me out
Cuz you always tried to fill me with doubt

Sayin that I'd look better if I was
Thinner but you know you

Should of loved me for my inner
When I left you yo I came out a winner

Oh oh, oh oh

And now I see ya face drop I told you
Not to leave me
Alone and now that I got my own

I see ya face drop I told you not to count
Me out
Cuz you always tried to fill me with doubt

Sayin that I'd look better if I was
Thinner but you know you

Should of loved me for my inner
When I left you yo I came out a winner

Oooohh ooh---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
