Wrap u around... wrap u around me... wrap you around

Come over here give some of that something that you got
Take my hand take my heart take me anywhere you are
When I'm losing my mind and this madness just wont stop

I think about you, I think about me, I think about us, together
I think of your eyes, lookin in mine
And I'm better... better
This world's too much, for me to take
Come give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap U around me (2x)

Take me into that place only your love can take me
Come touche me now cause you're the one with the touch that can save me
When it all gets too much when it all gets to greezy

I think about you, I think about me, I think about us, together
I think of your kiss, touching my lips
And I'm better... better

This worlds too much, for me to take
Come give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, Grab hold of me,
Wrap u around me (2x)

Your love surrounds me in my tender shelter
I don't know what could ever love me better
Nothing can make me feel the way I feel when I'm beside you

This worlds too much, for me to take
Come give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me,
Wrap u around me

Oh oh... oh ohhhhhhh

This worlds too much, for me to take
Come give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me,
Wrap u around me (2x) (ohoh ohoh)

Hey oh (12x)---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
