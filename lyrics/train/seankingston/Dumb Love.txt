(Chorus)
girl you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, 
I love you so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
wh-wh-wh-whyyy

(Verse 1)
you tell me that you're leaving
but then you wanna leave me
and never make your way to the door
i tell you that you're too much
and then i'll miss you too much
don't even know what we're fighting for
you keep my car?, girl
and then you go get it fixed
i talk one of them other chicks
just to make you jealous

(Pre-Chrous)
how can we make it right
when we both put up a fit
you make me so mad
it's kind of hard to compete
but when i look into your pretty eyes
my heart just drops

(Chorus)
girl you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, 
I love you so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
wh-wh-wh-whyyy

(Verse 2)
you always talkin reckless
sendin a text message
telling me to back in your goal
and then i get up callin mendez
you soundin so innocent
singing that you cant sleep alone
i go find ? to show how you spend my dough
you wanna go and sell my room and burn up all my clothes

(Pre-Chorus)
how can we make it right
when we both put up a fit
you make me so mad
it's kind of hard to compete
but when i look into your pretty eyes
my heart just drops


(Chorus)
girl you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, 
I love you so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
wh-wh-wh-whyyy

(Bridge)
callin it quits just aint right ?
i'd rather love u then to hate you
i want you to know (ohh)
your my, your my, your my shawty
your my, your my, your my shawty

(Chorus)
girl you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, 
I love you so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
dumb-b-do-b-dumb
wh-wh-wh-whyyy

(Chorus)
