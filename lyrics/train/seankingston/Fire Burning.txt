Lets Go
Hey, hey, hey

Hey Hey
Shawty got that super thing
Hotter than the sun of south in spain
Got me soon as I walked through the door
My pocket started tickle-ing
The way she dropped it low that thang
Got me wanna spend my money on her, her

She get it pop it lock it drop it,
That birthday cake,
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewellery
Shawty is cool like the fire,
Cool like fire

Somebody call 911
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor
Whoa

She won't bring the roof to ground on the dance floor
Whoa

That little shawtys fire burning on the dance floor
Shes fire burning fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawtys fire burning on the dance floor
Fire burning fire burning

The order is one in every hundred years
But aint no doubt im taking it home
I'm afraid we blow them legs
Little mama game is about to change
Shell be on covers over the world
