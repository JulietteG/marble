Lead:
saying you love me comes easy 
showing you love must be hard 
my soul can't take, another broken heart
why do you say you love me 
when you know you really don't mean it
is lust the only factor cause love I just don't see it 
cause love... 

              Chorus
love is complicated (love) love is complicated 

              Lead:
so what you waited for 
love don't live here no more
I've done all I can do but love you just don't do
my love will stand, in the mist of the storm
can you hear me calling from a broken wall 
cause love...

              Chorus:
I don't know why love is

              Bridge:
oh listen here, loving you with all my heart 
always knew we will never part 
but we both know love don't come easy 
that's why love is complicated 
love is complicated (oh) 
I really want to know why love is so complicated---Lyrics submitted by Toya Green.
