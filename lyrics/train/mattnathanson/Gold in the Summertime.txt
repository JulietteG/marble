It's too hot to sleep
Laughing in the heat
We lay together
And watch the sky turn on

Sirens come in waves
Up the fire escape
Every shadow disappearing
Into dawn.

Ooooooh let's keep this going.
I wanna go all in.
We'll never be lonely in the dark

Nobody loves you
The way that I do
The way you shine through
Gold in the summertime

Summer time, summer time
I gotta get that feeling

We could dodge the rain
In some museum cafe
Or run together til the
Storm clouds all get gone

Wander through the streets
F train to the beach
Be in love with being young,
Dazzling and lost

Ooooooh let's keep this going.
I wanna go all in.
We'll never be lonely in the dark

Roof top in Soho
Prince on the radio
The city streets glow
Gold in the summertime

Summer time, summer time
I gotta get that feeling

Let me disappear in your love. Your love
Just to be so near to your love. Real love.---
