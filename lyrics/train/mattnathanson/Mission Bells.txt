I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away

What kind of man misunderstands a woman like you?
Sees her in black and white
It's 5am and the phonebook says that you're not alone
In the cold grey morning light
The only one that's left to trust
My faithless heart wasted us

I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away

What kind of fool thinks love's a prison or a handicap
Only says goodbye
Sinking fast in the rocky waters of Alcatraz
His friends said suicide
The only one that's left to trust
My faithless heart wasted us

I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away

At the end of a Hitchcock movie
A little dark and a lot confusing
I'm the last of the worst pretenders
So lost, so lost in love

At the end of a Hitchcock movie
A little dark and a lot confusing
I'm the last of the worst pretenders
So lost, so lost in love

I had a dream you died
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Mission bells were ringing somewhere higher
I let you get away
I let you get away
I let you get away---
