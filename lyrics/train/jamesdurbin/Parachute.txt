Hangin' like a broken star in the sky
No reason to shine
Thinking I can never be someone's wish
on a first star at night

And I believe
There was nothing left
Left in my chest

Then I lost my grip when you made a wish
I could of never have guessed

I'm gonna free fall
But I won't crash
Hit the ground and I bounce right back
Not coming down no more
No more

I've lost all gravity now
Like walking on the moon
Feels like I'm floating way
Without my parachute

I've lost my fear of flyin'
I'm falling hard for you
Not scared of anything

So I think, I think, I'll just
Jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump jump

Oh oh oh

Straight into you

Jump jump jump jump

I was torn
I was left with a permanent scar
I'd been there before
But you saw through every flaw
found what was lost
So I pulled a record

I'm lettin' go
I'm gonna jump this time
Into the blue

Now I want to go back
Now I want to go back
With someone like you

I'm gonna free fall
But I won't crash
Hit the ground and I bounce right back
I'm not coming down no more
Not coming down no more

I've lost all gravity now
Like walking on the moon
Feels like I'm floating away
Without my parachute

I've lost my fear of flyin'
I'm falling hard for you
Not scared of anything

So I think I'll
I think I'll just
Jump jump jump
Without my parachute

Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute
Jump jump jump
Straight into you
Straight into you

Straight into you

Now I want to go back
Now I want to go back

'Cause I've lost all gravity now
Like walking on the moon
Feels like I'm floating away
Without my parachute

I've lost my fear of flyin'
I'm falling hard for you
Not scared of anything

So I think I'll just
Jump jump jump
Without my parachute

Jump jump jump
Without my parachute

Jump jump jump jump
Without my parachute

Jump jump jump
Straight into you---
