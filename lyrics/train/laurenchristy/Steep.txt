Softly , gently I will lit you down
Cause i don't love you, in the same way now 
I can hold you , but not with lover's arms
Cause you are more of , a brother  to me now 

Chorus:
And I can lie  next to you , but i can't lie to you
SO walk into the sun and watch, run into the rain
For you the future's easy so don't  weep for me it"s getting  (steep)

I love you for , exactly who you are
And I'd say we"ve come the nearest  yet by far

Repeat Chorus (Steeper) 

From where the dark that's where i want to be
Steeper , from going somewhere you won't want to see

So walk into the sun and watch me run into the rain
For you the future's easy , so don't weep yes,
I will watch you.

Walk into the sun and watch me 
Run into the rain drops 
For you the future's easy 
So don't weep  for me  it's getting steep---Lyrics submitted by davejenard.
