Have I ever told you that I'm
Sorry it didn't work out
Have I ever told you that I'm
I'm sorry that I walked out
Have I ever told you that I'm
Sorry that didn't think about how
it was going to make you feel

Have I ever told you that I'm
I'm sorry I wasn't honest
We don't know how these lies
Are going to come back to haunt us
Have I ever told you that I'm
I'm sorry that I broke my promise
That I made to you

But I believe
It was right for me
Or at least it seemed so at the time
But reality
Got the best of me
And I guess I lost my mind
My mind

Have I ever told you that I'm
I'm sorry that I forgot
Just how hard I said I'd try
I thought I did, but I guess not
Have I ever told you that I
I've been thinking about this
quite an awful lot

And I believe
It is right for me
Or at least it seemed so at the time
But reality
Got the best of me
And I guess I lost my mind
My mind

Have I ever told you that I
I love the way you turned out
Have I ever told you that I
I've been watching and I'm so proud
Have I ever told you that I
I'm still trying to figure out
what's inside of me

But I believe
There is hope for me 
And it's going to take some time
And the God who sees
What's inside of me
I know he can change my mind

And I believe
There is hope for me
And it's going to take some time
And the God who sees
What's inside of me
I know he can change my mind
My mind---Lyrics submitted by R.
