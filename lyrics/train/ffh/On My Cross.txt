How wide is your love that you could stretch your arms and go around the world?
And why for me would a Saviours cry be heard.. 
I don't know why you went where I was meant to go,
I don't know why you love me so...

(Chorus)
Those were my nails 
That was my crown
That peirced your hands and your brow
Those were my thorns 
Those were my scorns 
Those were my tears that fell down
And just as you said it would be
You did it all for me
After you counted the cost 
You took my shame; my blame 
On My Cross

How deep is your grace that you could see my need and choose to take my place?
And there for me, these words I'd hear you say
Father, no forgive them for they know not what they do
I will go because I love them so..

Chorus 2xs

After you counted the cost
You took my shame, my blame 
On My Cross---Lyrics submitted by Brienna.
