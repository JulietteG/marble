Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)
Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)
Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)
Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)

I love tattoos, what we gon do?
A full back-piece or a lil ones cool
Spendin all my money on tats and weed
Ink and green is all I need
I keep getting more, its like an addiction
People say Im crazy, they dont know what Im thinkin
Self-expression, keep ya guessin
Wonderin whats next? You could never imagine
Artist to artist, we the hardest, and if you doubt us
We will put you in a place where you will never come around us
Get yo money right, save up for that big tat
Im bout to ink the Roman Coliseum up on my back, like that

Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)
Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)
Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)
Inked up
(That ink is in my skin, my skin)

Started wit one, now I got 15
Cover up my body for the world to see
It aint just a trend when we bend the rules
I love getting dirty looks from the straight-laced fools
They ain t got a clue as to how we do
From the heart of Utica comin straight to you
I feel a rush when the ink meets skin
Let it heal up and well do it again
My tattoos tell the whole story of my life
I love wrestling and I love my mic
I got plans for the rest of my tats
We could keep some simple but they gotta be phat
Full color, so vibrant, you cant hide it, you gotta show it off
I love some fine women gettin tatted they lookin really hot
