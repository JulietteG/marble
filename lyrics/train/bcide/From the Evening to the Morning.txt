Im rollin through my city on a hot summer night
With the top cut down and the windows just right
I got a hot chick and her legs never end
She got a real good body if ya know what Im sayin
Never too much, its never enough
Once our eyes locked on, she was givin it up
How ya doin miss? I like the way that you dance
You got my dick at attention, standin up in my pants
I saw you right from the stage when I was rappin lil mama
I wanna sweep you off yo feet, now ya know that I gotta
I could buy you a drink, but thats just too clich
I wanna do something different in my own private way
Roses petals to the metal like Im hittin the floor
Come get in the jacuzzi, you will see whats in store
The bubbles over the top and we makin it hot
The water pourin over, I just hope it dont stop, cmon

Hook (x2)

I dont care if we will ever get along now
All I care is that we gonna get it on now
From the evenin to the morning I will be with you
And after that I am just content on leavin you

Todays a new day, different city, different state
New dame, same game, man nothin has changed
But the scenery switches as I move farther west
And the girls get hotter like the stars on movie sets
I seen her (I seen her) it was something of beauty
She had her hair pulled back and an apple-bottom booty
As I approached, it was like time stopped
But I know it really didnt, I was checkin my watch
The diamonds glistened off her neck, and Ill show her respect
Now I got her on my arm, headed to bed
I will make your dreams come true, just for the night
Anything you ever wanted or desired in life
I can make it happen, just from all of this rappin
Now that I have your attention, did I mention
Im the man with the grands and the plan
They cant do it like I can, but Im sayin
I aint playin, this a one night stand
