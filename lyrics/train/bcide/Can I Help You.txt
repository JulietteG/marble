You wanna know what its like in my life for me?
I go to work every morning I dont sell trees
I gotta deal with these people and they makin a mess
All the un-needed stress for a lousy pay check
I dont get tips but heres a tip for you
Never fuck with the person thats makin your food
Do my tattoos scare you? I think they do
And you look at me funny like Im gonna be rude
You couldnt buy a fuckin clue and thats the truth
Fuckin stare at the menu on your cell phone too
I dont get this, is the general public really fulla these dumb shits?
They help the economy but they all act above it
Fuckin snobby mommys to punk rejects
Then theres welfare families thats lovin the shit
You could put it on thick and they eatin it quick
And comin back to the counter for a cookie and drink

Hook
Can I help you, what the fuck do you want?
I want a lil side of something but I dont know what (x4)

People in they suits act likie a douche
And used car salesmen lovin all a the food
You got multiple orders? Then you are all goners
The people behind you are hatin you for this!
Get a line a 2 then it turns into 10
And there aint no body but you workin here again
You got no relief and just minimum wadge
And get harassed everyday by the customer base
What the fucks wrong with this bitch? You makin my hit list
Im hatin everything about this whole 9 to 5 shit
Im startin a business, tryin to relieve stress
Cuz everybody in this world seams to be useless
Look at my game now, Im makin it somehow
And everybody in my shoes come follow my lead now
Quit your fuckin job start grindin for pay
Put cha middle finger up and say FUCK SUBWAY!
