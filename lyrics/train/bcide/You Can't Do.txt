You Cant Do

Hook
You cant do what I can do
Playin shows and makin loot
Put my city on the map
How the fuck do yall like that?
You cant do what I can do
Playin shows and makin loot
Put my city on the map
All yall hatin kiss my ass

You wanna smoke a lil bit of weed tonight
I got that stank, its called Northern Lights
Takin first class flights, reachin new heights
Blowin up this place like dynamite
Everybody listen, this is a lesson
Im a dope rapper, its my profession
I clear out classrooms like school shooters
Stealin everybodys shit like a gang of looters
Yall know who I B, C-I-D-E
The man who makes it rock, you wanna party wit me?
Green Room did the beat, thats Dave P
You hear that shit, the drums are nasty
Cant outlast me, Im too flashy
Hardcore champ like Bobby Lashley
You wanna compete, like W-W-E
Get you in a headlock, put you to sleep

Hook

If you gonna start beef, Ill make mince meat
Lookin for some drama, you dont wanna see me or mine
Im a big stallion, full-blooded Italian, watch the lights shimmer
Off my B-Cide medallion
Im a Life Champion, musics my passion
Eatin Subway but Id rather be rappin
Lookin for a slore-bag like Paris Hilton, we could fuck at the Hilton
Record it, make a million and five
Not in night-vision cuz you look like a fiend
Big bags under your eyes and your skin looks green
Call the paparazzi, 8x10 glossy
Makin headlines in the paper like the bombings in Saudi
Arabia, Im takin her back to the mansion
You got loose lips, use em to my advantage
Spendin some cabbage, then imma ravage
That thing between yo legs like I become rabid

Hook

How you gon stop me? Im like a train
Flyin down the tracks and I blew the breaks
Blew the brain of the mainframe
Now it aint about nothing like an exhibition game
Gimme cocaine, Ill go insane
But Ill still be all over like an ad campaign
This is ridiculous, not inconspicuous
But everythings perfect, Im so meticulous,
Time to get serious, you must be delirious
I aint mysterious, thank you for hearin us
You aint a smoka, are you a rolla?
Smoke so weed that Ill be in a coma
Thoughts incoherent, I wouldnt get near it
His heart is still beating and hes still got spirit
Clean like Orbit without the minty flavor
Got followers like Jesus Christ, but I aint a savior
