We like to party from the East to the West coast
Getting hella hyphy and STUPID dumb wit them side-shows
We like to party from the East to the West coast
Getting hella hyphy and STUPID dumb wit them side-shows

B-Cide

Gotta find a car, gotta kick it in drive
Gotta find a hot ho for the rest of the night
But tonight Im in the 7-0-7 to ride
And Cog just picked me up wit some bitches so fine
Show me how they do it in the city by the Bay
Drop top scrapers, love for Mac Dre
Getting thizzed out, keepin it hyphy
Drinks never empty, doin it nightly
People look funny back in New York
Cuz they aint never seen somethin that was hyphy before
They aint seen a movement quite like this
Getting stupid dumb, ghost-ride the whips
I love that shit, its so fresh
Liferdef and Guttar Music all hot to death
They keep the party jumpin, all the girls is dancing
By the end of the night theyll be outta they pants and

Cognito

They say we want C-O-G, we want C-O-G
See me in the club, actin like they know me
Girl, I been around the world, nothin new you could show
So before you get all warm and cozy in my face and nosey
Lets hit the back door and mosey
On out to the parkin lot cuz hoes supposedly
Give it up any time or place for a rap cat
So I keep pills and condoms in my backpack
Im a pimp, drop off at the track is at
If she real good, make enough so I dont hafta rap
Take her on a plane to New York, drop her off wit B-Cide
Make a couple dollars on the EastSide
You aint my girl, you aint my bitch
You aint gotta write my hits or like my kids
All business is separate from friends and fam
And you neither one of them, girl you just a fan cmon

Hex

Liferdef got it on lock from east to west
Like Yuk I smoke a lot just to ease my stress
Late night dippin, lookin out fo the po-lice
Im off the chain like a dog with no leash
We like to party from coast to coast
Big league steps so them hoes get chose
So drunk that Im wobbly-wobbly
Hex he gon fuck? Man I gotta be, prolly
I do it big so the Ds will know
You betta let it go like Keyshia Cole
Cuz all I know is the night is young
Hoes is like cleats so they might sprung
Yeah, ya-did-a just said
Im so focused do what I gotta to touch bread
Its B-Cide and Cog, Hexwhoa
I aint gotta tell you cuz you already know
