I gotta get my shit right
I gotta get my head right
I gotta get my mind right,
Take myself back where I started from

These thoughts of suicide are cloudin my mind
but there's too much goin from me to take that ride
I turn to God for guidance, are you listening Lord?
And if you are, then what am I in all this pain for?
I'm on a path a destruction, my life's in dysfunction
And Liss, she's been getting to me more than something
More than ever cuz she didn't before
But things seam strange now behind closed doors
This is my life, and it's such a struggle
I wanna see the other side when I face that muzzle
I gotta keep my head up theirs more to live
I signed a deal and everything turned to shit
I'm tryin to do what I do, but it seems so strange
Every thought I think a her, can't get it outta my brain
This beautiful girl, she ruined my world
And I want nothing more than to get back with her

I gotta get my life back on track
Their ain't a day that goes by I don't think about that
but every time that I think, my thoughts been shiftin
I think I'm goin crazy in this world that we live in
it's so easy to make mistakes
but they can't get fixed that easily today
I gotta wait (gotta wait) there's more music to make
there's more people in the same situation awake
and they eyes are wide open, filled with hope n' emotion
the fact that they hearts been broken
I seen better days, cried the night away
fightin with myself over this big change
I feel empty (empty) the tanks on E
and every time I wake up it's hard to breathe
you ain't comin back, NAH, not like that
and if you do, I can't forget what's been said

Hook


I been smokin and drinkin tryin to ease the pain
but this pain is a pain that won't go away
I keep havin this dream of her and me
before we kiss I wake up and start to scream
where'd you go? Why'd you leave?
LISS IT'S ME, I'm all choked up and I can't speak
I was nothing but the best to you, never less
now I second guess, my life's a mess
can I get my life back? It's nothin really
but in the long run, it all seems so silly
you were like a mate a soul, we could grow old
but you didn't really want that, now I know
and your doin the same thing, with someone else
prayin every night, you find yourself
but when you find yourself, please find me
or I'll be trapped in here, for all eternity
