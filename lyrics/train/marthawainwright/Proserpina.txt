Proserpina! Proserpina!
Come home to mama, come home to mama
Proserpina! Proserpina!
Come home to mother, come home to mama now

I shall punish the earth
I shall turn down the heat
I shall take away every morsel to eat
I shall turn every field into stone
Where I walk, crying alone

Crying for Proserpina
Proserpina, come home to mama
Come home to mama now

Proserpina! Proserpina!
Go home to your mother
Go home to Hera
Proserpina! Proserpina!
Go home to your mother
Go home to Hera now

She has punished the earth
She has turned down the heat
She has taken away every morsel to eat
She has turned every field into stone
Where she walks, crying alone
Crying for

Proserpina! Proserpina!
Come home to mama, come home to mama
Proserpina! Proserpina!
Come home to mama, come home to mama now

She has turned every field into stone
Where she walks, crying alone
Crying for

Proserpina! Proserpina!
Come home to mama, come home to mama
Proserpina! Proserpina!
Come home to mama, come home to mama now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
