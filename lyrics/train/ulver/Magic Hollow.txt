I want to know if you would go to magic hollow 
Yes, come with me 
Come up with me to magic hollow 
Touch the stars as in a dream 
Everything you touch is deemed
Magic, magic 
Must make the time 
Make it one time to what you are missing
Magic delight beyond your sights 
Fantastic prisons 
Lights and colors lingering 
Spin them, touch, they are splintering 
Magic, it's magic
My side is blessed 
You have not guessed 
So won't you follow 
Follow through the dark 
I hear the lark of magic hollow 
Calling out a melody 
Veiled within my memory 
Magic, magic---Lyrics submitted by Eva Persephone.
