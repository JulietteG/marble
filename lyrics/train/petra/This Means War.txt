Words and music by Bob Hartman 
Based on Romans 16:20, Isaiah 14:12-15

Son of the morning - highest of all 
You had so much going till you took the fall 
Had a place in the glory but you wanted it all 
Impossible odds but you had the gall 
It seemed so unlikely that you would rebel 
Such a worthy opponent that you knew so well 
But you went down fighting when you heard the bell 
Took a third down from heaven when you went to hell 

(Chorus) 
This means war - and the battle's still raging 
War - and though both sides are waging 
The Victor is sure and the victory secure 
But till judgment we all must endure 
This means war! 

Then came the cross - you thought you had won 
You thought you had conquered God's only Son 
"So much for Jesus," you said in jest 
Then you got a visit from an unwelcome guest 

Now it's all over down to the wire 
Counting the days to your own lake of fire 
But you'll go down fighting for all that you're worth 
To try to abolish His image on earth---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Z.
