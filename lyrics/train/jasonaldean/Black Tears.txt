She puts on her work clothes, fishnet pantyhose,
She's got a nickname everybody knows at the gentlemen's club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right,
Makes her money one dollar at a time.
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name,
And she wears the pain

Black tears, rolling down,
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town
She reveals, and they all cheer,
Then she cries, black tears

Jealous of the innocent, sometimes she's convinced,
The boss man is still a friend she needs.
She's tried everything, cheap sex and cocaine,
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
The wrong kind of famous in her momma's eyes,
You can tell she knows it when she cries

Black tears, rolling down
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town,
White lights on the mirror,
Just won't hide, black tears

She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybody's watching

Black tears, rolling down,
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town,
If all the pain would just disappear
She'd quit cryin', yeah she'd quit cryin',
Black tears ---
