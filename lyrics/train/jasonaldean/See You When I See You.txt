Let's don't say goodbye
I hate the way it sounds
So, if you don't mind
Let's just say for now

See you when I see you
Another place, some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you
And I hope its some day soon

God made this ol' world round
And maybe its that way so the paths we go down
Yeah, I will cross again some day
Some day I'll

See you when I see you
Another place, some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you
And I hope its some day real soon

I hope its some day soon

I'll see you when I see you
Another place, some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine, just stop by
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you,
'til then my prayers are with you
And I hope its some day soon

I'll see you when I see you---
