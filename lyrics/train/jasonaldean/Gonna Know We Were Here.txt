You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your moaning runs just as fast as mine
Little to the middle, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
My slam is a little too hard
Might take it just a little to far
My burn, I like it fire
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but the show gonna we were here
Yeah, the show gonna we were here

People talk girl
You know that well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little rated R red-neck dream
Let's play the trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride on to the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't there yet, baby

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
My slam is a little too hard
Might take it just a little to far
My burn, I like it fire
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but the show gonna we were here
Yeah, the show gonna we were here

We only get a chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby let go and remember our name

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
My slam is a little too hard
Might take it just a little to far
My burn, I like it fire
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but the show gonna we were here
Yeah, the show gonna we were here---
