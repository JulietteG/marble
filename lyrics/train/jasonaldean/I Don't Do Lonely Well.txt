Baby since you've been gone
I leave the TV on
Gotta hear somebody's voice
I just need some kind of noise
I lay some pillows down
To wrap my arms around
I pretend I'm holding you
I know it's sad but it's what I do
To keep me from goin' crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Ohh but I don't do lonely well

I got some real good friends
Check on me now and then
Try to get me out at night
Say I need to get a life
It's easy to say alright
When you're not the one goin' crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Ohh but I don't do lonely well

Here comes another sunset
Here comes another long night
I'm not over you yet
No I'm not over you yet

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
Get it done like nobody else
Ohh but I don't do, don't do lonely well
No no no
Don't do lonely well ---
