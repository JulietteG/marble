You like the way that sounds?

Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin up his Bronco
Hes gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
All the girls are getting pretty sprayin on the White Rain
Yeah theyre gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game
Yeah

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but thats the way we get down
In a Hicktown

Well you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his womans smokin Pall Malls watchin Laura Ingalls
And Grannys getting lit shes headin out to bingo
Yeah my buddies and me are goin muddin down on Blue Hole Road
You know You know

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but thats the way we get down
In a Hicktown

(Bridge)

We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but thats the way we get down
Oh Oh We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
Its buck wild yeah but thats the way we get down
In a Hicktown
In a Hicktown
Its the way we get down
In a Hicktown
Yeah in a Hicktown
(Pause)

Awww we aint finished yet:
Got your country boys, & your Red neck girls.
Its the party heard round the world,right here in hick town.
Yea in hick town
The whole town is gettin down

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but thats the way we get down
Oh Oh We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
Its buck wild yeah but thats the way we get down
In a Hicktown
In a Hicktown
Its the way we get down
Awwww take it home---Lyrics submitted by Marie.
