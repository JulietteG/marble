It seems like money,
Is always on our minds these days,
Make more spend more,
Worry how the bills will get paid,
Oh it wasn't that long ago,
But it seems so far away,
When we didn't have a damn thing,
But we were happy,

And love was easy,
Just laying on a river bank all night counting the stars,
Love was easy,
As that feeling we found in the back seat of my car,
Even in the dark,
Love was easy,
When we didn't make it so hard,

Can you tell me,
The last time we really laughed,
The last time we had a moment,
When we hated that the moment passed,
Here we are down the road,
Standing here looking back,
Seeing what we used to have,
Is what we're missing,

When love was easy,
Just laying on a river bank all night counting the stars,
Love was easy,
As that feeling we found in the back seat of my car,
Even in the dark,
Love was easy,
When we didn't make it so hard,

Maybe that's how it is,
Ah maybe that's how it goes,
But all I know,

Is love was easy,
Just laying on a river bank all night counting the stars,
Love was easy,
As that feeling we found in the back seat of my car,
Even in the dark,
Love was easy,
When we didn't make it so hard,
When we didn't make it so hard,
Love was easy baby yeah,
When we didn't make it so hard---
