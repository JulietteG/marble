You don't know how bad,
I wish I was home
Can't wait to get back,
But while I'm gone
Y'all carry on

Drink one for me, for all the old times
We tore up that town, raised hell alright
Tell the boys, thanks for having my back
Some of the best memories I've ever had
So go on and get crazy
And drink one for me

I can't count the miles,
It just feels so far
And it could be a while
'Til I'm where you are
So keep me in your heart

Drink one for me, for all the old times
We tore up that town, raised hell alright
Tell the boys, thanks for having my back
Some of the best memories I've ever had
So go on and get crazy
And drink one

For the ones you can't be with
The ones we'll always miss
And times like these
And times like these

Drink one for me, for all the old times
We tore up that town, raised hell alright
Tell the boys, thanks for having my back
Some of the best memories I've ever had
So go on and get crazy
And drink one for me
Drink one for me ---
