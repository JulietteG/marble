There's still black marks on that county road 
Where we drag raced our pickups and mustangs 
And weathered all the sun and rain 

And to this day up on that overpass 
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see 
Ali will you marry me 

Take a ride, look around 
There ain't no doubt 

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it 
We let the world know we were here with everything we did 
We laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town 

There's still a rope burn on that oak branch 
That hangs over the river, I still got the scar 
From swinging out a little too far 

There ain't a corner of this hallowed ground 
That we ain't laughed or cried on 
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff 
It's everything we're made of 

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it 
We let the world know we were here with everything we did 
We laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town 
Like tattoos on this town 

Everywhere, there we are 
It hits me right in my heart 

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it 
We let the world know we were here with everything we did 
We laid a lot of memories down 

And we'll always be hanging around like tattoos on this town 
Like tattoos on this town---
