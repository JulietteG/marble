You're a crack-of-dawn, Monday-morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a plow with stroke diesel, backhoe-riding king of beers, 18-wheeler
Driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

But then the six-string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup

If we're talkin' 'bout memories, yeah, we're gonna make 'em
Talkin' 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Yeah, we all the same cause we thinkin' the same thing
We on the same page cause we sippin' the same drink
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up, haha

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
Your boy's blowing it up
It's going all night long
When the lights come on---
