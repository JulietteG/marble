I walk a hard line winding road
Don't really know where it's gonna go
Seems like trouble's my best friend
Soon as I get out, I'm back in again
It's a wonder, I ain't all alone

'Cause it ain't easy
No, It ain't easy
It ain't easy, Lovin' me

Don't why know I do the things I do
Must be I love to light the fuse
Stand back and watch it crash and burn and turn into ash
Just like it ain't nothin'
She ain't something I can lose

'Cause it ain't easy
No, It ain't easy
It ain't easy, Lovin' me

She's the brick by brick that built this house
Without her it would all fall down
So now she finds the faith and the strength to believe
Don't know why she sticks around

'Cause it ain't easy
No, It ain't easy
It ain't easy, Lovin' me

'Cause it ain't easy
No, It ain't easy
It ain't easy, Lovin' me---
