She was raised up in Jersey
I said oh Lord have mercy
Never seen a one light town till she moved down here
She said I'm so bored out of my mind
Need a starbucks and a Wi-Fi
Or a jet airliner to fly me anywhere 
I said do ya wanna take a drive in my truck
Don't pay no mind to that 12 point buck
Layed across my hood

Chorus:
Ever been to Rome, Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed a water tower
In Paris, Tenessee
Been to Florence, Alabama
Drank Muscadine wine
Just Give me a chance to change your mind
So before you go and fly away girl,
Let me show you round a Country Boy's World

Somewhere between there on the dirtroad
When i rolled down the window
She smelt wild flowers on that summer wind 
Just a bite of homeade ice-cream 
And a glass of momma's sweet tea
This old holler's got a way of makin friends
She never seen a glowin field of fireflies
Or the twinkle of a star in a southern sky
She fell in love 

We went down to Rome, Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed a water tower
In Paris, Tenessee
Went to Florence, Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Said she'll never fly away and she's my girl
That's cause I showed her round a country boy's world

Oooh, Now she's ridin shot gun
Sayin baby lets run wild

And go down to Rome, Georgia
Pick peaches off the trees
Climb a water tower
In Paris, Tenessee
Go to Florence, Alabama
Drink Muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Said she'll never fly away and she's my girl
That's cause I showed her round a country boy's world---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
