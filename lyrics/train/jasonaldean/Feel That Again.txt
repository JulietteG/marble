A river in July, two kids on summer break,
Another record high, clothes scattered on the bank.
The rush of jumpin' in, I wanna feel that again.

Sun going down, build a fire in the dirt
You're dancing all around wearing my t-shirt,
The way you pull me in, I wanna feel that again

Guitar comin' through the speakers,
That song you never wanna end,
Gimme some of that you and me,
Some of that way back when,
A little bit of wild and free
I wanna feel that again

Nothin' but a blur, gravel road, a flatbed Ford
Always was the cure, ooh whenever we got bored,
Sideways round the bend, yeah I wanna feel that again.

Guitar comin' through the speakers,
That song you never wanna end,
Gimme some of that you and me,
Some of that way back when,
A little bit of wild and free
I wanna feel that again

Guitar comin' through the speakers,
That song you never wanna end,
Gimme some of that you and me,
Some of that way back when,
A little bit of wild and free
I wanna feel that again
Feel that again ---
