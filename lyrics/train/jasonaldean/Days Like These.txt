Ain't no cloud up in my sky
I couldn't worry if I tried
I got an open road just darin' me
To pick you up and take you for a ride

I got a new shine on my car
Sun is tannin' my left arm
And while I'm waitin' on the red light
I'm burnin' up a little air guitar

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up I love this song
Come on girl the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong

Life is short
Lets go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these they go by way too fast
Yeah, days like these you wanna make them last

Rest your feet up on the dash
Leave your toe prints on the glass
Sing it like you mean it baby
Close your eyes and lay your head on back

What you say? What was that? Oh

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up I love this song
Come on girl the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong

Life is short
Let's go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these they go by way too fast
Yeah, days like these you wanna make them last

Speakers layin' in the truck bed
No this day ain't done yet
'Til the sun goes down

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up I love this song
Come on girl the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong

Life is short
Let's go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these they go by way too fast, yeah
Days like these they go by way too fast
Yeah, days like these you wanna make them last---
