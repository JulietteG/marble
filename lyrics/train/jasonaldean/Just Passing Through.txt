Well I can hear that rooster crowin' down the road
I felt my eyes open up real slow and looked around makin' sure i hadn't checked out
Cause there was an angel lying next to me
And I figured heaven's where I must be
Oh but it was you, and baby what else could I do
In that bed I said a little prayer
For one more day I'm still here

Chorus
Its your world and I'm just in it
Ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you girl
It's your would and Im just passing through

I dig in my heels and try to slow this down
I want my life to revolve around, everything you do
Oh but thats all up to you
Everything good seems to go so fast
Its kinda like one big party you crash you weren't counting on
One day you're here and gone
Baby all i wanna do is lay right here
And hope it all dont diappear

CHORUS
CHORUS

Im just here to love you girl 
Its your world and Im just passing through---Lyrics submitted by John.
