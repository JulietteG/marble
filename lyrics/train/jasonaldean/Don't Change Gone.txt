I can keep on changing the song
Keep on changing stations
Til I finally land on one
I don't mind that they keep playing
I'd take a different road through town
I find another way around
Change it up, really shake it up
Yeah, I'm trying

But it don't change gone, won't bring her back
She's moved on, and I'm stuck with that
I could change whatever I want
But it don't change gone

I can keep on hanging around
But I don't see me staying
Strike a match and burn it down
Walk out and leave it laying
Don't think about a thing just drive
Far enough til I find a change of scene
A new routine, I'd try anything

But it don't change gone, won't bring her back
She's moved on, and I'm stuck with that
I could change whatever I want
But it don't change

Headlights fading, nothing was breaking
She's gone

Yeah, I could change whatever I want
But it don't change gone
No it don't change gone ---
