Everybody's sayin' something,
They tell us how to live our lives-
It's all lies. (lies, lies)

I go from burning out the streetlights
To waking up all alone
Next to your pillow. (pillow, pillow)

And I know it's easier to go, just to
Go with the flow.
I'm here to let you know to
Just let go, step out of the straight line.
Don't you know?
We're here to have a good time.

Here, we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game.
And you, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place.
The door's been opened,
We've been waiting all this time.
Here, we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game.

She went to college, now a housewife.
She wears a smile and she cries inside,
She thought she did everything right. (Oh...)

He starts to wonder where the time went
As he's sittin' at his 9 to 5,
As he stares out the window. (dow, dow)

And I know it's easier to go, just to
Go with the flow.
I'm here to let you know to
Just let go, step out of the straight line.
Don't you know?
We're here to have a good time.

Here, we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game.
And you, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place.
The door's been opened,
We've been waiting all this time.
Here, we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game.

We're born on a rock
Spinning through space.
We can't understand
What we cannot explain.

(Here, we are, we're all the same...)
You, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place.
The door's been opened,
We've been waiting all this time....
Here, we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game.
And you, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place.
The door's been opened,---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
