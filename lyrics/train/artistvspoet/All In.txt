This story has just begun
Only ten pages in
and your assumption has won
All the skeptics can place their bets
It doesn't mean we're done
You know we've heard it before
It won't make us stop
but just want it more
All the critics laid down their bets
odds are two to one

And we've made this dream
turn into a reality
four chords, six strings
This is what we want our lives to be
We're all in
We're all in

Let's not forget the times
at 3132
Friends and family will hold
through and true
Always know, we couldn't be too far
From east to west
and the in-betweens
it's been miles and days
but it's so serene
Follow footsteps laid by giants
we'll try out turn

We've made this dream
turn into a reality
four chords, six strings
This is what we want our lives to be
We've lost all track of time
but we know that it will be
(ingrained in our memories)
We'll take this dream
and make it our reality
We're all in

And we've made this dream
turn into a reality
four chords, six strings
This is what we want our lives to be
We've lost all track of time
but we know that it will be
(ingrained in our memories)
We'll take this dream
and make it our reality
We're all in---Lyrics submitted by Becca.
