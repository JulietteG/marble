I know its not my place, 
to tell you what you're doing wrong.
Sometimes i think about your face.
and there's time that i don't think of you at all.
yeah, yeah
tell me you need me and i will stay.
You believe me and  i will wait.
and let you come back for me every time i fall
in your heart there's just no place
there's no room to make a mistake.
and with one wrong turn you will never make it home.
i know you will never say,
what i did that made you feel so small.
i spent the whole year on my face.
now with a little help i will stand up on my own.
tellm e you need me and i will stay.
you believe me and i will wait.
and let you come back for me every time i fall
in your heart there's just no place
there's no room to make a mistake.
and with one wrong turn you will never make it home.
yeah, yeah.
if you want me, then you got me, just never leave me alone.
tell me you need me and i will stay 
you believe me and i will wait
and let you come back for me every time i fall
yeah, yeah.
tell me your heart will never change.
that you'll always feel the same
that you'll stand beside me even if you think i'm wrong.
i was wrong
if you want me then you got me
just never leave me alone---Lyrics submitted by chelsea.
