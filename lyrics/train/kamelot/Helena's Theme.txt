I remember a song, from long ago
Some of the pieces,
They remind me of you,
How could I know you were to leave me?

I thought that I
I was that melody...
Oh, so wrong.
I am but a whisper tonight.

And if this is good-bye,
I will leave
But I'll love you until the end...---Lyrics submitted by MariSu.
