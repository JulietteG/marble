I stand before you blood of mine
A simple man of simple words
I expect no songs of praise when I am dead
Let my lament of endless gray
Light a fire in your hands
To forge a future we can call our own

So rise to the sound of revolution

Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
The last solution for our kind

I speak to you
The chosen ones
With all our strength we stand aligned
The pending birth of war will break the silence
A second chance will wait for us
To redeem us from our crabbing
And the thirst for what was once forbidden

We are breaking the walls from inside
So rise to the sound of revolution

Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
The last solution for our kind

Citizen zero...
Are you ready for the war...
Crows... cluster... riot!
Burn... the cage... down... riot!

Stand in the ashes
The echoes of our past
The smoke has cleared
There are shards of broken mirrors
Everywhere
We are standing at the crossroads
Afraid but not alone
A thousand missing faces
A story of a rose
In honor of their sacrifice
A new life can be born
I'm grateful and I leave this world
With no regrets at all
As life is pouring out of me
With all the power left in me
I raise my voice...

Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
Retribution
In the sound
Revolution for the human mind
Revolution
The last solution for our kind---
