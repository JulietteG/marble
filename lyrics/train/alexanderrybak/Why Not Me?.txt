You're standing right in front of me 
 and you have a purpose i can see 
 I wish i knew whats on your mind 
 but thats a key I'll never find
 I wanna know what I did wrong
 I really waited for so long 
 to be alone with you again
 i bet your game will never end

 And everybody knows your name
 you're driving everyone insane
 I saw you flirting with that guy
 You made me jealous don't know why
 I know I'm not the only one
 but when all you said i've done
 You wonder who your date would be
 I wonder Katherine why not me?

 Tonight is dark and you are gone
 again I'm wondering on my lone
 I guess I'll never know the truth
 about the secrets from your youth
 And if you played me all those times
 I'll come a thought that you'll be mine
 but when i realize your world
 you're just a happy little girl

 And everybody knows your name
 you're driving everyone insane
 I saw you flirting with that guy
 You made me jealous don't know why
 I know I'm not the only one
 but when all you said i've done
 You wonder who your date would be
 I wonder Katherine why not me?

 Katherine why not me x2

 You know I'm glad that you're my friend
 I hope this story never ends
 But there are times I nearly cry
 You make me weak I don't know why
 I know I'm not the only one
 but If you'd like to have some fun
 Wherever you might want to be
 just say Katherine why not me

 And everybody knows your name
 you're driving everyone insane
 I saw you flirting with that guy
 You made me jealous don't know why
 I know I'm not the only one
 but when all you said i've done
 You wonder who your date would be
 I wonder Katherine why not me?

 So Katherine why not me---Lyrics submitted by Esfandyar Zand.
