We're at two feet down
We're at two feet high
We can't create our scene
So why destroy our time?

Think I lost my girl
But I'm running off
Spending most my time
Forgetting at all costs

Found her 'neath thy sounds
Found her love distant
Strange you feel so low
Then you feel so high

Strange you feel so low
Then you feel so high

Then you feel so high
Then you feel so high
Then you feel so high
Then you feel so high---Lyrics submitted by Alan.
