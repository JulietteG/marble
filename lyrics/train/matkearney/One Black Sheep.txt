I was born a love child of the '70s 
Touch down at Sacred Heart 
Three boys and a treehouse family 
Saw the light from the reservoir 
Mamma told me angels are watching us 
In a green Volkswagen van 
In the cities of hippies and angels 
Just singing along to a Amy Grant 

There was money in my pocket 
Shoes on my feet 
But I always felt like the one black sheep 

There was food on the table 
A place to sleep 
But there's no rest for the one black sheep 
Singing 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Won't somebody tell me 
What's wrong with me? 
Singing 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Won't somebody tell me 
What's wrong with me? 

Packed up in Eugene, Oregon 
Amtrak went soccer cleats 
Headed south to California 
Conference player of the week 
But at night I dream of Graceland 
Stealing my friend Carl's guitar 
On the racquetball courts playing 
Songs for homeless broken 

There was money in my pocket 
Shoes on my feet 
But I always felt like the one black sheep 
Got a good education 
On O'Bart Street 
But there's no books on the one black sheep 
Singing 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Won't somebody tell me 
What's wrong with me? 
Singing 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Won't somebody tell me 
What's wrong with me? 

Two dropouts head eastbound 
Chevy truck with no A/C 
Starlite Fort Kearney Campground 
Said why not Tennessee 
Got fiber in my bones for 
God works to save 
Lord know I'm not home 
But I'm on my way with 

There was money in my pocket 
Shoes on my feet 
But I always felt like the one black sheep 
Got these 3 guitar chords 
And the road under my feet 
But there's no place for the one black sheep 
Singing 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Won't somebody tell me 
What's wrong with me? 
Singing 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Ooh ooh ooh, ay 
Won't somebody tell me 
What's wrong with me? 

'Cause there's no rest for the one black sheep---
