Did you close your eyes?  
When you walked away.  
Did I get to close in the pouring rain?
If there's one more chance, for us here tonight.  
Then I'll take the long way round this time.
And we sing,

Oh love it's easy if you don't try to please me,
If you don't wanna see me anymore.
And we sing out,

(Chorus)
Oh oh here we go again, I know how I lost a friend.
We go round and round again, oh oh, oh oh.

Bitter is the kiss that says goodbye.  
I can hear it in your voice and see it in your eyes
'Cuz we've been this low and we've been 
'Round this bend. 
I don't wanna lose you all over again and we sing.

Oh love it's easy if you don't try to please me, 
If you don't wanna see me anymore.
And we sing out,

(Chorus)x2

'Round here.
Hey hey.  
We got a light.  
It's not goin away. 
If all is broken,
If all is lost
And I've been found. 
So here's my heart
I'll give you all over again.

Oh no no no, oh no no no, oh no no no, 
Here we go again, 
Here we go again, 
Here we go again.  
Here we go again, singing.

Oh oh, here we go again, 
I know how I lost a friend, 
We go round and round again.
Oh oh, oh no, 
It's a long road baby running away.(x7)---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
