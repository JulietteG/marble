I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me
That keep, keep, keep
I be feeling like I believe
All the things, baby, that we could be
I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me
Beating right next to me
Beating right next to me

I feel your heart beat
I feel your heart beat
I feel your heart beat
Heart beat, your heart beat

Ain't bringing you no games
Ain't bringing you no cliche
If you share my debt unpaid
Then you share my name
'Cause you got me feeling so high
Oh baby, you are the rhythm of my life

I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me
That keep, keep, keep
I be feeling like I believe
All the things, baby, that we could be
I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me
Beating right next to me
Beating right next to me---
