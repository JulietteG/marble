Something's in the air tonight
The sky's alive with the burning light
You can mark my words, something's 'bout to break

And I found myself in a bitter fight
And I've held your hand through the darkest night
Don't know where you're coming from, but you're coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've known or seen

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you
Here we go, there's nothing left to choose
Here we go, there's nothing left to lose

So I packed my car and I headed east
Where I felt your fire, a sweet release
There's a fire in these hills that's coming down

And I don't know much but I found you here
And I cannot wait another year
Don't know where you're coming from, but you're coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've known or seen

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you
Here we go, there's nothing left to choose
Here we go, there's nothing left to lose

I can still hear the trains out my window
From Hobart Street to here in Nashville
I can still smell the pomegranates grow
I don't know how hard this wind will blow
Or where we'll go

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Here we go, there's nothing left to choose
Here we go, there's nothing left to lose---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
