You took the best of me (best of me)
And I'll never know
I'm left with the rest of me (rest of me)
Ad I can't let go

I'm waiting for a train that's not coming
It's like a waterfall in my head

Oh, won't you tell me why
I keep waiting up at night
Leaving on the lights
Like you never said goodbye
I hear you at the door
Footsteps on the floor
But you're here no more
What hurts the most
Is sleeping with your ghost (oh)
Sleeping with your ghost (oh)

I still feel you holding me (holding me)
All the world is gone
I still hear you calling me (calling me)
But I don't belong
How do you take the knife from your heart
When every beat still hurts the same

When we had a baby girl, I was scared to death
And the doctor said "doll, get ready to push"
Drove home like we stole the sun
Those kind of memories don't fade, don't run
They're stuck to the back of my mind
I hear you blowing in the trees at night
I'm still sleeping on my own side
Yeah, they said you'd never be prepared for the worst ones
You took your bow, they dropped the curtains
There's no encore, just me on the floor
Waiting here for more

Sleeping with your ghost---
