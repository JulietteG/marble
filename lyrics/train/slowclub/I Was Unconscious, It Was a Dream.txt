I'll let you say I love you,
when I know I'll never say it back.
And you open up the floodgates,
and wipe the village clean off the map.
Yeah, oh wipe the village clean off the map.

We sat with the bay-leaves and royalty,
into the part where everything was free.
And you inch yourself closer on that leather bench,
I stare at the frames while you see the, the banquet scene.
I, stare at the frames while you see the banquet scene.

And all of this because I've been screaming girl's names in the night,
I was unconscious, it was a dream.
Just let it die, die, die.
And you ask me to get blind blind drunk so I'll sleep the whole night long.
And I'll ask you to stop picking faults cause you'll miss me when I'm gone.

The rope it broke and I fell into the canyon,
I run my hand down the arc of your spine.
And your heart it aches for the lives that you will never lead,
we come and go but someday I will find the time...
to, lie beside you for one whole night.
to, lie beside you for one whole night.
