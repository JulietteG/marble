And in a moment it all came to this
The time it took for your muscles to grow and grip
Of all the things Ive heard
Whyd it have to be these words?

And in a second Ill be gone and you wont have to think
I got enough to keep me going, keep me from the brink
As your bones grew
Why did you become you?
Become you?

Oh, Ive told you, oh, to be older
You know Im right
Im right

You know these moments, they take years to pass
You gotta be coping, gotta be hoping the hands fly by fast
You call this true
Why did you become you? 
Become you?

See the sun rise now, this has to end
Dont let it be the one to walk us home again
And you know you havent got all the answers
If you did you would be screaming them out
And I know I havent got all the answers,
If I did I would be screaming them out, screaming them out

And in a moment it all came to this
The greatest book you ever read came from my favorites list
Of all the things to lose,
its you I choose.

Oh, I told you, oh, to be older,
You know Im right
Im right

Keep breathing, keep breathing
Find a scheme you believe in---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth RT.
