Well, I don't
Know what i'm doing here
I could say
That I do
But I don't
You could wrap a million candles 
Into a torch and hope that it stears you home
You could cut all the telephone wires
And hope that nobody does get through
I might not have the power 
Of telepathy 
But, I'm gonna be contacting you

Because i borrowed a book that I saw
Was planted deep inside your bag
It gave me an excuse 
To see you again
But I'm not a theif 
I'll give it back

Don't you ever wonder
Who's living in that house
It's too small for people
We all said
But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse

And I showed you the things that I'd made
You didn't think that they were too great
But I'm glad that you thought of it
Think what you're taught 
Because everybody else's mind is grey

We kept up the act for, two-o-o-o-o
dates before it needed glue
I didn't drink what you drank
You didn't sink when I sank
So, there's little else for us to do

Don't you ever wonder
Who's living in that house
It's too small for people
We all said
But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse

Said the mouse

I didn't say goodbye today
Oh I did it the coward's way
I tied it to the neck of a seafaring deck
That was sailing off down your way

But you poured petrol all over
The ship you used to sail the sea
You didn't think that you'd be coming home again 
So, you said Bye to me

Don't you ever ponder
On things we never said
Yes I did
But when we were kids 
Now it's too late
Because we're dead
Because we're dead
Because we're dead
Because we're dead
