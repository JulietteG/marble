It's okay to have scars
They will make you who you are
It's okay to have fear
Because that means you aren't scared of coming here
And in the middle of the night
So if you'll want to talk
Because you know that I want to talk too
It's not bad of you to think of what might go wrong
But you can't blame me for secretly hoping that I will prove you wrong
It's okay that I pray that you will miss your flight
And have to stay with me another night

It's brutal it's brutal 
Why cant you see
It's brutal it's brutal
What have you be
Because we are far apart
And my lonely heart
Finds it hard to get through the night
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light

When we are out in the market
And out on the streets
I've got a pocket full of problems
And a pocket full of seeds 
Hoping something might grow out of this misletoe
And I won't have to erase your memory

I like the way that our arguements stop when we fall asleep
And the way that body feels when it's wrapped around me
And I'd like it if you made it to mind my Christmas Eve
So you can hold me
And we'll watch Christmas TV

It is brutal it's brutal 
Why cant you see
It's brutal it's brutal
What have you be
Because we are far apart
And my lonely heart
Finds it hard to get through the night
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light

So come on home 
Just come on home
(repeat till end)
