A mistake on the part of nature,
You're so fabled, so fair, just sit anywhere,
I've pencil-sketched the scene,
It's feeling byzantine

Mistakes on the part of nature,
The living proof of what they're calling love,
Uncertain sideways streets,
Where things that don't match meet

A mistake on the part of nature,
You are a tall glass, a blast from the past,
Where things were simpler then,
You ask exactly when

A mistake on the part of nature,
It's forgiven, moved on, won't wear my son,
They said to walk that street,
That would feel byzantine

Silhouette tell me a tall tale, go, shout it out,
Silhouette shout from the top,
Sweet talk, Sweet talk
Yeah, Sweet talk, Sweet talk

Amnesia becomes ambition,
Ambition becomes a new sort of,
Try name simplicity,
Like always byzantine

A mistake on the part of nature,
It's forgiven, move on, won't wear my son,
They said to walk that street,
That would feel byzantine

(x2) Silhouette tell me a tall tale, go, shout it out,
Silhouette shout from the top,
Sweet talk, Sweet talk
Sweet talk, Sweet talk---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
