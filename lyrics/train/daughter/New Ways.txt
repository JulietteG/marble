Worst I bring
I have a dirty mind
Oh, I need, I need new ways
To waste my time
I need new ways

Worst I bring
I live alone, alone, alone
Worst I face
Keep it inside, I need new ways
To waste my time
I need, I need new ways

Im trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not just cross myself out
Not just disappear

Ive been trying to stay out
But theres something in you
I cant be without
I just need it here

Im trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not to cross myself out
Not to disappear

Ive been trying to stay out
But theres something in you
I cant be without
I just need it here

Oh I need
New ways to waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time---
