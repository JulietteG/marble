Don't you think you'll be better off
Without me tied around neck, it's like the way your
Body pulls me underneath where I can't breathe
I'm tired of talking, I've been screaming all day

Don't you think we'll be better off
Without temptation to regress, to fake tenderness
Waiting to see someone we won't know for long
In cities we'll only leave

Don't you think we'd be better off
Without the pressure to address
A room of faces
Waiting to hear some strange women speak in tongues
On lonely fridays of my loveless drunk, baby
Loveless drunk, baby

I don't want to belong, I don't want to belong
I don't want to belong, to you, to anyone
I don't want to belong, I don't want to belong
I don't want to belong, to you, to anyone
I don't want to belong, I don't want to belong

Don't you think we'd be better off
Without the pressure to address
A room of faces
Waiting to hear some strange women speak in tongues
On lonely fridays of my loveless drunk, baby
Loveless drunk, baby---
