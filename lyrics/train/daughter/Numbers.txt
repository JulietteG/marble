Take the worst situations
Make a worse situation
Follow me home, pretend you
Found somebody to mend you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

Can you clean lace faces?
Black out nights and tight spaces?
We'll feel distant embraces
Scratching hands 'round my waist, yeah
I wish my mouth would still taste you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better

I feel numb, make me better
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb, make me better
I feel numb in this kingdom---
