I said too much, said the wrong thing
Remembering the image I was trying to project to you
Cast an illusion, think I'm losing my head
Sometimes I feel
Be what you want, I can be what you want
Be what you want, I can be what you want
Be what you want, I can be what you want
Be what you want, I can be what you want

I don't know you now
But I'm lying here, somehow

I feel sick
I'm drowning in the pit of my stomach
Oh I know it's my fault
While you're busy diving I find I feel fine
Feel a little out of my mind

Oh I'm stuck, I've said too much
I'm going, much
I can check and wait
I'm waiting for some kind of response from you
Let me know
I haven't opened up
The floodgates again, to another man
Who controls the pain and never says anything
Anything
Anything

I don't owe you much
But I miss you such
I'm missing you

I feel sick
I'm drowning in the pit of my stomach
You don't know that I'm caught
Sinking in the lining of someone I can't face no more
I've gotta get him out of my mind

While you're busy diving down
I find that feeling
I feel alone
I've gotta get him out of mind
While you're busy diving down
I find that feeling
I feel alone
I feel alone---
