I'm so happy pretty baby
I'm so happy Jah has made you mine, girl
Girl if it's love you're looking for
Come on my love for you is sure
Girl if it's love you're looking for
Come on my love for you is sure
You bake the sweetest cake I know
Come on and show me what you know

Your recipe girl is fine, fine, fine
Don't you know, I really wanna make it mine
Your recipe girl is fine, so fine
Don 't you know, I really wanna make it mine
I really wanna make it mine, mine, mine
I really wanna make it mine, all mine, so

You bake the sweetest cake I know
Come on and show me what you know

Your recipe girl is fine, fine, fine
Don't you know, I really wanna make it mine
Your recipe girl is fine, so fine
Don 't you know, I really wanna make it mine
I really want to make it mine, mine, mine, hey
I really want to make it mine, all mine, so

Girl if it's love you're looking for
Come on my love for you is sure
You bake the sweetest cake I know
Come on and show me what you know---Lyrics submitted by Kristian.
