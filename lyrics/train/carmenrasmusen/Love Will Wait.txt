He had one hand on the wheel of his two-door Chevy Caviler
And the other one was running through the waves of her sandy hair
It was well past twelve when the pulled into thier parents drive
She didnt think anyone was watching when she kissed him goodnight
Busted

Her mama told her she was grounded for a year
Her daddy said that boy aint welcome 'round here
She ran up to her room screaming down those stairs
You can say what you wanna say
Lock me up, throw the key away
But if this is really fate 
Then love will wait

Two months later her mama finally let her off the hook
She said Im headed out to town to return a few library book
Then she climbed in the Caviler sitting at the Alvaco station
He told her time don't matter
Forever's worth the waiting
Ain't love sweet
Oh yeah


Her mama told her she was grounded for a year
Her daddy said that boy aint welcome 'round here
She ran up to her room screaming down those stairs
You can say what you wanna say
Lock me up, throw the key away
But if this is really fate 
Then love will wait

Now there's a little white house
On the edge of a country lake
Daddy's working on that rusty old chevy, in the driveway
Kids are playing with the dog throwing frisby in the front yard
And mama's sitting on that front pourch swing
Staring at that car, when it all started

Her mama told her she was grounded for a year
Her daddy said that boy aint welcome 'round here
She ran up to her room screaming down those stairs
You can say what you wanna say
Lock me up, throw the key away
But if this is really fate 
Then love will wait
Oh yeah
Love will wait---Lyrics submitted by Laurel.
