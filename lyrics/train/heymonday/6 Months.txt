Your the direction I follow to get home.
When I feel like I can't go on, You tell me to go.
And it's like I can't feel a thing,
Without you around.
And don't mind me if I get weak in the knees,
'Cause you have that effect on me, you do.

Everything you say, 
Everything time we kiss,
I can't think straight,
But I'm okay.
And I can't think of anyone body else,
Who I hate to miss as much as I hate missing you.

Months going strong now, 
And no goodbye.
Unconditional, unoriginal,
Always by my side.
Meant to be together. 
Meant no one but each other.
You love me I love you harder.
So..

Everything you say,
Everytime we kiss,
I can't think straight.
But I'm okay.
And I can't think of anybody else,
Who I hate to miss as much as I hate as missing you.

So please, give me hint,
So, please, give me a lesson on how to steal,
Steal the heart,
As fast as you stole mine,
As you stole mine, yeah.

Oh, Everything you say,
Everytime we kiss, 
I can't think straight,
But I'm okay,
And I can't think of anybody else,
Who I hate missing as much as I hate missing you.

So please, give me a hint,
So please, just take my hand.---Lyrics submitted by DeNiSe.
