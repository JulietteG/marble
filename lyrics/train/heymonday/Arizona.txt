It took two days for me to figure out
This isn't working out, But I lost my way
I drove all night just to be with you
But you weren't worth a view
 I gotta hit the brakes
Now you know, get up and gooo

Chorus:
Arizona Arizona
I got back on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona
is a million miles from Florida
Now you're history, I'm stranded get me out. 
I'm going home


Deep in your soul
lies a lonely heart
that only ever pumps for you alone.
and I can't relate, so I gotta leave you here
I can breathe without you dear.
Just start walking away
 Now you know, get up and go.

Chorus:
Arizona Arizona
I got back on the highway
now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona
is a million miles from Florida
Now you're history, I'm stranded get me out I'm going home


Tell me how does that feel with the Grand Canyon between me and you?
Tell me how does that feel to see me waving goodbye?


Took two days for me to figure out
This isn't working out 
I gotta hit the brakes
