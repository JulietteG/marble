(Ohhh Ohhh)

Heres my heart in a postcard darling,
Just one step from the edge. 
Sleep alone and its so hard darlin,
And next to me and my head.

But its too late, too late, to call. Are you out there?
Too late, too much to say.

Wish you here, wish you well.
If you only share this hell.
But you leave, and the stains are left on me,
i wish you, i wish you were here
I wish you, I wish you were here.

(Ohhh Ohhh)

Heres my Hollywood ending callin,
Everyday faced black.
Sick and tired of pretending darling,
That youll ever come back.

But its too late, too late, to call. Are you out there?
Too late, too much to say.

Wish you here, wish you well.
If you only share this hell.
But you leave, and the stains are left on me,
I wish you, I wish you were here
I wish you, I wish you were here.

Tell me, something,
Talk me down, down again.
Im broken, Im frozen up

Wish you here, Wish you well.
If you only share this hell.
But you leave, and the stains are left on me,

Wish you here, Wish you well.
If you only share this hell.

But you leave, and the stains are left on me,
I wish you, I wish you were here
I wish you, I wish you were here.
