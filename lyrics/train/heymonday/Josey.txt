The drinks are flowing
Just like a river
then she keeps going
The whole night in ends in a blurr

she's got no limit 
she thinks she's soo tough
can't walk a straight line
the end of the night she's rough

Bridge:
Her dress whispers reckless
The night starts now 
and she slips on her neckless

Chorus:
Josey 
Don't you worry it's just
a phase your going through,
someday you'll know just what to do

Josey
it's all right 
slap the hand that just keeps pulling
it doesn't matter just do something.

2nd verse:
She's ready to role
tonight is different
she'll start it real slow
to keep herself in check

Oh no oh noo
it's two for one
she starts a show no
from this moment on
she's done

Bridge:
Her dress whispers reckless
The night starts now and she slips on her neckless

Chorus:
Josey
Don't you worrry
it's just a phase your going through
someday you'll know just what to do

Josey
it's all right
slap the hand that just keeps pulling it doen't matter
just do something

verse 3:
The party is tonight
and she think their playing her song

The party is tonight 
and it's playing all night long
