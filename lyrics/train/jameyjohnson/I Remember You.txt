Always thought one of the most important conversations you could ever have in your life, was the first time you talked to God. What would you say?

I remember you
In the pages of a book
Lady read me once in Sunday School
I remember you
I studied every word
And I hide it in my heart just like you told me too
And stones roll away
And everybody prayed
The angels sang, I remember you

While youre standing there or on your knees
What do you hope God says back to you?

I remember you
I was there when you were born
I held your mommys hand, and your daddys too
I remember you
I recall the very day
You turned against the Devil 
And you cry out my name
And a stone was rolled away
And everybody prayed
The angels sang, I remember you
I remember you---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
