How long has it been?
Well, it looks like I drank myself sober again
Ever since she left me
You have been so hard to face
Good morning sunrise, guess I will call it a day

Last time I saw you
You let me down
I told her by morning 
She and I would work things out
But you took that sky just like she was yours to take
Good morning sunrise, guess I will call it a day

You always held her in a better light than I
I brought her heart ache 
And your beauty made her cry 
They say whiskey before noon is such a shame 
Thats way tonight, has taken your place 
Unlike you, her memory never fades away
Good morning sunrise, guess I will call it a day
Good morning sunrise, guess I will call it a day---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
