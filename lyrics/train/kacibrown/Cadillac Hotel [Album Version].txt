crazy man's preachin' in the steet in the mornin'
sayin' white man's currupted the world and jesus ain't comin'

the sea gull's are laughin' and i finish my coffee
in a little cafe on the corner of Rose and Dudley 

the sand falls from my hand as i pick up my guitar, 
lay out a blanket kiss the sun and sing words from my heart,

you make your way to the place where i am and im like hey,
why don't you come listen to me play,

chorus
i wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel,
i wanna spend the whole night under the stars singing to you until...
i melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel, 
i wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel, 
with you 
nanananananana

the evening sun falls in to the ocean over Malibu skys 
and i cant help but to drown in the blue of your emerald eyes, 

you smile and say hey baby, why don't you come up to my room, 
and im like, just come with me a know a place with a better view, 

chorus 

the moon lights your face in the dark of the night i pull you in with
my sweet lullabye
the city is sleeping im melting inside,
lalalalalala 

chorus 

nananananananananana na na na oh iiiiii nah nah nah oooohhhhh i wanna nanananana---Lyrics submitted by tealia.
