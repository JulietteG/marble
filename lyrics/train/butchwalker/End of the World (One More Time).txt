One more time

Something weird happened on the way to the store
Trying to buy a rifle and a record and more
Shocked like a cattle-prod
Hit me on the head
Like a premonition from a prophet in red

Sky rockets in sight
Get ready for a fight
Hey Hey!
Its gonna get ugly like a hacked-off hand
For reaching for a little more than the common man

All in good time
The cuts gonna heal
Even in the worst sun
Burns gotta peel

We get to the bottom
I can see the sign
Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time

Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time

Synchronized dancers like zombies in the street
Singing for a supper that you never wanna eat
Taking what theyre giving
But the giving is pissed
Looking at guitars
Like, What the hells this?

Sky rockets in flight
Get ready for a fight
Hey Hey!
I can see the headlines
Aint no joke
The party finally stopped
When the laptop broke

All in good time
The cuts gonna heal
Even in the worst sun
Burns gotta peel

We get to the bottom
I can see the sign
Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time

Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time

Hey Hey!

Dont worry bout me
Im doing just fine
Standing on the street corner
Flipping this sign
Working while the DJ drinks his wine
While an auto-pilot iPod
Shuffles in time

Sky rockets in sight
Get ready for the fight
We gotta go to battle
If we wanna win the war
Time to stop the party
When your hair gets sore

But all in good time
The cuts gonna heal
Even in the worst sun
Burns gotta peel

We get to the bottom
I can see the sign
Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time

Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time
Its the end of the world
Yeah, one more time

Hey Hey! ---
