Well, I married the short girl at a spring break ball
Been looking at the ceiling on the floor of my car
She got me a job taking memories to the trash
21 and over, yeah, it happens real fast

Well, we had our first baby, and I spent my last dime
Trying to grow a lot of clothes and keep them growing at a time
Sitting after my shift
The drinks are free, but I'm not

I'll tell you what I will be, if I ever grow up
I'm gonna get out of town and trounce everything all over
Come hello, how are, and not going to leave here
I'm sober
I don't want to be 21 and over

I spent the harder half of a life, trying to see where I went wrong
Get lost in the word of my own self
But life is too short, who would long to be

I'll tell you what I will be, if I ever grow up
I'm gonna get out of town and trounce everything all over
Come hello, how are, and not going to leave here
I'm sober
I don't want to be 21 and over---
