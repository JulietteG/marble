The 15th of June
Came tumbling through the door
Your bedroom smelled like your cologne
I was laying on the floor
A thief in the middle of the night
If the night came to stay
I feel the walls go rumbling
Like the sound of your name

So here I am
All bittersweet and dirty feet
Runnin as fast as they can
Where do I go
Without you
Heaven only knows

Girls out on the corner
Smoking cigarettes
Ashes in the breeze blowing in their hair
Like something else to forget
Follow them down with your eyes
Til the covers slide off your face
I got this lack of motivation
Moving me all over the place

Sunday morning, Father's Day
The first without my dad
As I look into my little boy's eyes
It takes all I have
Not to break down right in front of him when he smiles at me
You don't become a man
Until you lose your dad, you see---
