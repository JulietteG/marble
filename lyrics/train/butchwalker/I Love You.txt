It was a different time
I had others to make up my mind
That and nothing ever seems as kind
As you saying hi
And I still can see your home

I know we walked that line
Of when we stopped being friends
And you became mine
We said until our lives would ever end
I can still see your grin
A ray through the dirt in the hole

No one ever warned me
How hard it is to do
Lie myself through lovers
Cheat my way through school
Nothing ever will be quite as true
Like the way that I love you
I love you

Ohh I know I take things hard
But ohhh this was all that I was living for
Nothing ever will be quite as true
As the way that I love you

I'm staring at my feet
Inside the concrete they poured
On our street
My name just under yours
And I feel fine
Although I'm not fine
When are you coming home

If I could do it over
Before your time was through
Id take back every lie I spoke
And the hell I put you through
Nothing ever will be quite as true
Like the way that I love you
I love you---
