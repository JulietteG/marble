love
everybody sleeps
but i haven't done that in the last few weeks or so
and yeah, i know the remedy
but they ran out yesterday
i cant re-fill anything
especially my heart. especially my brain
if i could bottle up this mess i could do it all again

and i dont wanna know if theres another part of me
dont wanna feel if im still alive
dont wanna smell the bed where we used to sleep
im gonna miss it again, miss it again

just wanna walk away from the ashes
and take the fact that ive been burned
and maybe let you know im still standin
if you miss it again, miss it again, im around

and you, you were down the street
and i watched you through the windows draped with sheets so white
and yeah, it looks a lot like me
is it a comfort that you needed or coincidence thats everything
especially my eyes, 'specially my clothes
but does it move you inside out
maybe i dont wanna know

and i dont wann aknow if theres another part of me
dont wanna feel if im alive
dont wanna smell the bed where you used to sleep
gonna miss it again, miss it again

just wanna walk away from the ashes
and take the fast that ive been burned
and maybe let you know im still standin 
if you miss it again. miss it again, im around

and all the times you wanted out, you never said a thing about
how we would just become the ships inside a bottle
breakin' dowwn, sails fallin' off
tryin' to stay afloat inside a place you cant survive

are we breakin' down?

cause i dont wanna know if theres another part of me
dont wanna feel if im alive
dont wanna smell the bed where we used to sleep

just wanna walk away from the ashes
take the fact that ive been burned
and maybe let you know im still standin'
if you miss it again, miss it again, im around---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
