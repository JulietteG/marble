Well I was never good at picking what to wear, for somebody else
This dress will go good with her hair
At least I think in this light
From the lamp beside this couch
With half the bulbs burnt out
I'm starting to know how that feels

Autumn leaves
Come back to you
Autumn leaves
You feelin' blue
But when autumn leaves
Her love for me won't

Well the cancer got her good this time around
18 hours left before they put her in the ground
Was this the hand of god
That they talk about in church
If it is then it won't hurt
Only believers will know

There's a cold front that's headed for the town
This one will be rough
Some killers never make a sound....
They just walk up, take a knife to you and yours
Leave a message on my door
When I return to normal youll know---
