So I'm to blame, the reason why you left him a mess and without a sign.
He was first, I was next but enough to make you leave his side.
But do you know, do you know what happens next, as he's torn apart left thinking she 


got on a plane and they're miles apart, dug a little hole then she buried his heart with the one she trusts, and theyre on the run.
Tears fall like the rain.  I feel a little bad when I think of the pain that you put him through.  Am I such a fool?  Oooooohh. Yeaah. Oooooooohh.  Yeaah.


Yeah here we are and every line I say seems to come out right on time.
It's a first none the less, just enough to keep you where you are
But will it change, will I be the next one hurt?
Or the next one to complain


That she got on a plane and they're miles apart, dug a little hole then she buried his heart with the one she trusts and they're on the run
Tears fall like the rain, I feel a little bad when I think of the pain that you put him through
Am I such a fool, such a fool? Ooooohh.
She'll move on, she'll move on, she'll move on. (what is she waiting for?)


She got on a plane and theyre miles apart, she dug a big hole then buried my heart with the one she trusts and theyre on the run
Tears fall like the rain, I feel it pretty bad when I think of the pain that you put me through
Am I such a fool?  Ooooohh.  Yeaah.  So what am I waiting for?  Yeah well she keeps running, she keeps running, she's moved on, she's moved on, she's moved on, she's moved on.---Lyrics submitted by abbe.
