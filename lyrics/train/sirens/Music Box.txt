A tragic situation, another new beginning.
But I've been trying to find myself.
But I've been alone.
For so very long
I can't forget
The gift you gave me.

Your music box, and it still rings.
It brings you back, with a melody rooted inside.

With a turn of the key you return to me.
Wake up, wake up.
This is nothing much more than a memory.
It all floods back to me.

But I've been alone, for so very long.
But I can't forget, the gift you gave me.
Your music box,
Shattered against the ground.

It's permanentely unwound,
the sound, now that it's still I'm unbound.

Who could have guessed after all these years,
Nothing had changed amongst the gears,
Of your music box, and now that it's gone,
I felt the burden lifted
I've held so long---Lyrics submitted by Logan Pollaro.
