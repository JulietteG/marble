(feat. Jaymes Young)

When you're on your own
And you feel you're lost
When your heart's a mess
Though you've given your best

I'll be here giving it my best shot
Baby your love's got more than I need
Here, crying from the rooftops
Nothing can stop us
If we believe

Here, giving it my best shot
Baby I find that we can be free
When you're here, here with me

When your sky is dark
And the earth is shaking your bed
Your hope is at its end
You just need one friend

I'll be here, giving it my best shot
Baby your love's got all that I need
Here, crying from the rooftops
Nothing can stop us
If we believe

Here, giving it my best shot
Baby I find that we can be free
When you're here, here with me

When you can't find your way
Then all around you walked as deep and grayed
The stars fall from above
And your barely holding all my love

Giving it my best shot
Baby your love's got all that I need
Here, crying from the rooftops
Nothing can stop us
If we believe

Here, giving it my best shot
baby I find that we can be free
when you're here, here with me---
