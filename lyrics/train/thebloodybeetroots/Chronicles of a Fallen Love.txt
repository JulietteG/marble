I'm in the dark, I'm underwater
Searching for a teardrop in the water
I can feel your shadow over me
I can hear your whisper in my ear
The ocean is bleeding, it's taking me down
I'm falling, you're watching me fall

I'm watching as your body's falling deeper
You're looking for a teardrop, here it is
I remember the way you used to dance
Then I remember that you will never dance again
Now you're fallen, I'm falling with you
And with us, our blood, our love

Our heartbeats used to move in time
They've slowed down, left us behind
This is the story of a fallen love
Fallen love (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
