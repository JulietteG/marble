I dont know about my heart
I want you to stay with me
Every day you love someone, something wrong to you
I dont know what am going to do, my heart I want cry for my lovely Elizabeth
Some people they want ask me for you, my love

Am crazy about that love
I believe you on the phone
Many years I like to see you, every day you run from me 
I dont know what am going to do
My heart, I want cry, for my sweet Elizabeth

I say sweet Elizabeth but why you go (Kanda Bongo man sing sing)
I say Elizabeth but why you go
Come back you love me
Many years I love you
Many years you love me (Elizabeth, what happened)
You know that you miss me (my love)

(sth sth)
Do you see Elizabeth there (why you want to see me, what for?, Aaah..)

Elizabeth, weve stayed more than 10 years together, you and me,
You say that you like make-up, then I bought air-ticket for you to go to London
Just to buy make-up
But what happened? I hear that now, you are in New York
That neighbor who was with you on the plane is the one who took you to New York
I come a drunkard, I start to drink whiskey-Johnnie Walker
Now, Johnnie Walker, walking now on my head, and all my body
I love you my baby

Please
Come back you love me (aaaah..leave me alone)
Come back you love me (this is a waste of time)
You know that I love you ( I want to be free)
You know that you love me

I become crazy because of you
( My brother, leave that girlyou know that she loves you because of your money :: Shut up! I love her, its not you problem)

I say Elizabeth but why you go?
I say sweet Elizabeth but why  you go?
Come back you love me ( everyday)
You know that I love you ( everyday )
You know that you love me ( everyday)
Elizabeth (my love)
I want to stay with you (my love)
Only you and me (my love)

My God (my love) 
I wanted to kill myself because of you (my love my love)---Lyrics submitted by Magnate Frank.
