Ladies and Gentlemen
As you know we have something special down here
At Bird Land this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, funky funky
How 'bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute

Groovy, groovy, jazzy, funky, pounce
Bounce, dance as we dip in the melodic sea
The rhythm keeps flowin', it drips to MC
Sweet sugar, pop sugar, pop rocks it pops ya
Don't stop till the sweet beat drops

I show and prove as a stick in move
Hear the poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, mind, floating like a butterfly
Notes start to float, subtle like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya, drip trip, flip fantasia

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Biggity biggity bop, yeah
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky

Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin' in the dome, mix is on the lock
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the river we cruisin'

Up, down, 'round and 'round, found the found
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Finesse freak through the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat

Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Funky flowin' goin' on with the sweet sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found

Many trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya, dip trip, flip fantasia

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Biggity biggity bop, yeah
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Biggity biggity bop, yeah
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky

Jump to the jam boogy woogy jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic masta
Rhyme them on the mic I bring a sucka disasta

Beau coup bucks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle star I might be
Scribble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle

Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Oh you don't stop, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Give me more of that funky horn
What's that, yeah, funky, funky

Biggity biggity bop
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Biggity biggity bop, yeah
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, funky, funky

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Biggity biggity bop, yeah
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky

Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?
Biggity biggity bop, yeah
Biggity biggity bop, funky, funky---
