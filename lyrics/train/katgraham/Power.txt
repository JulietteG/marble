I used to be a flower on the wall in the back row
Never was a homecoming queen just a shadow

Now I got a crown cause you gave it to me
Cleopatra strong, yeah you found it in me

Throwing all the pages of the past out the window
(Throwing all the pages of the past out the window)

When you tell me that Im beautiful
I feel it, I breathe it, believe it
Got me feeling indestructible
I love it, I scream it

With you, Im a queen upon my throne
(Yeah, yeah)
With you, I built a kingdom out of stone
(Yeah, yeah)

You fill me up
You fill me up

Ive got that power, power, power with you here
Ive got that power, power, power with you here

Its so electric baby, what you do to me

Ive got that power, power, power with you here
(Power, power, power)

You tell me that you love me in the fog on the mirror
You like me with no makeup on so you can see me clearer

Now I got a crown cause you gave it to me
Cleopatra strong, yeah you found it in me
Everything I ever dreamt about, got it right here
(Right here, right here, right here)

With you, Im a queen upon my throne
(Yeah, yeah)
With you, I built a kingdom out of stone
(Yeah, yeah)

You fill me up
You fill me up

Ive got that power, power, power with you here
Ive got that power, power, power with you here

Its so electric baby, what you do to me

Ive got that power, power, power with you here
(Power, power, power)

When you tell me that Im beautiful
I feel it, I breathe it, believe it

Got me feeling indestructible
I love it, I scream it
I love it, I scream it
I love it, I scream it

With you, Im a queen upon my throne
With you, I built a kingdom out of stone

You fill me up
You fill me up

Ive got that power, power, power with you here
Ive got that power, power, power with you here

Its so electric, baby, what you do to me

Ive got that power, power, power with you here
Ive got that power, power, power with you here---
