VERSE ONE
Don't make excuses or give me reasons why 
I think its best for you to go 
You don't know how it hurts me 
Every time you say goodbye, 
Scars inside me don't show 

PRE CHORUS
You gotta be clear out of your mind, 
If you thinking i'm taking you back this time 
Find someone else to tell your story 

I've heard them so many times 
Till I know by how your lying
And not a word of it is true 

CHORUS
Bye bye baby 
I'd like to say that its been fun 
But i'm not gonna lie 

Bye bye baby 
Your bags are waiting at the door 
Don't leave them behind
Bye baby (By baby goodbye)
Bye baby (By baby goodbye)

VERSE TWO
You might be thinking 
That i don't mean what i say, 
But don't you let your ? 

You're no longer
Gonna have it your own way, 
I know exactly where your at.

PRE CHORUS
So you might as well save your kissing, 
Your words of endearment missing 
The point i'm trying to get through to you 

That's not gonna make it alright, 
When i know you've spending your night 
giving her the same treatment too 

CHORUS
Bye bye baby 
I'd like to say that its been fun 
But i'm not gonna lie

Bye bye baby 
Your bags are waiting at the door 
Don't leave them behind
Bye baby (By baby goodbye)
Bye baby (By baby goodbye) 

INSTRUMENT
Bye bye baby, Ooooh (See you later) 
See you later (Bye bye yeah) 
(See you later) 

(KEY CHANGE)

CHORUS
Bye bye baby 
I'd like to say that its been fun 
But i'm not gonna lie

Bye bye baby 
Your bags are waiting at the door 
Don't leave them behind

OUTRO
Bye baby (By baby goodbye)
Bye baby (See you later, bye bye) 
Bye baby (By baby goodbye)
Bye baby (See you later, bye bye)---Lyrics submitted by MissN.
