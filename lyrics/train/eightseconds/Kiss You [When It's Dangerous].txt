Lifeline, I wonder how you last so long,
you must be strong,
when I see the flowers in your hair,
And the pretty mouth with the red you adorn,

When you get close,
Ah danger senses please beware,
It's so unfair
That I am paying such a heavy price,
By looking at the garments,
That you wear so well

Refrain:
I won't kiss you if you want me to,
It's much too easy with someone like you,
In the rain or on a winters night,
Just wouldn't do,
Its got to be so right, I'll

Chorus:
Kiss you when it's dangerous
I'll kiss you then and only then,
I'll kiss you when it's dangerous,

Fineline, that's what I'm walking
when I look at you,
you know it's true,
Of all things the thing that I want most,
To catch you at the point
Where you don't have a clue.

(Repeat Refrain)

(Repeat Chorus)

I'll kiss you once, but never again...
