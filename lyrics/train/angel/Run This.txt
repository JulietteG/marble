(feat. Sneakbo)

I wouldn't go too far
Everybody knows you
So why you busy tryna be her?
Everybody's busy tryna be you
You ain't gotta try too hard
I just wanna hold you
When you look the other way
Looking at you with the whole room

Don't you know you run this party, run this party
Lady, you run this party
You came through and turn up this party
Look at that body
You ain't gotta role play
You be legal the whole way
Don't you know you run this, run this, run this, run this
Run this, oh, run this, oh, run this, run this

You're taking this too far
Everybody's so cool
'Cause she ain't got a dress like yours
Don't you see I'm tryna dress like you
You ain't gotta try too hard
Whenever you roll through
Like you did the other day
Looking at you with the whole room

Don't you know you run this party, run this party
Lady, you run this party
You came through and turn up this party
Look at that body
You ain't gotta role play
You be legal the whole way
Don't you know you run this, run this, run this, run this
Run this, oh, run this, oh, run this, run this

Ayy, I was gonna talk about a chick
But right now I'm on my own dick
All this money got me bopping like a crip
Get my black hoodie off and get her summer outfit, yeah
Catch a flight with me and my hitta
Look at that, that's that gal from twitter
I pull up like "Hi Cinderella"
Then I put my arms out like I'm doing macarena
She a sexy, spicy, nice likkle lighty
'Causing in a Heatwave live Wiley
I nearly passed out like Tinie
Straight from the south, she a southside Barbie
In the party like Call mi a Yardie
Call me a Niger, smokin' Bob Marley
It's comin' like the gyaldem are on me
My brother's like "Just call

Don't you know you run this party, run this party
Lady, you run this party
You came through and turn up this party
Look at that body
You ain't gotta role play
You be legal the whole way
Don't you know you run this, run this, run this, run this
Run this, oh, run this, oh, run this, run this---
