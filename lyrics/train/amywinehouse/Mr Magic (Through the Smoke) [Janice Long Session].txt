Everyday I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school

Mr Magic
Take a token
Mr Magic
Of my love
Mr Magic
I see you through the smoke

Without you Im misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when your next to me
Cause you come naturally

Mr Magic
Take a token
Mr Magic
Of my love, love, love
Mr Magic
I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach and look for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Bun jus to get you through

Mr Magic
Take a token
Mr Magic
Of my love
Mr Magic
See you through the smoke

Mr Magic

Mr Magic

Mr Magic

Waitin for the smoke to clear
Im waitin for the smoke to clear---Lyrics submitted by Jodene.
