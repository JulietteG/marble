Shout with me and hear the revolution beating.
Drums leading to war to new worlds.
Tear apart all maps cause they will only lead us to where we shouldn't be.
We break the sides of all new worlds.
Everywhere I turn I see the flames.
It starts to burn but it's okay,
cause I've been waiting for today to start this riot.
Feel the ground start to shake
all around, the world awakes
to the sound my earthquake when I become a,
a renegade.

This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.

Start breathing and listen to the drums beating.
They're leading towards a new world.
I look at my clock tic-toc, ticking.
This is the life we're given.
So we take it and make it worthy.
Everywhere I turn I see the flames.
It starts to burn but it's okay,
cause I've been waiting for today to start this riot.
Feel the ground start to shake
all around, the world awakes
to the sound my earthquake when I become a,
a renegade.

This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.
This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.
This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.

It feels like my heart's about to explode.
It feels like my heart's about to explode.
It feels like my heart's about to explode.
It feels like my heart's about to explode.

About to explode
I I I'm a renegade.

This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.
This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.
This is a riot, I I I'm a renegade.
I can't be quiet, I I I'm a renegade.

I'm a renegade.---
