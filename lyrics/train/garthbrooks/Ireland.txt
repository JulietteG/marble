They say mother earth is breathing, with each wave that finds the shore
Her soul rises in the evening, for to open twilights door
Her eyes are the stars in heaven, watching o'er us all the while
And her heart it is in Ireland, deep within the emrald isle............

We are forty against hundreds, in someone elses bloody war
we know not why were fighting, or what we're dying for
they will storm us in the morning, when the sunlight turns the sky
death is waiting for it's dance now, fate has sentenced us to die

(Chorus)
Ireland I am coming home, I can see your rolling fields of grreen and fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland

Oh the captain he lay bleeding, and I can hear him calling me
the men are yours now for the leading, show them to their destiny
and as I look up all around me, I see the ragged, tired and torn
I tell them to make ready cause we're not waiting for the morn

(Chorus)

Now the fog is deep and heavy, as we forge the dark in fear
we can hear their horses breathing, as in silence we draw near
There are no words to be spoken, just a look to say goodbye
I draw a breath and night is broken, as I scream our battle cry

Ireland I am coming home, I can see your rolling fields of green and fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand I'm coming home Ireland...
Yes I am home Ireland---Lyrics submitted by joel.
