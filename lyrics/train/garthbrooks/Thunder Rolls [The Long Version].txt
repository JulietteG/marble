Three thirty in the morning
Not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town 
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm movin in
He's headin' back from somewhere 
That he nver should have been
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burnin' 
In a house across town
Shs's pacin by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown
Askin for a miracle 
Hopin' she's not right
Prayin its the weather
Thats kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on 
Out of control
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls

She's waitin by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 

The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on 
Out of control
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls

She runs back down the hallway 
To the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol 
Kept in the dresser drawer
She tells the lady in the mirror 
He wont do this again
Cause tonight will be the last time
She'll wonder where he's been

The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold (darlin')
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on 
Out of control
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls---Lyrics submitted by brandy.
