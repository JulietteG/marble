Doctor you aint got a pill 
For whatevers making this World ill 
You cant get forgiveness at the store 
And peace its a politicians war 
You wont find a resolution in the bottom of a bottle 
In the stars or every startle 
The only answer to the problem, is 

People loving people 
Its the enemy to everything thats evil 
Aint no quick fix at the end of a needle 
Its just people loving people 
Whoaaooaao whoooaaooa whooaaooooooooooooooaoooaao 

Words arent always what they seem to be 
Talk is cheap and lies are free 
The fear when we dont understand 
Weve been scared since time began 
All the colors and the cultures look around theres so much spinning 
Its a complicated riddle 
The solution is so simple, its 

People loving people 
Its the enemy to everything thats evil 
Aint no quick fix at the end of a needle 
Its just people loving people 
Whoaaooaao whoooaaooa whooaaooooooooooooooaoooaao 

You can pawn it off on Kings and Queens 
And those behind the curtains 
See what can make the difference 
In a World so full of hurting 
That I believe the remedy starts right here with you and me 

People loving people 
Its the enemy to everything thats evil 
Aint no quick fix at the end of a needle 
Were just people loving people 
Its just people loving people 
Whoaaooaao whoooaaooa whooaaooooooooooooooaoooaao 
Whoaaooaao whoooaaooa whooaaooooooooooooooaoooaao 
Its just people loving people
