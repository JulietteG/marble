well...the snowflakes fell in silence over bellea wood that night. for a christmas truce had been declared by both sides of the fight. as we layed there in our trenches, the silence broke in two. by a german soldier singing a song that we all knew. though i did not know the language, the song was silent night. then i heard my buddy whisper "all is calm, all is bright" then the fear and doubt surrounded me cause i would die if i were wrong. but i stood up in my trench, and began to sing along. then across the frozen battle field, anothers voice joined in. until one by one each man became a singer of the hym. then i thought that i was dreaming. for right there in my sight, stood the german soldier 'neath the falling flakes of white. and he raised his hand and smiled at me as if he seemed to say, "heres hoping we both live to see us find a better way". then the devil's clock struck midnight, and the skies lit up again. and the battle field where heaven stood was blown to hell again... but for just one fleeing moment, the anwser seemed so clear... heavens not beyond the clouds. its just beyond the fear...no heavens not beyond the clouds... its for us to find it here...---Lyrics submitted by sam.
