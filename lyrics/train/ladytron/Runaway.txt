Every new day that you start 
plans the minute you're flagging your heart 
where you waking up today 
my little runaway 

every red eye that you cross 
makes the next feel serious 
where you waking up today 
my little runaway x4 

every silver shell that you crush 
will be enough 
where you gonna sleep today 
my little runaway 

when you feel like everyone 
wants to kill the unicorn 
where you waking up today 
my little runaway x16---Lyrics submitted by Santiago.
