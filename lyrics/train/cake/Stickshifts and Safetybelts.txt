stickshifts and saftey belts
bucket seats have all got to go
when were driving in the car
it makes my baby seem so far

i need you here with me 
not way over in a bucket seat
i need you to be here with me
not way over in a bucket seat

but when were driving in my malibu
its easy to get right next to you
i'll say baby scoot over please 
and then shes right there next to me

i need you here with me
not way over in a bucket seat
i need you to be here with me
not way over in a bucket seat

well alot of good cars
are japaneese
yeah but when were driving far 
i need my baby i need my baby next to me
oh oh well

stickshifts and saftey belts 
bucket seats have all got to go 
when were driving in the car 
it makes my baby seem so far

i need you here with me 
not way over in a bucket seat
i need you to be here with me
not way over in a bucket seat---Lyrics submitted by Brittnie.
