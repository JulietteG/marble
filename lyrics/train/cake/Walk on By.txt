Walk on by
The house where you still live
Walk on by
The place where we would kiss

And the room 
Where I held you tight
Tonight I must walk on by

Yeah

Walk on by
The room where you still sleep
Walk on by
The company that you keep

And the room
Where I held you tight
Tonight I must walk on by

Some... How... I... Know-ow 
I won't forget you, no no no no no
I won't 
You won't forget me, no no no no no
You won't


Ill keep on walking 
Away from here
Ill forget you 
When I reach the other side

Walk on by 
The house where you still live
Walk on by
The place where we would kiss

And the room 
Where I held you tight
Tonight I must 
Walk on by

Bye.

(Mean blues guitar)
(Then not-so-mean slide guitar) 

And the room 
Where I held you tight
Tonight I must 
Walk on by---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
