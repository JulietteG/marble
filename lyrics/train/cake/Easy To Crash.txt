Clouds hung hugely and oppressively
Over our busy little cars
Clouds hung hugely and oppressively
We didn't notice
We didn't care
We didn't notice

Driving along in our luxury cars
Down to our pretty city of stars
Down to our pretty city of stars (Stars in our eyes)
Money in pocket (Hugs on TV)
Plugs in the socket

You know it would be easy, so easy
It would be easy to
It would be easy, so easy
It would be easy to crash

Schoolteachers, bakers, bankers, congressmen
Stargazers didn't see a thing
Stockbrokers, singers, dancers, architects (Stars in our eyes)
We didn't notice
We didn't care (Hugs on TV)
We didn't notice
Plugs in the socket

You know it would be easy, so easy
It would be (It would be easy)
You know it would be easy, so easy
It would be easy to crash

It would be easy (So easy, it would be easy)
You know (It would be easy, so easy)
You know (It would be easy)
It would be easy, so easy
You know (It would be easy)
It would be easy, so easy
You know (It would be easy)
It would be easy, so easy
It would be easy to crash---Lyrics submitted by Bob.
