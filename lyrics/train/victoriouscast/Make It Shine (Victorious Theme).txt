Here I am, once again
Feelin' lost, but
Now and then
I breathe it in,
To let it go,
And ya don't know where you are now,
Or what it will come to
If only somebody could hear.
When ya figure out how,
Lost in the moment,
Ya disappear. . .

[Chorus]
You don't have to be afraid to put your dreams in action!
You're never gonna fade;
You'll be the main attraction!
Not a fantasy,
Just remember me,
When it turns out right.
'Cuz you know that if your living your imagination
Tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination.
In my victory,
Just remember me
When I make it
SHINE!!

Reaching high, feelin' low,
I'm holding on or letting go.
I like to shine,
I'll shine for you.
And it's time to
Show the world how
It's a little bit closer
As long as I'm ready to go.
All we have is right now
As long as you feel inside you know...

[Chorus]

Everyone can tell you
How it's all been said and done.---Lyrics submitted by Krissy.
