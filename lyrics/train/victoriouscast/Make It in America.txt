(feat. Victoria Justice)

Got a one way ticket down a 2 way street
Got the wind in my hair and theres dust on my feet
Im just trying to make it in America
Only thing to my name is an old t-shirt
Faded 1985 from a stones concert
And Im dying to make in America
And Im singing the words to my favorite song
With the rag top down and my glasses on
And Im driving straight through America

I wanna taste the sun
Baby Im born to run
I got a feeling that Im not the only one
I, I wanna show some skin
Yeah baby I need the ocean
And you can stop me now Ive got my heart in motion
I want to make it in America
Make it in America

I can see my star sunset and vine
Gonna carve my name in the Hollywood sign
Yeah I gotta, gotta make it in America
See me wearin a smile, even if Im broke
Ill be singing the words from a song I wrote
And I called it make it in America

I wanna taste the sun
Baby Im born to run
I got a feeling that Im not the only one
I, I wanna show some skin
Baby I need the ocean
And you can stop me now Ive got my heart in motion
I wanna make it in America
Make it in America

I can feel the sweat dripping down my face
I can hear my heart as it starts to race
Yeah sometimes this worlds such a lonely place
If I just push on I know that

I wanna taste the sun
Baby Im born to run
I got a feeling that Im not the only one
I, I wanna show some skin
Baby I need the ocean
And you can stop me now Ive got my heart in motion
I wanna make it in America
Make it in America ---
