Are you listening?
Here me talk, here me sing.
Open up the door is it less is it more.
When you tell me to beware
Are you here?
Are you there?
Is it something i should know?
Easy Come, Easy Go.

Not in Your head,
don't hear a word i said.
I can't communicate
when you wait don't relate.
I try to talk to you,
but you never even knew.
So, what's it gonna be?
Tell me, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

[CHORUS]
I'm so sick of it,
your attention deficit.
Never listen, you never listen.
I'm so sick of it,
so i'll throw another fit.
Never listen, you never listen.
I SCREAM your name,
it always stays the same.
I SCREAM and shout,
so what i'm gonna do now,
is FREAK THE FREAK OUT!

WOAHx4
Easy come, easy go.
Can you hear me?

[CHORUS]
I SCREAM your name,
it always stays the same.
I SCREAM and shout,
so what i'm gonna do now,
is FREAK THE FREAK OUT!

WOAHx4
I SCREAM your name,
but you NEVER listen!
No, you never lisstennn!
But you never listen...---Lyrics submitted by Melody.
