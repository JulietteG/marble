I don't wear designer clothes
I don't go to the finest schools
But, I know...
I ain't no fool, baby.
I may not be a star
I'm not driving the sickest car
But, I know...
I can make you happy, baby.

I don't know what you been used to
Never been with a girl like you
But, I can give you a love that's true to
Your heart, not material things...

I'll give you my song
These words to you
Sing you what I feel
My soul is true.
I don't have the world
Can't give it to you girl,
But all that I can do
Is give this song to you.
(Na na na, na na na)
(Na na na, na na na)

Yeah, I know that you are blessed
But, there's something you're missing yet
Your own melody...
Oh, baby.

I don't know what you been used to
Never been with a girl like you
But, I can give you a love that's true to
Your heart, not material things...

I'll give you my song
These words to you
Sing you what I feel
My soul is true.
I don't have the world
Can't give it to you girl,
But all that I can do
Is give this song to you.

I'll give you my heart, my soul, my voice; baby
What I can say, I'll sing it.
Oh, Oooh, Oooooh.

I'll give my song, these words, to you baby, baby
Sing you what I feel, my soul is true.

I'll give you my song
These words to you
Sing you what I feel
My soul is true.
I don't have the world
Can't give it to you girl,
But all that I can do
Is give this song to you.---Lyrics submitted by Brandeezy.
