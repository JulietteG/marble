Suddenly, 
My choice is clear
I knew when only you and I were standing here
And beautiful, 
Is all I see
It's only you I know it's true, 
It has to be

That money isn't worth a thing if you didn't earn it, 
You don't deserve it
True love doesn't cost a thing
And if you try to buy it, 
You can't return it
No, no, no woah
Your friends doing all the same things
And my friends
Look at what you're wasting
It doesn't matter if you change their minds

Chorus:
Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
Cause I'm falling (falling)
I'm finally falling (falling)

I don't need all the finer things, diamond rings are nothing
So show me something
Cause love is all I need and all I ever wanted
And now I got it
Eh, eh, eh, eh
My friends wonder what you're thinking
And your friends will
Probably think the same thing
It doesn't matter if we change their minds

Chorus:
Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
Cause I'm falling, falling
I'm finally falling, falling

If you can't find love when your in it
Just forget it
It would change your mind once you get it
Don't you get it?
Cause we did it
Yea we did it
Well we did it

Chorus:
Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
Cause I'm falling (falling)
I'm finally falling (falling)

Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
Cause I'm falling (falling)
I'm finally falling (falling)

Finally falling (falling)
I'm finally falling (falling)---Lyrics submitted by marissa.
