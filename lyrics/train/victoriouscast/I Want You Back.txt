Ohhhhhh


Let me tell you now
Ohhhh

(Ohhhh)

When I had you to myself I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look


CHORUS:
Oh baby give me one more chance
(show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back

Yes I do now
I want you back
Ooh ooh baby
I want you back
Ya ya ya ya 
I want you back
Na na na na

Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tearstains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
CHORUS:
Oh baby all I need is one more chance
(show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
Uh-huh

A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need

(oh, give me one more chance
to show you that I love you baby)

Baby, (baby) Baby, (baby) Ohh
I want you back
Forget what happened then
I want you back (let me live again)
Oh baby I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Spare me of this cause
(give me back what i lost)
Oh baby I need one more chance, ha
I tell ya that I love you
(Oh Oh)

I want you back (5 times)---Lyrics submitted by Brandeezy.
