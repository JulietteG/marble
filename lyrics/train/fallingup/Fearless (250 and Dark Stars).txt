Empty house far away
Lost in lonely space
You know you've felt the same
From the shallows in love
To the depths of your scars
You know you want to change
In the rafters, a vate
Fixed and spinning late
There's a certain fear
Even light with control
Lights outside our homes
Wait for every tear

So exit the fall
And now it's over
You're learning
It's all before your heart
So exit the fall
And now it's over
You're learning
It's all before your heart

I found a way out
Through everything I've known
I'm walking fearless
With my faith down and all that I own
Don't take my picture
Cause I won't be there standing alone
I'm living fearless, so fearless
Like every day's my own

Steady hands in the planes
Calculated ways
To call it ailing in figure
Hearts far away
When you work so late
From a distant end

So exit the fall
And now it's over
You're learning
It's all before your heart
So exit the fall
And now it's over
You're learning
It's all before your heart
And now it's over
Before your heart
And now it's over
Before your heart

Call it what you want it, Call it just a game
Call it insane, all of these voices
Call it what you want it, call it just a game
Call it insane, all of these voices
Call it what you want it, call it just a game
Call it insane, all of these voices
Call it what you want it, call it just a game
Call it insane, all of these voices
Call it what you want it, call it just a game
Call it insane, all of these voices

[Rapped during previous part]
I'm calling from the back of your mind
From the places you'll never reside
Where your thoughts collide
See places and thousands of faces
All at the same time
Look, everybody close your eyes
Travel to the place in the back of your mind
The place you'll never reside
Where thoughts combine
See places and thousands of faces
All at the same time
All at the same time
All at the same time---Lyrics submitted by Ammy.
