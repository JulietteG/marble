I've been here before, it's all I've ever known
Looking for the face that I am 
Where do I go? All that's in my sight
Are darkened dreams of empty lies
Hope is there it is waiting it is real
You are only what you want to feel
I can see your eyes and they are asking

We're a new hope generation 
We can see the wasted lives in your faces
But we can see Messiah rise in these places
Until the tears are gone

I've seen you before, you're always on your face
Trying to find the traces left
Hungry and tired, waiting for your needs
Just hold him close he won't ever let you go

Open, Open arms
Let your spirit
Open, Open arms,
Let your spirit pour

[Ben Hulbert:]
Here's the call to anyone at all who's ever had
The rise right after a fall
It's revolutional when they come like this - They
Can't believe we're living representatives
It gives light unto the gen. X and Y, resolution
With no generic reply
I stand aside a genre that's on a tear, broken
Chains explain that we are almost there

We're a new hope generation 
We can see the wasted lives on your faces
But we can see Messiah rise in these places
Until the tears are gone

You think i will throw away
But I don't care what you say
Cause the one you pushed aside, will rule one day
You can no divide a unified youth nation
So where's my annointed now generation---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa.
