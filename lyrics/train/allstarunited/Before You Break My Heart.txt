Today is gonna be the last day
Sweeping under the rug what I've done wrong
I'm just like a jet without a runway
Stuck on the ground for so long

Waiting...
What are you waiting for?

Before you break my heart
Before I let you go
And turn my whole world upside down
Before you break my heart
I gotta let you know
There's no better time than now

I'm strong but I feel so fragile
I'm the great wall of fine china
Cuz when you do I know I'll find a 


Way...
I need nothing more

I'm falling in a million 
Little pieces on the ground
But I feel better now

Break my heart...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
