n 1974, the world was destroyed in a nuclear war
and no one can remember except for me
Cause I was up on a hill
as the sky grew white and still
adn I felt completely at peace while i was melting

        I imagine you, and you iimagine me
    together were making love imaginarily

It shoook me straight to the bone
To be instantlly so alone
But one by one the trees all re-appeared
I guess every tree lives on in memory]
and memories never die ,
they just fet better


        I imagine you, and you iimagine me
    together were making love imaginarily
    I fall in love with you
    you hate me like you do    
    But Id imagine thats what youre supposed to do

        dont question what were feeling
        one doubt could send us reeling
    back into the nothingness of 74

In 1975 after a year of wondering if Im alive
I finally realize just what my life is
anything you dream is alive as you and me
and anything you want you already have

the children know its true
they believe in me and you
listen to them laugh their day away

        back down to the the desert's killing floor
        back in a box looking for something more

I imagine you, stand ing in the nude
out in the forest of a million dreams
i fall in love with you,. then were touching too
isnt that what we're supposed to do---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
