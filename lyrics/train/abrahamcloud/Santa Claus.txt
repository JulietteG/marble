Ive got every disease known to man
Waiting patiently,  inside me,
To surprise me, when I least expect it,
But I aint got no one to love,

Got a notebook full of words,
Wood guitar,  plastic bird,         
Got a bus pass to Vegas
And two condoms,  just in case,
But I aint got no one to love,

LOVE EVERYONE,
SANTA CLAUS SAID,
AS HE PERCHED
NAKED ON MY BED
LOVE EVERYONE
AND YOULL BE FREE,
BUT FIRST  YOU GOTTA LOVE ME.

Do you remember the day
You found out Santa Claus  
was just a game ?
Were you angry or afraid ?
Could you ever trust anyone
in your life again?    
You just lost someone you loved,---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
