Some say this is 
                 a dangerous place
                 dangerous women
                 lipstick mace
                 men disappear
                 without a trace
                 stay anonymous
                 hide your face
                 in this town 
                 youd need a
                 Bulletproof  Heart.

                 When I came here
                  I was innocent
                 Soon found out what
                 trouble meant
                 Now I regret
                 the times I spent
                 in your
                 Towerblocks and Tenements

                 In this town
                 youd need a bulletproof heart
                 a bulletproof heart
                  shatterproof
                  Heart.
                  Watch your step
                  Dont open your door
                  open your door.


                  Some say this is
                  a dangerous place
                  searchlight circles
                  watch this space
                  men disappear
                  without a trace
                  anonymous faces
                  lost in the maze.

                  In this town
                  youd need a bulletproof heart
                  in this town
                  youd need a bulletproof
                  shatterproof heart.---Lyrics submitted by charrual.
