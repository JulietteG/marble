Are you passionate?
Are you livin' like you talk?
Are you dreamin' now
that you're goin' to the top?
Are you negative,
In a world that never stops,
Turnin' on you?
Turnin' on me?
Turnin' on you?

Are you loving it?
Can you ever get enough of it?
Is it everything?
A love that never stops,
Comin' to you?
Comin' to me?
Comin' to you?

Once I was a soldier,
I was fighting in the sky,
And the gunfire kept
comin' back on me.
So I dove into the darkness,
And I let my missles fly.
And they might be the ones,
That kept you free.

Once I was a prisoner,
I was riding in a truck,
Cleaned up for public display.
I looked at those around me,
And when they looked at me,
I let them see my soul that day.

Are you scared of it?
Do you wish that it would stop?
Does it bother you
when you hear your spirit talk?
Well I'm right with you,
Yes I'm right with you.
It's working on me,
It's working on you.
It's working on me.---Lyrics submitted by Carla.
