Are there any more
real cowboys
Left out in these hills?
Will the fire hit the iron
One more time?
And will one more
dusty pick-up
Coming rolling down the road
With a load of feed
before the sun gets high?
Well, I hope that
working cowboy never dies.

Not the one
that's snortin' cocaine
When the honky-tonk's all closed
But the one
that prays for more rain
Heaven knows
That the good feed
brings the money
And the money buys the clothes
Not the diamond sequins
shining on TV
But the kind the
working cowboy really needs.

Are there any more
country families
Still working hand in hand
Trying hard to stay together
And make a stand?
While the rows and rows of houses
Come creepin' up on the land
Where the cattle graze and
an old grey barn still stands
Are there any more
real cowboys in this land?

Are there any more
real cowboys in this land?---Lyrics submitted by Carla.
