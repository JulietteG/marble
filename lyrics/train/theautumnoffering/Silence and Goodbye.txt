These embers turn to flames of yearning
I walked behind for too long
I can't stop bleeding
These open wounds you left aren't healing
How the days just burn away
for you, I wished for something better

Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl 
Open your wrists
I'll let you bleed on me
Don't live another day
You walked away and left me to crawl

These open wounds aren't healing 
nothing is forever

...And when i dream of the light in your eyes
I still reach for you

Nothing is forever

Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl

Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me 
You walked away and left me to crawl.---Lyrics submitted by james.
