(feat. Natalia Doco, Emilie Gassin, Axelle Rousseau & Sherika Sherard)

Stop, try again
don't be afraid to follow your heart
Stop, try again
I said to myself to hold on tight

I pray, I swear, I swear
I'm only me
I...,..., I shine
I...
You fight, you fake, you force
and not a beat
You sign, you..., you...
You count on me

Stop, try again
don't be afraid to follow your heart
Stop, try again
I said to myself to hold on tight

Around my heart I break
I'm so conceived
I slied, I crush, I burned
I run on me
You claimed, you treat, you lied
I'm not easy
I tried to fight you
you're not happy

Stop, try again
don't be afraid to follow your heart
Stop, try again
I said to myself to hold on tight

Judge yourself
(you judge yourself)
Don't be so hard
It takes sometimes, hit back in mine
I do the same
(I do the same)
I know it's hard
always beat the case

Stop, try again
don't be afraid to follow your heart
Stop, try again
I said to myself to hold on tight

Stop and try again
don't be afraid to follow your heart
Stop again
I said to myself and hold, hold on tight

I said stop!---
