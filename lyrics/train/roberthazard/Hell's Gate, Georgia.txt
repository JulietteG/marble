Lately I've been thinkin about
The time when we were young
When we lived our dreams and got things done

Now the days they move so slow
Like butter in the sun
They went by so fast when we were young

I still hear them old songs
Playin in my head
I still feel like jumpin up and dancin round the bed

Baby you're the fire
Burnin in my eyes
Hot as Hell's Gate Georgia in July

Lately I've been thinkin about
The shadows in the lace
Revlon red and moonlight on your face

Brush your skin so soft and warm
Just like a summers breeze
Just a sight can bring me to my knees

I still hear them old songs
Playin in my head
I still feel like jumpin up and dancin round the bed

Even when a cold wind blows
Our love burns up the sky
Hot as Hell's Gate Georgia in July

Sometimes I go drifting off
There's places you can't go
Sometimes you go places I don't ever want to know

Even when our love turns cold
An ember still survives
Hot as Hells Gate Georgia in July

I still hear them old songs
Playin in my head
I still feel like jumpin up and dancin round the bed

Baby you're the fire
Burnin in my eyes
Hot as Hell's Gate Georgia in July
Hot as Hell's Gate Georgia in July

Lately I've been thinkin about
The time when we were young ---
