Hands will never move across the face thats on the wall
Every nowadays 
A place where we can fall
Nobody will miss a thing, they leaved us all alone
Hold our hands together til the last of us have come

(Chorus)
We couldve been bad
Wrong, we had a chance
We couldve been sad
For just a little bit longer
Just a little bit longer

Dirty will love this turn
Move in to kings and queens
Probably watching over all
The mist that we have breathed
Tie me to your promises
And we wont let you down
Stronger than the distance we can turn it all around

(Chorus x2)
We couldve been bad
Wrong, we had a chance
We couldve been sad
For just a little bit longer
Just a little bit longer
Just a little bit longer---Lyrics submitted by Gabriela Flores.
