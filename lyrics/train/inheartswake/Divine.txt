Breathe, 
and feel the air in your lungs. 
Breathe, 
and see how far that youve come. 
Even when our worlds collide, 
just breathe in one more time. 

Step into this world and see through my eyes, 
youll find that there is a love behind disguise. 
In this heart space I feel perpetual grace, 
and through time we will both survive. 

I can feel her taking me back. 
I can hear her calling me home. 
Mother nature suspended in time. 
We are one. 
We are divine. 
Living in a dream we cant control. 

Breathe, 
and feel the air in your lungs. 
Breathe, 
and see how far that youve come. 
Even when our worlds collide, 
just breathe in one more time. 

When doubtful feelings flood into my mind, 
I remember Im here and Im alive. 
It is human to feel, 
it is love that will heal even through the darkest of days. 

I can feel her taking me back. 
I can hear her calling me home. 
Mother nature suspended in time. 
We are one. 
We are divine. 
Living in a dream we cant control. 

Living in a dream of reality. 
We are Divine. 

Breathe, 
and feel the air in your lungs. 
Breathe, and see how far that youve come. 
Even when our worlds collide, 
just breathe in one more time. 

This is Serenity. 
Living in a dream we cant control. 
Living in a dream, 
we are alive.---
