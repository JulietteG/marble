It's a cold cold world
That we're walkin' through
Lay down the burden of your heart
But it's warm as toast
Walkin' two by two
Lay down the burden of your heart

Lay down the burden of your heart
I know you'll never miss it
Show your Daddy where it hurts,
And let your Daddy lift it

It's a fine fine line
Between love and hate
Why, it's tough to tell the two apart
But you know it's love
That He offers you
Lay down the burden of your heart

Lay down the burden of your heart
I know you'll never miss it
Show your Daddy where it hurts,
And let your Daddy lift it---Lyrics submitted by Noel.
