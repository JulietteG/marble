You give so much
And juggle it all with a smile
You tame the tornados with style
How do you keep it all up
I guess because every day comes to an end
You get up and do it again
No matter whatever gets done

Welcome yourself to the messy moment
Welcome yourself to be here now
Open your arms, open your heart
Let some of that love come back around
Ready to climb when you see the mountain
Ready to run when you feel the storm

Learning to try
Learning to fly
Learning to fall
Welcome yourself to it all

So now it's here
Stuck in the wake of these words
So many others have hurt
How you get through
You just let go
Into the music that plays
And dance with the songs as they change
That's how you know what to do

Welcome yourself to the messy moment
Welcome yourself to be here now
Open your arms, open your heart
When some of that love comes back around
Ready to climb when you see the mountain
And run when you feel the storm

Ready to fly
Ready to try
Ready to fall
Welcome yourself to it all

All I can do is open my heart up and begin
How do I know the time that I've got
How will I live till then

Welcome yourself to the messy moment
Welcome yourself to be here now
Open your arms, open your heart
Cause baby that love comes back around
Ready to climb when you see the mountain
And run when you feel the storm

Ready to try
Ready to fly
Ready to fall
Welcome yourself to it all

Yeah, to it all---
