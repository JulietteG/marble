Oh Lord, how many are Thy works
In wisdom Thou hast made them all
The earth is full of Thy possessions
There is the sea great and broad
In which are swarms without number
Animals both great and small
Oh Lord, Thou hast made them all

In which are swarms without number
Animals both great and small
Oh Lord, Thou hast made them all---Lyrics submitted by Noel.
