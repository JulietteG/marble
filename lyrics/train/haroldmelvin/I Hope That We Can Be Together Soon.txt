Hope That We Can Be Together Soon

When I'm away from you, boy
All I seem to do is cry
And then when I see you, boy
My, how the time does fly
I don't know if you need me and love me
The way I love and need you

I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
Real soon

Can you make it real soon
When I think about you, girl
Chills run up and down my spine
And if my wish would come true, girl
I'd be with you all the time
Wrong or right, day and night I'm gonna miss you
All my lonely heart seems to do

I hope that we can be together soon
(Maybe tomorrow)
I hope that we can be tegether soon
(Maybe tomorrow)
I feel that we can be together soon
But will you make it real soon
(I can't wait)
Can you make it real soon
(I can't wait)

I hope that we can be together
I swear I can't wait any longer
Every day my love grows stronger
Ooh, baby
And I, I'd like to...---Lyrics submitted by Vickie.
