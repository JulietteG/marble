Here you come again
all sad and confused
Instead of you bringing me good news
you're always bring me the blues
You know sometimes 
you look better going
than you do coming
Now I wouldn't lie on you
for nothing in the world
but however
there are something that a man must tell
now you got a body is by fischer
but your mind is by matel

I oh I 
I should be your lover
your sho nuff lover

Now you come to me
when he makes you feel bad
and you tell me how
how he makes you feel sad
lay your head on my shoulders 
and cry
cause I'm the one who loves you
now wipe the tears from your eyes
cause I oh I 
I should be your lover

I oh I 
I should be your lover
your sho nuff lover

it should've been me 
right from the start
cause I could never no no
I'd never break your heart
because I was shy 
you just passed my by
girl I'd do anything now
but some things gonna have to change now
make up your mind
cause we wasting time
we're wasting time 
cause I oh I 
I should be your lover

I oh I 
I should be your lover
your sho nuff lover

casue I bet he don't love you
like I love you
and I bet he don't need you
like I need you

now it's you and Me
girl now you don't have to go
I have a few more things to say
that won't take long

cause I bet he don't love you
(like I love you) Love you
if he did he wouldn't do the things 
that he do to you
(and I bet he don't need you)
if he did you wouldn't be crying oh baby
(I bet he don't need you) look at you

girl I'd do anything now
but some things gonna have to change now
make up your mind
cause we wasting time
we're just wasting time 

(bet he don't love you) 
bet he don't love you
(like I love you)
(bet he don't need you)
If he did he'd be good to you
(like I need you)

YOu wouldn't be crying
(bet he don't love you)
Oh look at you
(like I love you)

Cause I
(bet he don't need you)
 oh I
(like I need you)
I should be your lover
sho nuff lover---Lyrics submitted by Michael Miller.
