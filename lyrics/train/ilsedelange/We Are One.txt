Used to hold me
Now I hold you
Used to tell me
Now I tell you
Don't worry
Don't worry
We won't be apart
You were strong
Now I'm stronger
Please hold on a little longer
Don't worry
Don't worry
We won't be apart

Cause
We are one one one
one one one
Rhythim of a beating heart
We are one one one
one one one
Never be apart
Never be apart
Oooh oooh
oooh oooh
Never be apart

Gave me love
And I love you
In my blood pieces of you
Don't worry
Don't worry
We won't be apart
Where you are gone
I'll remember
In my heart still together
Don't worry
Don't worry
We won't be apart

Cause
We are one one one
one one one
Rhythim of a beating heart
We are one one one
one one one
Never be apart
Never be apart
Oooh oooh
oooh oooh
Never be apart

If you need to move on
Then I leave a light on
To help you find your way back home
While you are away and I will be waiting
We are lonely but not alone
Not alone

Cause
We are one one one
one one one
Rhythim of a beating heart
We are one one one
one one one
Never be apart
Never be apart
Oooh oooh
oooh oooh
Never be apart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
