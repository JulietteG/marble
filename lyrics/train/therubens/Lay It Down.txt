And I dont mind
Cause I speak my mind sometimes
And I think its time for me to try
To lay the blame where blame lies

Ive been searching for whoever made me feel this way
Im not liking where its leading or who its leading too
Cause its you
Cause its you
Cause its you
Cause its you

And so I said I would speak the truth
But I didnt think it would be to you
I guess Im sorry I have to lay you down
But no one gets to push me around.

Ive been searching for whoever made me feel this way
Im not liking where its leading or who its leading too
Cause its you
Cause its you
Cause its you
Cause its you

Cause its you
[repeat]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
