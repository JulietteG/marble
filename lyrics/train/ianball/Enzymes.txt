There's no hands arms left for me here
I started to talk like her
I'm going on back at the end of my senses
Even though she's not Australia
She's fairly through and and through 

There's no hope here left for me either
I started to think like her
I'm going mad at the mention of Sicily
Even though I've never been there
We barely made it through 

This one explodes and green
This one don't go off at all
This one might be the best one of all

There's no hands arms left for me here
I started to talk like her
I'm going on back at the end of my senses
Even though she's not Australia
We did all we could do
We did all we could do
We did all we could do
We did all we could do
She's fairly through and through 
She's fairly through and through
She's fairly through and through---Lyrics submitted by riccardo davi.
