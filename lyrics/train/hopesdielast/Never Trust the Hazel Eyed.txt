You're always trying to say
This all it happened for a reason
And again I see tears on your face
Cause you know you cheated us in vain

Alone alone

You'd better dig your hole alone
Cause no one wants to see you anymore

You found a new world
But I saw real love
No matter what you say
Cause I can see you tremble
And I have real love

Don't you look into
Yourself every night?
And what you see
Is it something you like?
You tried to hide yourself
Behind those fucking lies

Alone alone

You'd better dig your hole alone
Cause no one wants to see your anymore

You found a new world
But I saw real love
No matter what you say
Cause I can see you tremble
And I have real love

Don't you look
Into your self every night?
And what you see
Is it something you like?
You tried to hide yourself
Behind those fucking lies
But what you are it never dies
That's why you cry
And you don't know why

I'm afraid it's too late [x3]
I'm afraid
I don't want you back

I'm afraid it's too late
To forget and see your face
I'm afraid it's too late
To forget my friend no way

It's easy to see
That you're staring at me
And you wish you could turn back time
It's easy to see
That you don't wanna be
What you are now

But it's too late
Yeah it's too late

You found a new world
But I saw real love
No matter what you say
Cause I can see you tremble
And I have real love
I don't want you back---Lyrics submitted by Chris Carter.
