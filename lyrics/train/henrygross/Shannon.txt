Shannon
A tale about the death of a pet dog

Another day is at hand
Mama says shes tired again
No one can even begin to tell her

I hardly know what to say
Maybe its better that way
If Papa were here Im sure hed tell her

Shannon has gone Ive heard
Shes drifting out to sea
She always loved to swim away

Maybe shell find an island
With a shady tree
Just like the one in our backyard

Momma tries hard to pretend
Things will get better again
Somehow shes keeping it all inside her

Finally the tears fill our eyes
And I know somewhere tonight
She knows how much we really miss her

Shannon has gone Ive heard
Shes drifting out to sea
She always loved to swim away

Maybe shell find an island
With a shady tree
Just like the one in our backyard

Just like the one in our backyard---Lyrics submitted by John.
