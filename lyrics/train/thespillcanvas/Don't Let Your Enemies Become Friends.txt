Blacked out fallen on the floor tonight
Thats what I do to feel the light
You tell the open line that draws me in
Every time I sink a little lower in the deep tonight
I dont remember anything I used to like about you and why I always let you in.

And as the saying goes, dont let your enemies become friends
For the record, I never wanted this
For the record, I wish we never met and opened up this mess
I couldnt keep up so we cracked down 
And now everything is worse
I should have known Im better off on the floor alone
Sometimes closure doesnt close up anything at all.

Roughed up rolling in the afterglow, my dark mistakes they start to show
You operate the spotlight I bathe in
Every time I put a little faith in my hopelessness  
I recall why Im such a wreck about you and how you never let me win

And as the saying goes, dont let your enemies become friends
For the record, I never wanted this
For the record, I wish we never met and opened up this mess
I couldnt keep up so we cracked up 
And now everything is worse
I should have known, Im better off on the floor alone
Sometimes closure doesnt close anything at all.

All you ever did was use me like a puppet
Stringing me along just to let me lose
Giving me a choice so I had to choose
All I ever did was put it in the open
Giving up a chance to shut you down
You took it as a chance to shut me up

For the record, I never wanted this
For the record, I wish we never met and opened up this mess
I couldnt keep up so we cracked down
And now everything is worse
I should I have known, Im better off on the floor alone
Sometimes closure doesnt close out anything at all
Yeah, sometimes closure doesnt close up anything at all.
