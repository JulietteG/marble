[Verse 1:]
Last night tried to get some snooze dreamed we was break ingup we were through, when I looked around you was gone, found that a house is really not home when your alone, since you been away form me baby I was so wrong, come back 2me baby and I thought about my family where would I be without their unity and my love for my people run deep n when I struggle through the game they supporting me, so many who are gone n now asleep rest in peace, I knw I'm blessed woke up 2a second chance...

[Chorus:]
This time I'll be there for you every night say a prayer for you (this time) I'm gonna open up gonna take your advice gonna show some love (this time) and baby I'll be true (I'm gonna make a difference) this time I'm so in love with you this time

[Verse 2:]
Woke up turned on the news said to myself what is this world coming to (awww yee-es) this can't be true baby I'm so scared scared of losing you and I feel so helpless I been waiting and waiting and Waiting and waiting just to catch my breath my world is filled with noise I need the calmness of your voice don't let them take away my joy cause without you there's an empty void

[Chorus:]
This time I'll be there for you say a prayer for you (this time) I'm gonna open up show you love (this time) baby I'll be true (I'm gonna make a difference) this time I'll show you love baby (this time) this time this time

I can't describe feelings inside feel like I'm gonna die and I can't hold back these tears n my eyes no one can replace the smile upon your face and it used to make my day I can't go on until I know that your ok and it's not the same baby so I so I gotta tell you

[Chorus:]
This time I'll b there for you say a prayer for you (this time) I'm gonna open up show you love (this time) baby I'll be true (I'm gunna make a difference) this time I'll show you love this time---Lyrics submitted by ace.
