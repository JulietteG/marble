Why did I dream last night?
Why did I not see the light?
Cause here and now is what I've been waiting for.
All my life, this is what I was born to do.
No sacrifice, I wouldn't give it up for you.

And set fire to my heart
Then tear my world apart,
Just like you always do.
And give, give me just a taste.
Then take it all away,
I'm lost in the game,
The game you call the fame.

Why did I think there was something more?
Why did it feel different to the years before?
Cause here and now is what I've been waiting for.
All my life, this is what I was born to do.
No sacrifice, I wouldn't give it up for you.

And set fire to my heart
Then tear my world apart,
Just like you always do.
And give, give me just a taste.
Then take it all away,
I'm lost in the game,
The game you call the fame.
The game you call the fame.

And set fire to my heart
Then tear my world apart,
Just like you always do.
And give, give me just a taste.
Then take it all away,
I'm lost in the game,
The game you call the fame. ---Lyrics submitted by julie.
