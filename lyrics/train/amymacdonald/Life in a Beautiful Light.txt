How do I know when I've found my one and only and these days of searching
Are through?
How do I know when you love me as much as I love you?
How do you know when your life, your life is complete?
When the butterflies in your stomach sweep you of your feet.

'Cause the stars in my eyes, well they twinkle when I see your face. And
The butterflies keep flying, flying all over the place. And the dark and
Grey, well it fits with the black and white.
And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.
And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.

Nothing can prepare me for what I'm feeling right now. And nobody and
Nothing is ever gonna bring me down, down down.

No rain, no hail, no sleet, no snow. 'cause the sun always shines
Everywhere I go.

'Cause the stars in my eyes, well they twinkle when I see your face. And
The butterflies keep flying, flying all over the place. And the dark and
Grey, well it fits with the black and white.
And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.
And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.

'Cause the stars in my eyes, well they twinkle when I see your face. And
The butterflies keep flying, flying all over the place. And the dark and
Grey, well it fits with the black and white.
And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.
And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.

And all I see is life, life in a beautiful light.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
