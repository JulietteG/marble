Hello Hello Hello Hello

Oh not again
One thing lead to another way
He said lets just be friends
Right then and there i said to him

Oh thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think youre looking for
Oh dont do me any favors
i guess ill see you later
matter fact pull over and let me out this door

Oh johnny took my heart
and left me right here on the sidewalk
on the corner is where he dropped me
Im saying ohh why did we have to part
So now im dialing on my cellphone
begging johnny baby bring me back my heart

bring me back my heart
bring me back my heart
bring me back my heart

Now I ask myself why?
why did i let him go? now im
walking alone, alone in this cold
Johnny the least you couldve done
was drive me home

Oh thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think youre looking for
Oh dont do me any favors
i guess ill see you later
matter fact dont bother knocking on my door

Oh johnny took my heart
and left me right here on the sidewalk
on the corner is where he dropped me
Im saying ohh why did we have to part
So now im dialing on my cellphone
begging johnny baby bring me back my heart

bring me back my heart (my heart)
bring me back my heart (my heart)
bring me back my heart (my heart)

Now im hiding
this is hard for me to do
see im not that chick whos sits around
and waits all night for you
but youre worth it
why you left me i dont know
but ill walk these streets all night
until i bring my baby home

oh i need your loving
you got that special something
who am i kidding 
please johnny come back home

Oh johnny took my heart
and left me right here on the sidewalk
on the corner is where he dropped me
Im saying ohh why did we have to part
So now im dialing on my cellphone
begging johnny baby bring me back my heart---Lyrics submitted by charlayne.
