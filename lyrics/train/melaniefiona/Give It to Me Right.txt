Ok Ok he's got my number and
you can't warn me Baby here I am
either you make the time
    ....
or just forget me
Im not Im not tryna run your life
Thats why, thats why
Im nobodys wife.
But when I want, when I want it
you gotta be ready
I don't want it all the time,
But when I get it, I better be satisfied
So give it to me right,or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand,
How real it is for me to find
A man who thinks he can
So give it to me right, Or don't give it to me at all
On time, on time I expect you to be
Oh my, Oh my Baby in my fantasy
You can't get it right,then just forget it
No ways ok, For you to go around
uh uh, today You better make a touch down
you know what I like, Won't you except it
I don't want it all the time,But when I want it
You better make me smile
So give it to me right, Or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand, If you can't please me,
I know someone who can
So give it to me right, Or don't give it to me at all
This is the real life baby
This is the life that makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahh
This is the real thing baby
When I'm alone I can make me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahh
I don't want it all the time,
But when I want it,You better make me smile
So give it to me right, Or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand, If you can't please me,
I know someone who can
So give it to me right, Or don't give it to me at all
Give it to me right, give it to me right,
So give it to me right, Or don't give it to me at all---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
