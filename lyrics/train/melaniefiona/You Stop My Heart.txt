Im so exited I cant get past to one, two, three
Im so impatient, its everything you do to me
A little fire fixed in good with desire
Makes my heart sing like a choir
Im on a respirator whenever he leaves

Cause you stop my heart
I cant focus on anything
Cause you stop my heart
And you get to beat it back again

Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my
Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my heart again

Its never private, he tells the whole world bout me
I cant fight it, hes taking all the air I breathe
Its so perverse, so take no list of this hurtin 
I just wanna keep flirting cause I know that I deserve him

Cause you stop my heart
I cant focus on anything
Cause you stop my heart
And you get to beat it back again

Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my
Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my heart again

You surround me like I wanna
Cause I love you
You will give this heart a murmur
Cause I lost you

Cause you stop my heart
I cant focus on anything
You stop my my my my my heart
And you get to beat it back again

Bum bum bum bum bum
You stop my heart
Bum bum bum bum bum
You stop my heart
My heart ---Lyrics submitted by Janny.
