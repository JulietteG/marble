Hello, hello, hello, hello

Oh not again, one thing lead to another way 
He said let's just be friends 
Right then and there I said to him

Oh, thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think you're looking for

Oh, don't do me any favors
I guess I'll see you later
Matter fact pull over and let me out this door

Oh, Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk 
On the corner is where he dropped me

I'm saying oh, why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
Begging Johnny baby, bring me back my heart

Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart, ooh

Now I ask myself why, why did I let him go?
Now I'm walking alone, alone in this cold
Johnny the least you could've done was drive me home

Oh, thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think you're looking for

Oh, don't do me any favors 
I guess I'll see you later
Matter fact don't bother knocking on my door

Oh, Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk
On the corner is where he dropped me

I'm saying oh, why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
Begging Johnny baby, bring me back my heart

Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart, ooh

Now I'm hiding, this is hard for me to do
See I'm not that chick who sits around
And waits all night for you but you're worth it

Why you left me I don't know
But I'll walk these streets all night
Until I bring my baby home

Oh, I need your loving
You got that special something
Who am I kidding 
Please Johnny, come back home

Oh, Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk 
On the corner is where he dropped me

I'm saying oh, why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
Begging Johnny baby, bring me back my heart

Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk
On the corner is where he dropped me

I'm saying oh, why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
Begging Johnny baby, bring me back my heart

Hey Johnny, you know who it is---Lyrics submitted by Diana Brown.
