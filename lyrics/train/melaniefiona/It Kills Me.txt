Oh yaahh ive got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you dont come home at night
But when you do you always start a fight
But I cant be alone , I need you to come on home
I know you messin around, but who the hell else is gonna hold me down
Ooooh I gotta be out my mind to think its gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave, but the other side still believes
And it kills me to know how much I really love you
So much I wanna ooh hoo ohh to you hoo hoo
Should I grab his cell, call this chick up
Start some shhhh then hang up
Or I should I be a lady
Oohh maybe cuz I wanna have his babies
Ohh yah yahh cuz I dont wanna be alone
I don't need to be on my own
But I love this man
But some things I cant stand ohhhh
Ive gotta be out my mind
To think its gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave but the other half still believes
and it kills me to know how much I really love you
So much I wanna oohh hoo ohhh, to you hoo hooo Should I do bad to c how react ,React to ma love
Oohh Ive gotta be out my mind 
To think it's gonna work this time Oohh part of me wants to leave but the other half still believes 
and it kills me to kno who much i really love you it make me want to oohh hoo to you hoo hoo---Lyrics submitted by demetrius.
