How about my first
Next to your last
Boy I couldn't have done no better
I could dance with you forever
And ever
Baby I don't want to let this go
In your arms is where I feel secure
Oh my heart has never been this sure
Not ever!

I've waited forever (oh)
For you to love me like I love you
Now that we're together (oh)
All I want is for you
To love me love me
Like you know I love you
Want me, want me
Like you know I want you
Love me, love me
Love me like I love you
Love me like I love you.
Love me, love me, like you know I love you
Want me, Want me like you know you wanna
Love me love me
Love me like I love you
Love me like I love you.

I held my breath til I turned blue
Waiting on you
Had my friends, even my family
Call me a fool (call me a fool)
Cause they don't have to ask to see you
For you, I saw through
And if it look so bad
And it hurt so bad
Why does it feel so good?

I've waited forever (oh)
For you to love me like I love you
Now that we're together (oh)
All I want is for you
To love me love me
Like you know I love you
Want me, want me
Like you know I want you
Love me, love me
Love me like I love you
Love me like I love you.
Love me, love me, like you know I love you
Want me, Want me like you know you wanna
Love me love me
Love me like I love you
Love me like I love you.

Have so much that I wanna say
But sometimes words they get in the way
And I don't wanna play these games no more
(games no more) (oh)
Cause I can be your Bunny
If you can be my Clyde
Make this last forever
Cause I'm down for the ride
And even if we fall
I'd rather risk it all
than say that we never tried. 

I've waited forever (oh)
For you to love me like I love you
Now that we're together (oh)
All I want is for you
To love me love me
Like you know I love you
Want me, want me
Like you know I want you
Love me, love me
Love me like I love you
Love me like I love you.
Love me, love me, like you know I love you
Want me, Want me like you know you wanna
Love me love me
Love me like I love you
Love me like I love you.---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
