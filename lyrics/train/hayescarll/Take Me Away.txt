Rain beatin' down, on a midnight moon
Oh babe, I'll be leavin' soon
Take me away

The winds are howlin' like an old freight train
Oh babe these are the winds of change
Take me away

Chorus:
'Cause I been sittin' on the front porch
Watchin' the world go round
Through the eyes of a fool, head like a rock
My whole world tumblin' down

Rain beatin' down, on a midnight moon
Oh babe, I'll be leavin' soon
Take me away

Grass around your ankles in the field before the flood
You're a rough-cut diamond in the Mississippi mud
Take me away

Well I'm a two time loser with my guitar and my gun
You're a mover and a shaker, and a lover in the sun
Take me away

Repeat Chorus

Rain beatin' down, on a midnight moon
Oh babe, I'll be leavin' soon
Take me away---Lyrics submitted by Leona Taylor.
