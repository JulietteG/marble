How good or bad, happy or sad
Does it have to get?
Losing yourself, no cry for help
You don't think you need it

And old friends are just a chore,
But now you need them more than ever before

All that glitter and all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bought and sold
Riding white horses, you can't control
With all your glitter
And all of your gold
Take care of your soul,
Take care of your soul
How high, how low, how on your own
Are you gonna get?
Because
Losing your soul, will cost you more
Than the life you're paying for

And all those friends you left behind
You might need 'em when it's cold outside

All that glitter and all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bought and sold
Riding white horses, you can't control
With all your glitter
And all of your gold
Take care of your soul
One day you're gonna wake up and find that
New dream is losing it's shine and
Nobody is by your side
When the rain comes down and you're losing your mind

So, who you gonna run to?
Where you gonna hide?
Glitter and gold
Won't keep you warm
On those lonely nights

And all those friends that were such a chore
You're gonna need them more than ever before

All that glitter and all that gold
Won't buy you happy
When you've been bought and sold
Riding white horses, you can't control
With all your glitter
And all of your gold
Take care of your soul
With all of your gold
Take care of your soul
Take care of your soul---Lyrics submitted by Emily Luty :).
