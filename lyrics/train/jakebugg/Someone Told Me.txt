Am I crazy, or am I blind
Someone told me about my mind, oh 

Someone told me (you get a hard life?)
Fell in love and all I did was cry, oh

Someone hold me, I'm done with this game
Said I'm sorry, but I'm not to blame, what a shame, whoa

Try to break from this lonely pain
Someone told me I'm just insane, oh 

Broke my heart when I knew, that I could not be with you, whoa 
Someone love(d) me, but not today

Will you show me, show me a way, how to love
Whoa
Someone told me (you get a hard life?)
Fell in love and all I did was cry, oh---Lyrics submitted by Darren B.
