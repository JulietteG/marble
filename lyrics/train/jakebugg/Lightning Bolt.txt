Morning, its another pure grey morning
Don't know what the day is holding
When I get up tired and I walk right into the path of a lightning bolt

Siren of an ambulance comes howlin'
Right through the centre of town and no-one blinks an eye
And I look up to the sky in the path of a lightning bolt

Met her as the angels parted for her
But she only brought me torture
But that's what happens
When it's you that's standing in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta toe the line, they want the water not the wine
But when i see the signs I'll jump on that lightning bolt

Chances, people tell you not to take chances
And they tell you that there aren't any answers
And I was starting to agree
But I woke suddenly
In the path of a lightning bolt

Fortune, people talking all about fortune
Do you make it or does it just call you
In the blinking of an eye
Just another passer-by in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and i wait my time
They say you gotta toe the line, they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I'll jump on that lightning bolt

Silence, I was lying back gazing skyward
When the moment got shattered
I remembered what she said
And then she fled in the path of a lightning bolt---
