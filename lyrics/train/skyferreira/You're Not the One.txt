Dreams stay with you
Always on my mind
I got a lust for lies
Seasons bring truth
When I found mine, it was summertime

Its the middle of the night and Im so gone
And Im thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
Im still thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else

Youre not the one
Guess youre not the one

Streets like a zoo
Through a city of lights, love at first sight
Silent rays of blue
They slowly glide
Right down my spine

Its the middle of the night and Im so gone
And Im thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
Im still thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else

Youre not the one
Guess youre not the one
Youre not the one
Guess youre not the one

I was enjoying the ride
And now were standing on the graveside
Left unsatisfied
I wont even bother to fight
I know youre not the one

Youre not the one
Youre not the one
Youre not the one

Youre not the one
Guess youre not the one
Youre not the one
Guess youre not the one

Youre not the one ---
