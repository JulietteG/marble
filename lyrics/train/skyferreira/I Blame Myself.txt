Is it because you know my name
Or is it because you saw my face on the cover?
Either way it's all the same
It's like talking to a friend
Who's trying to be your lover

Underneath it all
I know it's not your fault
That you don't understand
I blame myself

How could you know what it feels like
To fight the hounds of hell?
You think you know me so well
How could you know what it feels like
To be outside yourself?
You think you know me so well
I just want you to realize I blame, I blame myself
Blame, blame, blame myself
I blame, I blame, blame myself for my reputation

I'm just a face without a choice
A choice you'd never like to guess what I think above the shoulders
10 years old without a voice
I feel like nothing's really changed
Now I'm just a little older

Underneath it all
I know it's not your fault
That you don't understand
I blame myself

How could you know what it feels like
To fight the hounds of hell?
You think you know me so well
How could you know what it feels like
To be outside yourself?
You think you know me so well
I just want you to realize I blame, I blame myself
Blame, blame, blame myself
I blame, I blame, blame myself for my reputation

Oh, I blame myself
Oh, I blame myself
Oh, I blame myself
Oh, I blame myself

How could you know what it feels like
To fight the hounds of hell?
You think you know me so well
How could you know what it feels like
To be outside yourself?
You think you know me so well
I just want you to realize I blame, I blame myself
Blame, blame, blame myself
I blame, I blame, blame myself for my reputation

Oh, I blame myself
Oh, I blame myself
Oh, I blame myself
Oh, I blame myself---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
