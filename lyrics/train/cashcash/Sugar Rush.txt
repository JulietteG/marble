I took my time
I never touched when you taste you tease me
All night, sugar rush
Just gimme a taste tonight
Oh oh oh girl youre too much
Im burning up right now, and I need your touch
Come on lets take a ride
Crash and well collide
Just give it a chance tonight

[Chorus]
So I can taste you on my tongue
With your lips to kiss like the red hot sun
Youre one big sugar rush
Suck me in, suck me in, hold me down till the very end

I hate the chase
Just stop the clock cause youre so close now
That I can taste, sugar rush
Then up and go without a trace
Oh oh oh you and your hoax
You got me all lit up in your fireworks
Come on well light the sky
Smokes a shooting fly
Lets give a chance tonight

[Chorus X2]

Hold me down till the very end
Love, your sweet sweet loves making me
Go off the wall
Making me fly high
Cant sleep, got a big crush
I, I cant sleep need a sugar rush
Love, your sweet sweet loves making me, go

[Chorus X3]

One big sugar rush
Suck me in, suck me in, hold me down till the very end---Lyrics submitted by Holly.
