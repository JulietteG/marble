I was running on an empty heart
not a trace of gasoline
Trying to dim every single spark that could hurt
that could burn all of me

Like a soldier on the battleground  
lying wounded on the field
I was fighting alone with a broken sword  
now Im caught in a war with no shield

If you hold me now and leave me never
say youll stay with me forever
then I surrender
Surrender 

Surrender 
Surrender 

I pushed and pulled all the ones that tired
then I wanted them fade away
As I look around a vacant room
I see nobody left here to blame

Cause I made myself a prisoner  
shackled up by all my fears
But I feel you breaking away at the walls 
make them fall make them all disappear---
