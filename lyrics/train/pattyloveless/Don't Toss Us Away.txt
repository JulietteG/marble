Well it seems that everyone we know
The loves grown cold, while ours stand the storm
One by one they break
It such a shame
And now you say you want to do the same

Don't toss us away
So thoughtlessly
It just ain't right
Oh can't you see?
I still love you
I want you to stay
Darlin please don't toss us away

Well just think of all that we been through
The world we're building..me and you
How could all those years be tossed away
In just one moment..in just one day 

Don't toss us away
It just ain't right
To let love die without a fight
I still love you
I want you to stay
Darlin please don't toss us away

So now I'm asking once again
To understand, to be my friend
Oh it hurts so bad to think you'd go
But still the same, I love you so

Don't toss us away
So thoughtlessly
It just ain't right 
Oh can't you see?
I still love you
I want you to stay
Darlin please, don't toss us away

Oh darlin please
Don't toss us away---
