through the back window, of a '59 wagon
i watched my best friend Jaime slippin' futher away,
i kept of wavin', til i couldn't see her, and
through my tears i asked again why we couldn't stay.

momma whispered softly, time will ease your pain
life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same,
and she said how can i help you to say goodbye,
it's ok to hurt and its ok to cry, come let me hold you 
and i will try 

how can i help you to say goodbye.

i sit on our bed, he packed his suitcase
i held a picture of our wedding day
his hands were tremblin' , we both were cryin'
he kissed me gently and then quickly walked away.

i called up momma and she said time will ease your pain
life's about changin nothing ever stays the same,
and she said how can i help you to say goodbye,
its ok to hurt and its ok to cry, come let me hold you
and i will try 

how can i help you to say good bye

sittin' with momma, alone in her bed room
she opened her eyes, then squeezed me hand
she said i have to go now, my time here is over
and with her final words she tried to help me understand

momma whispered softly time will ease your pain
life's about changin nuthing ever stays the same
and she said, how can i help you to say goodbye
its ok to hurt and its ok to cry come let me hold you
and i will try
how can i help you to say good bye---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
