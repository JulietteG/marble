So they say lord for everything a reason
for every ending a new beginning
And so they say baby for everything a reason
And so they say baby for everything a reason

And those who loved before will be bought back together
those who loved before will be bought back together
And so they say baby for everything a reason
And so they say baby you will be bought
back to me.

I saw you leaving
i saw the light go out

and so they say lord for everything a reason
my house is haunted by rotten desire
and on my skin left the scent of indignation
and so they say baby for everything a reason

Don't call me that i had everything i needed
for every lie honey the truth lies underneath it
And so they say baby for everything a reason
And so they say baby you will be born
back to me

I saw you leaving
i saw the light go out

Come back to me.---
