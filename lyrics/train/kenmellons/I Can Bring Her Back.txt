The slammin' of the door
was loud enough to wake the dead
I don't love you anymore
was the last words she said
you know a man can go half crazy
with nothin's left to hold on to
but she forgot to take the pictures
now they'll see me through

I can bring her back when I want to
almost close enough to touch
the memories keep tellin' me 
that I don't have to give her up
I can bring her back night or day
I don't need a certain time
I can bring her back when I want to
Oh but only in my mind

In our bed I feel her presence
Lord, as if, she hadn't gone
when I close my eyes and go to sleep
that's when I'm not alone

I can bring her back when I want to
almost close enough to touch 
the memories keep tellin' me
I don't have to give her up
I can bring her back night or day
I don't need a certain time
I can bring her back when I want to 
oh but only in my mind

I can bring her back when I want to....---Lyrics submitted by Howard.
