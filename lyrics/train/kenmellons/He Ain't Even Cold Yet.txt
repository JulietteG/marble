The slammin' of the door
Was loud enough to wake the dead
I don't love you anymore
Were the last words she said
You know a man can go half crazy
If nothin's left to hold on to
But she forgot to take the memories
And they'll see me through

Cause, I can bring her back when I want to
Almost close enough to touch
My every thought keeps telling me
I don't have to give her up
I can bring her back night or day
I don't need a certain time
I can bring her back when I want to
Oh, but only in my mind

She left all the family pictures
Still hangin' on the wall
And back there in the closet
Is her last new dress I bought
In the bed I feel her presence
Lord, as if she hadn't gone
When I close my eyes and go to sleep
That's when I'm not alone

Cause, I can bring her back when I want to
Almost close enough to touch
My every thought keeps telling me
I don't have to give her up
I can bring her back night or day
I don't need a certain time
I can bring her back when I want to
Oh, but only in my mind

I can bring her back when I want to---Lyrics submitted by imma.
