Eden Langworthy/Sherry Lynn/Kim Ragans

Did you think I was gonna
Sit at home crying myself to sleep
Did you think I wouldnt make it
On my own
Without you here with me
Well you couldnt be more wrong boy
Im out singing and dancing to
You might think it sounds crazy
But Im way past over you
(Chorus)
So dont go believing I need a man
To make all my dreams come true
Time has shown Im a self made woman
Ive made history out of you
And dont you come begging at my door
Cause darling you dont have a clue
You might think it sounds crazy
But baby Im way past over you

Youre wrong if you were thinking
Id miss your boring company
So dont you be telling all your friends
I fell apart when you set me free
You can call them up and tell them
Ive got better things to do
They might think it sounds crazy
But baby Im way past over you

(Repeat Chorus)
 (Instrumental Break)
So dont go believing I need a man
To make all my dreams come true
Time has shown Im a self made woman
Ive made history out of you
And dont you come begging at my door
Cause darling you dont have a clue
You might think it sounds crazy
But baby Im way past over you
So dont you come begging at my door
Cause darling you dont have a clue
You might think it sounds crazy
But baby Im way past over you
You might think it sounds crazy
But baby Im way past overWay past overIm way past over you---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
