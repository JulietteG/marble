When the ground touched the tires
I was already lighter two time zones away from home
That dead end eight to five ex boyfriend low life
Was going going gone
A ten dollar cab ride to a bungalow seaside
For the next week my home sweet home

Im gonna slip into something Mexico
My little white two piece ball cap sombrero
From high heels to flip flops
Makeup to sun block
Lie on the beach tell the world where to go
And slip into something Mexico

Local cantina servesa  my svena
he said can I buy you a drink
I said dont get me wrong I may be alone
But alone is where I wanna be
A girl sometimes needs to unwind from
A wound life out of control

And slip into something Mexico
No deadlines just tan lines and time moving slow
From high heels to flip flops
Makeup to sun block
Lie on the beach as the waves come and go
And slip into something Mexico

I paid my tab and he smiled kind of sad
When I said adios Ive gotta go

slip into something Mexico
No deadlines just tan lines and time moving slow
From high heels to flip flops
Makeup to sun block
Lie on the beach as the waves come and go
And slip into something Mexico
My little white two piece ball cap sombrero
From high heels to flip flops
Makeup to sun block
Lie on the beach tell the world where to go
And slip into something Mexico

When the ground touched the tires
I was already lighter two time zones away from home---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
