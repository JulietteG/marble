Kari Eidson / Sherry Lynn

Out in the backyard down by the creek
Theres some initials on an old oak tree
A rope still dangles that old tire swing
How did we ever forgetthose simple things

Through the years weve lost sight 
 of those dreams that we dreamed
what went wrong we were right for each other
Now I long for those times and all too often it seems
How I wish that we hadnt let go of those Simple Things

Down on the corner at the five and dime
Thats were we shared our very first kiss
You gave me your heart and I promised you mine
How did we ever forget those simple things


Through the years weve lost sight 
 of those dreams that we dreamed
what went wrong we were right for each other
Now I long for those times and all too often it seems
How I wish that we hadnt let go of those Simple Things

Caught up in life we forget
The true joy that only love can bring
Each day we should bow our heads and pray
Cause we are so lucky to be blessed

Through the years weve lost sight 
 of those dreams that we dreamed
what went wrong we were right for each other
Now I long for those times and all too often it seems
How I wish that wed never let go of those Simple Things

Out in the backyard down by the creek
Theres some initials on an old oak tree
A rope still dangles that old tire swing
How did we ever forgetthose simple things---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
