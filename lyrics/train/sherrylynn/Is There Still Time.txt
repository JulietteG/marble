Sherry Lynn

Sitting on the porch swing thinking about her life
At seventeen she was a mother at nineteen someones wife
Times been traveling oh so fast shes watching it pass her by
Remembering her child hood dreams as she wonders Is there still time
(Chorus)
Is there still timestill time for her to chase her dreams
The ones she left behindIs there still time
Between the football and the little league
The broken vows and the misery can she somehow find the strength
To bring her dreams to lifeIs there still time
She closes her eyes and imagines shes singing on that stage 
In front of all her screaming fans everybody knows her name
The man who broke her heart in two sits watching from the crowd 
She opens her eyescovers her mouth then laughs out loud
Is There still time Is there still timestill time for her to chase her dreams
The ones she left behindIs there still time
Between the football and the little league
The broken vows and the misery can she somehow find the strength
To bring her dreams to lifeIs there still time
(Instrumental Break)
(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
