He walked up to me and asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him, I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do, so I whispered, "I Love You"
He said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I'd never been kissed before
He kissed me in a way that I want to be kissed forever more
I knew he was mine and so gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home to meet his mom and his dad

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy that I almost cried
And then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy that I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me---Lyrics submitted by Gale Powell.
