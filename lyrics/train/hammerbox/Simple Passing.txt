Here we are...
Passing round the stories
All the things they taught us
Well, yeah, they taught us well now

We've only got this moment
and some would about it,
"It isn't much"
Yeah, it isn't much now

Sit around the fire
In my mind
And who am I
And who can knock me if I killin' time?
No more apologies
For things I can't explain
And when you look inside
You see the reasons why
Don't you?

I know myself
I've long been blind
And I know why
And I see all the reasons why inside

Here we are
Waiting for the answers
In our TV and our radio
Gone by, oh my

I know my feel
They've long been blind
And they see all the reasons why in time.

Here we are...
Waiting for the answers
And a time until the radio will read our mind
No more apologies
For things I can't explain
And when you look inside
You see the reasons why
Don't you?---Lyrics submitted by Alexandre.
