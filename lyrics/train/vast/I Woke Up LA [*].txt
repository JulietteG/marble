I woke up LA
Then I went to sleep
I saw so many things
I know that you saw too
I walked a thousand miles
In clothes that children made
I felt so many things
I know that you felt too
Please forgive me, you know I lost my mind
Please forgive me, you know I lost the time
To say I love you
I woke up LA
Maybe it's a dream
To be with those who play
Dress up, make believe
I flew a thousand miles
On wings that children made
With all the things you get
When you don't have anything
Please forgive me, 'cause I forgot my lines
Please forgive me, while I still have time
Just to say you love me, yeah, say you love me
I woke up LA
To sound the siren song
Everything is great
And everything is wrong
I flew a thousand miles
On wings that children made
Yeah, it's the thing you get
When you don't want anything---Lyrics submitted by Kendall.
