(Here come the 3-string Trance Wonder!
We gon' do the Dog House!)

(Oh yeah)

All my life I been in the dog house
I guess that just where I belong
That just the way the dice roll
Do my dog house song

We gon' get pers'nal now

Ain't the kinda blues ya have for one day
Ya have it ya whole life long
Ya got ta be a professional
To sing the dog house song

Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Aoooh! Mmh mmhmmh
Sing the dog house song!
Dog house!
The dog house
The dog house!
Ya hear my dog house song

I'm gon' tell mah story:
Now my mom an' dad broke up when I wa 4 years old
When I was seven she went and got herself another man; it was hell, y'all
I left home 'fore I was 14 years of age; I figured I'd do better on my own
But then followed eleven years of bumb'lin' around and livin' kinda hand-in-mouth
Sometimes gettin' locked up an' somet- sometimes just goin' cold and hungry
I didn't have me no real school education, so what in the hell what I was gonna be able to do?
But I always did pick on the guitar; I used to put the hat out for spare change
But now I'm makin' this here record and I'm still tryin' to get your spare change
I don't know why went wrong but it ain't bad now
And I just keep playin' my dog house music
Sing the dog house song...!
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Sing the dog house song...!
Dog house!
The dog house, hah j-
The dog house! hooh, hoo
Sing the dog house song!
Dog house! A'right yeah
Dog house! Oh do it I'm-
Dog house! Do it ow-
Sing the dog house song
Sing the dog house song!
Sing the dog house song! Yeah
Sing the dog house song!
Sing the dog house song!
I'll sing the dog house song! Yeah
Sing the dog house song! Y'all
