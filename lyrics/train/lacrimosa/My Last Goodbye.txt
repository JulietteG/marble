Not here - not now 
Not with me and 
Not with a single tear of mine 
There is no pain 
There won't be no fear 
This is my last goodbye 
Cause I won't die 

Not here - not now 
No regrets - It was just another lesson in my life 
I close the door 
I clean my own place 
This is my last goodbye 
Beforde I die 

And when you fail 
You seem to swollow 
Everything that comes to you 
And if you fall I am the one 
Who takes you by his hand 

Don't take this love 
Please don't stock on this romance 

Fleeing from your love and far away 
You say goodbye 
But I live in the ruins of your love 
I am just a tear upon your face 
You are the sun that sets for me 
I'll be gone 
While I'll be waiting 
This is my last goodbye 

There is that much history 
There is that much to learn 
How can we do all the same mistakes again 
An no-one cares 
Fascinating to grow old 
It's fascinating to be born 
Fascinating to decide 
And sometimes even to be right 

Here I stand alone 
And now I say goodbye 
I leave this place - with a smile 
And with my breathing - 
Sometimes bleeding - 
Not unuseful soul 
I'm leaving this society 
But not my body nor soul 

Right here - right now 
With no regrets 
I say goodbye 
I am a Queen 
And I will rule my life! 
And when you fail 
You seem to swollow 
Everything that comes to you 
And if you fall I am the one 
Who takes you by his hand 

Fleeing from your love and far away 
You say goodbye 
But I live in the ruins of your love 
I am just a tear upon your face 
You are the sun that sets for me 
I'll be gone 
While I'll be waiting 
This is my last goodbye---Lyrics submitted by eireneee.
