I own your lazy ass
Drop your pants and let me peek!
So flash your boarding pass
If you wanna ride the beat!

I got my vibe in hand, don't need a man
Electrified!

It's time to hit the gas,
Spin my wheel and feel the heat!
If you want to have a blast
Close your eyes and think of me!

I got my vibe in hand, don't need a man
I'm satisfied!

Hook: 
You're my boy toy, baby! (boy toy)
Just a boy toy (boy toy)
You can touch me
Hell whenever you want (whenever you want)!
But only in your dreams
You're my boy toy, baby! (boy toy)
Just a boy toy (boy toy)
You can taste me
Hell whenever you want
But only in your dreams!

I'm your dirty little secret
Careful not to shout my name!
Here's my flick and you can click it
When you wanna fan the flame!

I got my vibe in hand, don't need a man
Electrified!

Hook: 
You're my boy toy, baby! (boy toy)
Just a boy toy (boy toy)
You can touch me
Hell whenever you want (whenever you want)!
But only in your dreams
You're my boy toy, baby! (boy toy)
Just a boy toy (boy toy)
You can taste me
Hell whenever you want
But only in your dreams!

You can touch me, 
You can taste me,
You can have me,
I want you too!
Keep dreaming, boy
Keep dreaming!
You can touch me,
You can taste me,
You can have me,
Hell whenever you want
But only in your dreams!

Boy toy baby, it's the boy toy!
Only in your dreams!
You can touch me now, you can touch me now
Only in your dreams!
Boy toy, it's the boy toy!
You can chase me, hell whenever you want,
Only in your dreams!
Hey, yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
