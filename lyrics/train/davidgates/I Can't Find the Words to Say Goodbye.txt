Can't say I don't love her
Still I can't pretend
That my heart is torn just knowing that
I'm losing my best friend

If it's easier said than done
Then someone tell me why
Though I tried
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I could tell her that I'm sorry
And hope she'll understand
She will have to do with someone else
All that we had planned

I'd rather her, hear the truth
Than hurt her with a lie
So I tried
But I can't find the words to say goodbye

Now I know, I have to go
There's no other way
But goodbye is not what I
Can't bring myself to say

If I told her, see you later
Then I might be wrong
'Cause this voice inside is driving me
To find where I belong

And I know I must leave her now
But every time I try
Don't know why
But I can't find the words to say goodbye
Don't know why
I can't find the words to say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by samantha usero.
