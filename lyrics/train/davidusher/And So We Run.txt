give me a sign
give me a reason to hold on
i'm holding on
what is a life
a series of moments all in line,just passing by

(chorus)
and so i lay here awake as all the clouds fall away
then fast asleep in your arms
wake up wondering where we are
try to freeze frame the day
then the light starts to fade
i will scream at the sky till we drink the oceans dry
and so we run and so we run and so we run

over the bridge,.back to the place where we were young
what we could have done
what did we find
there we were naked under god 
lucky god is blind

chorus

give me a sign,give me a reason to hold on
i'm holding on

chorus
and so we run and so we run and so we run---Lyrics submitted by Deb.
