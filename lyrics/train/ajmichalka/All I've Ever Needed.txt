Honestly,
Its time for honesty,
My heart is on my sleeve,
Oh will you hear me out.

Ive got nothing left to give of me,
I gave up everything so there, is nothing left to lose,
For me now.
Would you forgive me somehow?

I chased a million things,
Bright lights and empty dreams,
Now here I am,
Right where I thought I, wanted to be,
Id trade it all right now,
Leave it all and lay it down,
To get back where I belong,
Lord all Ive ever needed was your love.

Truth be told,
Ive made this world my hope,
and let it steal my soul,
but now I want it back.
Cause all I need is waiting,
In your arms,
A place to hang my heart,
Where I am known at last,
Youre the one true thing I have.

I chased a million things,
Bright lights and empty dreams,
Now here I am,
Right where I thought I, wanted to be,
Id trade it all right now,
Leave it all and lay it down,
To get back where I belong,
Lord all Ive ever needed was your love.
And I know that I was meant to be,
More than just a melody,
I know that you had hopes for me,
I hope you still believe in, me.

I chased a million things,
Bright lights and empty dreams,
Now here I am,
Right where I thought I, wanted to be,
Id trade it all right now,
Leave it all and lay it down,
To get back where I belong,
Lord all Ive ever needed was your love.
Lord all Ive ever needed was your love.---
