She's saving all her money trying to get ahead
All the luck in the world wont keep the baby fed
And the boss is on her back and it's getting her down
She's waiting for the one she loves to come around

He's building for the future while everybody sleeps
Filling in the cracks on these lonely streets
She says don't you worry honey it will be okay
One of these days were gonna fly away and he said...

There's only one Saturday night in every week
Sundays for recovering five days for discovering
We're all walking down the same street
You know there's only one Saturday night in every week.

He's a bonefide rebel searching for a cause
But real life got him and now he's getting bored
Cos he barely makes a living picking up stuff
But all he really wants to do is kick up the dust
She spends her days talking on the phone
Trying to sell you something you don't wanna own
She's dreaming of a break from the daily grind
Cos the mans got her working over time and they say...

There's only one Saturday night in every week
Sundays for recovering five days for discovering
We're all walking down the same street
You know there's only one Saturday night in every week.

Why wont the world stop spinning around
Why can't I find my feet when I'm falling down?

There's only one Saturday night in every week
Sundays for recovering five days for discovering
Were all walking down the same street
You know there's only one Saturday night in every week.
You know there's only one Saturday night in every week.
You know there's only one Saturday night in every week.---Lyrics submitted by bisola.
