All you got to do is just walk away
And pass me by
Dont acknowledge my smile 
When I try to say hello to you yeah
And all you got to do is not answer my calls
When Im tryin to get through
To keep me wondering why
And all I can do is sigh
I just want to touch
Chorus
I just want to touch and kiss
Said I wish that I can be with you tonight
Cause you give me butterflies
Inside inside and I 
All I got to say is that I must be dreamin
Cant be real
Youre not hear with me
I can feel you near to me so
I caress you let you taste us
Its just so blissful listen
I would give anything baby
 Make my dream come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
Chorus(x2)
I just want to touch and kiss
Said I wish that I can be with you tonight
Cause you give me butterflies
Inside inside and I 
If you will take my hand 
Baby I would show you
Guide you to the light and
If you would be my love 
Baby I will love you love you til the end of time 
Chorus(x3)
I just want to touch and kiss
Said I wish that I can be with you tonight
Cause you give me butterflies
Inside inside and I---Lyrics submitted by Tianna.
