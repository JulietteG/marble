never a story told
the saddest thing i ever saw
witnessed a murder 
but to scared to make the last call
look deep in her eyes
and i saw the beauty
(waiting)
they came from the sky 
heard their music playing for us

we were lovers burned alive
and i am reborn
i will naver forgive that night

knocked on the door two times
i think i remember this voice
that wants me to forget i was there
she opens the door and says
"ill help you"
(no regrets)
i dropped to my knees and i screamed 
"Thank you!"
cause its hard to believe

we were lovers burned alive
and i am reborn
i will never forgive that night
we were lovers burned alive
and we are reborn
i will never forgive that night

this is our lead 
this is our sin

can you remember?
can you remember?
can you remember?
can you remember that night?

we were lovers burned alive
and i am reborn 
i will never forgive that night (that night we died)
we were lovers burned alive
and we are reborn 
i will never forgive that night---Lyrics submitted by Kla.
