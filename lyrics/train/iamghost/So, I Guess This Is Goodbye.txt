So I drew a goodnight kiss, 
I said it was all for you
Held your face in time
But the miracles came crashing down

But it was too late; the killers came
With knives and dressed all in blue
As they suck me in
I take your hand, well, isn't this romantic?

He's learned a lot from watching you and I (lovely)
Just wish these dreams would follow through

Don't ever be afraid, 'cause I'm never letting go
Of your face since I knew there would be... 
Blood spilling from your cut, 
The ropes enwrapped you in love
Memories feed this disease
And I hate it

But it was too late, the killers home
And knows you well I assume
As my luck grows thin I take your hand
Well, isn't this romantic?

He's learned a lot from watching you and I (lovely)
Just wish I already knew

Don't ever be afraid, 'cause I'm never letting go
Of your face since I knew there would be blood.
Take these words I say, "Will you marry me?" to your grave
I knew you were the one.
This blood is love

You, me, I do, let's float away and die
You, me, I do, let's float away and die

He's learned a lot from watching you and I (lovely)
Tell the preacher to give our last goodbye

Don't ever be afraid, 'cause I'm never letting go
Of your face since I knew there would be blood.
Take these words I say, "Will you marry me?" to your grave
I knew you were the one, 
The one, the one! 
I knew there would be blood---Lyrics submitted by Kla.
