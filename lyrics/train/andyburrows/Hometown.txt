He got his walls and his ways
Waves are gone, he has his days
Has a lot on his mind too bad
Hes only happy if hes sad

Has his cannons which he fires
The only boy I know who can not cry

I can see the ground I cant see you
And see our hometown I cant see you
Leave the lights on when I go
So I can watch you down below

Has his loss, been his loss
There were bridges he had to cross
We have bridges that we burn
And have so much we had to learn

He has his canonns which he fires
The only boy I know who can not cry

I can see the ground I cant see you
And see our hometown I cant see you
Leave the lights on when I go
So I can watch you down below

The only boy I know who can not cry

I can see the ground I cant see you
And see our hometown I cant see you
Leave the lights on when I go
So I can watch you down below

I can see the ground I cant see you
And see our hometown I cant see you
Leave the lights on when I go
So I can watch you down below---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
