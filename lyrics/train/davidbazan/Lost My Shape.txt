You used to feel like a smoker shivering in the cold
Waiting outside the bar 'til the opener's over
But now you feel like a drinker 20 days off the sauce
Down at the liquor store trying to call your sponsor

You used to feel like the forest fire burning,
But now you feel like a child throwing tantrums for your turn

You used to sound like a prophet
Everyone wanted to know
How you could tell the truth without losing that soft glow

But now you feel like a salesman closing another deal
Or some drunk ship captain raging after the white whale
You used to feel like a forest fire burning
But now you feel like a child throwing tantrums
And then some

You used to feel like the prodigal returning
But now,
Now you hate what you've made
And you want to watch it burn---Lyrics submitted by Heru Setiawan.
