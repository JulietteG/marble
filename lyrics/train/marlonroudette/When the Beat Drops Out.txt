When the beat drops out
and the people gone
we still be there, still be there
for me child.

When the lights go out
and the morning comes
we still be there, still be there
for me child

When the beat drops out...

Life, happens you're making plans
flying highing shaking hands
a song will write you, you don't write it
I, didn't mean to fall in love
was rhythm that created if
I was running, we collide it

Baseline, I will always make times,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart...

When the beat drops out
and the people gone
we still be there, still be there
for me child.

When the lights go out
and the morning come
we still be there, still be there
for me child

When the beat drops out
and the people gone
we still be there, still be there
for me child.

When the lights go out
and the morning come
we still be there, still be there
for me child

When the beat drops out...

With you, I found a new way to live
I see an alternative
Now we started, we can stop it
I, I didn't mean to fall in love
last thing I was thinking of
was you and me but, we collide it

Baseline, I will always make times,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times,
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart...

When the beat drops out
and the people gone
we still be there, still be there
for me child.

When the lights go out
and the morning come
we still be there, still be there
for me child

When the beat drops out
and the people gone
we still be there, still be there
for me child. (we still be there for me)

When the lights go out (when the lights go out)
and the morning come (morning come)
we still be there, still be there
for me child (we still be there for me)

When the beat drops out...
