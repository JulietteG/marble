I'm strung tight fast as light
Power packed like dynamite
Razors edge cut you up
Chainsaw can't get enough

I'm so happy drivin through
With my fist when I knock you

I'm a wrecking machine ah a wreckin machine
(Chorus x2)

Good looking as you can see
Don;t want nobody rearranging me
Satisfaction in givin pain
Makes it easy when I go insane

Chorus.

He's a wrecking machine forty pounds of pressure
He's a wrecking machine will break your knee
He's a wrecking machine I tell you sonny
He's a wrecking machine don't mess with me
