I've had a visit this week from Mr. Murphy
Says his laws are gonna mess me around
But I don't worry
Takes more than Murphy to bring me down

His first strike he grabs my lady
She leaves me for another man yea
You might think I'd go crazy
But there one thing I understand you've got to keep on pushing

Whoa oh keep on pushin
Whoa oh never gonna stop
Whoa oh keep on pushin
Whoa oh

This man Murphy has just begun to fight
He turns some tables and I lose my job
So I go out & drink that night
When I get home my house had been robbed

Three strikes you're out

Not me I got to tell you
I'm a fighter ain't never going down
Hey Murphy I won't give in easily
If you keep messin around I'll just keep on pushin
