Let me get to the point real quick 
When ya pockets are thick 
mad chicks be on a brothers tip 
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car 
all the ho's go sweat you like a movie star 
to get in ya pockets 
thats what the girls wanna do 
but if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you 
no matter how strong your rap 
you only nock boots when you got loot 
you on the map 
cause if you broke youll get a wack slut 
if you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt 
with fresh gear,long hair and a cute face 
and if ya live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in 
then ya start loosin all ya bucks 
soon you broke as a joke and out of luck 
then she takes off and brakes off 
ya ho's gone, so long dear 
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn 
Cause when you on top everythings OK 
but when you broke you get no play 

Chorus: 

If you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz 
And if you dont got money you wont skoop a honey 
If you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass 
And if you dont got loot you wont be knockin no boots 

Verse Two: 

Girls of the 90's aint nuthin but crooks 
Its all about whats in ya pockets not how ya look 
that's why you cant talk to just any whore 
leavin brothers for the next man cause he's got a penny more 
they want a drug dealer not a scholar 
some girls barely speak but allways askin for a dollar 
and if you pushin a fresh Benz theyll be ya best friends 
yeah, as long as you collect endz 
you think shes all yours 
but as soon as your dough go your ho go 
now you solo 
but when you was makin papers sucker jumped ho's 
you bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's 
and you was takin em to the movies every weekend 
now that you dead broke the girls not speakin 
cause nowadays girls want you to crook 
the only thing they can get from Big L is a big.... 
Cause when you on top everythings OK 
But when you broke you gets no play 

Chorus 2X 

Verse Three: 

I tell it how it is cause im a goldfigga 
and I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger 
it aint even funny 
some girls dont even know me askin me can they get some money 
I'm lookin nuthin like ya poppa 
I wouldnt give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper 
they wanna know why im so fly 
a girl ask me for a ring and i put one around her whole eye 
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss 
Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this 

Chorus 2X 

Outro: 

It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all 
I hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack y'all 
It's Big L y'all, I'm livin swell yall 
I do my famous, spell my name, ring bells y'all 
(If you dont got endz) 
Girls be frontin 
(If you dont got endz) 
They aint givin up nuthin 
(If you dont got endz) 
all the girls they ignore you 
(If you dont got endz) 
they act like they never saw you 
(If you dont got endz).........---Lyrics submitted by Donte.
