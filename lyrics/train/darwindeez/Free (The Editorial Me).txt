Life is a greenhouse gas
Half the police in masks
Pretending to be my friend
But nothing can box me in,
cause Im free yeah

Ill be the first to dance
With every new circumstance
I smile at the scene I see
Cause I decide what it means to me,
cause I can because Im free yeah

Enclosed for your review is a picture of you
Before you knew
And circled in red are the things you said
When you lost your head
And got in bed
Cause god is dead

But to whom it may concern
Its no longer that persons turn, its mine and Im free

Dear sir(s),
We regret to inform you
The norm you conform to
Does not meet our needs at this time
But of course you may try to reapply for membership
And resubmit your manuscript
When the man youve scripteds hands are lifted to the sky
And the old you dies

Sincerely,

The editorial me ---Lyrics submitted by Gi Rodriguez.
