This is a black market reformation, keep your lips closed
and don't you ever give away our underground location
This is a black tie affair, don't ever close your mouth
and we'll stay here until someone falls in their own snare
I had this planned all along, and I brought you here for this
so tie your mask on and pretend that nothing's wrong

And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can
And I'll try to stay here, here with you

This is a black market reformation, how does it feel to be under the gun
Last ones to laugh pull the trigger here on the run
You can hide the money, I'll mark an X
I am above the law and you're the order, you make everything make sense

And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can
And I'll try to stay here, here with you

And I know Mexico is south of here, beautiful this time of year
So let's jump the border when the coast is clear
Salvation waits at ocean shore, we won't have to lie no more
Don't you worry baby I'll be right here

And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can
And I'll try to stay here, here with you
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
