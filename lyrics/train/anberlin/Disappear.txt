We're the last of the sleepless ones
left behind by those we left behind tonight
quiet now, let the poison take
were we always just your lost cause mistakes?

wait for me, will you wait for me?
i need you on my side
wait for me, make way for me
with arms wide

(chorus)
are you left alone?
watch us slowly disappear, in time
are you still alone?
forgotten, lost, and left behind

dark lit streets are no place for kids
but it gives us more of a home than you ever did
we're the scientists left to our own demise
you're still our last chance to get out of this place alive

wait for me, will you wait for me?
with arms wide

(chorus)

are you left alone?
watch us slowly disappear in time

(x2)
are you left alone?
watch us slowly disappear, in time
are you still alone?
forgotten, lost, and left behind---Lyrics submitted by Patrick.
