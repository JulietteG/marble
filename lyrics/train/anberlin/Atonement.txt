Ive seen faces I may never see again
Ive been places I never could have dreamt
Ive touched hands with those whove touched me
Seen the marks, the skeleton keys

I found peace in a foreign atonement
I lost myself in a tides of a moment
But nothing compares

Dont want to be here
Dont want to be here without you
I need to know you
I need to know you believe in me

Whats it worth if what its worth alone?
(Somebody tell me now)
And whats the point if all the points we know?
(Somebody show me how)

Ive loved where Ive been
Yes I love where Ive been
But my hearts where Im going

Dont want to be here
Dont want to be here without you
(I dont want to go alone)
I need to know you
I need to know you believe in me
(I dont want to go alone)

I lost myself in a tides of a moment
But my hearts where Im going

Dont want to be here
Dont want to be here without you
(I dont want to go alone)
I need to know you
I need to know you believe in me
(I dont want to go alone)

Cause I dont want to go alone
I dont want to do this all on my own
(I dont want to go alone)
(I dont want to go alone)
We can ride into the sun
Together we can take it, were right with you inside.---
