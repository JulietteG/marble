Write down, to remind yourself 
on how it can be, how it can be
Heartstrings, you're tugging at 
my heartstrings, my heartstrings
Helpless, I have become so helpless 
to your touch, oh touch me somehow
Restless, you leave me restless
breathless wait for me

The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God
You're a miracle to me
The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God
You're a miracle to me

Burning, like Joan of Arc 
to see you, just to feel you
Cadence, well I'd dance with the dead 
'cause I believe, yes I believe, yes I believe
Stifle, Paul said that you 
stifle him again and again and again

The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God
You're a miracle to me
The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God
You're a miracle to me

And if these are my parting words
Grant me this, my last request
Hold me here, until I sleep
If I burn, then I burn for you

The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God

The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God

The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God
You're a miracle to me
The closer I come to you
the closer I am to finding God
You're a miracle to me---Lyrics submitted by Skyler Harlow.
