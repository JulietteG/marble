You belong here.
You were meant for me.
You belong here.
You were meant to be with me.

You've got the better part of me.
Always have and always will
You've got the better part of me, oh.
And you know that I'm right.
And I know I'm asking too much.
And I know I'm taking control.
But, a heart that's not worth breaking isn't worth much, not at all.
Isn't worth much at all.

You belong here.
You were meant for me.
You belong here.
You belong here with me.
You were meant to be with me.

You are the better part you'll see.
Always have and always will.
You'll be the better part of me, oh, for the rest of my life.
And I know I'm asking too much.
And I know I'm all control.
But, I'll give you all I have.
It isn't much, much at all.
I'm not much at all.

You belong here.
You were meant for me.
You belong here.
You belong here with me.
You belong here (You belong here with me)
You were meant to be with me.

But, I'll give you all I have.
It isn't much, not much at all.
But, a heart that's not worth breaking isn't worth much, not at all.

You belong here.
You were meant for me.
You belong here.
You belong here with me.
You belong here (You belong here with me)
You were meant to be with me.
(You belong here with me.)---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
