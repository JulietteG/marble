Let's you and me make our way just beyond Haight street
Let's leave this life behind forgetting all they say
The time we have is time well borrowed
Stay out all night forget tomorrow

Let's you and me make a night of it
Old enough to know but to young to care
Let's you and me make a night of it
Old enough to know but to young to care

The rear view mirror shows the towns we're abandoning
Let's leave this life behind forgetting all they say
The time we have is time well borrowed
Stay out all night forget tomorrow

Let's you and me make a night of it
Old enough to know but to young to care
Let's you and me make a night of it
Old enough to know but o young to care

Who cares if there is trouble tonight
Who cares cause the kids are alright
Tonight we will take this town
Cause we're old enough to know 
But to young to care

Let's you and me make a night of it
Old enough to know but to young to care
Let's you and me make a night of it
Old enough to know but o young to care

Who cares if there is trouble tonight
Who cares cause the kids are alright
Tonight we will take this town 
Cause we're old enough to know
But to young to care---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
