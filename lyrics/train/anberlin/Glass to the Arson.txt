Tonight my heart is cold
lost in your lies, shallow replies

And gravity prevails this time it's over
And you think you're the one

Calm me with your lies your simple tragedy
It's all I wish to hear tonight
and you're all I wish to be
And this is how we all fall

Tonight my heart is cold
Lost in your lies, shallow replies
Tonight I'll just let go
Lost in your eyes, transparent cries

And innocence derailed
Savage the poison
Unhurried compass east

Calm me with your lies your simple tragedy
It's all I wish to hear tonight
and you're all I wish to be
And this is how we all fall

Tonight my heart is cold
Lost in your lies, shallow replies
Tonight I'll just let go
Lost in your eyes, transparent cries

And we are, we are, we are the arsons
who start all of your fires

And we are the arsons
who start all of your fires, burning
Burning your city down

Tonight my heart is cold
Lost in your lies, shallow replies
Tonight I'll just let go
Lost in your eyes, transparent cries
