Some people has this
Finally moved on
But I guess I was wrong
Do we not learn from mistakes?
Do we not have what it takes?
Are you the cure or disease?
Do you still take as you please
Are you the cure? Or are you the disease?

Chorus:
Someone, someone tell me what theyre fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive
Someone, someone, someone tell me why we need it?
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive

So well be fine, yesterdays gone
Enough hope that Im wrong
If we dont learn from their past
Well repeat them, history on at last

Are you with us or without?
Seen this ever fading out
Are with us, well are you with us?

Chorus:
Someone, someone tell me what theyre fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive
Someone, someone, someone tell me why we need it?
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive

Are you the cure or disease?
Do you still take as you lease
Are you the cure? Or are you the disease?

Chorus:
Someone, someone tell me what theyre fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive, truly alive

Someone, someone tell me what theyre fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive
Someone, someone, someone tell me why we need it?
I dont see a reason, tell me why we need a reason---
