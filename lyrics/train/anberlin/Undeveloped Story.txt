Taking on what others have hassled,
looking back to darker days getting me down
and if this is chaos, I think that I'm in love with glamour 
tides are turning, never understood my undeveloped story 
but it makes sense to me, you make sense to me

When it all falls down, I'll still be right here 
when it all falls down, we'll still be right here

Once in a lifetime, I could feel this way
Once in a lifetime, you could feel it too

Cancel your black subscription, I'm nowhere near a cigarette
and I'm cut clear as you wander, past this lonely street and wonder
dance all night, dance all night, the kids aren't here and we're downtown
past the morning glory, it's ten past two and I'm still workin' on forty

Once in a lifetime, I could feel this way
Once in a lifetime, you could feel it...

Dance all night, dance all night
(Repeat x2)

When it all falls down, I'll still be right here
(Repeat)

Once in a lifetime, I could feel this way
Once in a lifetime, you could feel it too

Once in a lifetime, I could feel this way
Once in a lifetime, you could feel it...

Dance all night, dance all night
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
