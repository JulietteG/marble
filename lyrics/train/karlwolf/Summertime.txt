We about to get stupid
So wake up,wake up,wake up
And fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime

Summertime,summertime
Searchin' for the love,can't you feel the thing?
I'm tired,you're fighting all the time
One night my heart went so in love
You see ,we live in a crazy world
And all this attention I gave you,girl
Then I gave up

...I'm coming,I'm coming,I'm coming away
We about to start up
So follow me all night
We about to get stupid
So wake up,wake up,wake up
And fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime

I'm tired,you're fighting all the time
One night my heart went so in love
You see ,we live in a crazy world
And all this attention I gave you,girl
Then I gave up

Where' s the light at the end of the tunnel?
...when I tell you I'm coming,I'm coming,I'm coming away

We about to start up
So follow me all night
We about to get stupid
So wake up,wake up,wake up
And fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
It feels like you're loving
Put up this fire
And the weather is so lovely
It feels like you're loving
Put up this fire
Just you and I
As soon as the clouds start to get out of the way

When I tell you I'm coming,I'm coming,I'm coming away

We about to start up
So follow me all night
We about to get stupid
So wake up,wake up,wake up
And fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime
Summertime,fall in love in the summertime---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
