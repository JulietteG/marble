It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[CULTURE] 
run di track 
ah dem wan fi try and hold mi back 
mi say wolf and culture gwan to di top 
ride di track 
the riddim is sweet and di dancehall hot 
crowd of people never wan we fi stop 
run di track 
ah we run di show 
mi say we run di shop 
we ah di don numba one and mi say we run dat 
we ah the king inna di place 
mi say ride pon di shock 
put your hand inna di air we ah gon burn down di spot 

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had 

And as Im walking through the subway 
All I feel is everybodys piercing eyes (piercing eyes) 
Im following the footsteps all I can imagine is that Im a guy 
You never know maybe shes afraid 
And everything around her is so damn fake 
I feel like that we've met before 
Hurry boy she's waiting 

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had 

The sun is rising on east side and every former life is waking up 
The feeling of seclusion makes you wanna dream away and fall in love 
She drags you in, not afraid 
Everything feels like fate 
What wrong with you, dont let her go 
Hurry boy it's waiting 

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
We're take some time to do the things we never had 

[Scatting] 
[Instrumental Break] 

Hurry boy it's waiting there for you 

(Down in A....) 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
(Ohh... ) 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
(No... oh...) 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
(Rains down in Africa...) 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
(Oh bless the rains...) 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
(Down in A...frica) 
I bless the rains down in Africa 
(Down in A...frica) 
We're take some time to do the things we never had
