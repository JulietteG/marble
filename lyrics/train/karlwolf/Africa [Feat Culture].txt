[Chorus]

Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Theres nothing that 100 men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have.(ouuouu)

(Reggae break)

[Chorus]

Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Theres nothing that 100 men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have.

And as I am walking through the subway 
And all I noticed is everyones perking eye
I follow in the foot steps
Imagine this in Africa(Africa)
You never know, maybe shes afraid(shes afraid)
And everything around her is so damn faint
I feel like weve meet before(meet before)
Hurry boy, shes waiting 

[Chorus]

Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Theres nothing that 100 men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have.(ouuouu) 

The sun is rising on the east side
And every woman is waking up(waking up)
I feel the mexication 
It makes you wanna dream, and fall in love (in love)
She drags you in, not afraid, everything is like clay
Whats wrong with you? 
Dont let her go
Hurry Boy its waiting.

[Chorus]

Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Theres nothing that 100 men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have.(ouuouu) 

Hurry boy.. Its waiting there for you

Down in Aaaff-

Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Theres nothing that 100 men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa(x4)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have.(ouuouu) 

Ahhhhh aaahhh aaahhhhhhh aaaaahhh ( reggae break)

This is Africa(x2)
