call on my phone
baby call on my phone
baby call on my phone
So I can hear that ringtone
(2x)

Lost without my lover
How can I live without you?
I dont wanna other
that`s what I`m stuck about you
cant even dream without seeing you
Why should I even try to breath?

And everything is all `where are you?`
guess its all my fault
ladies sing the blues
no one could deny it
We would fly it like United
Thought we`d never be divided coz
the love we had inside of us
was

inseparable
if you bump up this song
and you`re searcing for a moment where your heart`s went wrong
inseparable
just what you love
could have sworn you`d never ever given up
coz you`d think it was
inseparable
we`d always stay together
always and forever
But now I say that no one is
Inseparable
one of uf just gotta pick the phone up
as we`d always do
inseparable

bump bump (2x)

gotta photos of us on my refridgerator
videos on my phone
Why just cant I erase them?
It was ? I`ve doubted of you
inbox and ?
time after time
boy I`m lost cant you look
wont you please find me
I`m down to my last chance
wont you rescue me
see its broken my heart
to point it out ?
the reason out
things just aint the same without you

Boy I know we were inseparable
if you bump up this song
and you`re searcing for a moment where your heart`s went wrong
inseparable
just what you love
could have sworn you`d never ever given up
coz you`d think it was
inseparable
we`d always stay together
always and forever
But now I say that no one is
Inseparable
one of uf just gotta pick the phone up

its been sixteen days since I had you tight
follow up me in the pillow in the middle of the night
boy I just wanna you to show up and tell me everything`s allright
so what you`re waiting for?
coz none of us? 

inseparable
if you bump up this song
and you`re searcing for a moment where your heart`s went wrong
inseparable
just what you love
could have sworn you`d never ever given up
coz you`d think it was
inseparable
we`d always stay together
always and forever
But now I say that no one is
Inseparable
one of uf just gotta pick the phone up

I know I know I know
We WERE
I know I know I know
We WERE
I
Always stay together
Always and forever
Coz
One of us just gotta get the phone up

Baby pick the phone up
pick the phone up---Lyrics submitted by JoOsTiiN.
