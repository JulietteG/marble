Those days of love are gone
Our time is through
Still I burn on and on
All of my life only for you

From now until forever
And ever, my darling, forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one

As long as I shall live
I'll hold you dear
And I will reminisce
Of our love all through the years

From now until forever
And ever, my darling, forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one

If you should ever need me
Unfailingly, I will return
To your arms
And unburden your heart

And if you should remember
That we belong together
Never be ashamed, call my name
Tell me I'm the one you treasure

Forever and ever
I know that forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
Oh baby, you will always be the only one

Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one---
