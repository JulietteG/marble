It's 7am, thinking about you
Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling, you're feeling too
Like a new born child, soft to the touch
Baby is it possible to love someone so much

I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

Chorus

If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't say what you said
If you knew what I knew, we'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart, over things that aren't true
My lady yes, if you knew what I knew

Time passes by, the only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion and fears I have inside
Like a lost soul, I feel like I'm all alone
If only I could feel your pain, within your heart of stone

I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

Chorus

Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
Then you would be here to stay right by my side always

Chorus

If you knew what I knew my baby, you would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead---Lyrics submitted by alex.
