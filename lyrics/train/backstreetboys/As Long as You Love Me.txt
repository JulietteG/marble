Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine,
I'm leaving my life in your hands.
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind,
Risking it all in a glance.
And how you got me blind is still a mystery, 
I can't get you out of my head.
Don't care what is written in your history, 
As long as you are here with me...

I don't care, who you are
where you're from, what you did,
As long as you love me.
Who you are, where you're from,
Don't care what you did,
As long as you love me.

Every little thing that you have said and done,
Feels like its deep within me.
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run,
It seems like we're meant to be...

I don't care, who you are (who you are)
where you're from, (where you're from) 
what you did,
As long as you love me. ( I don't know)
Who you are (who you are), 
where you're from (where you're from),
Don't care what you did,
As long as you love me. (yeah)
As long as you love me.

I've tried to hide it so no one knows,
But I guess it shows,
When you look into my eyes.
What you did and where you're coming from,
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care, who you are (who you are)
where you're from, (where you're from) what you did,
As long as you love me. (As long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are), where you're from (where you're from),
Don't care what you did (yeah),
As long as you love me. (As long as you love me)

Who you are, where you're from 
What you did, 
As long as you love me.
Who you are, where you're from 
As long as you love me
who you are
As long as you love me
what you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me.---Lyrics submitted by Jonah Kirumira.
