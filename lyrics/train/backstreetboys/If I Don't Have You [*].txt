Everyday, girl, I wake up and pray
That you'll come back home
And don't take too long
Cuz since you've been gone
Everything's gone a bit wrong
I wish you were here
Holding me near

You know I'd go out of my mind
If you ever left my heart behind
So I'm beggin' you please (so I'm beggin', beggin' you please)
Bring you sweet love back to me (Please come back to me)

[Chorus:]
If I don't have you (don't have you)
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby it's true (baby it's true if I don't have you)
If you say goodbye (you say goodbye)
Girl I would die (girl I would die)
I'm a star with no light
A day with no night
If I don't have you

Late at night I reach to hold you tight
But you're not there (you're just not there baby)
I know you still care (I know you still care)
And oh how I miss your soft, lovely kiss
You'd give to me (to me)
So tenderly

We used to feel
That time would stand still
When I see you baby it will
So hurry home (so hurry, come home to me)
You know your man needs you so (oh girl you just don't know)

[Chorus]

If I don't have you (don't have you)
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I can't go on In this world alone
Baby it's true (baby it's true if I don't have you)
If you say goodbye (you say goodbye)
Girl I would die (girl I would die)
I'm a star with no ligh
tA day with no night
If I don't have you

If I don't have you I don't know what I'd do
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I just wanna hold you
I can't go on (can't go on)
In this world alone 
Baby it's true (baby it's true if i don't have you)
If you say goodbye (you say goodbye)
If you say goodbye I would die
Oh I would die (girl I would die)
I'm star with no light
A day with no night
If I don't have you

You know I'd go crazy without you 
If I don't have you 
To hold on to (to hold on to)
I just wanna hold you
I can't go on (can't go on)
In this world alone (in this world alone)
Baby it's true (baby it's true if i don't have you)
If you say goodbye (you say goodbye)
If you say goodbye I would die
Oh I would die (girl I would die)
I'm star with no light
A day with no night
If I don't have you---Lyrics submitted by emmy.
