Oh, oh, oh
Oh, no, no, baby
Oh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Yeah

How can I begin to 
Tell you what ya do to 
Me every time I hear ya 
More willing to wanna see ya 

I know that there's no use in 
Tryin' to explain my confusion 
But still I'm not complainin'
'Bout my situation 

Let's not talk about a possible ending

The very first time that I
Was lookin' to be your fella
I found my inspiration
Hidin' in your expression 
So I put myself forward
For your consideration 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Let's not talk about a possible ending 
Let's not think about it every day
And I know 
I'm so
In love
With you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe
Every time I'm near
My beautiful woman

Yeah

And so I put the top down 
To take you drivin' downtown 
I guess we'll know just what to do 
When you're lookin' to fool around

It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down
Get down, ohh, no, no, no (oh)

Let's not talk about a possible ending (baby)
Let's not think about it every day (oh)
And I know (I know)
I'm so (I'm so)
In love (in love)
With you (with you, baby)
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe
Every time I'm near
My beautiful woman (my beautiful woman)

My beautiful woman (yes you are, yes you are, yes you are)
My beautiful woman (anything that you want me to do, I'll do) (now)
My beautiful woman (my beautiful)

B is for beautiful as the sunshine (sunshine)
E tells me everything is feelin' alright (don't you know I feel alright)
A goes to
U and me swingin' in time (swingin' it)
T is two
I want you
You've got me actin' like a FOOL

Let's not talk about a possible ending (oh, yeah, yeah)
Let's not think about it every day (everyday)
And I know (I know)
I'm so
In love
With you (baby)
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe
Every time I'm near
My beautiful woman

Let's not talk about a possible ending (possible ending)
Let's not think about it every day (oh girl, no, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know (I'm so in love)
I'm so
In love
With you (you)
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe (ohhh)
Every time I'm near
My beautiful woman (my beautiful woman)
My beautiful woman (yes you are, yes you are, girl you are)
My beautiful woman (you're so beautiful)
My beautiful woman (my beautiful woman)---Lyrics submitted by emmy.
