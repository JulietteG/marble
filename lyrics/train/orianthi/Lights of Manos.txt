According to you, Im stupid, Im useless, I cant do anything right
According to you, Im difficult, hard to please, forever changing my mind
Im a mess, in a dress, cant show up on time, even if it would save my life
According to you, according to you

Chorus
But according to him, Im beautiful, incredible, he cant get me outta his head
According to him, Im funny, irresistible, everything he ever wanted
Everything is opposite, I dont feel like stopping it, so baby tell me what I got to loose
Hes into me for everything Im not, according to you

According to you, Im boring, Im moody, and you cant take me any place
According to you, I suck at telling jokes, cause I always give it away
Im a girl with the worst attention span, youre the boy who puts up with that
According to you, according to you

Chorus

Need to feel appreciated, that Im not hated, oooh no
Why cant you see me through his eyes, its too bad your making me decide
But according to me, youre stupid, youre useless, you cant do anything right

But according to him, Im beautiful, incredible, he cant get me outta his head
According to him, Im funny, irresistible, everything he ever wanted
Everything is opposite, I dont feel like stopping it
Babe Ill tell you what youve got to loose
Hes into me for everything Im not, according to you
You, you, according to you, you, you
According to you, Im stupid, Im useless, I cant do anything right---Lyrics submitted by Shannon.
