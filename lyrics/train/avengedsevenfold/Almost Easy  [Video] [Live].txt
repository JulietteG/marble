OOOOHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!               
(verse)  I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
 cus I'm afraid and stuck in my ways and thats the way it stayayayayays!         
                 so how long did I expect love to outwiegh ignorance?
          by that look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip

   ( pre chorse)     I'm not insane I'm not insane

                            I'm not insane I'm not
                               Not insane
(chourse)        
                     (Mother)  come back to me its almost easy
                 (said it all)    come back again its almost easy

         (verse)   shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
    It's hard to face,but the fact remains that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with scuicidal memories, selfish beneath the skin but deep inside im not insane


     (go back to prechourse)


   (chourse)        
                    (mother)   come back to me its almost easy

        (said it all) come back again its almost easy
            (you'll learn your lesson)   come back to me its almost easy
(but first you'll fall)    come back again its almost easy!


     now that i've lost you it kills me to say (hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you slipped away
  Im losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong now let me make it right(make it alright)

   (prechourse with evil laugh)

      (mother)   come back to me its almost easy
  (said it all)  come back again its almost easy
  ( you'll learn your lesson )   come back to me its almost easy
   ( but still you'll fall)   come back again its almost easy 
                                        The end---Lyrics submitted by nolan.
