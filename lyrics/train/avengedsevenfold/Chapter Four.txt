Give me your hand, (Conceived and born was one of light)
blood is spilt and man will follow
infernal man, (Rain and dark, the other born black night)
punishment too great to bear

Raise your head and taste the courage
(the one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night

I've come here to kill you,
won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance,
I closed my brothers eyes tonight...

[Repeat from the beginning]

It's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
and from my hands to my brothers grave
You took his side, you took his gift,
feel the power of a fallen man,
crestfallen man...

Far away in this land I must go,
out of the sight of the One.
A punishment sent from His hand
a hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One,
away in this land you must go.

Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth.
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit.

Far away in this land I must go,
out of the sight of the One.
A punishment sent from His hand
a hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One,
away in this land you must go.
