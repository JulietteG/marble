The lives of some men
If walls could talk to spills the lies 
We'll see the world through devil's eyes

I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it to high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
And a one way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons 
After all 
everybody's doing their time

Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter 
Gotta fix won't don't belong

I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all 
everybody's doing their time!

That's just the price to play
So tell me what you like
Got a hand on the kerosene match tonight, right...

Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval 
and a dollar got a pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all 
Everybody's doing their time

Time!---Lyrics submitted by Nicholas Barnes.
