A living nightmare, aleep but still aware
the endless torture,the painless pleasure
i grasp myself
tring to regain control 
i expierience and i learn
another fraction of my mind
so confused 
but everything makes perfect sense 
cant feel the pain emotional pains so much deadlier
lost 
uve just been raped, pain
your freinds cant help
why wont they help you?
another reality 
this cant be happening
why is this happening ?
who the fuck are you?
who the fuck, are you?
trying hard to figure out whats done
i scramble but now i run 
the images in my head 
all the problems that ive been fed
punching slowly my mind cant change the speed
as my victims bleed
no matter what i do or how hard i try
i cant use my abilities 
use my abilities
art of illusion
my razor knifes sharp edge 
peirces my victims body but i cant take their soul
punching through jello, stabbing not killing
disapointment, discomfort 
my razor knifes sharp edge 
peirces my victims body but i cant take their soul 
punching through jello, stabbing not killing
disapointment, discomfort---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
