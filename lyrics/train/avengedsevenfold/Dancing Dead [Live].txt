Dead men, 
They celebrate 
As the final chapter 
Fades away 
Cuz they can't hide; 
We can see their flesh is rotten! 

The band plays a hopeful tune 
The champagne is poured 
As they socialize 
The look in their eyes 
Hide in the light! 

Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
Dead dancin in their graves 
The drinks here are free 
So relax 
Enjoy the sight of all the 
Dead dancin in their graves 
And while the world that they built 
Told 'em to change 
Told 'em to listen 
They just kept it the same 
And now that midnight has come 
I'll get a room watchin the 
Dead dancin in their graves 

Bones covered up by suit 
As the visible scars, 
They multiply 
Kiss it good-bye 
Too stubborn and I'll destroy! 

Tick, tock 
The time bomb has been 
Recognized and pressurized 
Nowhere to hide 
Swallowing light! 

Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
Dead dancin in their graves 
The drinks here are free 
So relax 
Enjoy the sight of all the 
Dead dancin in their graves 
And while the world that they built 
Told 'em to change 
Told 'em to listen 
They just kept it the same 
And now that midnight has come 
I'll get a room watchin the 
Dead dancin in their graves 

Feel a coming strength 
And now it's too late 
To change.

Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
Dead dancin in their graves 
The drinks here are free 
So relax 
Enjoy the sight of all the 
Dead dancin in their graves 
And while the world that they built 
Told 'em to change 
Told 'em to listen 
They just kept it the same 
And now that midnight has come 
I'll get a room watchin the 
Dead dancin in their graves---Lyrics submitted by Chrstoffer.
