like walking into a dream 
so unlike what you've seen
so unsure but it seems
cause we've been waiting for you
fallen into this place ,just giving 
you a small taste of your afterlife
here so stay, you'll be back here soon
any way
i see a distant light, but girl this can't 
be right
such a surereal place to see so how did 
this come to be arrived too early
and when i think of all the places i don't just 
belong i've come to grips with life and realised 
this is going to far

i dont belong here we gotta move on dear escape
from this afterlife 'cause this time i'm right to
move on and on far away from here

a place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
can leave this place but refrain 'cause we've been waiting 
for you fallen into this place ,just giving 
you a small taste of your afterlife
here so stay, you'll be back here soon
any way this place on earth's not right (with my back
against the wall) no pain or sign of time (i'm much to 
young to fall) so out of place don't wanna stay, i feel
so wrong and that's my sign i've made up my mind
gave me your hand but realise i just wanna say good
bye please understand i have to leave and carry on 
my own life

i dont belong here we gotta move on dear escape
from this afterlife 'cause this time i'm right to
move on and on far away from here got nothing against you
and surely i'll miss you this place is full of peace
and light, and i'd hop you might take me back inside when 
the time is right

soft solo

loved ones back home all crying cause they're already mising me
i pray by the grace of god that there's somebody listerning
give me a chance to be that person i wanna be (i am unbroken;
i'm choking on this ecstacy oh lord i'll try so hard but 
you gotta let go of me (unbreak me, unchain me i need 
another chance live)

guitar solo

i dont belong here we gotta move on dear escape
from this afterlife 'cause this time i'm right to
move on and on far away from here got nothing against you
and surely i'll miss you this place is full of peace
and light, and i'd hop you might take me back inside when 
the time is right---Lyrics submitted by gazza.
