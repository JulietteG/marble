Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in th distance, try and see it all
Chances are that ya mind find 
That we share a common disconfort now
I feel Im walking a fine line
Tell me only if its real
Still Im on my way (on and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take
CHORUS
Hey, I cant live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light conceiled
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the Wheel
Real as ever, and it seems Ive been buried alive

I walked the fields through the fire 
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldnt  survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a Little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign 
Tell me only if its real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away
Hey, I cant live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light conceiled
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the Wheel
Real as ever, and Im chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark, slammed all the locks
Death calls my name and it seems Ive been buried alive

Take you down now
Burn it all out throw you all around
Get your fuckin hand off me
Whats it feel like took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now youre knockin at the wrong rate
For you to pay the toll
A Price for you alone the only deal youll find 
Ill gladly take your soul
While it seems sick sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with hand of fate
Shame to find out when its too late 
But youre all the same trapped inside inferno awaits 
Evil thoughts can hide 
Ill help release the mind
Ill peel away the skin
Release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive

This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Strike you from the light(gladly have taken your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Die buried alive (gladly have taken your soul)

This is now your life
Die buried alive---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
