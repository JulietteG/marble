So this is what it comes down to
A single word out of that pretty mouth
Indicated
That you picked your world over ours
You claim you're not like the rest
But you sure do act the part

You'll be sorry
I am suffocating on the words that you messed up
You are the one that could put all my fears to bed
You are fire
That life is dead

I wanna be the one who tells you that
You were never there to face the fact
That you would always be
The one that carried me

I knew that this couldn't be
The kind of thing that pulled you away from it all
What's it gonna take
To put you back in your place?

Listen bitch I just want you to know
Everybody came here for a show
I know you're not stupid and can follow direction
So shut the fuck up and stop being pretentious

Sluts like you make me sick
You don't deserve the air you breathe
Take it from me
You're as low as low can be

I wanna be the one who tells you that
You were never there to face that fact
That you would always be
The one that carried me

You gave it away
It took all this time to see it
I really didn't believe it
If this is what its come down to
You better hope I don't find you

You carried me!

So I'll let be.

And I know it's hard to imagine
That something like this could happen
We had all the time in the world
You had lots of potential
But then you went mental

I wanna be the one who tells you that
You were never there to face the fact
That you would always be
The one that carried me

You gave it away
It took all this time to see it
I really didn't believe it
If this is what it's come down to
You better hope I don't find you

Oh my god
What happened to us?
We were so unstoppable
We couldn't fall.---Lyrics submitted by xHELLxBENTx.
