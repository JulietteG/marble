Shake Your Body Like A Tambourine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule (Ashley Joi)] 
Shawty Got A History

Even Though I'm Far I'm Coming. 
(Baby I'll Be Right Over.)

[Ja Rule:]

[Verse 2: Ja Rule] 
Back And Forth And Forth And Back Baby 
She Like Hit It From The Back I'll Ride You Later
And We Was Only In The Elevator 
Hope Her Mind Was Right Cause The Look Was Major. 
When Women Don't Wanna Cum I Make Em, Begg Em 
Make Em Feel Like I'm Doin Them A Favor
Give Em An Ultimatum 
Cause Rule Ain't No Essay 
I'm Horrible Like West Craven
If U A Hoe I Can't Save Ya
What I Can Do For It Goes 
Without Sayin Not Sayin
I Want Us To Be Naked Baby 
I Don't Want You To Think That I'm Ungrateful Baby
Especially When You Work That Twork That Body 
For Me In The Club And All Eyes Is On Ya 
We Don't Need To Talk Money Cause My Eyes Is On It
Besides Baby You Know What I Want.

(Out Chick Its Time To Go)
Riding Round 6 Am An (I'm Tryna Sleep It Off)
Cause I'm Ridin And It's Too Early
(Too Early In The Morning...)
[Ja Rule:]
