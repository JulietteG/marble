Oliver, remember me? Once I was lover to a friend 
For two full moons we lived and loved. Id do it all again. 

Oliver, dear friend of his, tell me how hes faring. 
I am so afraid for him. Im kept awake by caring

Please dont tell him that I asked but is his heart still breaking. 
And if it broke be extra keen, his life is for the taking. 

He says even with the sea but the ocean knows no reason
And winters ocean knows no kindness watch for him this season

Oliver, Oliver, if you see him, tell him that I miss him
Sure as hell if I could be there Id bend to him to kiss him.---Lyrics submitted by Ax.
