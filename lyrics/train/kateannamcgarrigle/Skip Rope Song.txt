I  USED TO KNOW A PRETTY GIRL ,
        WHO CUT OFF ALL HER HAIR
        THE SCISSORS FLEW AMONG THS CURLS
        AND CURLS WERE EVERYWHERE,

        I GATHERED UP HER FALLEN LOCKS
        AND CARRIED THEM AWAY
        AND PUT THEM IN A SILVER BOX
        AND KEEP THEM TO THIS DAY

       SONG, SING , BIRDIE WITH THE WING 
       PERFECT CIRCLE SUN 
       THE GROWN UPS GET TO MAKE THE RULES
       AND WE HAVE ALL THE FUN .

       BUT NOW I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU 
       AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL STAY
       AND TO PROVE THAT MY LOVE IS TRUE
       I LL TTHROW THE CURLS AWAY.

       SONG, SING BIRDIE WITH THE WING 
        PERFECT CIRCLE  SUN .
       THE GROWN GET TO MAKE THE RULES 
       AND WE HAVE ALL THE FUN .
       AND WE HAVE ALL THE FUN---Lyrics submitted by sean.
