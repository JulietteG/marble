Lightly, softly the world lies sleeping
Heaven bends to earth below
Christmas morning children waking
To hear the sacred story told
Joy to the world, the Lord has come

Ring the bells...ring the bells
Emmanuel
Ring the bells...ring the bells
Emmanuel has come.
(Has come)

So join the host of angel singing
Glory to the new born Christ
Good good news
Fills the sky

Ring the bells...ring the bells
Emmanuel
Ring the bells...ring the bells
Emmanuel has come.

Our long awaited wonderful savior
Has come to deliver us out of the darkness
And into this marvelous love that has given us life
New life.
So shine your light
Shine it bright
Yeah!

(Joy to the world
the Lord has come)
Joy to the world
the lord has come

Ring the bells...oh ring the bells
Emmanuel
Oh ring the bells...ring the bells
Emmanuel, Emmanuel has come.
(Has come)

Go and tell...go and tell
Emmanuel...Emmanuel, Emmanuel has come---
