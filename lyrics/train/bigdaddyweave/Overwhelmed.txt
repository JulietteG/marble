I see the work of Your Hands
Galaxies spin in a Heavenly dance oh God
All that You are is so overwhelming

I hear the sound of Your Voice
All at once its a gentle and thundering noise oh God
All that You are is so overwhelming

I delight myself in You
Captivated by Your beauty
Im overwhelmed, Im overwhelmed by You

God, I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy
Im overwhelmed, Im overwhelmed by You

I know the power of Your Cross
Forgiven and free forever Youll be my God

All that Youve done is so overwhelming
I delight myself in You
In the Glory of Your Presence
Im overwhelmed, Im overwhelmed by You

God, I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy
Im overwhelmed, Im overwhelmed by You

You are Beautiful, You are Beautiful
Oh God, there is no one more Beautiful
You are Beautiful, God you are the most Beautiful

You are Wonderful, You are Wonderful
Oh God, there is no one more Wonderful
You are Wonderful, God You are the most Wonderful

You are Glorious, You are Glorious
Oh God, there is no one more Glorious
You are Glorious, God you are the most Glorious ---
