How could I ever know
I would find myself alone
Facing your demons as well as mine
Wishing for the past that words cannot find

But somewhere in the night
The music in my mind comes alive, 
I hear loves haunting lullaby
And it sings of a time we once knew
A time when all I could breath was you
But seasons never remain the perfect shade
Our love is not the same
So we must change, change, change
Ohhoooh ooohhooh oh!
Oh ohooooooooooooh!

How could I ever know 
That with time you would go
Leaving me to find 
What was missing in between our lives!!

But somewhere in the night
The music in my mind comes alive,
I hear loves haunting lullaby
And it sings of a time we once knew
A time when all I could breath was you
But seasons never remain the perfect shade
Our love it's not the same
So we must change!!

Once we had summer in the fall
Now my heart knows what it's like
To lose it all!!---Lyrics submitted by Jami.
