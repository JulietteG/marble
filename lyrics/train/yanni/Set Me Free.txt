Why are we fighting
Why are we lying
Maybe God can help me out
But he cant see the damned in this crowd

Did I lose it all
How did I miss the call
Conform me to an image of a doll
Break me up against his wall

I cant look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving
Just set me free

Can you please forgive me
Words cant save the makings
Buildings crumble down under
And lovers crash at the sound of thunder

I once believed
Honesty was key
But I cant stay and live this way
Cause every time I stand you take it away

I cant look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving
Just set me free

Once I was young,
Now i'm old enough 
to see what you were hiding

I cant look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving
Just set me free

I cant look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving
Just set me free---Lyrics submitted by Jami.
