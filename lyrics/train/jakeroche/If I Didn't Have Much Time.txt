I would write everyone I know a letter
Telling them I care
I would ride into the night both fast and slow
And vanish in the air
Sing every song like it's my last
Past through places I'd not past
I'd find the peace in common things
And the happiness they bring

If I didn't have much time
Before I said goodbye 
I'd smile and thank you for the beautiful life
And wish you a goodnight

I'd be the ocean as it churns
I'd be the fire as it burns
I'd know that every moment is a very special gift
No right or wrong, just do or don't 
No controling things I can't control
No time to kill or mope around
I'd put my feet back on the ground

Chorus 2X---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
