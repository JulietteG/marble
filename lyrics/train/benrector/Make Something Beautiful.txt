Please let me make something beautiful
A thing that reminds us there's good in the world
A thing that reminds us there's still something out there worth fighting for

'Cause it feels like the world has gone crazy
Spinning faster and cheaper than ever before
And it feels like there's nobody giving a damn that it's getting worse

Let it be something wonderful
Let it be something beautiful

Please let me make something beautiful
A thing that reminds us there's good in the world---
