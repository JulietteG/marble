I woke up this morning, and i heard the news
I know the pain of a heartbreak

I don't have answers, and neither do you
I know the pain of a heartbreak

This isn't easy
This isn't clear
And you don't need Jesus
Til your here

Then confusion and the doubts you had
up and walk away
They walk away
When a heart breaks

I heard the doctor, but what did he say
I knew i was fine about this time yesterday
I don't need answers, well i just need some peace
I just need someone who can help me get some sleep
Who could help me get some sleep

This isn't easy
This isn't clear
And you don't need Jesus
Til your here

Then confusion and the doubts you had
up and walk away
They walk away
When a heart breaks
When a heart breaks
When a heart breaks
oh when a heart breaks

This isn't easy
This isn't clear
And you don't need Jesus
til your here

Then confusion and the doubts you had up and walk away
when a heart breaks---Lyrics submitted by faith moore.
