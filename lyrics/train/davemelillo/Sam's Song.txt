I take a walk down to the shore
And I wonder how much longer I'll sustain these steps
It's been a month since I've been gone
And it''s been a month too long 
since you have graced me with your presence

I smell your scent on every single shirt I wear
I find pieces of your hair stuck to my suitcase
I try to call but the reception here is weak
And it'll still be three more weeks til' I get home

(chrous)
I hope you're waiting by the door when I get home
I don't want anyone to see me here alone
It's not enough to say "I think about you now"
But that was all I had
..but that was all I had

I walk the boards alone tonight
And try to fill this empty space inside my chest
I take Atlantic home tonight
And every neon light in sight spells out your name

And every morning that I wake
I make a point to check the date, in case
I slept an extra day
I've crossed so many numbers out
But every time I count them there are so much more

(chorus)x2---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
