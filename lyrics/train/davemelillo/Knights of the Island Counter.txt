So we sit at this table, with our hands in our laps
And we have a few drinks while we share a few laughs
But now those days have passed and they're not coming back
its a shame, cuz' that's all that I had

(chorus)
And we'll sing out loud for hours 
until the morning that we know we can't avoid
These nights are notable and priceless
I swear that every word I say
I mean until my dying day
It's a shame when I wake I can't recall a thing
It's a shame when I wake I can't recall a thing

So keep things Quiet until the rest of the street falls asleep
then we'll break out and show everyone just what we're made of
so young, lets abuse our health and have a little fun
I'll drink to that, let's drink to that

(chorus)

I've got some problems but we've got ten dollars
that's enough to get us wasted before the night is over
these past five days I've been completely sober 
But tonight I'm gettin ripped wide open

I've got some problems but we've got ten dollars 
that's enough to get us wasted before the night is over
these past five days I've been completely sober
But tonight I'm gettin ripped wide open---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
