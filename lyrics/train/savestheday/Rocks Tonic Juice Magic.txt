Let me take this awkward saw
Run it against your thighs
Cut some flesh away
I'll carry this piece of you with me

Cause all I can say tonight is I hate you 
But it would be alright 
If we could see each other
Sometime (Oooh)
If I could somehow make you mine

And if not i'll take my spoons
Dig out your blue eyes
Swallow them down to my colon
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
Cause you're beautiful 
Just not on the inside (Yeah)

Light comes from within
Your beaming eyes don't seem so bright

Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done

Boardwalks and breaking waves
Made our Saturdays
I'd buy you lemonade right now
If you were here
And i'd throw it in your face
And i'd listen to you cry
Remember how i missed our nights underneath ocean skies

Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done

You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
