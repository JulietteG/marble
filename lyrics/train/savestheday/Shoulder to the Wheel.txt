And I say just go.
Please Dave just drive.
Get us as far as far can be.
Get us away from tonight.
And I say I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean to yell- I'm having a bad week; I miss my mom.

We drive, 
Dave steps on the gas the world that's-
Flying by is- Slick and smooth.
Big waves of light;
The radio's playing Queen.
We're rocking out.

And we're going now.
Cuz hey, this is it.
This is where we are.
Out here where silence is-
Seventy miles an hour.
Windows up tight and I am home.

We drive, 
Dave steps on the gas the world that's-
Flying by is- Slick and smooth.
Big waves of light;
The radio's playing Queen.
We're rocking out.

Okay.
We drive, 
Dave steps on the gas the world that's-
flying by is- Slick and smooth.
Big waves of light;
The radio's playing Queen.
We're rocking out.

We drive, 
Dave steps on the gas the world that's-
Flying by is- Slick and smooth.
Big waves of light;
the radio's playing Queen.
And we're rocking out.

And I say just go.
Please Dave just drive.
Get us as far as far can be.
Get us away from tonight.
Seventy miles an hour.
Windows up tight and I am home.

We drive, 
Dave steps on the gas the world that's-
Flying by is- Slick and smooth.
Big waves of light;
The radio's playing Queen.
We're rocking out.
We rock n' roll.
We're rocking out.
We rock n' roll.---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
