This song will become the anthem of your undercrowned
your two floors down getting high in the back room
if i flooded out your house
do you think you would make it out
or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs.............. 

And at your funeral i will sing the requium

this song will become the anthem of your undercrowned
your two floors down getting high in the back room
if i flooded out your house 
do you think you would make it out
or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs..............

and at your funeral i will sing the requium

i would offer you my hand
it would hurt too much to watch you die.......

and you can bet when we moan the death of you that night
they'll lay me on the dinner table
i will be the pig
with the apple in my mouth
the food that celebrates your end.......

and at your funeral i will sing the requium

i would offer you my hand
it would hurt too much to watch you die.......

and at your funeral i will sing the requium

i would offer you my hand 
it would hurt too much to watch you die.......---Lyrics submitted by cristil.
