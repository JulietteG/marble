Hammer nails into my eyes,
So ill never notice when,
Your staring at the ground.

Wishing that you didnt know,
What im really thinking,
You wont even look at me now

Say youll never leave,Please,
this war inside my mind
is killing me.

see myself in shredded skin
sow my lips together
so i wont have to say a word

What i never meant to say
i wish i could erase it
make it right again someday.

Say youll never leave,Please,
this war inside my mind
is killing me.

Ill cut out my throat and ill eat it raw
and drown in the blood
as it fills my lungs.

Say youll never leave,Please,
this war inside my mind
is killing me.

its killing me(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Bethann.
