If you've got a quarter you can stick in my neck
and I'll sing whatever song you want for whatever mood you're in.
Isn't that what you expect? I can sing you to sleep.
I've got a mouth full of blood.
Well I'll carry this casket if it's what I have to do.
So bring on the dark sky and let it cover me entirely.
Isn't that what you expect? I can sing you to sleep.
And all you want from me is a broken heart.
And I'll run down to the river and grab five buckets of water.
Wait right where you are and I will serve you at your table.
I hope you like my restaurant and the lighting is right.
The jukebox is in the corner. My mouth is the speaker.
It plays your favorite songs and you know where the coin slot is.
Isn't that what you expect? I can sing you to sleep.
And all you want from me is a broken heart.---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
