Theres many a day I act free
Were oceans apart
Even though my tears have dried
Theres an emptiness I feel in my heart
Come forward

Uh, from the first time that I loved you
I told you from the start
Our love would come together
If we could stand to be apart
I never mean to break to you heart, no

The days I cope without you
I feel so all alone
I see you in my dreams at night
I feel your touch so strong (So strong)
I feel your pain and tears miles away
I surrender my soul to you, dear

Love you x 3
Love

Mishale, what am I supposed to do
Mishale, Ill never get over you
Mishale (Mishale), loving you is heaven
Missing you is hell and I need forever to be strong

No matter where I find myself
Youre always on my mind (Always on my mind)
The photographs stare back at me
Reminds me that your loves deep as mine
(Deep as mine)
Im coming home to you, babe, is what Im livin for, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Love you x 3
Love

Mishale (Mishale), what am I supposed to do (Mishale)
Mishale (Ohoh), Ill never get over you (Mishale)
Mishale, loving you is heaven (Loving you is heaven)
Missing you is hell and I need forever to be strong, ohohoh

My swollen eyes reveal my pain
As my tears fall ???
My lifes fading
Imma just ???

Love (Love) you (You)
Love (Love) you (You)
Love (Love) you (You)
Love

Mishale, what am I supposed to do (Mishale)
Mishale (Ohoh), Ill never get over you
(Ill never get over you)
Mishale (Mishale),
loving you is heaven (Loving yous heaven)
Missing you is hell and I surrender myself to you, baby

Mishale (Oh), what am I supposed to do
(What am I supposed to do)
Mishale (Ohoh), Ill never get over you
Mishale (Mishale), loving you is heaven
(Loving you is heaven)
Missing you is hell and I need forever to be strong, oh

What am I supposed to do
Mishale (Mishale), Ill never get over you
Mishale, loving you is heaven (Loving you is heaven)
Missing you is hell---Lyrics submitted by yennifer.
