Take off all of your skin and brave when you are free
Shake off all of your sins and give them to me
Close up, let me back in
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wild fire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me and I'm like oooo

I will follow you down wherever you go
I, I'm baby I'm bound to you and do you know?
Closer, pull me in tight
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wild fire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me and I'm like oooo

I'm just gonna raise my head
Welcome to the final end
And I'm gonna fight
I'm just gonna raise my head
And hold you close

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wild fire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me and I'm like oooo---
