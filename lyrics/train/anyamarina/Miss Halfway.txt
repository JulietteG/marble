You oughta hear the mirror in my house
You oughta fear her pretty, pretty mouth
Says Im imperfect in every way:
Miss Almost, Miss Maybe, Miss Halfway

All my friends in L.A. got jobs on Melrose Place
I play Replacements songs and sigh-- a Waitress In The Sky 
You oughta hear the things Ive been thinking
You oughta swim in a heart that is sinking
You try to break me with all the things you say:
Miss Almost, Miss Maybe, Miss Halfway
Tony makes 60 K, invests in IRAs, 
But Im busy making paper airplanes out of resumes

But Im gonna burn, Im gonna shine and multiply
Im gonna fill up the great divide
Youll never break me with all the things you say
Miss Almost, Miss Maybe, Miss Halfway
Im gonna burn a pie now and then
And Im gonna say the wrong things to your friends
Im gonna burn and shine and multiply
And when I do, youre gonna see me in her eyes

Im gonna burn and shine and multiply
Im gonna fill up the great divide
Youll never break me with all the things you say
Miss Almost, Miss Maybe, Miss Halfway
Miss Almost, Miss Maybe, Miss Halfway
Miss Halfway, Miss Halfway, Miss Halfway ---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
