You can knock me over with a feather
I'd have never, I'd have never 
Never've believed in you
You can knock me over with a feather
How enviable it seems
And now, now, nobody envies me
But oh, no now, nobody envies me

I can't help it I am ?????
Long after I wake to the radio
I need you in my life I want you
Right this second so hurry up, pronto
Hurry up pronto, hurry up pronto
Hurry up pronto

I don't care if it's you, you bad thing
Nothing's funny when you're not laughing with me
Nothing happens until I tell you it
Nothing is funny until you're laughing with me
And nothing happens, nothing happens

I can't help but crying out for
Your cheesy pop song here on the radio
Need you in my life, I want you
Right this second, so hurry up pronto
Hurry up pronto, hurry up pronto
Hurry up pronto

Hurry up pronto, what's the hold up?
Hold up, waiting for a second, not a minute
Too little, too late to catch the beginning of it
Hurry up pronto, the ghost that grabs me
The cold, cold space where a body used to be
My heart aches but only a third beat

Nothing is perfect, my god we were close
I hope this is worth because 
Goddamn, it hurts

Hurry up pronto, what's the hold up?
Hold up, wait for a second, not a minute
Too little, too late to catch the beginning of it
Hurry up pronto, the ghost that grabs me
The cold, cold space where a body used to be
My heart aches but only a third beat
Only on a third beat, only on a third beat oh yeah
Only on a third beat

Hurry up, pronto---Lyrics submitted by holly.
