Only one name lasts forever. 
Only one fame stands alone.
Only king as an anthem. 
That goes on and on and on.

I'm singing to the God who brings redemption to the nations.
Kings and oceans bow to him in praise.
I'm singing to the God who wrote the book honor, salvation .
To the one who covers me in grace.
I'm singing.

Only one word in the beginning. 
Only one truth will prevail.
Only one love brings you freedom.
Only one man took the nails.

I'm singing to the God who brings redemption to the nations.
Kings and oceans bow to him in praise.
I'm singing to the God who wrote the book honor, salvation .
To the one who covers me in grace.
I'm singing.

Praise Praise to the Savior.
Praise to the lamb of God.
Praise in all of His splendor.
Praise for saving my life.

 I'm singing to the God who brings redemption to the nations.
Kings and oceans bow to him in praise.
I'm singing to the God who wrote the book honor, salvation .
To the one who covers me in grace.
I'm singing.---Lyrics submitted by heather.
