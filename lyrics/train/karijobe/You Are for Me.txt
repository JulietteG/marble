So faithful, So constant, So loving and So true
So powerful in all you do.You fill me, You see me, You know my every move.
You love for me to sing to you 

I know that you are for me.
I know that you are for me.
I know the you will never forsake me in my weakness.
And I know that you have come down even if to write my heart.
To remind me who you are.

So patient, So gracious, So merciful and true.
So powerful in all you do. You fill me, You see me, 
You know my every move, and You love for me to sing to you. 


I know that you are for me.
I know that you are for me.
I know the you will never forsake me in my weakness.
And I know that you have come down even if to write my heart.
To remind me who you are.---Lyrics submitted by Hailey Cothern.
