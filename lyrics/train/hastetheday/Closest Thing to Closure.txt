The battle's over
My heart moves on
I kept my mouth shut
While you screamed and cried
All the lies, all the lies

The battle's over
My heart moves on
Stood and took the arrows
That cut through my heart
I stood alone, I stood alone

You broke down all my walls
I'll build them up again
The battle's over now, my heart moves on

Today I stand, to watch you fall
That's just to say I've had enough
Not even you
Can stop me now
My heart moves on can't stop me now
[X2]

My heart moves on
My heart moves on
My heart moves on
My heart.---Lyrics submitted by Eduardo.
