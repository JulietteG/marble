In the springtime 
You can see nature full and free 
High up in the trees 
You can hear the birds them singing songs of freedom 

Out in the open 
Everything there is fresh and clean 
Unlike the life I'm here living 
All creatures great and small 
Living together one and all 

I wanna be 
The way I wanna be 
That is the way I wanna be 
Like the birds in the tree yeh 
They're going tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet etc. 
Singing songs of freedom 
Singing songs of freedom 

Living in the city 
No chains around my feet 
But still I am not free 
No handcuffs on my hand 
But I've got my dignity 

I wanna be 
The way I wanna be 
That is the way I wanna be 
Like the birds in the tree yeh 
They're going tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet etc. 
Singing songs of freedom 
Singing songs of freedom 

See as a youth living in the city 
Can't get no work 
Can't get no job 
Can't get no money to put in my pocket 
I can't get a thing to have of my own 

That's why I wanna be free 
That's why I wanna be free 
Like the bird in the tree 
Like the bird in the tree 
They're going tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet etc. 
Singing songs of freedom 
Singing songs of freedom 

Yes in the springtime 
You can feel nature full and free 
High up in the trees 
You can hear the birds them singing songs of freedom 

Out in the open 
Everything there is fresh and clean 
Unlike the life I'm here living 
All creatures great and small 
Living together one and all 

I wanna be 
The way I wanna be 
Just like the birds in the trees 
They're going tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet etc.---Lyrics submitted by Gail.
