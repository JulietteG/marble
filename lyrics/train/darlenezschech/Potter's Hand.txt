I.
Beautiful lord
Wonderful savior
I know for sure 
All of my days are 
Held in your  hands
Crafted into your perfect plan 

II.
You gently call me into your presence
Guiding me by your holy spirit
Teach me dear lord 
To live all of my life through your eyes

Refrain:
I'm captured by your holy calling
Set me apart, i know you're drawing me to yourself 
Lead me lord i pray 

Chorus:
Take me, mold me, use me, fill me
I give my life to the potter's hand
Call me,guide me, lead me walk beside me
I give my life to the potter's hand---Lyrics submitted by Rhea.
