Intro
Jesus lover of my soul
Jesus I will never let You go
you've taken me 
From the miry clay 
You've set my feet upon the rock 
And now I know

Chorus
I love You
I need You
Though my world be fall
I never let You go

My Savior, my closest friend
I will worship You
Until the very end
[rep. intro. and cho.]---Lyrics submitted by Ayco.
