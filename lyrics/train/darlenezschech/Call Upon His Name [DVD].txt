Not to us oh God
But to Your name all glory
We give thanks and praise
To You alone forever

Praise Him all the earth
All creation bows to You
Nations stand in awe
He is the king of glory

To you oh Lord
You reign in Heaven and on the earth
To You alone
As the Earth is filled with knowledge
Of the Lord

Call upon His name
The orphans and the widows
He'll lift You up again
And shower You with mercy

Bless You all my soul
Robed with strength and majesty
The Lion and the Lamb
Togethercome and worship
To You oh Lord
You reign in heaven and on earth
To You alone
As the Earth is filled with Your wonder

To you oh Lord
You reign in Heaven and on the earth
To You alone
As the Earth is filled with knowledge
Of the Lord

All to You
Both now and evermore

Come and drink again
Be filled with living water
Call upon His name
He is the King of glory---Lyrics submitted by elena.
