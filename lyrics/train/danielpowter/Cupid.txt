Hey oh oh oh, Hey  oh oh oh, Hey oh oh

You're the perfect part of me
You're the oxygen I breathe
You're a superstar, a work of art, it's electricity
You're a yes in a world of no's
You're the Beatles to my Stones
It's a sweet romance, a spotlight dance
Girl you shake me to my bones
But every now and then I'll start to slip away I gotta hear you say

Take me out spin me around
We can laugh when we both fall down
Let's get stupid dancing with Cupid tonight
When I sing out of key still play air guitar for me
Let's get stupid dancing with Cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right
Hey oh oh oh, Hey

And when we fight we fight
And it ain't a pretty sight
Well it's not complex, it's the make up sex
Though we always get that right
Well they don't make a pill that can give me the thrill
When I look at you then I hear you say

Take me out spin me around
We can laugh when we both fall down
Let's get stupid dancing with Cupid tonight
When I sing out of key still play air guitar for me
Let's get stupid dancing with Cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right

It's quite clear to me that we were always meant to be
You're my bird , baby I'm your bee
You got me A to Z

Take me out spin me around
We can laugh when we both fall down
Let's get stupid dancing with Cupid tonight
When I sing out of key still play air guitar for me
Let's get stupid dancing with Cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right

Hey oh oh oh, Hey oh oh oh
