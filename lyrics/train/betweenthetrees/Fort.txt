If we had one opportunity, one chance just a chance to go and find ourselves 
(Like when we were young, when we were)
Best friends runnin' through the woods 
And we were actin' like we're lost just to get away for the weekend
(Just to get away) from the city 

We could spend tonight lookin' back, or we could try to find
All this time spent on barely knowing who we are
A child like us, is we need 

So heres our chance, our chance to make the change 
To become the type of people that we've always wanted to be
(We're not livin' by what anybody says, only livin' by what we've known since we)
We were, we were best friends
And we knew how to get away for the weekend

We could spend tonight lookin' back, or we could try to find
All this time spent on barely knowing who we are
A child like us, is all we need

I found my soul in the forest (in the forest)
I found my love in the forest
And we just need time to try and find our selves again
Or just time to breathe in

We think we need so many useless things
When all we really need is time to breathe 2x---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
