I bet you didn't know
Long before the show
late sometime last year we were thinking of you
we just wanted you to hear
and so
Listen up we'll make it clear
so there's no misdirection
we had you in our hearts before you knew us
before we were in your ears
we were...

...Praying for the crowd...

Here is the song we wrote about you
Here is the song that you can sing-along to
Up until you now youve only listened
So keep listenin and start singin'

I know
you've heard it all before
but you must admit there's something different
something more than just a toe to the floor
Clap your hands and sing along
If your dancing keep on dancing
If standing still and holding on
Give yourself the chance to let go
and make it more

...Praying with the crowd...

Here is the song we wrote about you
Here is the song that you can sing-along to
Up until you now youve only listened
So keep listenin and start singin'
Here is the song we wrote about you
Here is the song that you can sing-along to
Up until you now youve only listened
So keep listenin and start singin'

So the curtains close
and you're heading home
and you're on own
So we hope you know that we're thinking of you...

Here is the song we wrote about you
Here is the song that you can sing-along to
Up until you now youve only listened
So keep listenin and start singin'
Here is the song we wrote about you
Here is the song that you can sing-along to
Up until you now youve only listened
So keep listenin and start singin'---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
