She opens up my bedroom door 
she's waking me up soon 
"i'm turning on the light" she warns 
it's the little things that you do 
she's the one that start's my day.. 
my dear mom... my comforter 
my friend forever 
when life's right or wrong 
she is also my laughter 
Yet my sholuder to cry on 

choris 
my mom is my super hero 
my mom is my world ...] 

all out of gas no place to go 
she knows just what i'll say 
she turns and laughs and opens up 
her purse 
and gives enough for the week 
she didn't have to give but she did 
it's just the kind of woman she is 
Love, she is love 
my dear mom... 

Chorus 
my mom is my super hero 
my mom is my world...] 

Love is an action that she shows me often. 
even when it's not in her kisses 
blessed with a mom who puts herself after her children. 
it dosen't get much better than priceless... 

Chorus 
my mom is my super hero 
my mom is my world...]---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
