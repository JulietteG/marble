Felt like strangled in my own bed
But stood up
Nothing, nothing instead
Of staying out of the last hours

Put it all in my endless debt
I'm taking everything I can get
See us trying to hold on what's left of our souls

Now would you believe me
If I said

Felt like crying in my own head
But laughed like nothing
Nothing instead
Of staying out of the last hours

We're young but already so old
Our hearts are filled with doubt and sold
For the highest bidder in this mess we live & die

Now would you believe me
If I said
That it was only a dream
To get stuck in between
Then paint back the rainbow
Through the golden sea

It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now
It was only a dream
It was only a dream now---Lyrics submitted by emily murrin.
