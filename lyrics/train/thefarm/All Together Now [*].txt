Remember boy that your forefather's died
Lost in millions for a country's pride
Never mention the trenches of Belgium
When they stopped fighting and they were one

A spirit stronger than war was at work that night
December 1914 cold, clear and bright
Countries' borders were right out of sight
They joined together and decided not to fight

All together now, all together now
All together now in no man's land (together)
All together now (all together), all together now (all together)
All together now (together, together)
In no man's land (together, together)

The same old story again
All those tears shed in vain
Nothing learnt and nothing gained
Only hope remains

All together now, all together now
All together now in no man's land (together)
All together now (all together), all together now (all together)
All together now in no man's land (together)
All together now (all together now), all together now (all together now)
All together now (together, together)
In no man's land (together, together)

The boys had their say, they said no (all together now)
Stop the slaughter, let's go home
Let's go, let's go (all together now)
Let's go (all together now), let's go home
All together now (together, together)
In no man's land (together, together)
All together now (all together now), all together now (all together)
All together now (together, together)
In no man's land (together, together)---Lyrics submitted by ellie clements.
