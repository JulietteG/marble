I hear a lot of records on the radio
A lot of love songs
They make me sing along
I sing staight from my heart right into yours
Complete with clique and metaphor you've heard before
It's ringing in my head cause it rings true
I know you're missing me, like I've been missing you
I can never get enough no, never get enough of a good thing

Does the world really need another love song?
Another you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone
Another I don't know if I can live without you
Another maybe you baby you, gotta make a livin' though

Ah ah ah ah ahhh I love you 
Another Love song 
Ah ah ah ah ahhh I do 
Another love song 

Time and time again we need a little break, from the give and take
We make the same mistakes
I know I've never been the one to let my feelings show
and I guess in ever guy I'm not alone
We could all use a push, when it comes to shove
We sing of life and love and the lack there of
with a little bit of luck we can never get enough of a good thing

Does the world really need another love song?
Another you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone
Another I don't know if I can live without you
Another baby you Ohhh I 

Does the world really need another love song?
Another you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone
Another I don't know if I can live without you
Another baby you, baby you
I don't thing we'll ever know

Ah ah ah ah ahhh I love you 
Another Love song 
Ah ah ah ah ahhh I do 
Another love song

A modern girl will give it away
Just give me some of that Marvin Gaye
Don't need grace, good place to start
Go ahead a take a little piece of my heart 

So, does the world really need another love song?
Another you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone
Another I don't know if I can live without you
Another baby you, baby you, baby ooo

Does the world really need another love song?
Another you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone
Another I don't know if I can live without you
Another baby you, baby you
I don't think we'll ever know

Ah ah ah ah ahhh I love you 
Another love song 
Ah ah ah ah ahhh I do 
Another love song

Ah ah ah ah ahhh I love you 
Another love song 
Ah ah ah ah ahhh I do 
Another love song---Lyrics submitted by stacy.
