She is my rock and my rolling thunder
I've been the spell she was under
I, I love that girl

She is my cigarettes and champagne
She's got me strung but I'm not running
I, I love that girl
I, I love that girl

She is the days I can't get over
She is the nights that I call home endlessly
For you I'll always wait

Caught in the waves of hesitation
Lost in the sea of my own doubt endlessly
For you I'll always wait
For you I'll always wait

She is the flame and the fire she's raging
I've been the spark and the war she's waging
I, I love that girl

She came along and she spoke so sweetly
Changed everything, took my heart completely
I, I love that girl
I, I love that girl

She is the days I can't get over
She is the nights that I call home endlessly
For you I'll always wait

Caught in the waves of hesitation
Lost in the sea of my own doubt endlessly
For you I'll always wait

And the city buzz and empty cars
It's 3AM I wonder where you are
And the crooked smiles and worn out miles between us
Now I wonder where you are

She is the days I can't get over
She is the nights that I call home endlessly
For you I'll always wait

Caught in the waves of hesitation
Lost in the sea of my own doubt endlessly
For you I'll always wait
For you I'll always wait
For you I'll always wait---
