I'll meet you in the Star Room
in thirty or forty years.
You can bring along your dentures.
I'll bring my souveniers.

I'll meet you in the Star Room
for cocktails and for cheers.
We can have a conversation
that neither of us hears.

And I'll help you with your walker
if you'll help with my Depends.
And, we can find the moon
with a telescopic lens.

I'll meet you in the Star Room
for a final festive fling.
And I'll hold your pale arthritic hand
against my double chin.

And if we should spot Orion,
then we'll kiss beneath its glow.
And, if the time is right
we'll let go.---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
