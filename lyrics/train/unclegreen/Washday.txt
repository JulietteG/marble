I'm looking for a little more time
If that's not asking too much
I just need a little more time
So I can get in touch

Well but my day, washed away
Yeah my day, washed away
Washed away

You know it's been one of those weeks
Where nothing really goes
Week after week after week
My mortality shows

Because my day, washed away
Yeah my day, washed away

Well I can't stop it
There's nothing I can do
The years are dropping
And it's happening to you
Washing away

Yesterday it seemed like I was ten
And tomorrow I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing again

Because my day, washed away
Yeah my day, washed away

Well I can't stop it
There's nothing I can do
The years are dropping
And it's happening to you
Washing away
You're washing away
I'm washing away---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
