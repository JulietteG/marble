I feel it coming to me
I feel it coming on good
I feel it coming to me
I guess I knew that it would

I'm going down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

I feel it coming to me
I feel it coming on strong
I feel it coming to me
And it didn't take long

I'm going down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

What did I do to deserve it?
What did I do to make them so mad?
What did I do to earn it?
I hope it wasn't all that bad
I hope this guiltlessness I've had
Doesn't make my admission
An act of submission now, now

I feel it coming to me
I feel it coming on hard
I feel it coming to me
And all my instincts are scarred

I'm going down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

What did I do to deserve it?
What did I do to make them so mad?
What did I do to earn it?
I hope it wasn't all that bad
I hope this guiltlessness I've had
Doesn't make my admission
An act of submission
Doesn't make my confession
An act of possession
Doesn't make my consenting
An act of preventing 
Doesn't make my acceeding
An act of receiving
Doesn't make my confirming
An act of reaffirming your suspicions
Your suspicions

I'm going down, down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

I'm going down
I'm going down
I'm going down---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
