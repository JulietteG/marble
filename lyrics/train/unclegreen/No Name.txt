Out in the yard, you've got no name
What's it like to have no name?
Must be hard, who's to blame?
What's it like to have no name?

No one's making, no one's making a change
No name

Under the car, you've got no name
Everyday you've got no name
Must be hard, every day's the same
How's it feel to have no name?

No one's making, no one's making a change
No name

It's a shame
That you sleep
And awake
In a night
In the shade
Of a light
That is made
No place

Sit in the chair, you've got no name
Who knew you've got no name?
Who knows what's fair?
It's an empty claim
It's just that way, you've got no name

No one's making, no one's making a change
No name
No name
No name
No name---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
