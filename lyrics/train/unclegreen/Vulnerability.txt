I was watchin' the news on my TV
Flippin' through a magazine carelessly
Half listenin' and half dreamin' like I do
Half listenin' and half dreamin' like I do

Then the newsman's voice began to wane,
and his face turned pale and he called my name.
He said, "I just don't know what I am comin' to."
"I just don't know what I am comin' to."

I said, "Oh, vulnerability, You can talk to me."
"'Cause if times get rough, we can always just turn them off."

I was down at the club on a Friday night
(lookin' for a place to fantasize)
And a band was playin' in the floodlights
(and they played a song I recognized)
And the stage was red and green, but mostly blue
(then the singer looked into my eyes)
He said, "Help, I need somebody how 'bout you?"

I said, "Oh, vulnerability, You can talk to me."
"'Cause if things go wrong, we can play some different song."

You know, all the people out on the streets, now
the ones I will and will never meet, now
they're driftin' in seclusion down the road
Well they shake their heads and
they run away, now
the things they do, and the
things they say, now
To cover up that fear of being alone

I was watchin' a film by a dear old friend
(slippin' into something like a dream)
I was sad to see that movie end
(slippin' deeper scene by scene by scene)
So I sat there in my chair, and I closed my eyes
(somethin' stirred upon the movie screen)
And the image of my friend materialized

Ooh, and he said, "Oh, vulnerability, You can talk to me."
"'Cause if we hit bad times, we can always just rewind."
"If we hit bad times, we can always just rewind."
