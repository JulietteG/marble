Ephenus
Called again today
What's come between us
She couldn't say
She couldn't say

Over
and over again
Go all the reasons
I can't understand
I'd give you all my money
If you could tell me why

Oh-oh Ephenus
called again today
What's come between us
She couldn't say

You know I want you
But my time is running out
You'll always haunt me
But I'll have to do without
I'd give you all my money
If you could tell me why

Oh-oh Ephenus
called again today
What's come between us
She couldn't say
You know I want you
But I just don't have enough
You know I need you
But I just don't have enough

I'd give you all my money
If you could tell me why---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
