Hanging out on Saturday
Looking for a wife
If it's my lucky night
It might happen twice
But I know I have no confidence
In my own advice

Filling applications out
Just gives me the blues
With the other applicants
I wait for interviews
But I know that I positive that
I can only lose

I can stand around and wait in a line
Or sit at home and wait for a sign
But it all equals out in good time

All the days drag on and on
Time just moves so slow
Then the minutes tick away
And all your time just goes
But it's all unimportant
The last time your eyes close

I can stand around and wait in a line
Or sit at home and wait for a sign
But it all equals out in good time
In good time

So I'll sit here on this hill
Until the second before the end
Leaving all my family
Forgetting all my friends
And if nothing ever happens
I'll be a part of it
But if everything changes, well
I'll just watch and sit

'Cause I can stand around and wait in a line
Or sit at home and wait for a sign
'Cause it all equals out
In good time
In good time---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
