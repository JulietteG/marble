Undivided page
See the trees and see the forest
Right behind a change
But I got nothing
I got nothing

Over the under
Better not be covered
Sorry my brother
Not in range
Under the over
Were you there?
We both were
Sorry my brother 
Not in range

If you saw his hands
You'd think you could hold on sometime
When he took his stand
But I got nothing
Seemed like something

Over the under
Better not be covered
Sorry my brother
Not in range
Under the over
Were you there?
We both were
Sorry my brother 
Not in range

Inside his brian is something
That I can't describe
That I can't describe
We gotta make a killing
To get out alive
To get out alive

Once he got inside
He saw something no one else did
And it seemed so right
But I got nothing 
Seemed like something

Over the under
Better not be covered
Sorry my brother
Not in range
Under the over
Were you there?
We both were
Sorry my brother 
Not in range
Not in range
Not in range
Not in range---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
