I'm gone to Little India
In the strip mall across the street
Where all the would-be Yogis
On their lunch hours go to meet

Sitting in the lotus in a thousand parking spaces
Staring into nothingness, a thousand open faces
I'm gone 
to Little India
I'm gone 
to Little India

I'm gone to Little India
Between the laundrymat and mini-mart
With all the would-be Ravis
Playing raga on air sitar

Waiting for the universal consciousness to take us
Hoping that the cops don't come along and try to wake us
I'm gone
to Little India
I'm gone
to Little India---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
