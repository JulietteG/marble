I'd better tell you what you could be getting into
I'd better show you all the places I have been before

I've got to do it

I'd better tell you that I know the circumstances
And I could prove from past experience the chance is slim

I'll just admit it

Oh, you're getting into it now
You're getting into it

You're looking at me
And you're liking what you see there
But I can tell
That you're not really seeing me there

It's just a feeling

Oh, you're getting into it now
You're getting into it

I will do what's right
I've got to confess
I've made such a mess
Before
I don't know how
But I could do it
Again
Yeah

Well, I'd better tell you what I've seen myself reduced to
I'd better lable everything I've gotten used to and

If you're still here

Then
I'll get into it now
I'll get into it now

I'd better tell you what you could be getting into
We're getting into it now
I'd better tell you mwhat you could be getting into
We're getting into it now---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
