I can't think about you tonight, ite, ite
I can't bear to see your face in the light, ite, ite
Don't be afraid of my runnin' away
'Cause it's the only thing that'll get me to stay, hey, hey

I need all my strength today, hey hey
I need all my resolve today, hey hey
I can't let anything put up a fight
'Cause I'm gonna lose sight, yeah I'm gonna lose sight, ite, ite

I need all my strength today
'Cause this ain't the way
this ain't the way

I can't lose my head now, how how
I just gotta hold on somehow, how how
It's a random conclusion based on no evidence
but in the back of my mind, well it seems to make sense, heh hence

I can't lose my head now
it can't be allowed
It can't be allowed

I gotta open my eyes to see, he he
I gotta figure out what's ahead for me, he he
On the heels of redemption, my throat turns dry
and for a few fleeting moments, I wonder why, hi hi

I gotta open my eyes to see
'Cause I know it can't be
I know it can't be---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
