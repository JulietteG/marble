A Man-o-War
Without a race
A Superman
Without a face

Did you leave the basics
Up to someone else?
You don't need a witness
To idolize yourself

A figureghead
Without a plan
A totem pole
For Everyman

Did you think the blessings
Come from somewhere else?
You don't need a pulpit
To deify yourself

Saint Lazaro
Pay no mind
Saint Lazaro 
Pay no mind

A Hercules
Without a myth
It's circumstance
Not hit and miss

Was it all misfortune
Or was it something else?
You don't need a fable
To moralize yourself
'Cause you're no more a victim
Than anybody else

Saint Lazaro
Pay no mind
Saint Lazaro
Pay no mind---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
