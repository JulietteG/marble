Thought I had something to say
Something to say
(Coulda been the wrong thing)
Thought I had something to say
Something to say
(Coulda been the wrong thing)
Shouldn't say the wrong thing
Don't wanna put my foot into my mouth
With nothing to say

Geronimo
Geronimo
Geronimo
Geronimo

Thought I had some where to be
Somewhere to be
(Coulda been the wrong place)
Thought I had some where to be
Somewhere to be
(Coulda been the wrong place)
Can't be in the wrong place
Don't wanna get stuck where I don't belong
I should just stay

Geronimo
Geronimo
Geronimo
Geronimo

And  now day
Passes to night
What's wrong with idle time, and besides
Who can decide?
Decide?

Geronimo
Geronimo
Geronimo
Geronimo

Thought I had something to say
Something to say
(Coulda been the wrong thing)
Thought I had something to say
Something to say
(Coulda been the wrong thing)
Thought I had something to say
Something to say
(Coulda been the wrong thing)
Coulda been the wrong thing
Shouldn't say the wrong thing
Nothing to say
