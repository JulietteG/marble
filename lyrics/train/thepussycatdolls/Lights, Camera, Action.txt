Hey girl
Do you love me?
Yes
Well, I'm going try something with you
So don't be shy
Are you ready?
Of course, baby
Let's go

You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action
You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action

I've been thinkin' about this for some time
I've got a feaky temptation, burning deep inside

You see the scripts already wrote
The bedroom is a set
I hope you know your lines
'Cause one take is all we get

Now hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action
You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action

By the time this is over
Girl, I'ma make you a star
You ready? 1-2-3-4

Directin' and producin'
And you're the leading lady in the show
(You're the leading lady, baby)
Nobody double needed
'Cause I do all the stunts on my own
(Believe that)

That you can turn your phone off
All be quiet on the set (The set)
You'd better know your lines
'Cause one take is all we get

You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action
You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action

You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action
You go hit the lights
I'll set up the camera
Now let's get to the action

We goin' rewind
Go one more time
Play back our love
On the wide screen
Baby don't stop
Until I say cut
Camera's off, camera's out
Keep it rollin'
(Can we roll it)
(Can we roll it)
(Can we roll it)
(Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll...)

Baby, let yourself go---Lyrics submitted by Alin.
