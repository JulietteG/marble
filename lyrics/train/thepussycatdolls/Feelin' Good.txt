Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new a dawn
And a new day
And a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
So good, yeah

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
Rivers running free
You know how I feel
Bouncing on the tree
You know how I feel
It's a new a dawn
And a new day
And a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
So good
So good

Dragon fly out in the sun
You know what I mean
Don't you know?
Butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this whole world, is a new world, and a whole world, for me.

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of pine
You know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
And a new day
And a new love for me
And I'm feeling...
Oh...
I'm feeling good

You know how I feel
You know how I feel
You
You know how I feel
Feeling good
I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good
Feeling good
Feeling good
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me---Lyrics submitted by Inga.
