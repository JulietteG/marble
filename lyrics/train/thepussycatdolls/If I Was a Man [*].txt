If I was a man
Just for a day
I'd take my time on you
That's what a man would do

If I was a man
Just for a day
And once I had my way
I'd get up, get up
and walk away

Monday night
Tuesday night
Friday night
Every night Why?
Cause I can

New York and Japan
With the stop up in Milan
After all
I'm a man

I'll get to know your family
Get your friends to fall
in love with me
Just happens all so easily Easily

I'll have you
thinking I'm the one
You play your part I play along
We can have a lot of fun
Until I'm done

I can lie and hide and
fool your heart
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man
Paint it all like a work of art
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man

I turn it on
Turn it off
Tu-turn it out
Turn it up Why?
Cause I can

It's no sweat
Get the check
Show respect
Don't forget you'll
pay me later
That's the plan

I'll get to know your family
Get your friends to fall
in love with me
Just happens all so easily Easily

I'll have you thinking
that I'm the one
You play your part I play along
We can have a lot of fun
It's a plan

I can lie and hide and
fool your heart
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man
Paint it all like a work of art
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man

If I was a man
Just for a day
I'd take my time on you
That's what a man would do

If I was a man
Just for a day

And once I had my way
I'd get up, get up
and walk away

I can lie and hide and
fool your heart
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man
Paint it all like a work of art
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man

I can lie and hide and
fool your heart
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man
Paint it all like a work of art
If I was a man for a day
If I was a man

I'd take my time on you
That's what a man would do

And once I had my way
I'd get up, get up
and walk away

I'd take my time on you
That's what a man would do

And once I had my way
I'd get up, get up
and walk away---Lyrics submitted by asley.
