Why you talking all that talk
Who you trying to impress
Think you better check your style
That might have worked before 
but I ain't having it
Show me that you got the touch
Hear the words that I don't say
Gotta read between the lines
You gotta learn this song

Cause I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

It's not about the way you roll
Your making it too obvious
Try to be original
You gotta learn me
Don't be in such a rush
I can be your symphony
Listen to me all night long
If you give me what I need
I could be your favorite song

I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

(Played)
Baby just like that
Come on do it again
We're going to get this right
Even if it takes all night

Do you feel me?
That's right
Take it nice and slow

I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

Played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gottafind the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played
Like a violin
Make the string talk with your finger tips...---Lyrics submitted by Paige.
