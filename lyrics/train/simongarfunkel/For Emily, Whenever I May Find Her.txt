What a Dream I had, 
pressed in organdy, clothed in crinoline,
of smokey burgundy, 
softer then the rain.....

I wondered empty streets down
past the shop displays,
I heard cathedral bells
dripping down the alley ways
as I walked on........
   And when you ran to me your
   Cheeks flushed with the night
    we walked on frosted fields 
    of juniper and lamplight...
I held your hand.......

And when I woke, 
and felt you warm and near,
I kissed your honey hair
with my grateful tears
  Oh How I Love You Girl
    Oh I Love You!!!---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
