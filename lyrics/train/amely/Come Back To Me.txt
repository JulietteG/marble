I feel the weight of silence crashing down
It brings me to my knees
Remember back to when we had it all
When you stood next to me

But with every kiss
It tastes like goodbye
And I don't wanna feel like
This will be the last time

I stopped breathing
My heart's not beating
Begging you on my knees

Ill say never
Just stay forever
Will you come back to me?
Just come back to me

I stole the moment but
The moment stole the breath right out of me.
Regretting every second, left in fear
Your ghost is haunting me

But with every kiss
It tastes like goodbye
And I dont wanna break
Here tonight

I stopped breathing
My heart's not beating
Begging you on my knees

Ill say never
Just stay forever
Will you come back to me?
Just come back to me

I cant hold myself under
Time cant heal everything
Try and somehow discover
Find yourself again---Lyrics submitted by bryan.
