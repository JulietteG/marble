Do you ever feel like you're dying?
Got the same dream on repeat
It's like a song you can't rewind,
And though you try it only makes you see (makes you see)

These are the chords that you have chosen
This is your favorite melody
And even though you're all alone 
I've got a way of changing everything (everything)

So go it alone or stand by your side
At least you can say I've tried
To throw it all away or keep you locked inside (inside)

When you're standing in the rain
And you see me standing by you
When nothing goes your way
You feel me right behind you
I will take away your pain
You know I'll make it better when I 
Sing to you

You say your heart don't beat without me
Am I making sense to you?
I wish I could, you know I would
But it's a major minor kind of tune (kind of tune)

So listen to me I'm gonna make you proud
Keep your high from ever touching ground
And I'll be your strength when you are feeling down (feeling down)

When you're standing in the rain
And you see me standing by you
When nothing goes your way
You feel me right behind you
I will take away your pain
You know I'll make it better when I 
Sing to you

When you're standing in the rain
And you see me standing by you
When nothing goes your way
You feel me right behind you
I will take away your pain
You know I'll make it better when I 
Sing to you

Girl this is the reason
And even though I'm leaving
I won't ever be too far
Turn on the radio
You'll hear in stereo
You will always be my star
Star
Star
Star
Star

When you're standing in the rain
And you see me standing by you
When nothing goes your way
You feel me right behind you
I will take away your pain
You know I'll make it better when I 
Sing to you

When you're standing in the rain
And you see me standing by you
When nothing goes your way
You feel me right behind you
I will take away your pain
You know I'll make it better when I 
Sing to you

When you're standing in the rain
And you see me standing by you
When nothing goes your way
You feel me right behind you
I will take away your pain
You know I'll make it better when I 
Sing to you

(star, star, star, star)
You know I'll it better when I
Sing to you---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
