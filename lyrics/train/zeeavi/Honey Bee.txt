I am a honey bee
Shunned out from the colony 
And they wont let me in 
So I left the hive
They took away all my stripes
And broke off both my wings

So Ill find another tree
And make the wind my friend
Ill just sing with the birds
Theyll tell me secrets of the world

But my other honey bee
Stuck where he doesn't want to be
Oh, my darling honey bee
Ill come save you even if it means 
Id have to face the queen
Oh buh duh pum buh dum pum
puh dah dah duh pah puh dum dum

So Ill come prepared
My new friends said they would help me
Get my loved one back
They say it isn't right
The bees have control of your mind
But I choose not to believe that
So well meet in the darkness of the night 
And I promise I will be there on time 
Well be guided by my new friends, the butterflies 
Bring us back to our own little hive

Oh, my other honey bee
No longer stuck where he doesn't want to be 
Oh, my darling honey bee
I have saved you and now that youre with me
We can make our own honey 
Oh buh duh pum buh dum pum
puh dah dah duh pah puh dum dum---Lyrics submitted by Hannah A.
