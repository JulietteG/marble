First of the gang

You have never been in love
till you see the stars
reflecting the resevoirs

And you have never been in love
until you see the dawn rise
behind the home for the blind

We are the pretty, petty things
And you're standing on our streets

well hector was the first of the gang
with the gun in his hand
and the first to do time
first of the gang to die

Oh my

Yeah hector was the first of the gang
with the gun in his hand
and the first to do time
first fo the gang to die

Oh my

You have never been in love
until you see the sunlight thrown
over smashed human bones

we are the pretty petty things
and you're standing on our streets

well hector was the first of the gang
with the gun in his hand
and the first to do time
first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy

yeah hector was the first of the gang
with a gun in his hand
and a bullet in his skillet
the first was last
to go under the sun

And he stole from the rich and the poor
and the not very rich and the very poor

he stole our hearts away
He stole our hearts away
he stole our hearts away-ay-ay ay-ay ay-ay
He stole our hearts away
He stole our hearts away
he stole our hearts away-ay-ay ay-ay ay-ay
away-ay-ay
he stole our hearts away
he stole our hearts away
He stole our hearts away---Lyrics submitted by maral.
