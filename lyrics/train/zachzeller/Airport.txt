With every breath that's taken
His heart slowly creeps out of his chest
Within the crowds of people
The light is shifting faster
He's lost his love
Slow down
The shoe shiner, he's shining his shoes
He says, "It happens all the time"
Slow down
Turn back
Just be silent
For once
Take a breath
Receive the love---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
