My calling card is bone dry
I've been disconnected
The midnight train flashed right before my eyes
Thought I caught a glimpse of you
Called your house
Got that robot voice
That simple voice
That irritating voice
Yesterday's the day I recall from yesterday
She moves in a way that makes the ocean cringe
It makes the ocean cringe
She parted the sea and stuck her foot right in
She spun the moon again---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
