In the morning they will rise
In the night they will sleep
But for the time in between
Endless possibilities
Fathers and daughters they dance
While the sons and mothers decline
The angels in the sky they weep
For the damned that they oversee
And their souls
So lift us up
Take our hands
Bind our feet
And place us in the ground
Ever so gently
As we emerge
Their skin painlessly peels off
Exposing all of our insides
We are precious and impressionable
Go ahead
Rape our minds
Rape, rape our minds---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
