You can spend your whole life building, something from nothing. 
One storm can come and blow it all away, build it anyway.

You can chase a dream, that seems so out of reach 
And you know it might not ever come your way
Dream it anyway

God is great
But sometimes life aint good
And when I pray 
It doesnt always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
I do it anyway 

This worlds gone crazy 
And its hard to believe 
That tomorrow will be better than today 
Believe it anyway 

You can love someone with all your heart
For all the right reasons
In a moment they can choose to walk away
Love them anyway

God is great
But sometimes life aint good 
And when I pray 
It doesnt always turn out like I think it should 
But I do it anyway
Yeah I do it anyway 

You can pour your soul out singing
A song you believe in 
That tomorrow theyll forget you ever sang 
Sing it anyway 
Yeah sing it anyway
Yeah Yeah 

I sing 
I dream
I love anyway Yeah---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
