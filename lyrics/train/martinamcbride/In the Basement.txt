(feat. Kelly Clarkson)

Oh, now tell me where can you party, child, all night long?
In the basement, down in the basement.
Oh where can you go when your money gets low?
In the basement, down in the basement
And if a storm is taking place, you can jam and still be safe
In the basement, down in the basement

Where can you dance to any music you choose?
In the basement, down in the basement
Oh, you got the comforts of home, a nightclub too.
In the basement, down in the basement.
There's no cover charge or fee and the food and drinks are free,
In the basement, down in the basement

Where they don't check you age at the door
In the basement, down in the basement
Barracuda and jerk til your feet get sore
In the basement, down in the basement
Do any dance you want to do, there's no one under you
In the basement, down in the basement ---
