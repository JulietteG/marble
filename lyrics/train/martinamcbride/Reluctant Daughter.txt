Jesus, tell my Father,
I wanna be His child again.
Tell Him what my name is, 
In case He's forgotten.

Tell Him I'm the woman at the well,
Drawing water.
And, I'm sorry if I've been His,
Reluctant daughter.

Jesus, tell my angels,
To keep me in their prayers.
Remind them how I need,
To feel them everywhere.

Tell them I ready to drink,
Living water.
I don't want my angels to think I'm His,
Reluctant daughter.

*instrument bridge*

Jesus, tell my Father,
I want to come to heaven.
Tell Himmto shout my name out,
So I won't be forgotten.---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
