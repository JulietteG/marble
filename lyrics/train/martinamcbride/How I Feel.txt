confetti fallin' from the sky
my hometown on the 4th of july
a midnight snow on Christmas eve
like standin' up for what you believe

that's how I feel when I'm with you
that's how I feel when I'm with you
that's how I feel
that's how I feel when I'm with you

your lucky coat, the first day of fall
when you wake up laughin' just because
an old church door that stays wide open
a perfect heart that's never been broken

that's how I feel when I'm with you
that's how I feel when I'm with you
that's how I feel
that's how I feel when I'm with you

that's how I feel when I'm with you
every day there's something new
to cry about, to laugh about
those moments I can't live without 
that's how I feel
that's how I feel
when I'm with you, yeah
when I'm with you
when I'm with you---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
