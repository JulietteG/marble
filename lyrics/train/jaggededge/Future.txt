(It's a heartbreak)

I feel like a penetrating water on  some quicksand
Rising to my knees when you're not around
I'm breaking every border, every rule
Now pertaining to what's doing
What we said, when we started out
And them church bell rang, and cupid's straight spray
And I even took my 5 shots in the heart
Girl, just for you
I don't need no medicine
All I really need is a touch from you
Girl, I do see my future with you

When I look in your eyes, I see my future in you
Till I get newborn child, I see my future with you
I walk a million miles to have a future with you
When I look in your eyes, I see my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you

I see me and you cross the border
And a nice little house on the water
Or a villa, just for me and you
Using every inch of this tool
But with the drama that's been popping up
It'd be a shame, if we can't do it
But the fat lady ain't sang yet
And the new style that ain't hang
See I'm trying to take us back to the beginning
When every day was alright
And we really couldn't stand to fight
I just want you here with me
Please don't take away my future

When I look in your eyes, I see my future in you
Till I get newborn child, I see my future with you
I walk a million miles to have a future with you
When I look in your eyes, I see my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you

You can catch me start early daydreaming you
Well, if that's what you really want
And you don't want to be involved with you
Make me wanna be involve with you
And baby, you're my future

When I look in your eyes, I see my future in you
Till I get newborn child, I see my future with you
I walk a million miles to have a future with you
When I look in your eyes, I see my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you
See my future with you---
