I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
My soul I been pourin', I remember that morning
You left with no warning, I need you now
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you, now

From the moment I walked in it was wrong, so wrong
Yeah, and I looked around for a couple seconds and
Everything, it was gone, it was gone, it was gone
So many things about ya, it was perfect for me
Can't believe all my love has gone away
And I'm down in the dumpster, I'm bout to fill this cup
Bartender, hit me one(?)

I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
My soul I been pourin', I remember that morning
You left with no warning, I need you now
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you, now

From the moment she walked out, I was done
All done, I ain't even take a week
It was like immediately after, and now she all gone
And already moved on from this chapter
See, I waited, I waited, for one to bring on
I'm staring out the window and I'm singin' that song
And you don't even know what you did
Oh

I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
My soul I been pourin', I remember that morning
You left with no warning, I need you now
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you, now

Tell me what it is baby that you want
Tell me what it is baby that you want
I been wrong for so long
Can't wait the rest of my lifetime to be happy
In spite of you, I'll never believe this day
Can't sleep cuz I'm hurtin', every mornin' I'm hurtin'
Only you can stop this hurtin', yeah

I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you
My soul I been pourin', I remember that morning
You left with no warning, I need you now
I don't wanna spend, I don't wanna spend
The rest of my life gettin' ova you, now---
