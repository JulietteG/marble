Well, he was the Sax Man from the state of Tennessee
First set in with the band at the ripe old age of three, we told
And when he blew into that horn all the people gathered 'round
Club manager jumped right up and said, "Boy, I gotta have that sound!"

Scream "Hallelujah Lord!", I said the Sax Man's got my soul
Everybody gotta move their feet when the Sax Man started to blow
Now blow it Sax Man!

(Weak saxophone noises)

Nnnn, 'kay, he's a little shy, but his genius cannot hide
Cause when the Sax Man starts to win he gonna take you on a ride
Take it Sax Man!

Ow! Take it Sax Man!
He'll be right with you folks!

All right, Sax Man, that's my fault, I put you on the spot
But now you're all warmed up and this-a next one's gonna be hot
Kick it Sax Man!

(Come on! )

(What the fuck are you doing! )

Haha, okay! Why don't we have a little inspiration now.
You know this game, Sax Man!
Repeat after me, here we go, and!

Shibidi bop bop buda bop bop

Bip bip bipbip bip bip bipbip bip

Aridididi bop bududidadi

Fuckin' play something, Sax Man!

Okay, move it on!
Sax Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan,
Sax Man!---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
