Hi I'm John Waters 
 and this is the Creep.

 When your out at a 
club and you see a fly girl 
 Do the creep(haaaa)
 Do the creep(haaaa)

 And if you wanna make
friends at the ATM
 Do the creep(haaaa)
 And do the creep(haaaa)

Well we got a new dance,
 so get up on your feet
It's real easy to do and
 it's called the creep

 Let your arms flop around
like a marionette
 Pop your knees up and
down sh-sh-shakin' your
neck

Now pull your wasteband up
 like you expecting a flood
And slick your hair down
 flat like it was covered in
mud

 Trim up your pencil
mustache and pop them 
 peepers
Put this in your speakers,
 you a certified creeper

When you see a country
 bitch laying out at the
beach
 Do the creep(haaaa)
And do the creep(haaaa)

 And when a fine PYT
walks in front of your tree
 Do the creep(oooo)
And do the creep(haaaa)

I was six years old when I
 started creepin'
My parents took it to their 
 room and I started peepin'

 Can you imagine their surprise
when they lifted their heads
 And saw my little ass creepin'
at the foot of the bed

And they knew i was a
 creep since the day i was 
born
 Get poppin' out of momma
like some kettle corn
 And the doctor saw my
head and he started
 freakin'
cause i came out clean and I
 came out creepin'

[Nicki Minaj]
 When I was a girl, I creeped
in the boys locker room
 Hide deep inside, it was my
little creep stalker room

As they dis-robed I was
 oogling and oggling
Little did they know that
 for me they were modeling 

 And i would laugh 
haha haha haha haha
 And they would dance
lala lala lala lala

So pop pop pop you 
 peepers and turn out your
sneakers
 Don't sleep, come on get
ya creep on with me

 Go get ya sweating off ya
bride at her wedding
 Do the creep(haaaa)
 And do the creep(haaaa)

[Nicki Minaj]
But when you sneak into a wake
 and
You see a beefcake
 Do the creep(oooo)
 And do the creep(haaaa)

 When the judge is a hottie
and you can't control ya
 body
Do the creep(haaaa)
And do the creep(haaaa)

[Nicki Minaj]
So get ya knees flexin' and
 yours arms T-rexin'
And creep(oooo)
Do the creep(haaaa)

[John Waters]
And don't forget
 to smile.---Lyrics submitted by veronica.
