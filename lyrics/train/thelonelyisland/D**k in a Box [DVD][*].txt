just 2 normal guys, hanging out, having fun
right guy number 2,yeah guy number 1
E to the S to the P to the N

if my team loses, i'll be mean all night, if you tell me to relax, we'll get in a fight
watching sports with girls is a pain, they dont know the rules, theres no time to explain
single, double, triple, home run
before the celebration, i'll shoot my gun

i also drink whiskey and we smoke cigars

we're real men, and we like sportz, if you say that we're not, then we'll see you in court
im team captain and i chose you
im the other team captain and i chose you too
we steal the ball and we're off to the races
we scare the other team with our mad dog faces like
what what what what what what
what what what what what what
we like sports and we dont care who knows
from the pre game jokes to the wrap up show
we like sports and we dont care who knows
football, football, football
tennis
hockey
golf
throw me the baseball
now toss me the big skin
now feed me the rock
now give me the rock---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
