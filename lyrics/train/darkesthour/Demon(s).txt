You and me, we're the same
Asking for more
More than the numbing existence
Offered us all
What did they say? What did they do?
To make you crawl back in
Despite everything that you've been through
You're still right here
Where I left you
We can lift up our heads to the sky
Find all of those strings that they're pulling
And keep from falling back
In through our own empty posessions 
Turning us into machines

And one of these days we'll no longer betray
Ourselves in anyway
We won't all look the same way down
And one of these days we'll no longer betray
[ Darkest Hour Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ] 
Ourselves in anyway
Then we'll all take the same way out

And all these illusions
Dropped on a sea of believers
Crowding around as they hunt me down
And throw me out
While all the rest of the others
Bang their heads in the trenches

And one of these days we'll no longer betray
Ourselves in anyway
We won't all look the same way down
And one of these days we'll no longer betray
Ourselves in anyway
Then we'll all take the same way out
So don't give up on me
We can be still pretend
This is all just a game
That'll work itself out in the end---Lyrics submitted by william.
