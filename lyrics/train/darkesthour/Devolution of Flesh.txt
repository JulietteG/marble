This is the end, of a sickening tale of life death and repeat
Radiant waves of dissonant ways set forth the halls of refrain

You're a plague, you're a plague
And you feed off the youth but it won't keep you young
You're a plague, you're a plague
And your prophets are gone
And you harbor your share of the blame
Put on the face, again with no hope 

Another day in this solemnest state
Swallows its tail, destroys and creates sinking deepwith the weight of the world
unrelenting and stale

Suffer each day as we've fallen out of hate
And now you've drained every last drop of sincerity

You're a plague, you're a plague
In this mortal world and the next
You're a plague

This is the end of the end of your self absorbed dominion
A new dawn has risen, solitude and its dull light will guide you
through living this day again and again and again

Suffer each day as we've fallen out of hate
And now you've drained every last drop of sincerity
You're a plague, you're a plague
And you feed off the youth but it won't keep you young
You're a plague, you're a plague
and im sick with disgrace
in an age of decay, you're a plague---Lyrics submitted by James.
