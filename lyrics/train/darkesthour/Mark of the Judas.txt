You want to own this
You want to control this
Well I chose an eternity of this
And laugh at the fire
Take all you want and all you need
You never cared what you left of me
Never give what you can't take back
The true mark of the Judas
Never forget
The true mark of the Judas
All my words blinded by piety
And I won't lose myself like you did
Fears-- you want to talk of fears
Well I'm the one who's been hiding
All these years
Too many secrets
Too many lies
I will never be clean again
Too many secrets
Too many lies---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
