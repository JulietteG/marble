[Intro]
Lord, I dedicate this song to you
Thank you for the opportunity to share my gift of song with the world
You created me and this ability I possess to express everything I am and hope
to be through music
I know that without you I'm nothing
And I know in my heart I just wanna say that now and forevre you shall be
Lord of all in my life

[Verse 1]
Maker of the heavens, artist the sea
Creator of the sunshine and the sculptor of me
But still they laugh and mock you
Some don't believe and they fail to realize that you reign eternally

[Chorus]
Lord of all, holy and exalted
you still reign upon the throne
Lord of all, high and lifted up
You shall always be Lord of all

[Verse 2]
There are those who pray to dead idols
Cause they believe that they will come again
But soon they will all bow down and worship the lamb
And proclaim that he is Lord

Messiah, my Lord
Messiah, my Lord
Messiah, my Lord

You shall always be Lord of all
[modulate and repeat 2x]

You shall always be Lord of all ---Lyrics submitted by andi.
