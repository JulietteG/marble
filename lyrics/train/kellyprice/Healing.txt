Chorus:
I need a healing for my soul
So give me a healing for my soul
I need a healing for my soul
So give me a healing for my soul
[Just for my soul, I need healing]

Lord Im looking for a new life that's just for my soul
[Just for my soul I need healing]
Cause Im tired of crying all night just for my soul
[Just for my soul I need healing]

Verse I
Lord I need Thee, Oh I need Thee
To take away this pain an misery
Cause God I just can't do this by myself
I need help Lord

(Chorus)

Verse II
Lord I made some terrible mistakes
Gave my body and my soul away
Now I come to You cause I need to be whole
Heal my soul Lord

(Chorus)

Bridge
I need Healing for me
Thats what I need
Ive been broken hearted
Torn apart but Lord I know that
If I only touch You 
You'll exchange my issues
For Your Virtue
