Ready or not, here I come
 You can't hide, nigga I'm too damn fly
 Sippin' all of this purple, it got me too damn high
 They say they're down for the team but playin' two damn sides
 I'm like niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal
 And these voices in my head saying niggas ain't for you
 And when you gettin money these niggas will aim for you
 And when its looking sunny these niggas will rain on you
 It's a dark cloud over me, money took control of me
 I'm barely getting time to see my son and that shit hurting me
 Baby momma trippin out, I tell her to work with me
 I'm on probabtion still strapped cause niggas want to murder me
 And lately I've been getting faded
 Cut a couple homies off cause them niggas hating
 And all these bitches wanna fuck me cause a nigga made it
 I'm getting paper heart cold as the refrigerator

Young nigga getting money
 Young nigga getting money
 Young nigga go and get it yeah
 And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
 And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

Young rich nigga quarter millie worth of jewels
 Bad bitch with me trying blow me like a fuse
 Just to get a bag or maybe a pair of shoes
 Aint it crazy what your lady would do for a pair of Loubs
 Big dreams turn to big thangs
 Ive been waiting on this day since I was 16
 Big chains, Aston Martin as I switch lanes
 Before I ever made a hit, I had a wrist game
 In the kitchen with them thangs, trying make a killing
 We in the building, every other month I make a million
 Any nigga talking reckless cause they think Im chilling
 'Til I put some money on thier head, yeah, make them feel it
 Have they own homies do him like they never knew him
 I'll have Omelly walk up on him when we run into him
 Close range shorty have him put something through him
 So I hope your ready cause we heavy and we're coming for you

Young nigga getting money
 Young nigga getting money
 Young nigga go and get it yeah
 And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
 And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

The meek shall inherit the earth
 So Ima own this bitch until Im buried in dirt
 I only roll with nigga that'll carry me to my hearse
 Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
 And I dont know why, I just feel like Im the one
 They label me a victim but now look what I become
 Or should I say became, I dont do it for the fame
 Im from where they never make it but I went against the grain
 Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
 Lifes a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
 Niggas getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
 Dodging all the pot holes, jumping all the barriers
 And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy
 Shorty wanna be a star, thats why she popping that pussy
 She trying to win so she hang amongst winners
 Thats why I take the time just to pray at moms dinner
 Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter
 Not the weather, Im talk about within us
 Cause for that money, sins they get committed
 And friends they get to splittin', divided just like division
 So eryday that I wake up, my undivided attention
 It goes to getting that cake up and staying out of the prisons
 The system made me stronger
 And being broke just gave me my hunger
 I'm gone!

Nigga like me I walk around, fear no man
 I don't owe you niggas shit!
 E'ry nigga you see around me
 That's the niggas that's with me, unless they in jail or dead or something
 Nigga livin' life like fuck all you niggas
 Ya feel me?---Lyrics submitted by MASS.
