Okay...
Yeah..
I got a rubber in my pocket and I'm talking like this.

[CHORUS]
Face down, ass up. That's the way, we like to fuck.
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck,
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck.
Face down, ass up. That's the way, we like to fuck.
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck,
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck.

[Meek Mill]
I got all these hoes tryna fuck.
I got pussy on my mind, and got patron all in my cup.
And I got shawty on my line, tryna do the you know what.
And I ain't gotta say no words you know I swerve if you know her.
Cause I don't play. I'm like no way.
I'm killin them hoes, it's 2 on 1.
I take one home, I touch that down.
You take that home, and you gon punt.
Cause yall gon kick it, and I'm bout my business.
When it come to counting them hoes, I got no bitches.
Look, I got my city. Cause I run that shit.
But I want your face down, and your ass up.
And your ass up, and your face down.
She comin up, tryna catch breath.
And I grab her weave, like stay down.
Just breath yall...
Breath hoe...
KOD I'm balling homie, sneaker breath hoe.
Now look, I gotta rubber up in my pocket.
Never slippin, I got it!
Bad bitch she look tropic.
If she fuck me right, then she shopping.
Matter fact I'm lying.
I'm high as fuck like I'm flying.
Got perks off in my system
I tell em hoes when I get up, now put ya....

[CHORUS]
Face down, ass up. That's the way, we like to fuck.
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck,
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck.
Face down, ass up. That's the way, we like to fuck.

Her pussy good.....my dick is gold.
I'm in your hood, I probably fuck your hoe.
These bitches nasty, I need my nuts licked.
These bitches know I got that deep up in your gut, dick.
Face down, with your back arched.
Fingers spread that ass apart.
And I'm deep in, and she leaking.
Buss a couples nuts, then sleep in it.
Don't chu try to runnnnn, where that pussy going?
I eat cray on the weekday. Weekend, her 3 friends.
Got a nigga going out the deep end.
Cause I'm deep in, when I dove in.
And I'm so in, when I go in.
Pussy feeling sumtin like the ocean.
She didn't even let a nigga know when..
You just gonna leave a nigga soaking.
And I'm wit that and I get that.
Finna send another nigga his bitch back..
Hold Up!

Your ass big so throw that.

Couple bad independent women in my section.
You be trickin dollars, I don't even pay attention.
And I do be popping bottles,
And I don't think its a problem.
So just HOLD UP...let me open up with this ganja
Put your face down, ass up.
Oh you think you all that.
I say that we see wassup and play lets see who call who back.
And now you mad, saying that I treat you bad.
Cause when I treat you high,
I treat you and leave you, you'll be needing baths
Now we in Magic and Onix tryna see what's happening.
Trust me, I throw this bag. She buss it like that Peter Pan.
See the plan, come alone or go back home.
And if they act like they don't know, play this muthafucking song!

[CHORUS]
Face down, ass up. That's the way, we like to fuck.
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck,
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck.
Face down, ass up. That's the way, we like to fuck.
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck,
There's some hoes in this house I'm tryna fuck.---Lyrics submitted by todd shelow.
