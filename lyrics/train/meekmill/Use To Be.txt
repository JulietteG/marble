[Hook: Jordanne]
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I used to grind in the dirt
 I used to cry to 'til it hurt
 I will look up to the heavens
 When is my time gonna come
 I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to, be
 Said I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to be

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
 I was never use to niggas that was use to
 Being broke so I started selling coke
 Times got hard was selling soap
 Scheming just like the preacher in church he selling hope
 Now I'm getting older, heart getting colder
 Looking at my son while his head lay on my shoulder
 Thinking in my head will I make it to see him grow up
 Or will I catch a bullet from something these niggas throwing
 Trying to take me out, in the hood trying to make it out
 Niggas plotting on me cops all staking out
 Trying to get a couple bricks so I can make a house
 Close friends hating on me really trying to play me out
 Damn, but niggas couldn't deal with me
 If they had blackjack my shooters would still hit them
 North side of Philly where it's real gritty
 And dirty at where everyday they murder at

[Hook]
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I used to grind in the dirt
 I used to cry to 'til it hurt
 I will look up to the heavens
 When is my time gonna come
 I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to, be
 Said I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to be

 [Verse 2]
 When I was young I started planning it out
 My daddy got killed I was the man of the house
 By the age of 16 man them hammers was out
 So when niggas trying to hit me I'm just handing them out
 Cause I ain't trying to see my mom crying, and my sis mourning
 So I'mma let this little Mac 11 rip on them
 Louis Vuitton sneaks watch the blood drip on them
 For all the times I bled the tears I shed
 Every time I made money it was here I said
 And if my niggas asked for it it was yeah I said
 Selling butter just to get the fam bread I spread
 I got married to the streets and it was here I wed
 Cause I was never use to being what I use to
 Started off walking now the Rolls Royce a coup too
 I'mma let the top down every time I shoot through
 To give them motivation even though I know they hating

[Hook]
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I used to grind in the dirt
 I used to cry to 'til it hurt
 I will look up to the heavens
 When is my time gonna come
 I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to, be
 Said I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to be

[Verse 2]
The man with the gold makes the rules
And one who makes the rules break the rules
 Some niggas make it alive, some make the news
 It's either family or money, I hate to choose
 Cause you need money just to feed the fam, the family keep you cool
 Got a nigga on the papers still I keep the tool
 Niggas heard I'm getting money so they creeping though
 I keep my hand up on that hammer what's for me to do?
 Let these niggas kill me?
 Try to line me up so they can rail me?
 I'm just giving you the real me
 Started with a dollar now I got it and I'm filthy

[Verse 3]
 The man with the gold makes the rules
 And one who makes the rules break the rules
 Some niggas make it alive, some make the news
 It's either family or money, I hate to choose
 Cause you need money just to feed the fam, the family keep you cool
 Got a nigga on the papers still I keep the tool
 Niggas heard I'm getting money so they creeping though
 I keep my hand up on that hammer what's for me to do?
 Let these niggas kill me?
 Try to line me up so they can rail me?
 I'm just giving you the real me
 Started with a dollar now I got it and I'm filthy
 [Hook]
I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I use to be a use to
 I used to grind in the dirt
 I used to cry to 'til it hurt
 I will look up to the heavens
 When is my time gonna come
 I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to, be
 Said I use to be a use to
 But I never got use to
 Being what I use to be---Lyrics submitted by ke.
