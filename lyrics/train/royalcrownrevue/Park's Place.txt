(Mando Dorame/Eddie Nichols)
Arranged by Mando Dorame


There's a place I know
The wise guys go that's Park's Place
Showgirls swing when the chairman sings
At Park's Place-Park's Place
Yes my friends
It's the livin' end
Park's Place
The lights, fights and skirts
Are a sight at Park's Place
Mugs and thugs and big old lugs
Dig Park's Place
Man they really ball at Park's Place


They're high, they're low
They blow their dough
At Park's Place
Man the time flies at Park's Place
Yes my friend it's livin' in Park's Place---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
