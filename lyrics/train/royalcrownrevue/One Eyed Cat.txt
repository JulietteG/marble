You're a one eyed cat, and I know just where you go
Out the back with those deadbeat pals you know
I bet ya's out hanging there by the light of the moon
Licking from a dirty dish and filling your spoon

Cause you're a one eyed cat with a big grin on your face
Yowling and scratching when someone's on your case
Ya nasty little devil don't you know you're going to push too far
Your nine lives sipped away at the corner bar

You're a bad kitty---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
