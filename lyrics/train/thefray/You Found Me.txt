I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
where the west was all but won
all alone smoking his last cigarette
I said where've you been?              
he said ask anything

Where were you?
when everything was falling apart
when all my days spent by the telephone
it never rang and all I needed was a call
it never came from the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
you found me
you found me

Lying on the floor
surrounded
surrounded

Why'd you have to wait?
where were you?
where were you?

Just a little late
you found me
you found me

But in the end everyone ends up alone
losing her, the only one who's ever known
who I am, who I'm not, who I wanna be
no way to know how long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
you found me
you found me

Lying on the floor
surrounded
surrounded

Why'd you have to wait?
where were you? 
where were you?

Just a little late
You found me
you found me

Early morning city breaks
I've been calling for years and years and years and years
and you've never left me no messages
never sent me no letters
you've got some kind of nerve
taking all I want

Lost and insecure
you found me
you found me

Lying on the floor
where were you? 
where were you?

Lost and insecure
you found me
you found me

Lying on the floor
surrounded
surrounded

Why'd you have to wait?
where were you? 
where were you?

Just a little late
You found me
you found me

Why'd you have to wait?
to find me
to find me....---Lyrics submitted by lith.
