Happiness is just outside my window
Would it crash blowing 80-miles an hour?
Or is happiness a little more like knocking
On your door, and you just let it in?

Happiness feels a lot like sorrow
Let it be, you cant make it come or go
But you are gone- not for good but for now
Gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks

Happiness damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself, thats probably enough for now
Happiness has a violent roar

Happiness is like the old man told me
Look for it, but youll never find it all
But let it go, live your life and leave it
Then one day, wake up and shell be home
Home, home, home---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
