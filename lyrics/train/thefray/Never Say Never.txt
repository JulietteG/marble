Somethings we don't talk about,
Rather do without and just hold the smile.
Falling in and out of love,
Ashamed and proud of, together all the while.

You can never say never.
While we don't know when,
But time and time again.
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go.x5

Picture you're queen of everything,
Far as the eye can see, under your command.
I will, be your guardian, when all is crumbling;
I'll steady your hand.

You can never say never,
While we don't know when,
But time time and time again.
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go. x5

We're pulling apart and coming
Together, again and again.
We're growing apart but we pull it together
Pull it together again and again.
Don't let me go. x10---Lyrics submitted by emily.
