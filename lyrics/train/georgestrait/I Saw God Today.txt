Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
Ive been by her side for 18 hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of a sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashing lights, the honking horns
All seemed to fade away
In the shadow of that hospital at 508
I saw God today

Chorus
Ive been to church, Ive read the book
I know hes here but I dont look
Near as often as I should .. yeah I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today.

Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
Man she had that glow
Yeah I couldnt help but notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melted into shades of red.

Chorus
Ive been to church, Ive read the book
I know hes here but I dont look
Near as often as I should .. yeah I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
Shes sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks
Shes got my nose, shes got her mamas eyes
My brand new baby girl
Shes a miracle
I saw God today---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
