[Chorus]
Well, I Do what my heart says do
And Right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tugging' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

I went home flying high
I met the girl of my dreams tonight
A wild fire, screaming' inside
I know it's real 'cause my heart don't lie

[Chorus]
Well, I Do what my heart says do
And Right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tugging' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

Well, here I am knocking on your door
This old hound wants to talk a little more
The T.V.A. and the hoover dam
Don't turn me on like holding your hand

[Chorus]
Well, I Do what my heart says do
And Right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tugging' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

[Chorus]
Well, I Do what my heart says do
And Right now it's pointing at you
Hey girl, you're tugging' on my heart strings
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing

Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing
Well, I've seen everything
I thought I heard my heart sing
Heart sing ---
