I pack up my saddle
Throw it in that two- horse trailer
Back up my truck, hook 'em up 
And drive away
Wont be the first time
But this times the last time
She meant it when she said
That's all I've got to say
Never have been thrown like this before
I ain't her cowboy anymore

Never saw it comin'
But I knew where it was goin'
When she asked how long this time
Before I hit the road
She didn't come right out and say it
But I sure got the message
When I reached out to hold her
That shoulder sure was cold
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course
I ain't her cowboy anymore

[Chorus] 
These white lines are a blur
Like the last few nights I spent with her
I don't know where I went wrong
Or if I did
Like the good ol' boy I am
I told her that I understand
But Lord knows that I wont
Long as I live
Seems lately every time it rains it pours
I ain't her cowboy anymore

We meet in Denver
Settled down in Dallas
The best days of my life
Were the ones I spent with her
You'd think that all that lovin'
Ought to count for something
Guess I wore out my welcome
Like the rowels of these old spurs
That Casper sunsets what I'm shooting for
I ain't her cowboy anymore

[Chorus] 
These white lines are a blur
Like the last few nights I spent with her
I don't know where I went wrong
Or if I did
Like the good ol' boy I am
I told her that I understand
But Lord knows that I wont
Long as I live
Seems lately every time it rains it pours
I ain't her cowboy anymore

Her cowboy anymore
I ain't her cowboy.... anymore---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
