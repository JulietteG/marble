Stranger danger,
Danger stranger
when you gonna follow through?
i'm staking away now, when the rain clouds cover above your house.
still feeling the focus, cause i'm a flames girl!
have i failed to impress you?
cause when in wine, 1 and 4 make 2..
but it's 5!
it's 5!
can i ride with you?
in till the sunset gets away? and we'll get chased by the moon.
OOOOoooooOOoooooOOOO
OOOOoooooOOoooooOOOO
Hope the passion don't fray, inside of that spouse.
will and down changing and cokeing, i'm a changed girl.
Have i failed to impress you?
cause when in wine, 1 and 4 make 2..
But it's 5!
it is 5!---Lyrics submitted by drake.
