Always alone
Someone come for me
Here on my own
Feels like the pain last an eternity
Tears come no more I wanna smile again
Love again
Please someone find me

Souls pass me by
Why can't they see me here
Touch me one time
Just like magic
I wiil reappear
Sadness like the rain it showers over me
I wanna feel again
Please someone find me

Lost not yet found
Breathing in misery
Hope lurks around
When will the Sun ever shine on me
I need love to come and carry me
Take me away
Please someone find me

I'll sing my song
Maybe i'll scream and shout
Please someone come
I don't wanna live without love
Hear my plea
I have love to give
I wanna live
Please someone find me---Lyrics submitted by John.
