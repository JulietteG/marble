See we gotta talk about this situation
Its effecting lives 
It aint right cmon

Lets talk about it
Lets let it be known
Cause if we dont talk about it
Then theyll never pick up a phone

You see everyday a woman cries
For someone in the world to realizes
That she is a victim of her husbands abuse

I dont understand you see
When the system starts to fail 
And the husband leaves the jail
She begins to think that
Telling someone is no use

She can either run or hide
Or stay with him and
Let her kids watch her soul die

I dont understand but
Shes back at that kitchen table
With a cigarette between her lips
And smoke in her eyes
As she cries
With a fresh cup of coffee

Chorus
Can find no peace in a cup of coffee (x3)
Gotta let it go baby 
Can find no peace in a cup of coffee (x3)

She is a soul 
Trapped in a torn body
And the doctor says can you
Please hold still so we can stop the blood flowing

I dont understand I mean
Doesnt it hurt you where
He hit you in your head 
Just inches from your skull
Inches from being dead

I dont understand I mean
Doesnt the pain make you see?
Oh my god hes hurting me

I dont understand and the counsel walks in 
She ask you 
Are you gonna let him go?
But you bite your bottom lips
And the blood shed
And you still say no

Whats that you say?
I gotta stand by my man
Hes doing the best that he can
And the counsel say girl 
You better think again

She tries her best to serve you a cup of tea
To make you will see
But still you ask 
Can I have a fresh cup of coffee?
No 

Chorus
Can find no peace in a cup of coffee (x3)
Gotta let it go baby 
Can find no peace in a cup of coffee (x3)

Your babies crying
Theyre crying mama mama please
Dont die you and you wanna say something
But youre choking up blood
And you wanna say baby please dont cry

And the police they come rushing in
But theyre too late
They ask you question 
But your mind is in a coma state

I dont understand and your ancestors your ancestors are calling 
Theyre calling peace is near 
But the peace you feel is the peace you fear
And once again they saved you
From a life of rage
Given to you by the husband you once loved
Who is now locked in a cage

Now you see now that I do understand
Dont let death or near death 
Be your last resolution
 Dont let coffee be your only solution 
No 

Chorus 
Can find no peace in a cup of coffee (x3)
Gotta let it go baby 
Can find no peace in a cup of coffee (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Tianna.
