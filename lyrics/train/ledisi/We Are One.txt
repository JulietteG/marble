Heaven sent you here for me
Like an angel you rescued me
When I close my eyes I dream of you
We are one

Another lifetime I'm holding you
Those that cam before me
To my last breath know that I love you
We are one

One... Oh, know that we are... one
We are one

Oh, baby... Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Baby we are one

Um, yeah... Oh, you know that we are one
We are one---Lyrics submitted by kerry.
