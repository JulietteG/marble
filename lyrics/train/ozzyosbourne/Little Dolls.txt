Wrything and screaming the pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy.
Your image in his hands it's useless to try
Escaping his curses.
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls.
Tortured and flaming you give birth to hell
Living a nightmare.
It's a pity you'll pray for your death
But he's in no hurry.
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls.
No where to run - your fate is in his hands
Your time has come - you'll live to his command
I'm warning you - the worst is yet to come
The killer who - remains a mystery
I that believe in the stories of old - would never fight it.
Demons and curses that play on our soul
Like something ignited.
You never imagined such a fate could follow you
(You never thought it was true)
And when it's your time I wonder how you'll do
Your kind of trouble's running deeper than the sea
You broke the world
You've been a fool
The little doll is you yeah!
No where to run - your fate is in his hands
Your time has come - you'll live to his command
I'm warning you - the worst is yet to come
The killer who - remains a mystery
Wrything and screaming the pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy.
Your image in his hands it's useless to try
Escaping his curses.
No where to run - your fate is in his hands
Your time has come - you'll live to his command
I'm warning you - the worst is yet to come
The killer who - remains a mystery---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
