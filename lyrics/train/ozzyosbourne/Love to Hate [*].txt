Another day and more bad news
I wonder who died today
I feel so numb I might as well be dead

I live on hope and legal dope
Addicted to the system
Is it real or does it just live within my head

I guess they lied to make me feel afraid
I cant believe a single word they say

Cry another tear
'Cause the devil will not wait
Living in fear
Why do people love to hate
Love to hate

Desensitized and victimized
The action never stops
Could it be a smokescreen to keep us satisfied

Insecure and paranoid
Im trying to survive
I cant tell if Im hearing truth or lies

Ill never make it to the Holy Gates
No ones gonna matter, the fire of hell awaits

Cry another tear
'Cause the devil will not wait
Living in fear
Why do people love to hate

[SOLO]

Another day and more bad news
I wonder who died today
I cant tell if Im hearing truth or lies

I guess they lied to make me feel afraid
I cant believe a single word they say

Cry another tear
'Cause the devil will not wait
Living in fear
Why do people love to hate

Cry another tear
'Cause the devil will not wait
Living in fear
Why do people love to hate
Love to hate---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
