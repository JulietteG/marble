Thoughts about you just wont let me sleep at night
Blinded by obsession and despair
All you are is just synthetic paradise
Steal my love from me without a prayer

The euphoria rushes through my veins
The eternal possession driving me insane
I must be dreaming

Im running fast but getting nowhere
I see the light but I never get there
I hope I wake when the morning gets here
Your love is like a nightmare

Feed me lies and cover with a smile of grace
Promise me the truth and I'll be saved
Take away the pain and make my heart be brave
Comfort me forever, Im your slave

I know there will be a price to pay
I'll feel the guilt tomorrow but I'm numb today
I'm dreaming

Im running fast but getting nowhere
I see the light but I never get there
I hope I wake when the morning gets here
Your love is like a nightmare

[SOLO]

I'm running fast but getting nowhere
I see the light but I never get there
I hope I wake when the morning gets here
Your love is like a nightmare

Im running fast but getting nowhere
I see the light but I never get there
I hope I wake when the morning gets here
Your love is like a nightmare---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
