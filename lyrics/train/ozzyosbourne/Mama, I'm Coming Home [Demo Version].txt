Times have changed
And times are strange
Here I come, but I ain't the same
Mama, I'm coming home

Times gone by
Seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me
Mama, I'm coming home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

You made me cry
You told me lies
But I can't stand to say goodbye
Mama, I'm coming home

I could be right
I could be wrong
It hurts so bad it's been so long
Mama, I'm coming home

Selfish love, yeah we're both alone
The ride before the fall, yeah
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
I've just got to have it all

I've seen your face a hundred times
Every day we've been apart
And I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
Cause Mama, Mama, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

I've seen your face a thousand times
Every day we've been apart
And I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
Cause Mama, Mama, I'm coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
