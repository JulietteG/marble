Yesterday has been and gone,
Tomorrow will I find a song,
Oh will it rain...

Everybody's having fun,
Except me I'm the lonely one,
I live in shame.

I said, hey!
Goodbye to romance - Yeah,
Goodbye to friends,
I tell ya..
Goodbye to all the best,
I guess that we'll meet,
We'll meet in the end.

I've been the king,
I've been the clown,
Now open wings can't hold me down,
I'm free again.

The jester with the broken crown,
It won't be me this time around,
To love in vain.

I said, hey!
Goodbye to romance - Yeah,
Goodbye to friends,
I tell ya..
Goodbye to all the best,
I guess that we'll meet,
We'll meet in the end.

And I feel the time is right,
Although I know that you just might say to me,
What did you go and do?
What did you go and do?

But I have to take this chance,
Goodbye...
To friends and to romance,
And to all of you,
And to all of you.

Come on now....(Randy Rhodes solo)

I say hey!
Goodbye to romance - Yeah,
Goodbye to friends,
I tell ya...
Goodbye to all the best,
I guess that we'll meet,
We'll meet in the end.

And the weather's looking fine,
And I think the sun will shine,
Again...

And I feel I've cleared my mind,
All the past is left behind,
Again....

I say hey!
Goodbye to romance - Yeah,
Goodbye to friends,
I tell ya...
Goodbye to all the best,
I guess that we'll meet,
We'll meet in the end.---Lyrics submitted by Annalee.
