ALL ABOOOOOAAAARRD HAHAHAHAHAHA...
AY AY AY AY AY...
Crazy, but thats how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe its not to late
To learn how to love
And forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds not healing
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeah-h yeeeeaaaahhhh

GUITAR SOLO!!!!!!!!!!

Heirs of a cold war
Thats what we've become
Inheriting troubles I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and whats to blame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train...---Lyrics submitted by Merrilee.
