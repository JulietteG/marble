Silver screen such a disgrace 
I couldn't look her straight in the face 
A foolish picture I live in disgust 
Degradation being eaten by lust 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
Inspiration that's blue and uncut 
Can't kick the habit obsession of smut 
Voyeur straining in love with his hand 
A poison passion a pulsating gland 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
(wait 1/2) 
Flaps 
(solo, 1) 
I shouldn't do it the guilt tells me why 
I just can't stop I try and I try 
X rated demon that lives in my head 
Hungry for bodge and he wants to be fed 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
(1) 
No No, No bone movies 
No No, No bone movies 
No No, No bone movies 
(with ad lib No's) 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies 
No bone movies
