Im an average man
with an average life
i work from nine to five
and how I paythe price
I just wanna be left alone
in my average home.
but what do I always feel
Like Im in the twilight all night

I always feel like somebodys watching me
and I have no privacy.
I always feel like somebodys watching me
Tell me is it just a dream.

When I can home at night
I pulled the door on tide
People call me on the phone
I'm trying to avoid.
But can the people on tv
see me or I just are paranoid 

When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair.
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there.
People say I'm crazy I'm just a little touched.
but Maybe shouts remind me of cyco too much cause

I always feel like somebodys watching me
and I have no privacy.
I always feel like somebodys watching me
Tell me that its just a dream.

I always feel like somebodys watching me
and I have no privacy.
I always feel like somebodys watching me
and I just wanna trick someone.---Lyrics submitted by MennaMohamed.
