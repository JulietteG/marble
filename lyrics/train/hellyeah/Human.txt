I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
Because I'm broken, flawed and human
Human! Human! Hu...

You drove the stake in my worst mistake
Now I'm the one left alone
Brought out the evil that's the devil in me
And now I'm on my own inside the dark unknown
You told the lie you believed in me
Lights dimming low lost the glow
You are the sin and so sinister
I'm just the soul you owe
The who you left unwhole

I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
Because I'm broken, flawed and just human
Heaven's sake is forsaken
Didn't create all creation
I've designed my undoing
Because I'm broken, flawed and just human

You were the anger in all my danger
Old habits keep me this cold
You killed the light that enlightened me
My ark of dark afloat, now I've lost all my hope
The spoiled child among all the children
The troll controlling me
You are the ire that fueled my fire
Stab my stability, I'm my worst enemy

I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
Because I'm broken, flawed and just human
Heaven's sake is forsaken
Didn't create all creation
I've designed my undoing
Because I'm broken, flawed and just human

I defy your defiance
It's all lies in alliance
I've been damaged, left in ruin
Because I'm broken, flawed and just human
Heaven's sake is forsaken
Didn't create all creation
I've designed my undoing
Because I'm broken, flawed and just human
Human! Humaaa...---
