You pray for quiet,
Inside your head the screams won't silence;
I remember those days...
The terror that's the home;
The fear that's in your bones,
It just won't go away...
No...

The strangle holds, the insulting names,
The wound up shirt around his fist;
The nose to nose, beer-stinking breath.
Thrown down onto the floor,
So battered, bruised and sore
Thrown down onto the bed,
And thrash until you break your neck

Hell's where I was born! Hell's where I was raised,
This hell is where I'm from and this hell is where I'll stay.
The hush is all I need to hush the misery;
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside a dream
Just be still and pray
And let the noise just fade away.

Retain to violence;
Locks up your heart like a secret closet,
So no one can penetrate...
You just can't stand the touch;
Affection weighs too much,
You push everyone away
From...

The reckoning,
The venom stings,
Whipped so bad I pissed myself;
Still wear the beatings from that belt
If this reminds you of home,
You better know you're not alone
Hold the gun up to my head,
I'll pull the trigger on myself!

Hell's where I was born! Hell's where I was raised,
This hell is where I'm from and this hell is where I'll stay.
The hush is all I need to hush the misery;
The hush that belongs to me,
Like the hush inside a dream
Just be still and pray

These are the memories in me
You didn't wanna know!
You didn't wanna know!
These are the memories we keep
We don't wanna show!
We don't wanna show!
But now at least you know, you're not alone

Hush is all I need, hush the misery;
Hush belongs to me, like the hush inside a dream
Hell's where I was born! Hell's where I was raised,
This hell is where I'm from and this hell is where I'll stay
The hush is all I need to hush the misery;
The hush that belongs to me,
Like the hush inside a dream
Just be still and pray...
And let the noise just fade away...---
