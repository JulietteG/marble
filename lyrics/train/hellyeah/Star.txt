Oh,the way you move
the way you move me
makes me feel alive 

Oh, the way you look
the way you look at me
sends chills up my spine,yeah

I found my star
that star is you

Oh, the way you touch
the way you touch me 
makes me feel alive 

Oh, the way you melt me 
when we melt together
melt into my eyes

I found my star
that star is you
I found my star 

I love the way you do me, just like you do
just like you do 

My angel 
My anger
My star

I found my star
that star is you
I found my star
that star is you 

I found my star
that star is you

YOU'RE MY STAR!---Lyrics submitted by frances.
