Slam!

Cant touch this, we rule it with a clenched fist,
On, top fuel with a death grip
Judged, by a weak little man with a pen in his hand and just doesnt fucking get it
Own, couldnt stop us if you wanted to
School, breaking knuckles with a ruler,
Done, no more, emergence, to dominate you

Run, hide, your time is coming
Hunt, find, walking a fine line
Run, hide, my time is coming
Hunt, find, its just a matter of time

Talk your shit, and get some balls to back it
Plague, HELLYEAH coming with a vengeance
Victim, by a weak little man with a gun in his hand and I dont fucking get it
Sick, livid and my stomach aches
Rage, boiling over, full of hate
Weak, worthless, spineless and were coming for you

Run, hide, your time is coming
Hunt, find, walking a fine line
Run, hide, my time is coming
Hunt, find, Its just a matter of time

Just like a storm rolling over,
Rebellion is rising, blazing the steeds,
Dont Fire until you see the whites of their eyes,
Burned at the stake within me,

Warhead, payback, settle the score

Run hide, your time is coming,
Hunt, find, walking a fine line,
Run hide, my time is coming
Hunt find, Its just a matter of run hide---Lyrics submitted by maggie.
