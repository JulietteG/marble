I was looking in the mirror last night and I don't like what I see.
Looking at the reflection but I don't like what's looking at me.
Too light or too dark or
too big or too small.
Always pulling out the measuring stick and forever coming up short.

Don't be ashamed for God has arranged,
worth more than a billionare,excusively engineered.

Nobody is a nobody.
God doesn't make mistakes.
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exsist in faith
We all may fall.
Some may stall.
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes.

All in all, God doesn't make mistakes.

I was looking at the tv last night and everyone's better than me.

Big car.
Big house.
Big dreams.

Things my life won't see.

Too shy or bold.
Too nice or too cold.
Always looking at a half empty glass and always coming up last.

Don't be ashamed for God has arranged,
worth more than a billionare,excusively engineered.

Nobody is a nobody.
God doesn't make mistakes.
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exsist in faith
We all may fall.
Some may stall.
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes.

All in all, God doesn't make mistakes.

Spread your wings!

Lift your head and pray!

You will win!

Believe you will get it, get it!

Nobody is a nobody.
God doesn't make mistakes.
Nobody ever takes a place that doesn't exsist in ways.
We all may fall.
Some may stall.
But all in all God doesn't make mistakes.(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Semariah.
