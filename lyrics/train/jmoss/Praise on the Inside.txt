There's a praise on the inside 
That I can't keep to myself
A holler stirring up 
From the depths of my soul
So excuse me if I seem a little giddy
Or maybe even strange
But praise is the way I say thanks

There's a praise on the inside
That I can't keep to myself
A holler stirring up
From the depths of my soul
So excuse me if I seem a little giddy
Or maybe even strange
Praise is the way I say thanks

Let it bring forth the sound
From your heart, filled with gladness
All ye lands make a joyful noise
Let the songs of David live forever
Because praise is the way I say thanks

Praise is the way we say thanks
There's a praise on the inside 
That I can't keep to myself
A holler stirring up 
From the depths of my soul
So excuse me if I seem a little giddy
Or maybe even strange
But praise is the way I say thanks
(repeat)

Let it bring forth the sound
From your heart, filled with gladness
All ye lands make a joyful noise
Let the songs of David live, forever
Praise is the way I say thanks
(repeat)

There's a praise on the inside
I can't keep to myself
A holler from the gut....
