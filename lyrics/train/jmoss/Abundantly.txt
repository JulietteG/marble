Verse 1:
It would like the sky that's never sunny
It would like the bee that can't make honey
Maybe like the falling snow that never melts
Like always hearing of Your touch, but never felt
It's like the vest that holds no flowers

Chorus:
Never wanna sleep without you
Never wanna wake without you
Never wanna part with life 
Abundantly
Never take a chance without you
Cuz, I always do my best without you
I never wanna leave this life
Abundantly

Verse 2:
It would be like the game that has no winner
Like knowing love's behind the door, but can not enter
Like knowing joy's in the morning, but never comes
What life would be like if God didn't sent His Son
It's kinda like a heart with no love flowing through it.
