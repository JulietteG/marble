if i were a drummer i would use my symbols
if i were a writer i would use a pencil
i would use my voice if i were a singer
no matter who or what we are we must praise


if i was a doctor i would use my research
a prolific dissertation if i was a speaker 
i would use my hands if i were a potter
no matter who or what we are we must praise

let the people of god bless him 
let it ring with love and truth
with our gifts we exalt the 
merciful wonderful god
{real sweet}
we must praise


if i were an eagle i would use my wings
since I'm a believer i use every thing
make a joyful noise{unto the lord} all ye people
no matter who or what we are we must praise

let the people of god bless him
let it ring with love and truth
with our gifts we exalt the
merciful wonderful god 

praise his holy holy name(5 times)
with our gifts we exalt the
merciful wonderful god
we must praise

oh hallelujah ooh glory
ooh holy of holy
the bread of life god
ooh meat of hunger lord
water of thirst lord 
we magnify you
we thank for what you've done
what your doing god and what your going to do
no matter who or what we are we must praise---Lyrics submitted by destiny.
