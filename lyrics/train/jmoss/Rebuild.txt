Spoken: Have You Ever been broken

J Moss
Lord rebuild me(2x)
For Ive taken what Youve made & thrown its value away
Oh Lord, wont You rebuild me

Spoken: Give Me One More Chance

J Moss & Background
Lord rebuild me(2x)
For weve taken what Youve made & thrown its value away
Oh Lord, rebuild me

Theres that piece of Love
Theres that piece of Joy
Theres that piece of Righteousness oh my soul make it whole again
Theres that piece of Hope
Theres that piece of Faith
Theres that piece of Happiness oh my soul 
God rebuild again
(Repeat All Background & J Moss & Background)

J Moss While Background Repeat Bless My Soul(13x)
Bless my soul
Please, wont You do it
Ive lost some things
My heart is broken
Wont You fix me Jesus
Wont You fix me Lord
I cant do without Ya
Search me, Cleanse me, Wash me
I need, I need it
I wont let go til You bless my soul
Rebuild Again

J Moss
Fix Me Jesus
Put Me Back Together Again
Fearfully & Wonderfully Made
At the fruit of my lips Ill always exert Your praise---Lyrics submitted by Shaunte.
