Sittin here think 'bout times 
I thought I wasn't gon' make it 
Times I should've been dead 
And been gone But God felt different 
But I'm still all because of His goodness 
I'm a living witness miracles still fall from heaven

He moves when we don't expect Him to 
He knows the doors that we face 
And He speaks right before we stop believin 
He shows His love through his grace

I'll praise Him in the sanctuary 
I'll praise Him with the tremble and dance 
I'll praise Him with the trumpet and symbol 
Since I'm breathin, I'm goin praise Him again

Sittin here think 'bout times 
I thought I wasn't goin' make it 
Times I should've been dead 
And been gone But God felt different 
But I'm still all because of His goodness 
I'm a living witness miracles still fall from heaven

He moves when we don't expect Him to 
He knows the doors that we face 
And He speaks right before we stop believin 
He shows His love through his grace

I'll praise Him in the sanctuary 
I'll praise Him with the tremble and dance 
I'll praise Him with the trumpet and symbol 
Since I'm breathin, I'm gon praise Him again

I'll praise Him in the sanctuary 
I'll praise Him with the tremble and dance 
I'll praise Him with the trumpet and symbol 
Since I'm breathin, I'm gon praise Him again

I'll praise Him in the sanctuary 
I'll praise Him with the tremble and dance

Since I'm breathin, I'm goin praise Him again 

I'll praise Him in the sanctuary 
I'll praise Him with the tremble and dance 
I'll praise Him with the trumpet and symbol
