Why are you selling dreams of who you wish you could be 
A prince in all of the magazines 
They'd have no words for the man I've seen 
Talk real fast 'fore they see your face 

And would they love you if they knew all the things we know 
We've got these images 
We need them to be true 
Not ready to believe we're no more insecure than you 

[Chorus:]
But then there're girls like me who sit appauled by what we've seen 
We know the truth about you 
Now you're the prince of all the magazines 
That is a dangerous thing 

But would they love you if they knew all the things that we know 
Those Golden Boys 
All a fraud don't believe their show 
Would they love you if they knew all the things that we know 

Golden Boy life ain't a video 

Place you in these robes and tell you you're the greatest man 
And you believe and play your cards 
Got dealt a winning hand 
Don't you get tired of the show 
The kissin' ass of all the people that you wanna know 

When I was young I thought you had it won 
I saw you on T.V. you made life look fun 
But then years go by and people grow 
I realize it's all a freak show 

[Chorus]

Girls like me don't need no bubblin' mindstate thrown in my face 
The way you goin' ain't gonna be no stroll in the sunshine 
Can't turn it back now baby you gone and past that line 
So give it on up now 
What you gonna do 

[Chorus]
