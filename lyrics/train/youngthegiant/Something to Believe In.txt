It gets old when you talk to the sun
In a tongue understood by no one
Can it be that I hear what he's saying?
Is there a reason why I'm still awake?

And he says, "I've got you written in a black book by the railroad track. You see, I know your fate."
(Ooh)
And I say, "you've got to listen, I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate."

I'll give you something to believe in
Burn up a basement full of demons
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Now give me something to believe in
Just give me...
Just give me something to believe in

Everyday when I speak to the moon
Pale as a ghost in the afternoon
Tragedy has a hold of my mind
But I can see the light between the lines

And I say, "you've got to listen, I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate."

I'll give you something to believe in
Burn up a basement full of demons
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Now give me something to believe in

Promise me
So afraid
I'm a slave to my mind
You give me something to believe in

"I've got you written in a black book by the railroad track. You see, I know your fate."
(Ooh)
And I say, "you've got to listen, I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate."

I'll give you something to believe in
Burn up a basement full of demons
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Just give me something to believe in
Just give me...
Just give me something to believe in---
