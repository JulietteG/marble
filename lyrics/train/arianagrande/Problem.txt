IGGY: 
Uh huh, it's Iggy Iggz 
I got one more problem with you girl 
Aye 

ARIANA: 
 Hey baby even though I hate ya 
I wanna love ya 
I want you you you 
And even though I can't forgive ya 
I really want to 
I want you you you 

Tell me, tell me baby 
Why did you leave me 
Cause even though I shouldn't want it 
I gotta have it 
I want you you you 

Head in the clouds 
got no weight on my shoulders 
I should be wiser 
and realise that I've got 

BIG SEAN: 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 

ARIANA: 
I know your never gonna wake up 
I gotta give up 
But it's you you you 
I know I shouldn't ever call back 
Or let you come back 
But it's you you you 
Every time you touch me 
And say you love me 
I get a little bit breathless 
I shouldn't want it 
But it's you you you 

Head in the clouds 
got no weight on my shoulders 
I should be wiser 
and realise that I've got 

BIG SEAN: 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 

IGGY: 
It's Iggy Iggz, uh 
What you got? 
Smart money bettin 
I'll be better off without you 
In no time 
I'll be forgettin' all about you 
You saying that you know 
But I really really doubt you 
Understand my life is easy 
When I ain't around you 
Iggy Iggy 
Too biggie to be here stressing 
I'm think I love the thought of you 
More than I love your presence 
And the best thing now 
Is probably for you to exit 
I let you go 
Let you back 
I finally learned my lesson 
No half-stepping 
Either you want it or you just keep playin' 
I'm listening to you knowin' 
I can't believe what you're sayin' 
Theres a million you's baby boy 
So don't be dumb 
I got 99 problems 
But you won't be one 
Like what! 

ARIANA: 
One less, one less problem 
One less, one less problem 

Head in the clouds 
got no weight on my shoulders 
I should be wiser 
and realise that I've got 

BIG SEAN: 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 

One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem ---
