Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you-u-u
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to
I want you-u-u
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why did you leave me
Cuz even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you-u-u

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem) 2x

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up but it's you-u-u
I know I should've never call back
Or let you come back but it's you-u-u
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I should've want it but it's you-u-u

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem) 2x

It's Iggy Iz
Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgetting all about you
You saying that you know but I really really doubt 
You understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin' 
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's, baby boy
So don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one 
Like what

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem) 3x---Lyrics submitted by Mari.
