La la, la la
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now Im popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompons
Now youre working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause Im putting down my story in a popular song
Said Im putting down my story in a popular song

[Chorus:]
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
You were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I dont know
Now youre in the front row
Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
Its not about who you are or your fancy car
Youre only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
Thats all you ever need to know

Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go

Always on the lookout for someone to hate,
Picking on me like a dinner plate
Id hid during classes, and in between them
Dunk me in the toilets, now its you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the shit you do
It aint so funny when the jokes on you
Uh, the jokes on you
And everyones laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
How come you look so cool?
Cause thats the only thing that Ive learned at school
So thats the only thing Ive learned at school

[Chorus:]
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
You were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I dont know
Now youre in the front row
Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
Its not about who you are or your fancy car
Youre only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
Thats all you ever need to know
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go

Before the next time that you calling him crazy
Lazy, a faggot, or that fugazi
Heres the one thing thats so amazing
It aint a bad thing to be a loser, baby!

All you ever need to know
Youre only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
Youre only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
Its not about who you are or your fancy car
Youre only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you.
Thats all you ever need to know---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa Boyer.
