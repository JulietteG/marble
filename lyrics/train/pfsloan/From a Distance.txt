Have you ever heard a lonely church bell ring
Have you ever heard a crying angel sing
From a distance from a distance you can hear a crying angel sing
Oh she's crying for the sadness tomorrow sins may bring
Have you ever seen a star fall from the sky
From a distance it looks just like heaven's lost an eye
From a distance from a distance looks like heaven's lost
an eye
It's a chance for God to see you and I
Faith my friend is hard to recognize
When you're traveling all alone in the night
Have you ever wondered just how tall is tall
From a distance the highest building still looks very small
From a distance from a distance the highest building still looks small
Oh you can't measure anyone or anything at all
Faith my friend is hard to recognize
When youre traveling all alone in the night 
Have you ever heard a lonely church bell ring
Have you ever heard a crying angel sing
From a distance from a distance you can hear a crying angel sing
Oh she's crying for the sadness 
tomorrow's sins may bring---Lyrics submitted by Ellen Heacock.
