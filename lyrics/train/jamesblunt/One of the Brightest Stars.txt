One day your story will be told,
One of the lucky ones, whos made his name

One day theyll make you glorius,
Beneath the lights of your deserved fame. 
And it all comes round once in life a lifetime like it always does
Everybody loves you cause youve taken a chance out on a dance to the moon, too soon

And as they'll say told you so, we were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

One day theyll tell you that youve changed 
Though theyre the ones who seem who to stop and stare
One day youll hope to make the grave, before the papers threws to send you there. 

And it all comes round once in a lifetime like it always does,
Nobody loves you cause youve taken the chance out on a dance to the moon, too soon

And they'll told you so, we were the ones who saw you first of all,
we always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

And they'll say told you so, we were the ones who saw you first of all,
we always knew that you were one of the brightest stars---Lyrics submitted by Caio Almeida de Souza.
