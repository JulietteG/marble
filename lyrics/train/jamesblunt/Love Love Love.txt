I'm not looking for us
And neither should you.
Absolutely gorgeous,
Then nothing I say is true.
You won't find yourself
In these guilty eyes

'Cause I love anybody who's fool enough to believe
And you're just one of many who broke their heart on me
And so I say I don't love you,
Though it kills me
It's a lie that sets you free.

Love, love, love
I can't take your
Love, love, love

And so I say I don't love you,
Though it kills me
It's a lie that sets you free.

I will wrap my body
In other women's arms.
Make love in a hurry,
Feel better than I am.
Hope you find yourself
In someone else's eyes

'Cause I love anybody who's fool enough to believe
And you're just one of many who broke their heart on me
And so I say I don't love you,
Though it kills me
It's a lie that sets you free.

Love, love, love
I can't take your
Love, love, love

And so I say I don't love you

'Cause I love anybody who's fool enough to believe (Love, love, love)
And you're just one of many who broke their heart on me (Love, love, love)
And so I say I don't love you, (Love, love, love)
Though it kills me
'Cause it's a lie

'Cause I love anybody who's fool enough to believe (Love, love, love)
And you're just one of many who broke their heart on me (Love, love, love)
And so I say I don't love you, (Love, love, love)
Though it kills me
It's a lie that sets you free. ---Lyrics submitted by bak.
