So while turning in my sheets
And once again I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go

Hello hello
There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but
My heart is heavy does it show
I lose the track that loses me
So here I go

Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh

And so I sent some men to fight
And one came back at dead of night
Said hed seen my enemy
Said he looked just like me
So i set out to cut myself
And here I go

Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh

Im not calling for a second chance
Im screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason but dont give me choice
cause Ill just make the same mistake again

Oh ooooh

And maybe someday we will meet
And maybe talk and not just speak
Dont buy the promises cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go

Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh

Im not calling for a second chance
Im screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason but dont give me choice
cuz Ill just make the same mistake 

Im not calling for a second chance
Im screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason but dont give me choice
cuz  Ill just make the same mistake again

Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh
Oh ooooh

Oh ooooh
So while turning in my sheets
Oh ooooh
And once again I cannot sleep
Oh ooooh
Walk out the door and up the street
Oh ooooh
Look at the stars 
Oh ooooh
Look at the stars fall down
Oh ooooh
And wonder where
Oh ooooh
Did I go wrong---Lyrics submitted by Lori R.
