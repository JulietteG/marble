And the souls were left resting
As they gathered up the crowd
No one was left guessing
No one was proud

And they saw him on the bridge
With his head in both his hands
No one wanted to startle him
'Cause it was a long way to land

And we're all in this together
And I won't get out lost
And they'll call you up and tell you
That I once loved

I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever

Delicate and fragile you always were
Like china in his hands
And broken pieces were lined up
Forever left in these wounds by this man

And we know that you never wanted to hurt her
We know you had another plan
Believing a story without an ending
Left you a bitter man

And we're all in this together
And I won't get out lost
And they'll call you up and tell you
That I once survived

I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever

We're all in this
We're in this one together (In this one together)

And we're all in this together
And I won't get out lost
And they'll call you up and tell you
That I once survived
That I once survived
That I once survived---Lyrics submitted by Arno Knito.
