You know me and my woman, we been going thru alot of changes 
for about six months or so.
It's been real hard to talk to one another.
You know relationship ain't nothing without commmunication.
How we were laying in bed the both of us looking at the same overhead.
Eyes wide open about three o'clock in the morning.
I said, " Baby, we can't go on this way." She said, "you right."
I said, "I know you love me and I love you." Then we start holding each other.
I felt the tear roll down my face...
Last night...me and my woman...we cried...cried..together...

   CHORUS:
Said we cried...(cry) cried...(cry) cried...(cry)......
We cried together....Oh..oh...

Ain't nothing wrong with you...no. There ain't nothing wrong with me...uh uhn.
We not the only people in the world who go thru ups and downs.
All we have to do is talk. We can work it out...
Oh...let me kiss your eyes...let me wipe yo tears away.
Let me hold you tight. Tomorrow will feel better cause it's a brand new day.
Aww last night...me and my woman...we cri...ed together...
CHORUS 

Now we have times when we laugh hardy...we even go out on the town and we 
party, party, party...
Everyday the sun doesn't shine, sometimes it has to rain. 
Just like we enjoy the pleasure...we have to stand the pain.
Let me kiss your eyes...let me wipe your tears away.
Oh let me hold you close...let's talk to each other. I wanna hear what you got to say...
Oh...last night, sweet last night...me and my woman...we cri...ed together...


And then we---Lyrics submitted by WILLIAM.
