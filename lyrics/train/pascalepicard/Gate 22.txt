I wont try to argue now
Anyway I feel theres nothing I could say
To ease your mind
Maybe theres nothing exciting outside
But round here Im just wasting my time
Spinning round on nothing new
When I close my eyes I remember that kiss
Id rather keep them wide open
And if I miss that train do you really think
That even here, Id be closer to you

So here I am leaving soon and
Im standing at gate 22
Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know Im still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know Ill keep hanging on. Sweet memories
Im leaving but my mind will surely stay
At gate 22

Theres too many dreams I must chase down
Though sometimes I bite off more than I can chew
I know youd like to keep me near
I know its easier to be two
But I cant plan my life all around you
Im weaker than Ill let you know
So dont ask me to jump this wall
From here it looks too tall
Two people kissing goodbye facing a door
A classic picture were all tired of

So here I am leaving soon and
Im standing at gate 22
Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know Im still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know Ill keep hanging on. Sweet memories
Im leaving but my mind will surely stay

And I already see the picture of that day
When youll say youll wait for me
And Ill pretend just then to believe you
Ill send you postcards for a few weeks and then
Another perfect moment at the wrong time
But the timing is always wrong

Here I am leaving soon and
Im standing at gate 22
Cause whatever you may think I forgot
You know Im still thinking about it
Sometimes I wish I could stay
But no matter where I go, no matter how long
You know Ill keep hanging on. Sweet memories
Im leaving but my mind will surely stay
At gate 22---Lyrics submitted by Ngu.
