Its been a long road, getting from there to here.
Its been a long time, but my time is finally near.
I can feel the change in the wind right now, nothings in my way
And there not gonna hold me down no more, no there not gonna hold me down.

(CHORUS)
Cos ive got faith of the heart, im goin where my heart will take me, 
Ive got faith to believe I can do anything.
Ive got strength of the soul, no ones gonna bend or break me.
I can reach any star
Ive got faith 
Ive got faith
faith of the heart

Its been a long night, im trying to find my way.
Through the darkness, now ive finally had my day.
Now I feel my dreams come alive at last, I will touch the sky.
And there not gonna hold you down no more, no there not gonna change my mind.

(CHORUS)..................
I've known a wind so cold and seen the darkest days 
But now the winds I'm feeling are only  winds of change
I've been through the fire and I've been through the rains
But I'll be fine oh oh whoa oh
(CHORUS)
......its been a long road............---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
