My ladies! 
Ha, ha, ha, ha 
You know you gotta run away 
With me to the islands 
HA! 
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa 
My sugar cane 
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa 
Sugarcane 

She said she's tired of the city life 
Says she wants a simple life 
Tell me she she need me 
Want to settle down and be my wife 
Introduce her to the island life 
She says it everything that she likes 
We bought some fruits from the fruit stand 
Roots from the roots man 
Coconut water well we get it from the jelly man 
She had a piece of my sugarcane 
From then she hasn't been the same 

She says 
No bright lights no fame 
Hey! 
Caviar or champagne 
She wanna be a plain old Jane 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 
It ain't hard to explain 
How this girl rocks my brain 
She likes being a plain old Jane 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 

Girl there ain't no substitute 
Don't you worry about the loot 
Wanna be a mommy ripe and ready for a couple youths 
Forever on this island cruise 
Tell me baby how can we lose? 
She love the ackee and the salt fish 
Yam from the market 
Sweet cocoa tea or some real hot chocolate 
But when she taste my sugar cane from then she hasn't been the same 

She says 
No bright lights no fame 
Hey! 
Caviar or champagne 
She wanna be a plain old Jane 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 
It ain't hard to explain 
How this girl rocks my brain 
She likes being a plain old Jane 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 

She says 
No bright lights no fame 
Hey! 
Caviar or champagne 
She wanna be a plain old Jane 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 
It ain't hard to explain 
How this girl rocks my brain 
She likes being a plain old Jane 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane 
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa 
She likes the taste of my sugar cane---
