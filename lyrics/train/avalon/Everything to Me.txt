I grew up in Sunday school,
I memorized the Golden Rule,
And how Jesus came
To set the sinner free...
I know the story inside-out,
And I can tell you all about
The path that led Him up
To Calvary...
But ask me why He loves me,
And I don't know what to say -
But I'll never be the same,
Bacause He changed my life when He became...

(CHORUS)
Everything to Me -
He's more than a story,
More than words on a page of history
He's the Air that I breathe,
The Water I thirst for,
And the Ground beneath my feet --
He's Everything...
Everything to Me...

We're living in uncertain times,
And more and more, I find
That I'm aware of just
How fragile life can be...
I want to tell the world I've found
A love that turned my life around -
They need to know
That they can taste and see...
Now every day, I'm praying
Just to give my heart away
I want to live for Jesus
So that someone else might see that He is...

(CHORUS)
Everything to Me -
He's more than a story,
More than words on a page of history
He's the Air that I breathe,
The Water I thirst for,
And the Ground beneath my feet --
Oh, He's Everything...

And looking back over my life at the end,
I'm gonna meet You,
Saying You've been
Everything to Me -
You're more than a story,
More than words on a page of history...

(CHORUS)
You're Everything to Me -
You're more than a story,
More than words on a page of history
You're the Air that I breathe,
The Water I thirst for,
And the Ground beneath my feet --
You're Everything...
Lord, You're Everything to Me...

Everything to Me...
You're Everything to Me, Jesus...
Everything to Me...
The Air I breathe, the Song I sing...
Oh-oh...
Everything to Me...
You're my Life and my All, yeah -
You're Everything...---Lyrics submitted by Jenielin.
