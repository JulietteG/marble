Trap
It's a trap
Been a trap from the start, boy (been a trap from the start, boy)
You don't trust lies, do you, do you?
Then why you trust your own heart?
(Do it, click it, feel it, drink it, pull the trigger)
It's the last time
Same thing that you said last time ...
We forever drinkin', but the thirst is never leavin'
Searchin' the earth for what you only find in heaven
So insane

Tell me, can you catch me, I'm fallin'
Tryna make my way to the shore, but I'm callin' out
I'mma be gone by the mornin'
I can feel the end comin' now
Don't let me drown, throw the raft
Before I drown pull me up now
Before I drown, hurry up
Before I drown
(Can You save me now?)
'Fore I drown
Save me from me, save me from me
Save me from me, save me from me 'fore I drown
Save me from me, save me from me
Save me from me, save me from me

I can feel the water all around my head
Around my head
I can feel the waves all around my neck
Come, won't you, come, won't you
Come, won't you, come here

Hollerin' YOLO!
If tomorrow we may die, sure (tomorrow we may die, sure)
Then the kid 'bout to play
We need to play in house parts
I know how it feels, at 15 I ain't wanna live
I was at the bus stop, ducked down, sparkin' up the spliffs
Thinkin' if I die tomorrow no one care
Followin' these raps
Brag about my status
Am I makin' people jealous?
I know I ain't happy (I know)
Never found joy, I could only find distractions

Oh, He saves
Let Him become your life
Feelin' like you gone too far or are you too far gone
Oh, my Lord loves your type
Feelin' like you runnin' out of air
He wants you right there
God only helps stop, but can't help themselves
We hold the beauty of the King on the pledge of unseen
From the desert of me to the meadows upstream, drink
There is no feelin' better, never
Won't be satisfied so ...
Everyday no fling, I'm safe---
