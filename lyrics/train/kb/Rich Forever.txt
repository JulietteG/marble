Silver and gold, silver and gold

Last year man I made more money than I ever made in my life
Granted, it wasn't really that much cause we never had much
Just enough was enough for the guys
Jump in the truck, take a ride
And I went a bought a crib with my bride
It was a crib without a baby in it
Me and KB-J in the back y'all when I get back
Then we back to the back car, when Im back to the start
Hold up, I remember
That empty fridge apartment with no power in it
Still to God, we will turn power steering
Your moneys too cheap to fund my joy
We had that work you cant employ
I roll in

We had that work you cant employ
We roll in
We had that work
Boy we got treasure, well be rich forever
Look they can have it all
Let that money fall
But when its all said and done
Well still be countin' (well still be countin')
Well still be countin' (still be countin')

We Rolling in it
Roll in, Roll in
All my Dawgs they go in
We Rolling in it
Roll in, Roll in
All my Dawgs they go in
We rolling in it
But still we can't

Aye, I know a girl down on Wall Street, climbing to the top
She said Christ came and broke her
You know he a beast with the stocks
When you still making knots
And youre not gonna flaunt
How they not gonna not
But she dont care about what theyre about, she coulda got a yacht
But she stay giving her money to the mission on the block
Now thats amazing!
Gave His life (light) so we gave up ours, Daylight savings
Silver and Gold
Its good so we tried to make it
Since our treasures in heaven
We cheerfully gave it
No envy, thats Vegas
Content G, with out savings
We got everything in our Savior
And the New Earth is waiting
We just children raising our babies
Tryna win the city, Chicago
Better get what I'm on
You are not what you bring home
Be rich in good works
Cause thats what you bring home
In the face of heavens gates
Mr. Gates estate's debase and break like paper plates
I'm down, tell ya bout this
Till we got a bigger house but the same sized coffin
People at the top feeling like they at the bottom and thats probably why the rich are more likely suicidal
Silver and golds too low for the soul
They want a Jesus piece when he died for the whole
What is this love and mercy, grace, forgiveness?
We'll be in eternity still counting our riches---
