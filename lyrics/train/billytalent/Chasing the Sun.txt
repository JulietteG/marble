We tried to stay young by chasing the sun
You blink for too long, the swans sing a song
And all that I've lost, and all that I've won
Don't mean nothing more when you open your eyes, and they're gone

After all we've been told, were still flesh and bones
And life's worth much more than silver and gold
And all that I've lost, and all that I've won
Don't mean nothing more when you open your eyes, and they're gone

And how can it be that we'll never see
The first day of spring, and the last autumn leaves
So lost in my mind, I tried to stay strong
If wounds heal in time, then tell me why it's so hard to move on
Hard to move on, I'll never move on

I caused the mistakes that well never make
The pictures of trips that well never take
And all of these thoughts they keep me awake
Hang on to your heroes, before its too late
'Cause therell come a time when you open your eyes, and they're gone
Someday they're gone, someday theyll be gone

And I'll still be here chasing the sun---
