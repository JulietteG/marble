So the governments crazy and the weathers all wrong
The radio aint playing country songs
Grits wont cook in the microwave
And youre made about the price of gas these days
You cant get a signal on your mobile phone
Your dog ran off and your wife cam home
It all boils down to just one fact
Theres a great big monkey hanging on your back

But It Aint My job (it aint my job)
It aint my job (it aint my job)
Dont break me down cause you feel funky
It aint my job to tote your monkey

Seems every morning about this time
You come in here and start to whine
Its the coffee, its the car, its the Coke machine
Aint you ever happy bout anything?

But It Aint My job (it aint my job)
It aint my job (it aint my job)
Dont break me down cause you feel grumpy
It aint my job to tote your monkey

So take your circus and leave this town
 Aint got time to monkey around
Go tell Dr. Phil what you think
I aint your daddy and I aint your shrink

But It Aint My job (it aint my job)
It aint my job (it aint my job)
Dont break me down cause you feel grumpy
It aint my job to tote your monkey

Your toast was burned and your eggs were runny
Last night Letterman wasnt that funny
You smoked all your drinkin money
But it aint my job to tote your monkey

Tag:  Hey boy Im sorry if all this talk has upset your tummy
But it aint my job to tote your cotton pickin monkey
Naw. naw nawnaw.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah K.
