Ladies and gentlemen please 
Would you bring your attention to me?
For a feast for your eyes to see
An explosion of catastrophe

Like nothing youve ever seen before
Watch closely as I open this door
Your jaws will be on the floor
After this youll be begging for more

Welcome to the show
Please come inside
Ladies and gentlemen

woa
Do you want it?
woa 
Do you need it?
woa
Let me hear it
Ladies and gentlemen

Boom
Do you want it?
Boom 
Do you need it?
Boom
Let me hear it
Ladies and gentlemen

Ladies and gentlemen good evening
Youve seen that seeing is believing
Your ears and your eyes will be bleeding
Please check to see if youre still breathing

Hold tight cause the show is not over
If you will please move in closer
You're about to be bowled over
By the wonders youre about to behold here

Welcome to the show (welcome to the show)
Please come inside
Ladies and gentlemen

Boom
Do you want it?
Boom 
Do you need it?
Boom
Let me hear it
ladies and gentlemen

boom
Do you want it?
boom
Do you need it?
boom
Let me hear it

Welcome to the show (Welcome to the show)
We're glad you came along (We're glad you came along)
Please come inside
Ladies and gentlemen

Boom
Do you want it?
Boom 
Do you need it?
Boom
Let me hear it
Ladies and gentlemen
