Jumping into my 55' Chevy with flames
I'm peelin' out at the light
Feel like I'm going insane
I'm shootin' straight through the night
I'm like a runaway train
I'm breakin' in doors and bringin' the pain

I got this feeling
I don't know what to do
Sex, drugs and violence
Give me something to do, yeah

Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
I got a feeling down in my soul
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
You're never too young you're never too old

All my life I've been lookin' for a bitch like you
Sweet bubble gum breath and diamond shape baby blues
Get on the floor and show me what you can do, yeah
I bet your dreamin' for the night is through, yeah yeah

I got this feeling
I don't know what to do
Sex, drugs and violence
Is drivin' through

I got this feeling
I don't know what to do
Sex, drugs and violence
Please give me something to do, yeah yeah

Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
I got a feeling down in my soul
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
You're never too young you're never too old, yeah

Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
I got a feeling down in my soul, yeah
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
You're never too young you're never too old, yeah---
