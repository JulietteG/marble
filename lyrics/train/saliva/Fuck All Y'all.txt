Here's a little story that needs to be told, about the devil doing business in the fiery hole.
Here's a little story that's oh so oh so true, about the fame and the money and the lawyers too.

There's just one thing I'll say to you
...if you're fucking me, I'm gonna fuck with you.
Since all my money you're chasing, I'll find a steady replacement.
Fuckin' me must've been entertainment.
Nobody more, nobody gets burned...

Here's to all the fucking lies you told, about a rabbit in a hat that's running for the hole.
Here's to all the fucking money you made, so take your nickel back and default the rest of your take.---
