Being, no concern 
Point of no return 
Go forward and reverse 
This I will recall 
Yeah, every time I fall 

Keep setting forth in the universe 
Keep setting forth in the universe 

Out here realigned 
A planet out of sight 
On nature drunk and high 

Keep... 
Keep... 

ohhhhhh...---Lyrics submitted by a.
