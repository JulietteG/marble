Minimum Wage / B.E. O'Neal

I have to get up, get to the job
I have to put my work clothes on
I work in the kitchen, from 8 til 10
Go home for a minute just to do it again
How could I find peace of mind?
Im not even living on my own time
When somethings done wrong, what can I say?
Someone could send me back home today
I make the minimum wage
I said that I work I work for the minimum wage

I wash the dishes.  I mop the floor
Im glad Im alive.  Who could ask for more?
I have God.  He lives in me
Unhappy rich people there must be
Oooh la la, oooh la lay
Forget the future.  Work today
Im not unhappy, why be sad?
Think of all the good times that weve had

We work so hard.  Yes we work all day
We work so hard but we need to stay

We work so hard.  Yes we work all day
We work so hard but we need to stay

I wash the dishes.  I mop the floor
Im glad Im alive.  Who could ask for more?
I have God.  He lives in me
Unhappy rich people there must be
Oooh la la, oooh la lay
Forget the future lets work today
Im not unhappy, why be sad?
Think of all the good times that weve had
I make the minimum wage
I said that I work I work for the minimum wage
Dont you know that we work we work for the minimum wage?
I said that I work I work for the minimum wage
I said that we work we work for the minimum wage---Lyrics submitted by Michael Backaus.
