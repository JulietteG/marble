The boys wanna fight....
The boys wanna fight....
The boys wanna fight....
The boys wanna fight....
But the girls are happy to dance all night

We know best how they can mess with us
Voicing an opinion's getting dangerous
And in a world where good's not good enough
Let's get loaded and kick up a fuss

The boys wanna fight 
but the girls are happy to dance all night
The boys wanna fight
but the girls are happy to dance all night

Is there anybody else?
Anybody else?
Is there anybody else?
Anybody else?

What a mess we've made it's ridiculous
The whole wide world's a stage of complete chaos
It gets so funny that we get confused
We don't know where to turn 'cause we've all been used

(Chorus)

Let's get loaded (Oh let's be selfish)
Let's get wasted (And lose our senses)
Let's get shit faced (So we can fake it)
Let's get stupid (Just entertain us)
Let's get wicked (Desensitize us)
Let's get toasted (Don't educate us)
Let's get hammered (Yeah paralyze us)
Let's forget it (Don't count on all)

(Chorus)

I'm sick sick sick of saying nothing
I'm sick sick sick of doing nothing
I'm sick sick sick of saying nothing
But let's get loaded---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
