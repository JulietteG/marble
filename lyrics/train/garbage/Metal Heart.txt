I wish I had a metal heart; I could cross the line.
I wish I was half as good as you think I am.

But now that we know for sure they're telling lies
when they say no one gets hurt and therefore nobody dies
you know it's hard to believe anything that you hear 
they say the world is round.

Wish I was as big as you; you'd have to tell the truth.
I'd be nothing you could hurt; nothing you could use.

But now that we know for sure they're telling lies
when they say no one gets hurt and therefore nobody dies
you know it's hard to believe anything that you hear
they say the world is round.  The world is round.

I want to be dependable, I want to be courageous and good.
I want to be faithful so that I can be heroic and true.
I want to be a friend you can rely on, you can lean on and trust.
I want to understand so I can forgive and be willing to love.

I wish I wasn't flesh and blood; I would not be scared
of bullets built with me in mind.
For then I could be saved.

My sweet Lord take care of me, for I think I'm done.
Kiss my mother on her cheek and lay my burden down.  Lay my burden down.

(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
