Freaks on E, that's what we fuck
Man

Alright yo, 1,2 1,2
Yo, heheee

This is what I love, and can't stop lovin'.
Get wasted at partys, from 9 till 7 in the morning,
I live for the music.
Rollin' blunts, feelin' high, gettin' loaded,
or take some pills and go to la la land.
Spendin' all my money on dope and extreme high price tickets.
But in the end, it's all worth it.
I like to live in my own world, 
Fuck regular life! Fuck a '9-to-5' job!
I'm told to enjoy every moment, every hour, every minute.
Thats what I do on fridays and saturdays. 
Why should I take life so seriously?
I just want to do, what I like to do! 
Be afar from reality, 'cause I can't stand society!
This is my own world, I just wan't to hear the music.

I think the whole system fucking sucks,
everybody's working their fucking ass up during the week,
getting told to be fucking stressed out. 
So what's wrong, and what's right?
I live for the weekend, I live for hardstyles, I live for hardstyle baby!

C'mon, lets go!---Lyrics submitted by nancy.
