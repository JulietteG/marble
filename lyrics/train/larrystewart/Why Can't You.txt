I wrestled with the devil all night...   fightin' with what's wrong and what's right...
  I was two months from home,  the whiskey too strong......  Brought a weakness I've never known.   I won't try to make an excuse,   there can't be one for what I've done to you!!  Won't you please let me in, so I can plead my case again????  

       CHORUS:   If the Lord can forgive me,  why can't You?    If I can still get to heaven,     why can't I get to you?? He died for my sins, I'm dying here too,  
If the Lord can forgive me girl,  Why can't You???  

       It's Killing me to see how you hurt....  You're right I should have thought of that first.   But in time I will heal the pain that you feel by givin' you the love you deserve.  I know this won't be easy on you,  trust... is something I'll have to prove!!! For the children's sake,  Don't let them pay for my mistake!!!!  
      REPEAT CHORUS   

     This may be the hardest thing you'll ever do, before I make it right with him let me make it right with you!!!   If I can still get to Heaven why can't I get to you??
   He died for my sins,  I'm dying here too!!!   If the Lord can forgive me girl, 
  Why can't you??!!!---Lyrics submitted by BARBARA.
