D-D-D-Didi, you don't...
D-D-D-Don't know how you lost me.
And after almost two years
Y-Y-You lost me at "hello".

It gets worse and the worst,
It just gets the best of us.
It just gets worse and the worst,
It just gets the best of us.

D-D-D-Didi, this midwest address has made a mess of us.

P-P-Pack up my bag,
B-B-B-Borrow a couple bucks.
B-B-Borrow's the wrong word,
'C-C-Cause i'm not coming back.

I got a lead on the job
From a cousin in Silverlake.
So don't just stand there and shrug,
Didi, I'm turning the door knob.

It gets worse and the worst,
It just gets the best of us.
It just gets worse and the worst,
It just gets the best of us.
Shit gets and the worst,
It just gets the best of us.
You know it gets worse and the worst,
It just gets the best of us.

D-D-Didi, this midwest address has made a mess of us.

Oh and I know my doe is a little bit psycho.
She wears her head inside out.
And my doe, she looks alright though
With the lights low
With the lights low

It gets worse and the worst,
(oh and i know my doe is a little bit psycho)
It just gets the best of us.
(she wears her head inside out)
It gets worse and the worst,
(and my doe, she looks alright though)
It just gets the best of us.

Didi, this midwest address has made a mess of us.

L-L-Los Angeles is less than I longed for.
W-W-When awake in my car
D-D-Didi it's you I miss.

'Cause you're smarter than not.
I'm better than no one.
Didi, forgive me.
Do you wanna get married?---
