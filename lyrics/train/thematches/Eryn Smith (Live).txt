If you ever go down to Huntington,
there is a girl there that is named Eryn.
She's got ADD, but isn't bored with me.
At least not yet, she said.
With a 'zine in between
her bohemian jeans,
half sober.
She's a dog in heat
and proud of that clich. ok-ok, ok, ok
She's a can of mixed nuts
with a damn nice butt.
It's over.
But more and more,
she tries to make me stay, ok-ok, ok, ok

Eryn Smith, I don't want you to hate me.
You should know you educate me.
You should know you make me want to say,
You're bitchin'
And I just want you to hold me,
though I know we'll leave here lonely,
'cause in the end, it's meant to be that way
anyway.

She hacks her hair shorter on the left side
'cause if you called her cute
she'd be horrified.
She says you're gonna eat popcorn in the dark
And pay ten bucks to watch her life one day.

Let's go...

You should know I think so much of you.
You should think I don't think of you much,
But that's not true.
You're the dimple in my cheeks
that I can't spit out.
You're the smile in my eyes
that I can't cry out
The word "subtle" is not a word that goes with
Eryn Smith----
