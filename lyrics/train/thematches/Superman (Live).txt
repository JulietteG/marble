I swear that you believed me
when I told you that I was Superman
With you I can even fool myself
We've been friends since we were 12,
now I'll be 17 on the 24th
You've posed for 5 years on my shelf
I counted seasons 'til the fall
when I would steal your heart
You left the scene before my crime
I think about you
when I'm sick and tired of stupid girls
I think about you all the time

I am Superman with you
Oh, c'mon, you know you're my hero, too
Oh, it might sound like a lie
But I know and you know
that Superman can fly

Stared through the menu on the wall
we've read too many times
Lit a match to watch it burn
You keep me waiting longer every day
but still I'm here
The more you live, the less I learn

Went to Marine world,
tried to find the words to say to you
But I couldn't find the place to start
I love you, I hate you
All I know is that I don't know nothing
And nothing's gonna break my heart -
break down to a thousand pieces

One more second with these words unsaid
they'll catch fire in my head
and I might look like a fool here,
and sure, you might pretend I'm making this up,
but I don't care.---
