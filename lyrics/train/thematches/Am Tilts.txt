Come now, whats your name again?
I'm not implying come morning I'll need to know
but you never know.

The morning tilts
Over the hills
And floods the world
The morning tilts
The morning spills
The morning tilts
Over the hills
And floods the world
The morning tilts
The morning spills
We lose our grip
And slip
Into the day.

We can't kiss with grins like this
Chapped lips are all over your your pearly scar
We better stop.

The morning tilts
Over the hills
And floods the world
The morning tilts
The morning spills
The morning tilts
Over the hills
And floods the world
The morning tilts
The morning spills
We lose our grip
And slip
Into the day.

Oh Oh Oh
Over the world (the world)
All our waking end
All that we
All that we
Thrust against the end
Thrust against (up against)
Up against the end
Oh oh is this?
Oh this could be
Could this be the end?

The morning tilts
Over the hills
And floods the world
The morning tilts
The morning spills
The morning tilts
Over the hills
And floods the world
The morning tilts
The morning spills
We lose our grip
And slip
Into the day.---
