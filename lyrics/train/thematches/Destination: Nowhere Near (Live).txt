The world is moving everywhere but here,
so load the van. Destination: Nowhere Near
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again, yeah

We'd been on the road
for several weeks, now
and it drove you crazy
Got to get back out of this old town now
where my parents hate me
1, 2, 3 And I am alone
2, 2, 3 by the telephone
3, 2, 3 and my friends ain't home tonight

The world is moving everywhere but here,
so load the van. Destination: Nowhere Near
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again, yeah
Destination: Nowhere Near

I sit in my room and play
a punk rock song on my folk guitar
Remember when the van broke down
and our shit wouldn't fit in a borrowed car
1, 2, 3 We were just eighteen
2, 2, 3 With a madman dream
3, 2, 3 And now it seems we're still insane
(still down in Oakland playin')

The world is moving everywhere but here,
so load the van. Destination: Nowhere Near
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again, yeah
Destination: Nowhere Near

The world is moving everywhere but here,
so load the van. Destination: Nowhere Near
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again
I wanna be on the road again, yeah
Destination: Nowhere Near
Right now---
