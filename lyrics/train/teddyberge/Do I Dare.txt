Should I tell you I love you
Should I tell you I care
Should I tell you I love you
Oh daring do i dare

Do I dare tell you
Whats on my mind
That darling I love you
That I wish you were mine

Should I tell you i love you
Should I tell you i care
Should I tell you i love you
Oh daring do i dare

(Instrumental )

I know your much too young
To fall in love
And although your just eighteen
Your all Im thinking of

Should I tell you I love you
Should I tell you I care
Should I tell you I love you
Oh daring do i dare

Oh Ive tried to tell you
Whats in my heart
That although I love you
I know we cloud part

Should I tell you I love you
Should I tell you I care
Should I tell you I love you
Oh daring do I dare---Lyrics submitted by James Johnson.
