Mi companero de mantalla tiempo de dormir
Ya se se yio el sol es colecio
Y las estrellas y la luna duerlas muy bien
e cubrincon su monto duerme bien

It's time you hit the trail to dreamland little saddle pal
So saddle up your bronc and drift away
It's time you rode into the shadows little saddle pal
For your work's over for another day

Dream about a golden palomino
taking you to never neverland
Maybe you will find a long lost gold mine
or capture a rustler band

It's time you hit the trail to dreamland little saddle pal
So saddle up your bronc and drift away---Lyrics submitted by Leah Joy King.
