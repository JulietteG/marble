Do you remember all the laughs we had then?
You always talk about with your friends
I've missed the point of coming back
I'm old enough to know better than that
I'm old enough to know better than that
I'm old enough to know better than that

I held it in my hand for awhile
Long enough to grow attached to it's smile
Not missed the way it falls upon my head
I'm turning back to see if it's them
And you give it your all even when you've haven't got enough
And you give it your all even when it's not there
You give it your all when there's nothing to try

What you running for?

I'm heading west on Elm Street
Locked that door and I'm not looking back---
