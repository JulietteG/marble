But you know what I'm thinking without ever letting up
And you know what I'm thinking without ever letting up
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh

And oh, I like the feeling of that lagging feeling
Oh, I like the feeling of the feeling
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh

You never let it
And you never let it
And you never let it
And you never let it
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh

You know what I'm thinking without ever letting up
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh
You know what I'm thinking without ever letting up
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh---
