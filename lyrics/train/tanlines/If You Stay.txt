Nobody wants to be alone
Sitting by themselves watch the fall of the snow
Every time you see my picture on your phone
You always think the same things

Every time I know, you know, I know, you know why
I think it's not my fault
Nobody every says those words
I do
Everybody's living
Everybody's talking about numbers these days
But I think I can get over it all

If you stay
If you stay here
I'll erase your fears---
