I saw the pieces
I saw the sun going down
Let's meet up at the beginning
Let's meet up at the beginning
I know the reason
I'm down at the bottom of it all
Let's meet up at the beginning
Let's meet up at the beginning

Cause I fall to pieces
I'm falling apart
I fall to pieces
When you go
I fall to pieces
When you're away
I fall to pieces

When you're away
When you're away
When you're away
When you're away

I read the papers
I know the
Let's meet up at the beginning
Let's meet up at the beginning
I know the reasons (know it all)
I'm down at the bottom of it all
Let's meet up at the beginning
Let's meet up at the beginning

I saw the ruins
I saw the world turning black
Let's meet up at the beginning
Let's meet up at the beginning

I fall to pieces
When you're away---
