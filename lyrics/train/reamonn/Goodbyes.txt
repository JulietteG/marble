We both dressed as we thought fit
What do you wear to goodbyes?
The time would come for us both to say
And hear each others lies
I dont feel like Ive been holding back
Breaking up is hard on us both
I feel so empty as you walk away 
These words have no meaning 
Theres nothing to say
So goodbye, goodbye
These words have no meaning when your hearts at a leaving
Goodbye, so goodbye
And now theres nothing worth keeping, nothing left to believe in
And when you think the fighting is over, then come the sleepless nights I wanted to hold her, goodbye
I can barely remember the love, but I can still hear the fights
Standing in the hallway screaming at the top of your voice, you know you were right
I dont feel like Ive been holding back, it cuts like a knife, but it still feels like life
So goodbye, goodbye
These words have no meaning when your hearts at a leaving, goodbye, so goodbye
And now theres nothing worth, keeping nothing left to believe in
And when you think the fighting is over, then come the sleepless nights I wanted to hold her, goodbye
You said it wouldnt hurt, but now you see its not getting better
We tried so hard to make it work
I thought that Id be with you forever
Goodbye, goodbye
Yeah these words have no meaning when your hearts at a leaving
Goodbye and goodbye
You thought this might be worth saving but I must be mistaken
Goodbye so goodbye
Now Im ready to let you go
I see you leaving
I stopped believing
I finally think the fighting is over
No more sleepless nights I wanted to hold her
Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Annik.
