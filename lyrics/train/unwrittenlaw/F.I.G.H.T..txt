I heard you were concerned with my life, i heard you have a lot to say, i'm gonna do it if it feels right, i'm gonna do it anyway,so don't stay under the light use it,use it, still puttin' up a good fight,still puttin' up a goooood F.I.G.H.T. fight fight fight F.I.G.H.T. fight fight. Everybody thinks they know my problems, everybody knows whats best for me, don't think that anyone can solve them, don't think there's anyone for me. Sooooooooo don't stay under the light, use it, use it, still puttin' up a good fight, still puttin' up a gooood F.I.G.H.T fight fight fight  F.I.G.H.T fight fight fight fight fight fight. Whooooooooaaaaaaa don't stay under the light, use it, use it, still puttin' up a good fight, still puttin' up a gooooooooo oooooood F.I.G.H.T fight fight   fight fight.---Lyrics submitted by Squirrely.
