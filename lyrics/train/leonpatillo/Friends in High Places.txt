I was in need and i needed a friend
I was alone and i needed a hand
I was going down but someone rescue me

[CHORUS:]
My GOD cares too much to say
His mercies are new everyday
I get down to pray 
And then GOD is in on it's way

I walk by faith and not by sight
If things go wrong it'll be alright
Cause someone greater is watching over me

Chorus

And with faith i believe
I've got everything i need
I walk by faith and not by word i see

I've got friends in high places
I 've got someone i can go
And i've got someone watching over me
