i will wait
you will break
i will summon
you will  . . . me
i will come undone
you will succumb
i will be vestal you will bleed

i will kill time
you will singe the thread that hangs the lie
i will return the favor
i will not abate
you willingly disintegrate
i will be the undertaker

you
you can't touch me
you . . . you can't touch me
you
you can't touch me

i will remain
you will burn without a flame
i will suspend forever
i will miss the ground
you will wish me down
you will be my resurrector

i will hold my breath . . . remember

you
you can't touch me
you . . . you can't touch me
you
you can't touch me

when the living room is cold when i'm sleeping on my feet
when i wish upon the hardwood and your milky tea
when the corner of my eye follows fairies in the sun
when the silence sounds like
someone

cracking

you can't touch me
you can't touch me
you can't touch me---Lyrics submitted by Cheyenne.
