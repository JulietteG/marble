Buried waist deep gagged and bound 
Piles of heads lie on the ground 
Executioners start to assemble 

Condemed man shakes with fear 
Doom now becoming clear 
The faces of the heads he resembles 

Severd 
Head 
Stoning 

His family's head strike him 
The most recent victims 
Without mercy savage killers throw 

His wife's head breaks his jaw 
Bruised flesh becoming raw 
From many wounds blood begins to flow 

When the victim dies 
They chop off his head 

Severed head stoning 

Bady beaten,in a daze 
Eye pops out, fluids spray 
Pulsing veins cause the wounds to gush 

The end is near the bloody stumps 
Mangeld face a mass of lumps 
What was now a man reduced to mush 

Mashed into a pulp 
Dozens of bones break 

{Solo - Jack Owen} 

Severed head stoning---Lyrics submitted by john.
