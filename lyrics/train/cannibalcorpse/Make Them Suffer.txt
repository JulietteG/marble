suffer

Extreme pain is what they need to feel for the rest of there lives
Misery and dispairleaves their souls when infinity ends

let them taste the wrath as the agony consumes them
Swollowed bu the darkest light a blackened state of dismay
Survival is the only thing left for them
The grievous revelation is a new beginning
Led to the solution against there will

Deprivation thrives as the therapy continues
Sullen mastery is an answer uncontested
Denial is the only thing left for them
Life as they knew it is a distant memory
Scores of victims lust for apathy

Make them suffer
while they plead for cessation
Entirely demoralized and close to mass extintion
Damned to please supremacy
The reason for their martyrdom they will never know

Make them suffer
while they bleed through damnation
begged for retribution before meeting with demise
cursed by animosity
once chosen for this mad ordeal there is no escape

(SOLO)

Domoination reigns supreme the evil has no end
Spent of all their energy now worthless and degraded
Slow death is the only thing left for them
Phisically and mentally devoid of dignity
Languished immortality

Make them suffer
while they plead for cessation
Entirely demorilized and close to mass extintion
Damned to please supremacy
The reason for their martyrdom they will never know

Make them suffer
While they bleed thruogh damnation
Begged for retribution before meeting with demise
Cursed by animosity
Once choosen for this mad ordeal there is no escape

Make them suffer
Forever---Lyrics submitted by O'Doyle.
