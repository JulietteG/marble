Dont say another word
My finger to your lips
And pressed
God is not watching us
We can do whatever we want
So lets
So lets

Its been so long, so long
Its been so long, so long
Stop your resistance
This is where you belong
Woah, woah, this is where you belong
Woah, woah, this is where you belong

Its been so long, so long
Its been so long, its been so long
Stop your resistance
This is where you belong
Woah, woah, this is where you belong
Woah, woah, this is where you belong
Woah, woah, stop your resistance
this is where you belong

(This is where you belong)
(This is where you belong)
(This is where you belong)
(This is where you belong)
