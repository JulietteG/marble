Mission accomplished
do you feel regret
breathing down your neck
broken friendships in progress
do you ever wonder why
your soul is in despair
light a match
use it to find your way through the dark

When the sun goes down
emotions all come out
yeah
and your sapphire eyes
keep staring at the ground
yeah
youre burning all your bridges down
youre burning all your bridges down

The future is pending
are you sending angels out
or demons instead
what goes around
comes around
will you cross the lakes and rivers
that surround you
light a match
use it to find your way through the dark

When the sun goes down
emotions all come out
yeah
and your sapphire eyes
keep staring at the ground
yeah 
youre burning all your bridges down
youre burning all your bridges down

With every kiss
thats on your lips
youre burning all your bridges down
with ever kiss
thats on your lips
youre burning all your bridges down

When the sun goes down
emotions all come out
yeah
and your sapphire eyes 
keep staring at the ground
youre burning all your bridges down
youre burning all your bridges down
youre burning all you bridges down
youre burning all your bridges down
youre burning them down
youre burning them down
youre burning them down
youre burning them down
youre burning them down
burning them down
youre burning them down---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
