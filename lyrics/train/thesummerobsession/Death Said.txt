I took a walk outside to think about my life and what it means
I heard a voice I made a choice Ill be everything I can be
Death said Ready, you might go, you never know how...
Upsetting, I know, Im here to let you down
Somethings waiting for you around the corner its true...
Death said You might go, you never know who...

I wasted time, I faced my crime, I went too long not caring
The oxygen Im taking in, Im taking seriously
Death said Ready, you might go, you never know how...
Upsetting, I know, Im here to let you down
Somethings waiting for you around the corner its true...
Death said You might go, you never know who...
(Death said)
You never know who
(Death said)
You never know who
(Death said)
You never know who
(Death said)

I can hear it coming over me
I can hear it calling out to me
I can hear it coming over me
I can hear it calling out to me
And I never will 
I never will 
I never will forget...

Death said Ready, you might go, you never know how...
Upsetting, I know, Im here to let you down
Somethings waiting for you around the corner its true...
Death said You might go, you never know...

Death said Ready, you might go, you never know how...
Upsetting, I know, Im here to let you down
Somethings waiting for you around the corner its true...
Death said You might go, you never know who...
(Death said)
You never know who
(Death said)
You never know who
(Death said)
You never know who
