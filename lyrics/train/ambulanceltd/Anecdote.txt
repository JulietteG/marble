You pin the medals to your chest,
And settle down for seven minutes rest.
You dim the lights, administer the cure,
You tried it several times, you're still not sure.
You take the first one for free,
And pass it off to me,
I don't refuse.
Baby, if you only knew,
But I don't think you do.

You take the lines from ordinary books,
You're disappointed in the way she looks.
You cut the circulation to your hand,
And calculate the motion of the land.
Then you fall back asleep,
And wander down the street, 
That loses use,
Don't say you feel the same way too.
I don't think you do.

You cut the worms and bait them on the hooks,
You cast the line towards the closest brooks.
You meet the girl who says she knows the plan,
You act impressed and say you understand.
Cause you like to believe,
That all that love was free,
For someone like you,
You'll never be lonely or get the blues.
But darlin' it's not true.---Lyrics submitted by Ariel.
