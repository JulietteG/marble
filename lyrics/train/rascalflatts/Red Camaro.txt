I saw a Red Camaro today
It turned my head around
It made me think about
Back when my life was a game
and we played it all night long
Just like our favorite song

(Chorus)
Summers just around the bend
Summers just around the bend
Turn up the music loud, take the t-tops out 
and let the chromes shine
Cruise along the river side
Feel the wind blow
Through your hair through your toes
Got you bare feet hanging out the window

I saw a red Camaro today
and I did a double take
I thought I saw her face
We were so reckless and young
and it all comes back to me

(Chorus) 
Summers just around the bend
Summers just around the bend
Turn up the music loud, take the t-tops out
and let the chromes shine
Cruise along the river side
Feel the wind blow
Through your hair, through your toes 

Looking back
Looking back
sweet wine and sunshine
Looking back
Looking back
Man those were some good times

1,2,3,4

(Chorous)
Turn up the music loud, take the t-tops out
and let the chromes shine
Cruise along the river side
Feel the wind blow
Through your hair, through your toes 
Got your bare feet hanging out the window

Turn up the music loud x2---Lyrics submitted by Taylor Turley.
