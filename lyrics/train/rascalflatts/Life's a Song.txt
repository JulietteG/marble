Life is a cement trampoline
A humble church, a melody that's bittersweet
Oh the pain of almost havin' it all
Of comin' so close, five yards to go and droppin' the ball
Oh life, has been a guitar on my back
Bendin' strings and rhymin' things
What's wrong with that, what's wrong with that

Life's a song, turn it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Life's a song, turn it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh

Time it ain't no magazine
It's just a space we fill with faith and walk between
Oh and time, has been a thief and a friend
Sweetens the wine, oh and steals the night, mhmm
Decides the end, yeah it decides the end

Time's a song, turn it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Time's a song, live it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh

Yeah life's a song

Oh the joy, out here on this weary road
To hear your voice, to feel my home
God speed me home, God speed me home

Love's a song, turn it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Love's a song, turn it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh

(Life's a song, turn it up
Turn it on, sing along
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh)
Turn it up, yeah sing along
Life's a song, whoa oh oh
Turn it up, turn it on
Yeah life's a song
Turn it up ---
