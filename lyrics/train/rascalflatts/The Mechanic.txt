When I'm broke down, you're the mechanic
And when I'm mean, you're romantic
And when I cry, you're the sexiest clown ever seen
You fix me
When I'm a sinner, you're a King James
And when I'm lost, you're the map's missin' page
And when I'm shakin', you're steady like stone
You see, you fix me

I'd be crazy baby, lost forever
Blowin' around in stormy weather
Like a bunch of dead leaves
I'd be a boarded up house on a dead end street
Old Chevy on blocks, leakin' gasoline
Oh it ain't hard to see
Broke down is where I'd be
Baby you fix me

When I'm cold, you're on fire
And when I'm flat, you're air for the tire
And when I'm rain through the clouds your sunshine screams
You fix me

I'd be crazy baby, lost forever
Blowin' around in stormy weather
Like a bunch of dead leaves
I'd be a boarded up house on a dead end street
Old Chevy on blocks, leakin' gasoline
Oh it ain't hard to see
Broke down is where I'd be
Baby you fix me

Ooh, you, I don't know where I'd be
Oh where I'd be

I'd be crazy baby, lost forever
Blowin' around in stormy weather
Like a bunch of dead leaves
I'd be a boarded up house on a dead end street
Old Chevy on blocks, leakin' gasoline
Oh it ain't hard to see
Broke down is where I'd be
Baby you fix me
Baby you fix me ---
