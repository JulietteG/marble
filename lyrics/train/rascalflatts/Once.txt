Should've been much further than this by now
Little bit more gone a little less twisted around
Should've been much better, you'd think
But I'm not, I'm still stuck
I'm still here in this rut

Looking back on everything that we had
Holding on to words that we can't take back
What am I to do with the past
When it's all that I have 
And I can't get you back

Now I wait by the phone
In the dark, drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low
And I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
I'm reminded of us
Where we've been, all we've done
And all the love that we shared once

Oh, once -

I remember you saying I was the one
And nothing could change that 
But you were wrong
It's funny how life turns on a dime
Now we don't even talk
I just stare at these walls and

I wait by the phone
In the dark, drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low
And I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
I'm reminded of us
Where we've been, all we've done
And all the love that we shared 

Once, you made the world feel so right
Once, you were my morning,
Noon and night
Why'd we slip away
Why did it all change
How will I ever be the same

Now I wait by the phone
In the dark, drunk on hope
I'm so lost, I'm so low
And I just want you to know
Everywhere - all we've done
Oh, by the phone baby
I've been so lost
I just want you to know
Yeah, where we've been

Should've been much further
Than this by now
Little bit more gone a little less twisted around---Lyrics submitted by Arielle.
