I can hear truck tires coming up the gravel road,
And its not like her to drive that slow,
Nothing on the radio,
Foot steps on the front porch,
I hear my door bell she usually comes right in,
Now i can tell,

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear im going to cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things have never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight
But here comes goodbye

I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
I can see it written on her face 
That she had never felt this was
One day i thought i'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violens would play
Here comes the bride

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear im going to cry
Here comes the pain
Here come me wishing this have never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight
but here comes goodbye

Why did it have to go from good to bad
Before the lights turn on
yeah and your left alone
Ohh... 

But here comes good bye
Yeah....
Here comes goodbye 
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear im going to cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing this had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight
But here comes goodbye
Ohhh---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
