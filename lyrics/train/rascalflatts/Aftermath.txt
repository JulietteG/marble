The way you turned your head
And all the words you said
The way they left your lips they left me
Frozen in my tracks
Now you can't take them back
No it's too late for that, now I feel

The aftermath of
A fragile, cracked love
That all but fell apart
Like gravel to skin
The hurt has set in
And all that's left of my heart
Are pieces and parts

How was I to know
Like a hammer to my soul
You would break me down so easily
Now baby here I am
Left with half of could have been
Can't help wondering if you feel

The aftermath of
A fragile, cracked love
That all but fell apart
Like gravel to skin
The hurt has set in
And all that's left of my heart
Are pieces and parts

The aftermath of
A fragile, cracked love
That all but fell apart
Oh you know it feels like
Like gravel to skin
The hurt has set in
And all that's left of my heart
Are pieces and parts
Pieces and parts ---
