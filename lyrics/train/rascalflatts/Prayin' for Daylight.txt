I don't want to spend another lonely night 
ooooooo 

I've got the lights turned up 
The door is locked, the bedroom TV's on 
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night 
Since you've been gone 

Prayin' for daylight waiting for that morning sun 
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong 
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right 
Don't make me spend another lonely night 
Prayin' for daylight 

I made a bad miscalculation 
Betting you would never leave 
'Cause if you're getting on with your new life 
Then where does that leave me 

Prayin for daylight 

Prayin for daylight 
Hoping that I didn't wait too long 
That this is just the dark before the dawn 

Deep in my heart I know 
That you love me as much as i love you 
And that you must be lying somewhere 
Looking up to heaven too 

Prayin' for daylight 
I don't want to spend another lonely night 
I don't want to spend another lonely night 
Prayin' for daylight---
