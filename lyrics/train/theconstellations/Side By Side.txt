She left the door wide open
Note on the floor with a key
She wrote that her heart's been broken
And she meant what she said to me
Woke to the sound of the birds ringing around in my brain
Bedsheets are frozen, I know this is more than a dream

And I ain't no good at saying goodbyes
So if you must leave then we'll both go 
Side by side

She left the door wide open 
A pistol lay warm in my hand 
She said that shes gone to find another
who'll love her and understand
A breath formed at the window 
And she tried to call out my name
The first shot was all
But the second one eased the pain

And I ain't no good at saying goodbyes
So if you must leave then we'll both go 
Side by side

I left the door wide open 
The note floats around on a breeze
And it will find us together 
And forever that's how we will be

We left the door wide open...---Lyrics submitted by U Florin.
