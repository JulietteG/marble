I'd hope you are sorry
The things that you've said
But not desillusion 
So I feel instead
Your head is a mess and you scream and you shout
'Cause you were born jealous for ever and that 

Listen listen to what I've got to say
Why don't you listen try to see things my way
Now listen why believe I deceived you with some one else
Why don't you listen listen listen listen

Now I just define and explain my needs all day long
But all you can hear are those voices say "I told you wrong"
You wanna keep me in chains but I was born free and I ain't gonna change

Now listen listen to what I've got to say
Why don't you listen try to see things my way
Now listen why believe I deceived you with some one else
Why don't you listen listen listen listen---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
