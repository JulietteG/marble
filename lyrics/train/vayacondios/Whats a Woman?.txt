What's a woman when a man
Don't stand by her side?
What's a woman when a man
Has secrets to hide?

She'll be weak, she'll be strong
Struggle hard for so long
What's a woman when a man

(What's a man without a woman?)
Don't go by the rule?
What's a woman when a man
(What's a man without a woman?)
Makes her feel like a fool?

When right turns to wrong
She will try to hold on
To the ghosts of the past

When love was to last
Dreams from the past faded so fast
All alone in the dark she will swear
He'll never mislead her again

All those dreams from the past
Faded so fast, ghost of the past
When love was to last

All alone in the dark
She will swear cross her heart
Never again
Cross my heart, never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
(A woman without a man?)
I say never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
(A woman without a man?)
No, no, never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
(A woman without a man?)
Never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
(A woman without a man?)
Never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
(A woman without a man?)
Never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart
(A woman without a man?)
Never again

(What's a man without a woman?)
Cross my heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
