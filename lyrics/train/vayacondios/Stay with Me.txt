Baby, stay with me tonight 
Baby, soothe me like an orphan child 
This word's on fire, the crooks and the liars 
Are bribing our souls and robbing our lives 
They come to haunt us 
In dreams where they taunt us 
And they don't tell us everything has it's price 
Baby, stay with me tonight 
Baby, say it will be all right 
Fairy tales tell you a good man will find you 
And love will be the key to paradise 
Girls they believe it, they want to feel needed 
They're so afraid to lead a lonely life 
Locked in the shadows of doubt 
Secrets are afraid of the light 
Forever searching for the spirit 
We keep hidden inside 
Baby, stay with me tonight 
Baby, take me in your arms tonight 
This world's on fire, we're caught in a mire 
And we don't know what to believe anymore 
Men built their towers of hatred and power 
And we don't know what all the suffering is for 
Locked in the shadows of doubt 
Secrets are afraid of the light 
Forever searching for the spirit 
Hidden deep in our hearts 
Baby, stay with me---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
