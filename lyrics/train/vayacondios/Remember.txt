Remember, the gipsy never gets lonely
Remember, the gipsy never gets lonely
He spends his nights doing what
They pay him well to do
He don't talk too much
Won't waste no words on you
He's the meanest cowboy in this town
And there ain't no Susy 'round
To nail him down
In some back room
He lays his cards on the table
Whatever job he does
They know he is able
He's a roving rogue
Moving from place to place
You don't stand a chance
To see a smile upon his face
He wouldn't give no one
The time of day
When the job is done
Just collects his pay
Whenever you might
Meet up with this stranger
Better move along
His name spells danger---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
