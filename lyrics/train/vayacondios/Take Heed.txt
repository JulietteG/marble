The seed you sow 
Thats what you gonna reap
The seed you sow 
Thats what you gonna reap
The seed you sow 
Thats what you gonna reap
The seed you sow 
Thats what you gonna reap

Mankind take heed
Take heed take heed mankind
Mankind take heed
For the seed you sow mankind
Thats what you shall reap 
Take heed take heed mankind
Mankind take heed
For the seed you sow mankind
Thats what you shall reap

You cant plant corn and reap yam
I said you cant plant corm and reap yam
The fruit from your labour
Thats what you gonna eat
The fruit from your labour
Thats what you gonna eat

Mankind take heed
Take heed take heed mankind
Mankind take heed
For the seed you sow mankind
Thats what you shall reap 
Take heed take heed mankind
Mankind take heed
For the seed you sow mankind
Thats what you shall reap

From creation
Man has caused destruction
From creation
In every generation
Dispensation---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
