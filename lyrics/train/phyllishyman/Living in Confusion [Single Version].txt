I believed in you I thought you could do no wrong
Until I saw one day that you were stringing me along
Played me for a fool; you used me once too much
I'm in so much pain here I am again
Trust is a hard thing to come by these days
You build me up to let me down got me spinning around
I wish I knew where you were coming from
You told me you loved me I thought I was your only one

Seems like I'm always going through changes 
Living in confusion, confusion, confusion
Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion, confusion

I had faith in you just knew you wouldn't hurt me 
But you played a game, you should be ashamed
I let my guard down I was so vulnerable
I hope you had your fun don't you know I was loyal to you
Truth is a hard thing to come by these days
You build me up to break me down got me spinning around
I wish I knew where you were coming from
You told me you loved me, I thought I was your only one

Seems like I'm always going through changes
living in confusion, confusion, confusion
Seems like I'm always going through changes 
living in confusion, confusion, confusion oh

I deserve better, I'm not gonna take no more
You build me up to let me down got me spinning around
I'm gonna find, find me somebody new
A love I can count on---Lyrics submitted by Beverly.
