The last of the silver screen cowboys
The last of a fast dyin breed
Cattle a grazin, six guns ablazin
God knows, this is what America still needs
The last of the silver screen cowboys
Standin tall for what he believes is right
Dont push him around, cuse more than one villains found
That he dont back down from a fight
Roy and trigger we love you
And hoppy we saved up our dimes
For the Saturday double features
And we sat through both movies two times
Gene, Lash, and Rex were our heroes
We knew good would win in the end
If we could just turn back the pages
And ride those old trails once again

The last of the silver screen cowboys
We settled the score with our fists
How we loved little babies
Treated women like ladies
But it was only our horse that we kissed

Then the time slipped away afore we knew it
And you little wranglers put up your play guns and your toys
But memories dont die
And we're still ridin high

Were the last of the silver screen cowboys---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
