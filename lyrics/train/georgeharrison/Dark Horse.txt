You thought you knew where I was and when
But It looks like they've been foolin you again,
You thought that you'd got me all steaked out
But baby it looks like they've been breaking out

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out from the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Looking for the source
I'm a dark horse

You thought you had got me in your grip
Baby looks like you was not so smart
And I became to slippery for you
But let me say that I was nothing new

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I picked up my first spoon
I've been a cool jerk
Looking for the source
I'm a dark horse

I thought that you knew it all along
Until you started getting me not right
seems as if you hearded a little late
But I warned you when
We both were at the starting gate

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out from the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Looking for the source
I'm a dark horse---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey.
