There'll come a time 
When all of us must leave here
Then nothing Sister Mary can do
Will keep me here with you
As nothing in this life that I've been trying
Can equal or surpass the art of dying
Do you believe me ?

There'll come a time
When all your hopes are fading
When things that seemed so very plain
Become an awful pain
Searching for the Truth among the lying
And answered when you've learned
The art of dying.

But if you want it, you must find it
But when you have it, there'll be no need for it
There'll come a time
When most of us return here
Brought back by our desire to be
A perfect entity
Living through a million years of crying
Until you've realised the art of dying
Do you believe me ?---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
