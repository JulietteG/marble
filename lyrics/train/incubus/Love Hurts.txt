Tonight We Drink To Youth
While Holding Fast The Truth 
Don't Wanna Lose What I Had As A Boy

My Heart Still Has A Beat
But Love Is Now A Feat
As Common As A Cold Day In LA

Sometimes When I'm Alone I Wonder
Is There A Spell That I Am Under
Keeping Me From Seeing The Real Thing

Love Hurts
But Sometimes Its A Good Hurt 
And It Feels Like I'm Alive
Love Sings 
when it transcends the bad things
have a heart and try me 
Cause without love I won't survive

I'm fettered and abused
I stand naked and accused
should I surface this one man submarine
I only want the truth
so tonight we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy

sometimes when I'm alone i wonder
is there a spell that i am under
keeping me from seeing the real thing

Love hurts
but sometimes its a good hurt
and it feels like I'm alive
love sings
when it transcends the bad things 
have a heart and try me cause without love i won't survive

Without love i won't survive

love hurts
but sometimes it's a good hurt 
and it feels like I'm alive
love sings
when it transcends the bad things
have a heart and try me 
cause without love i won't survive

love hurts
love hurts
without love I won't survive

love hurts
love hurts
without love I won't survive---Lyrics submitted by anthony.
