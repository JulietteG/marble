Wind me up
put me down
start me off and watch me go
I'll be running circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center
and i'm out of tune
just kickin this can along the avenue
But i'm alright

coz it's easy once you know how it's done
you can't stop now
it's already begun
you feel it
running through your bones

and you jerk it out
jerk it out

shut up
hush your mouth
can't you hear you talk to loud?
No I can't hear nothing 'cause I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue
But that's ok

coz it's easy once you know how it's done
you can't stop now
it's already begun
you feel it
running through your bones

so you jerk it out
jerk it out---Lyrics submitted by Vassilis.
