Are you feeling alone
Like you're so out of place
I've been there before
Stumbling every time you try
Sometime it's easier to hide

You wear your heart on your sleeve
And so do I
Just enough to believe
That we can make a change if we try
The fear becomes like dust in the light

Let go, it's your chance
To live out loud

Take this time to shine, don't waste a minute
'Cause the love you've got inside is a gift you give away
So come on, come on and radiate
Don't be shy you know you gotta live it
'Cause the light you've got inside can be the difference today
So come on, come on and radiate
I see a spark in your eyes

It's obvious
That hope is alive
You were meant for more in this life
You're glowing like the sun in the sky

Here you go, it's your chance
To live out loud

CHORUS
Don't be afraid don't be ashamed
To let it show, let 'em know, yea let it out
Love like there is no other way
No better time than now

Let go, it's your chance
To live out loud

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by kaylee helmer.
