Kinda like a dog
with seven pupils in its eye
kinda like a madness
that refuse to subside

kinda like everything you want
just w/in your grasp
kinda like how a banshee wail
dances
on a living heart

I'm gonna stand at the top of the world and
challenge the heavens
gonna bring you god
gonna bring you god!
in the palm of the left hand black
gonna bring you god!!

Kinda like when the sun goes down
and darkness makes its climb
Kinda like all your muscle tissue
starting to unwind
Kinda like if you brave the hate
feed it to the left hand black

how I know
I can take their power
send it back at triple times the strength

how I see the battle
and the bleeding human race
how I miss the taste of it
its sweet and warm embrace
how I see the world's demise
its last and final gasp
how I see reality explode
into another kind of life

I'm gonna stand at the top of the world and
challenge the heavens
gonna bring you god
gonna bring you god!
in the palm of the left hand black
gonna bring you god!!

with the power of my left hand black
gonna bring you god!!
gonna bring you god!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
