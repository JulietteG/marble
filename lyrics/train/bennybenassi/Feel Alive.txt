You can tell
When you are feeling love

And I can tell
That there is something in your eye

It's a tear, it's a tear
Falling down

It's a tear, it's a tear
Drying out

When you feel...
When you feel...

When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive

I can tell
That you are in love

And I know
What that little drop is in your eye

It's a tear, it's a tear
Of happiness

No more fear
No no more fear of loneliness

Do you feel
When you feel

When you feel
When you feel

When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive

When you feel alive
Do you feel alive
When you feel alive
Do you feel alive

I am burning, with this love
I am burning, is it love
I am burning, with this love
I am burning, is it love ---
