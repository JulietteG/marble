Play the music, play the music
Play the music, play the music
Play the music, play the music
Play the music, play the music

You got the love I like
I got to have you now
You're my emotions
Don't leave me hangin' round
Baby please,
Why don't you understand
I only want to be your friend
You are my sweet release
I got to have you now
You are my affection
Don't leave me breakin' down
Everybody in the world should hear what I'm saying
Cause I wanna scream it to the world today

Turn me up up up up up up up
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down

Play the music, play the music
Play the music, play the music

You are the man for me
I got to have you now
You got the power
Don't leave me on the ground.
Touch me babe,
You really turn me on
No no don't leave me on my own !
You are my one desire
I got to have you now,
I need your action,
I'm gonna say it loud,
Everybody in the world should hear what I'm saying
'cause I wanna scream it to the world today

Turn me up up up up up up up
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down ---
