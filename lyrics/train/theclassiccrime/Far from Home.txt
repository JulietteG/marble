I've got a bad taste in me.
Its like I"ve been robbed
Of something I once was in my childhood
Memories

And it's buried in sandboxes backyard
Back where we'd sing
That dreams could come true if believed

The sidewalks scream our names
We are so
Far From Home
Far From Home

I've got a bad
Pain in my heart.
It's like the first time that I looked in your eyes
The first time it all fell apart


And it's buried in sandboxes backyard
Back where we'd sing
That dreams could come true if believed

The sidewalks scream our names
We are so
Far From Home
Far From Home

But now
We are so
Far From Home
Far From HOme

All I have is words,
To which I'm a slave
I scribble them down
Hoping they'll save
Me but I'm lost,
I'm so lost
These pages will burn,
And I'll pass away.
Yesterdays gone
And I just can't shake
The fact that I'm lost
I'm so lost

But now
We are so
Far From Home
Far From Home

Now 
We are so
Far From Home
Far From Home

But now 
We are so
Far From Home
Far From Home
Far From Home

Now 
We are so
Far From Home
Far From Home
