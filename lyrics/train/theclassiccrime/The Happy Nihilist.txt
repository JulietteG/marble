I am a happy nihilist, no absolute truth does exist
When I decide to shake my fist, I only got myself to blame
Cause were all players and life's the game

I only take what I need, I am so light on my feet
I will not stop or concede, I am not driven by greed
No moral compass for me, it's all just natural feelings
Existence has no meaning, there's no such thing as happy
But late at night when I sleep, I dream of more than I see
There's something burning in me, a driving need to be free,
Why do I sit here and think about the things that I need?
There's nothing left to believe, oh is it all just a dream?

Ive taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like h*ll to trust nobody else but me

I used to read everything, I used to need nothing
I put my money on me, I used to be something
Now I cant sleep, cause Im not happy

Ive taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like h*ll to trust nobody else but me

Whoa oh oh
Why am I haunted by the metaphysical?
Is it a cosmic lie or is it literal?
The books I read that used to free my mind
Have made me more blind but the truth Ill find it
I was a happy nihilist
Now Im wondering why I exist

Ive taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like hell to trust nobody else but me---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
