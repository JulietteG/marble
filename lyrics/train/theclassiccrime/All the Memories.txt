I cant stop killing the songs you like..
you look at me with eyes that beat the sunrise 
no content.. no questions
we'll talk to all the others
and bring me back to earth
im thankful for your mother for what its worth..

all all the memories we had
framed in our minds like photographs
take a second take a second and make this last
you where the future meets the past
i can never fall in love again[2]

i cant stop moving cause i feel dead
give me a second and i'll turn it into a year
that you wont forget
we'll make them read our stories yeah 
we'll make them eat their words
we'll make there lives seem boring for what its worth

all all the memories we had
framed in our minds like photographs
take a second take a second and make this last
you where the future meets the past
i can never fall in love again[2]

I'll drink your poison and say
im still not going away
i'll swallow all your bombs and grenades
and love you like a tsunami wave..wave..wave.

all all the memories we had
framed in our minds like photographs
take a second take a second and make this last
you where the future meets the past
i can never fall in love again[2]

all all the memories 
framed in our minds
take a second take a second and make this last
your for the wall
i can never fall in love again...[2]
