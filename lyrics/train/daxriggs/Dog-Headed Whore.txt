We knew the devils hands,
They wish the king was dead,
How we watched upon the tombstone at the carnival,
I'm a black clown in this prison rodeo,
Struttin like a dog headed whore

Hoping the moon explodes,
Hoping the moon explodes,
Hoping the moon explodes,

Little spider
Left for germany,
There's a hell of a whole lotta stars between you and me,
Bless those black boots that i knew before,
Struttin like a dog headed whore

Hoping the moon explode
Hoping the moon explode
Hoping the moon explode
Hoping the moon explode
Hoping the moon explode
Hoping the moon explode
Hoping the moon explode---Lyrics submitted by Joey.
