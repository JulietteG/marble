Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I missed you so much, I missed you so much

Tell me is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my high (faze, phase?), woah

Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together

He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Rain spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together---
