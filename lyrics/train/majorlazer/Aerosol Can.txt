(feat. Pharrell Williams)

(Bridge)
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)
We F'in bad
We F'in bad
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)

(Verse)
Yo! When I was young and my dad had a bigger house
I'd catch a contact and talk like ika mouse
Go to school, act like I'm pullin my feet out
Kinda funny cus I used to freak my teachers out
Like yan dan didi dan dan
Seein so much bitches teach about
Piece is the one black china and they skeeter out
In the club everybody on Sinatra
Look around, everybody on Sinatra
I ain't talkin bout this shit they call cool
Like I'm talkin bout this shit just so you can go ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I mean just go bonkers cus made the young girls wild
And they go topless
With the dope boy smile, they don't need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas
Brrap brrap brrap they got ya

(Hook)
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom
Shootin all night, bom bom bom bom
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Bangin on that ass like orangutan
Transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We be F'in bad)

(Verse)
Skateboard, can a nigga make more?
Steal my style? I ain't got no reward
Like hmm, make yoself bigger like mushroom
Mario Kart
All yall niggas wanna get like me
All yall niggas wanna spit like key
Missionary, wanna hit it like me
Meanwhile yo bitch wanna kiss my dick
Chow rubber so you hit that ass for the combo
Act 47 and the dress on a rhino, boom
Commodore like Lionel, zoom
Hold on that ass like a move a-ron
Am I wrong?
Ride her with my dick mane, all night long
One second I'm here, next second I'm gone
That's 2 in 60 seconds, nigga what you want?
Girls on me like they superglued on
My dick like a table you can place food on
Make sexual all day long
I'm high like the place mow lawn

(Hook)
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom
Shootin all night, bom bom bom bom
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Bangin on that ass like orangutan
Transform to a grown man
And transform again like

(Verse)
Come in, I'm hot like the place too son
BBC, icecream skewed on
No discounts, no coupons
But I got the Rolls Royce for the great poopon
Now you jealous, wit yo face screwed on
Who on? You on?
Feeble ass nigga, you get boot on
Strictly attitude get messy, food on
Boy peace? You wrong
Retrieving it, you don't wanna feud on
Your nerves in there for a big dude on
Stompin that nigga until you done
Hopin that you make it home wit yo shoes on
While I'm torin these booties, scorin these movies
I know boy can let it when I'm chillin wit Stewie
Ass small, jig is what I did for Louie
Sunglasses, campaign and jewelry
Ask how bad, how you really wanna use me
Cookin croissant, I ain't usin that loosely
Look at yo forehead, sweatin profusely

(Hook)
Ring, bom bom bom bom
Aerosol can, bom bom bom bom
Monkey outside, bom bom bom bom
Shootin all night, bom bom bom bom
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Bangin on that ass like orangutan
Transform to a grown man
And transform again like

Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)
Fast wind, slow wind (we F'in bad)---
