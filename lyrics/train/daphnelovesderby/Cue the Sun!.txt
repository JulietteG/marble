If I find my way through the darkest of days,
will I laugh about the things that kept me awake?
But if my greatest fears paints a song so crystal clear,
will I run away or will I hide?

Chorus:
And if I don't come home tonight just know I tried my best to fight,
please don't think I plan to lose to the night.
And crystal moon so dull and bright, my heavy soul can't stand the light.
It burns me straight to the bones, my bones.

In the desert sun I watched my nerves come undone
one by one like strings they tangle into knots
Ever since that day deep in Santa Fe,
I've learned to keep myself from giving everything away.

Chorus:
And if I don't come home tonight just know I tried my best to fight,
please don't think I plan to lose to the night.
And crystal moon so dull and bright, my heavy soul can't stand the light.
It burns me straight to the bones, my bones.

Chorus:
And if I don't come home tonight just know I tried my best to fight,
please don't think I plan to lose to the night.
And crystal moon so dull and bright, my heavy sould can't stand the light.
It burns me straight to the bones, my bones.---Lyrics submitted by tiana.
