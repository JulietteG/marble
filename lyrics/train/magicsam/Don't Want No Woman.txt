I don't want no woman tellin' me what to do
I don't want no woman tellin' me what to do

Yes I'm grown now darling, just as grown as you

I don't want no woman tellin' me this and that
I don't want no woman tellin' me this and that

It makes me mad darling, and I don't go for that

Now you drink your whisky and I drink my wine
You tend to your business, and I tend to mine

I don't want no woman tellin' me how to live my life
Yes I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't want no wife

You used to boss your mens, well that I wont deny
Before I let you boss me, I lay down and die

I don't want no woman tellin' me how to live my life
Yes I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't want no wife

You used to boss your mens, well that I wont deny
Before I let you boss me, I lay down and die

I don't want no woman tellin' me how to live my life
Yes I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't want no wife

I don't want no woman tellin' me how to live my life
I don't want no woman tellin' me how to live my life
Yes I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't want no wife---Lyrics submitted by Rodrigo Lisseck.
