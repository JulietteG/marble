Emcees, tryin' ta play post, play me up close, brag and
boast
Ya know
Things like that make me weary, but
I never let a rapper get near me, cuz
I'm Rob Base, pick up the pace
It takes more than beats to rock this place
It takes more than rhymes to rock this time
Rhyme for rhyme, the Base design
M.C.'s get mad, cuz I'm blowin' up
To every battle, the Base keeps showin' up
A fast tempo, a-with a hook
Don't judge a book by the way that the cover look
Cuz I'm mean, reign supreme
Wrote my first rhyme at the age of fifteen
I'm like a match, when struck I burn
Not concerned cuz I'm sure that ya won't learn
Now git up, and let's start
I wanna see which sucka got heart
I get fresh as I get older
Every time I rock I get bolder
So don't sleep, and say I'm wack
Cuz if ya do ya get backslap (backslap)

Chorus:
If it's not in your vision
Don't sleep on it
Don't sleep on it

Don't make a-no decision
TURN IT UP! (On the bass right now)

Drop your ego, and let me go
And just show what I know cuz I'm on the go
I rock smooth, bust a move, hit me
And the way I perform, you can't forget me
Clear off the smoke, this ain't a joke
The new kid on the block is like dope
Been here for a while, been all punishment
But now I'm on (I'mon), so let's start it
No I'm not retarded, or either crazy
I work hard, I'm not lazy
Rappers don't faze me, or eith-amaze me
Or either come up close and just graze me
Coolin', neva be a fool, and
Gimme just a little mo' time I be rulin
Tell it to the mack, cuz I'm on wax
But should I pay tac, or should I just act
To get a new job, yes, time is what I'm pressed for
Every time I perform ya want more so (so...)

Chorus

Aaaaaah, break it down, to get the dope sound
Then hang around with the posse from Uptown
On the Ave, they get cash
But I leave it alone cuz I'm a smash
On the mic, I think differently, a-from another or
other MC who
Intervene, try to just rip up the Rob on the sneak
tip
I get mad, they get sad, or either rag the had cuz I'm
that bad
I'm not frontin', cuz this is my theory
You don't believe me, so just hear me
I rock harder, I rock longer
I do this cuz I gotta get stronger
A lotta rappers rhyme harder, and meaner
But I rhyme with the sound that's cleaner
"I ain't nuthin'", that's what they say
Well OK if they wanna play that way
Cuz I'm Rob buttkickin' Base
What rapper's next to be erased?
On my list, I'm not known to diss
But I'll do it, so don't sleep on this, c'mon

Chorus

Hit it, admit it, ya did it, ya can't fit it
So forget it cuz I know you ain't wit' it
In the centre, I didn't rent her
Sat 'cha butt in the chair, got a splintuh!
Back in the days, amazed by the rap phrase
Rap today, to me it don't faaaaaaze me
I'm not another M.C., or angry by the way ya speak to
me
Jealousy; what makes you wanna battle me
Dope beats; what makes you wanna idol me
It ain't nuthin' to me or E-Z
Cuz I'm the R, the O, the B, and he's E-Z
I bust a fee wherever it be, ya see
He or me, the E, the Z, the A, the B
Alphabet's from A to Z, ya see
I'm not tryin' to confuse your mind
I'm just tryin' to pump this plain old fresh rhyme
I stay calm, rap like a pro
I know ya know, so let's go, c'mon!

Chorus

Now E-Z Rock, you remember how we did it before
I want you to do it one more time, for ya mind
1-2-3, give it to 'em

If it's not (scratching)
Don't sleep on it, come on!
If it, if it, if it's not (scratching)
Don't sleep on it, come on!
