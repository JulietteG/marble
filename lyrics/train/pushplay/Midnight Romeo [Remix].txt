Meet me at my door,
By the end of the night, you'll be screaming for
More, more, more of me
Tonight's a big night, so lets make history.
My lips, touch your lips.
My hands on your hips,
What's it gonna take, 
For you to give me my good night kiss? 

Oh, woah
My heart is beating fast but my hands are moving slow.
Oh, woah
And it feels so right you just cant say no.....

Late night, gonna hit the town 
Gonna take you out, 
Gonna make you glow,
Woah oh. 
Midnight Romeo
Show me yours and I'll show you mine,
Gonna make you sweat, 
Gonna feel it head to toe,
You know,
I'm your Midnight Romeo

I'll be your Dr. Jekyll and your Mr. Hyde
The best of both worlds when you get inside my
Place, place, place, with me
You'll be the lock
I'll be the key
The nights about to end
Tell me baby are we more than friends?
Tonight your dinner's free
What's in it for me?

Oh, woah
My heart is beating fast but my hands are moving slow.
Oh, woah
And it feels so right you just cant say no.....

Late night, gonna hit the town 
Gonna take you out, 
Gonna make you glow,
woah oh. 
Midnight Romeo
show me yours and ill show you mine,
Gonna make you sweat, 
Gonna feel it head to toe,
You know, 
I'm your Midnight Romeo

Now it's time to turn the lights down low
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Gonna make you sweat 
Gonna be your Romeo
In my head its time to lose control
woah woah
I'm your Midnight Romeo

Late night, gonna hit the town 
Gonna take you out 
Gonna make you glow
woah woah

Late night, gonna hit the town 
Gonna take you out 
Gonna make you glow 
whoa oh
Midnight Romeo
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Gonna make you sweat 
Gonna feel it head to toe
You know 
I'm your Midnight Romeo

Late night, Gonna hit the town 
Gonna take you out
Gonna make you glow
whoa oh
Midnight Romeo
Show me yours and I'll show you mine 
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna feel it head to toe
You know 
I'm your Midnight Romeo.---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
