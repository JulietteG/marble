If I could then I would
Take you away from here tonight
You're the air I breathe
Do you remember
Those cold Decembers
With you wrapped around me as tight as a glove?
We watched the stars in the sky
Midnight blue matches your eyes
Together forever and ever she said
But she lied
Nothing can last forever

Chorus:
If I could then I would
Take you away from here tonight
You're the air I breathe
If I could turn back time
I'd do it all to make you mine
Starlight Addiction

I'm always dreaming
Never stopped believing
That you could still be standing right next to me
We watched the stars in the sky
Midnight blue matches your eye
Together forever and ever she said
But she lied
Nothing can last forever

Chorus

the life lyrics

They say we're wasting time
Walking like we're blind
Our look
Trying to find the reason why
Our lines are so unpredictable
My life is not for sale
This one never fails
Not this time
I won't fail
This is our one shot
To break free from this lie

This is the life
This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute
Every second is so real

Now we're on the road
Playing sold out shows
And now they don't know
Who we are tonight
The crowd screams for one more

This is the life
This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute
Every second is so real

This is the life
This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute
Every second is so real

This is the life
This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute
Every second is so real

This is the life
This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute
Every second is so real

This is the life
This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute
Every second is so real---Lyrics submitted by Jemco.
