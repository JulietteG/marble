Cover girl
Lately, I'm feeling just a little bit shaky
I'm looking for a girl who won't talk back
This and that, leave me in the dust

On page three
I think I might have found the girl of my dreams
She's the kind of girl who always looks great
Never late, a girl that I can trust

I'm turning the page right now
I'm done, just so you know

I'm in love with the girl in the photograph
When I look at her she's looking back at me
She's the girl in the magazine
Whoa, whoa, she's the girl in the magazine

I saw her on the cover of seventeen
With baby blue eyes looking back at me
I wish there was a way she could pop out
Hang out, come till I'll break free

You can call me crazy
I'm falling for a paper back lady
She's the only girl that will fight me
Spite me, girl who never leaves

I'm turning the page right now
I'm done, just so you know

I'm in love with the girl in the photograph
When I look at her she's looking back at me
G-g-g-girl in the magazine

I'm in love with the girl in the photograph
When I look at her she's looking back at me
She's the girl in the magazine

You know you're missin' out, baby
Look at this photograph
Maybe she's more brittle than you
Could ever be and I swear

I've never been so happy
Since the day you left me
She's more real than you

But lately, I'm feeling just a little bit shaky
I'm still looking for a girl who won't talk back, this and that
Leave me in my dust

I'm in love with the girl in the photograph
When I look at her she's looking back at me
G-g-g-girl in the magazine

I'm in love with the girl in the photograph
When I look at her she's looking back at me
She's the girl in the magazine
Whoa, whoa, she's the girl in the magazine---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
