From the chapel to the parking lot
All the Scriptures that she had forgot
Memories so overwrought
De murder Adieu for tonight
Never been such a delight
To make a human sacrifice 
Can meet in the alleyway 
You've got this occupation
And obligations to
Be sure that he suffers
Be sure that he fights
Say goodnight
Say goodnight (say goodnight)
She feels no contrite 

[Chorus:]
This wont be the first to last, its just about time
When it goes by so fast 
When dealing with the perfect crime
Wait by the balery led over to a charade
Wait for the cue
And strike with dismay

The night is young at the cabaret 
She makes sure her hair wont shake
To hesitate its no mistake
Shhh (ahh)
But pressure rises, her hands sweat
Its all procedure its a set 
He could see her silhouette 
Don't run tonight
It's out of his hands tonight
Her fingers on the trigger what a pleasant surprise
The look in her eyes
The demonic look in her eyes
Tell the whole story it's one simple line
(one simple line)
The job was a sight

[Chorus:]
This wont be first to last its just about time
When it goes by so fast
When dealing with the perfect crime
Wait by the balery led over to charade
Wait for the cue
And strike with dismay

There she goes again
There she goes again
There she goes again

Without a trace the scene was left with hints of your grace
And don't repent, the past has foregone time to move on (move on)
Till you're next in tombs to rot---Lyrics submitted by Karina.
