Jenny was a young girl
sitting by the fire
waiting for her knight to come
everyday she waited, looking out the window
hoping that her knight would come

It's too late, it's too late
na na na na na na na na na
It's too late, it's to late

Danny was young boy
sitting at a table
playing with the dirty cards
hiding all the jokers, hitting all the aces
playing with the dirty cards

It's too late, it's too late
na na na na na na na na na
It's too late, it's to late

(na na na na na na na na na x 4)

Jenny had a letter
wrote in on a monday
sent it far away from home
everyday she waited, looking out the window
hoping her reply would come

It's too late, it's too late
na na na na na na na na na
It's too late, it's to late

Early in the morning
Danny found a letter
read it till the pages tore
kept it in a dark place, pulled it out in secret
read it till the pages tore

It's too late, it's too late
na na na na na na na na na
It's too late, it's too late

(na na na na na na na na na x 4)

D-d-danny and Jenny, whoa whoa
