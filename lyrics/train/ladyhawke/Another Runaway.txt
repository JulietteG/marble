I never said I was a one time woman 
I never wrote it 
I never said it 
I should have known you`d leave me out here hanging on 
I should have seen it 
I didn't get it 

Oh oh oh I don't believe it 
Oh oh oh you never mean it 

It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to call back yesterday 
It's too late, it's too late I'm just another runaway 
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to call back yesterday 
It's too late, it's too late I'm just a 
Another runaway, another runaway 
Another runaway, another runaway 

You always said I was your part time woman 
I don't believe it 
I didn't see it 
You always acting like a part time wanna be 
I shoulda seen it 
I didn't get it 

Oh oh oh I don't believe it 
Oh oh oh you never mean it 

It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to call back yesterday 
It's too late, it's too late I'm just another runaway 
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to call back yesterday 
It's too late, it's too late I'm just a 
Another runaway, another runaway 
Another runaway, another runaway 
Another runaway, another runaway 

Oh oh oh I don't believe it 
Oh oh oh you never mean it 

It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to call back yesterday 
It's too late, it's too late I'm just another runaway 
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to call back yesterday 
It's too late, it's too late I'm just a 
Another runaway, another runaway 
Another runaway, another runaway---Lyrics submitted by Charley.
