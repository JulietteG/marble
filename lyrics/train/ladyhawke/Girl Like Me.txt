Im on a high and I dont even know why
Im gonna shin myself before your innocent eyes
Youre ready now to forget what we have
Youd better seal it tight before the memories go bad

Between devil in the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hands
Its all down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me [2x]

Its getting late and I pretend not to see
Im planning my move in, just you sounded creepy
I I I I I I I I I heard youre leaving and Ill never know why

Between devil in the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hands
Its all down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me [2x]

I I I I I I I I I heard youre leaving and Ill never know why

Between devil in the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hands
Its all down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
