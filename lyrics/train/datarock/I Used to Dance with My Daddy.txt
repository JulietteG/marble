Put your hands on the phone-a
Dial the number
See that you're free to be carrying on-a
When you gonna?
We'll succumb
but let the rhythm take control and move along
alright

It's a thing that you sing when you don't want to ring
one of the people that you see downtown
who's the real clown?
you want to go to the show, although it's a slow-mo...

I used to dance with my daddy, yeah?!

Put your hands on the phone-a
Dial the number
See that you're free to be carrying on-a
Race with the pace
of the people these days
That's a bass, start a waste
It's okay, it's all night!

It's a thing that you sing when you don't want to ring
one of the people that you see downtown
who's the real clown?
you want to go to the show, although it's a slow-mo...

I used to dance with my daddy, yeah?!---Lyrics submitted by Seras.
