[ ]= Voices in the background

I'd wanna go to the Blues Parties
[The Caribbean]
I'd wanna Dance to Nothern Soul
]Back in the Seventies]
Be into Two Tone and Post Punk
]New Wave and No Wave]
I'd Wanna Live on Lower East Side
]Back in the Seventies]

Cause all the Best of the Early Eighties
]At least up to '83]
Was an Extension of Seventies
Postmodernity

I'd be a Fan of Fela Kuti
]And a Feminist]
And I'd be Dancing at the Disco
]Back in the Seventies]
Be into YMO and DEVO
[Cultural Relativist]
I'd be Engaged in the Computer Age
[Back in the Seventies]

How Sick It Would've Been
To be There
In the Middle of the Past
And the Future
You'd Know It Couldn't Last...

As the Story Goes Now
And Everybody Knows
Even History'll Show How
Everything Revolves
Around Peaks like Those

How to Outgrow Being a Moron?
[Stuck in the Eighties]
Do as D A T A R O C K
Take a Look at the Seventies---Lyrics submitted by Seras.
