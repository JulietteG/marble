If these streets could talk
Theyd tell us things
Of shattered hearts and wars unseen
Its a battle we cant win alone
We need saving desperately
He made a way, said follow Me
Give up your life for something more
Oh, what are we waiting for
Lets take it around the world
Well start a fight and join the fight
In this love riot
Oh, ready, set, here we go
From London (New York) to Tokyo
You gotta unite and
Join the fight in this love riot
We are an army of the truth
Were on the march to rescue you
Dont have to make it on your own
Were holy rebels and when we yell
The mountains fall, the oceans swell
This is the time to let them know
Well take to the streets, yeah
Well take to the streets
Exploding with love
Hes already won this, already won this
What are we waiting for
What are we waiting for---
