"God's Not Dead (Like A Lion)"

Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold
To see a revolution somehow

Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold
To see a revolution somehow
Now I'm lost in Your freedom
In this world I'll overcome

My God's not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion [x2]

Roaring He's roaring roaring like a lion

Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
My faith is dead I need resurrection somehow
Now I'm lost in Your freedom
In this world I'll overcome

My God's not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion [x2]

Roaring He's roaring roaring like a lion
Roaring He's roaring

Let heaven roar and fire fall
Come shake the ground
With the sounds of revival [x3]

My God's not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion [x4]

He's Roaring He's roaring He's roaring like a lion [x2]---
