Through You the blind will see
Through You the mute will sing
Through You the dead will rise
Through You the our hearts will praise
Through You the darkness flees
Through You my heart screams 

(chorus)
I am free
Yes I am free
I am free to run (I am free to run)
I am free to dance (I am free to dance)
I am free to live for You (I am free to live for You)
I am free (I am free)
Yes I am free (I am free)

Through You the Kingdom comes
Through You the battle's won
Through You I'm not afraid
Through You the price is paid
Through You there's victory
Because of You my heart sings

(chorus)

Who the Son sets free - is free indeed
Who the Son sets free - is free indeed

I am free to run (I am free to run)
I am free to dance (I am free to dance)
I am free to live for You (I am free to live for You)
I am free (I am free)
Yes I am free (I am free)---Lyrics submitted by Genny.
