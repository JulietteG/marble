One to another,
Do you remember me?
I feel so small,
Well are you listening?
Tonight,
So temporary,
The things that I have seen,
I ran so far,
Will you take me back again?

CHORUS:
Entertaining angels by the light of my TV screen,
24/7 You wait for me,
Entertaining angels by the time I fall to my knees,
Host of heaven sing over me,

One to another,
The feelings in between,
I won't let go,
Of all you taught me,
Alright,
Close as a brother,
The way we used to be,
I'll hold my breath,
And I'll wait for You to breath.

CHORUS:
Entertaining angels by the light of my TV screen,
24/7 You wait for me,
Entertaining angels while the night becomes history,
Host of Heaven sing over me.

Entertaining angels by the light of my TV screen,
24/7 You wait for me,
Entertaining angels by the time I fall to my knees,
Host of heaven sing over me.

Entertaining angels by the light of my TV screen,
24/7 You wait for me,
Entertaining angels while the night becomes history,
Host of Heaven sing over me.

Entertaining angels by the light of my TV screen,
24/7 You wait for me,
Entertaining angels by the time I fall to my knees,
Host of heaven sing over me.

Entertaining angels by the light of my TV screen,
24/7 You wait for me,
Entertaining angels while the night becomes history,
Host of Heaven sing over me.---Lyrics submitted by Fred.
