Dream away child
Let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries
Might claim you

Dream away child
Let your dreams run wild
Or the years
And the tears shed
Might tame you

For the last time we have
Tasted love's sweet tears
By the fire's glow

If our hearts are strong
There'll be no long
Goodbyes when it's time to go

But the strongest hearts are sometimes broken
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken
And the greatest wounds we hide inside ourselves where they never show

Dream away child
Let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries
Might claim you

Dream away child
Let your dreams run wild
Or the years
And the tears shed
Might tame you

When the winter weds the northern wind
The child they bear is snow
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids
But the trees will grow

Sun and earth in time will come together
God will give us back our summer weather
But the memories of that first sweet taste of love
Pass away so slow

Can the wise men count the pointless lies we tell
Or the price we pay
And are songs a place to keep those words of love
That we couldn't say
When there's no room left to live inside ourselves
Do we dream away
