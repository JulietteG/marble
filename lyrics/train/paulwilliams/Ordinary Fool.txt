Only a fool, like fools before me
I always think with my heart
Only a fool
That same old story
Seems I was born for the part

It's a lesson that I've learned
And a page I should have turned
I shouldn't cry, but I do
Like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through

How many times have I mistaken
Good looks and laughs for bad news
How many times have I mistaken
Love songs and laughs for the blues

When a road I've walked before
Ends alone at my front door
I shouldn't cry, but I do
Like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through---
