Love and I were strangers
Till you and I were friends
Into the shadows of my life
You brought sympathy and sunshine
I wish that we could still be friends

Once I held you now you've gone
And now each day must end with another night alone
Is there no one I can turn to
I wish that we could still be friends

Nobody moves me like you do
Your magic just goes on and on
We used to wake up every morning
Safe and warm
We'd laugh away the chill
I'd laugh again
If we could still be friends

Life is not a love song
But broken hearts will mend
And in the quiet of my room
We might sit and hold the pieces
I think that we could still be friends

Nobody moves me like you do
Your magic lust goes on and on
We used to wake up every morning
Safe and warm
We'd laugh away the chill
I'd laugh again
If we could still be friends

Love can put things back again
I wish that we could still be friends---
