If dreams are a shadow of love, fame and fortune that adorn the night
Some fade away quickly and lose all their meaning in the morning light
Yes some dreams are lifeless ,their life entertainment meaning nothing more
But there are dreams holding promise worth waiting for...

Save me a dream, as perfect as the night is long,
Save me a dream ,as secure as your arms a shelter were we both belong
And our love can bring the stars, even closer than they seen 
Save me a place in your heart, save me a dream

Some call you crazy, and convinced that you're lazy, if you dream by day
When were dreaming were list'ning, if somebody's whisp'ring who knows what they'll say
Some find a purpose, a sense of direction in a wandering mind
If ideas are prizes, like children of angels who knows what we'll say....

Save me a dream, as perfect as the night is long
save me a dream, as secure as your arms a shelter wre we both belong
And our love can bring the stars, even closer than they seen
Save me a place in your heart, save me a dream

Save me place in your heart, save me a dream.---Lyrics submitted by raquel.
