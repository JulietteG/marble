Whenever I need to leave it all behind
Or feel the need to get away
I find a quiet place
Far from the human race
Out in the country

Before the breathing air is gone
Before the sun
Is just a bright spot in the night time
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone
And take back something worth remembering

Whenever I feel they're closing in on me
Or need a bit of room to move
When life becomes too fast
I find relief at last
Out in the country

Before the breathing air is gone
Before the sun
Is just a bright spot in the night time
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone
And take back something worth remembering ---
