(Short turn around)

V1: 
what a journey what a journey its been
Paul was a prisoner on a journey oer the sea
And his ship with the tempest was tossed
But an angel of God stood by him and said 
Fear not ,for none will be lost

Chorus:          
What a journey its been since I met the master
And Jesus saved me from sin
The journey is been long and I m nearing the end
What a journey what a journey its been

Break 

V2:
 Now I started on this journey years ago with the Lord
And sometimes my ships in a storm
But the Lord, has kept his promise to never leave me alone
And someday my ship will sail home

Chorus:       
What a journey its been since I met the master
And Jesus saved me from sin
The journey is been long and I m nearing the end
What a journey what a journey its been

Tag:            
The journey is been long and I m nearing the end
What a journey what a journey its been---Lyrics submitted by keith.
