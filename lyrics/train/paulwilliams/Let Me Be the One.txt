Some sleepless night
If you should find yourself alone
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one

To set things right
When this old world's turned upside down
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one

For love and understanding
To find a quiet place
For silent understanding
A loving touch
Come to me

When things go wrong
And there's no love to light the way
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one---
