Just an old fashioned love song playing on the radio
And wrapped around the music is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back 'cause they've never really gone

Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

To weave our dream upon and listen to each evening when the lights are low

To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings that we've come to know
You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back 'cause they've never really gone

Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me---
