In the book of Jeremiah, chapter 6 and verse 16
He tells us how we need to live, its a way thats good and clean
He tells us how we need to walk no matter where we go
If well walk in the old path well find rest for our soul

Chorus
Seek ye out the old path and walk therein
Cried Jeremiah the prophet but they would not hear him
Seek ye out the old path and walk therein
Stop following after the flesh stumbling around in sin
Now the old way
Its a good way
And its Gods way
And we better walk therein

2.	
Theres a man on the inside of every one thats born again
He tells us how we need to live if well listen to him
Hell keep us on the old path and we wont go astray
Hell help our lives to be a light to someone thats unsaved

Chorus
Seek ye out the old path and walk therein
Cried Jeremiah the prophet but they would not hear him
Seek ye out the old path and walk therein
Stop following after the flesh stumbling around in sin
Now the old way
Its a good way
And its Gods way
And we better walk therein---Lyrics submitted by shelia steel.
