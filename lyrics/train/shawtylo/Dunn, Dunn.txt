Ay what you blind need some glasses to see?

Bumpin' system see the **** my way
Got them cd's and them thangs on the highway
We get it in 'til six in the mornin'
Chiver st. bowen homes me and my homies

Done done it all done done it all i've done it all i've done it all
Well mention bankhead they're not lyin' it's me
Done done it all done done it all i've done it all i've done it all

Well mention bankhead they're not lyin' it's me

Done done it all done done it all i've done it all i've done it all
