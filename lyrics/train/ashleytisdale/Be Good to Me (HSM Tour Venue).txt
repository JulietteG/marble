Everyday is getting worse
 Do the same things and it hurts
 I don't know if I should cry
 All I know is that I'm tryin'
 I wanna believe in you
 I wanna believe in you
 But you make it so hard to do

What's the point of makin' plans
 You break all the ones we had
 I don't know where we went wrong
 Cause we used to be so strong
 I wanna believe in you
 I wanna believe in you

So why can't you be
 Be good to me

I don't ask for much
 All I want is love
 Someone to see
 That's all I need
 Somebody to be
 Somebody to be
 Somebody to be
 Good to me
 Good to me
 Gotta be good to me
 Good to me
 Please

I used to think I had it all
 Then one day we hit a wall
 I had hoped you were the one
 Where's my dream, where has it gone
 I wanted to be with you
 Forever just me and you

So why can't you be
 Be good to me

I don't ask for much

All I want is love
 Someone to see
 That's all I need
 Somebody to be
 Somebody to be
 Somebody to be
 Good to me
 Good to me
 Gotta be good to me
 Good to me
 Please

Where do I go from here
 You've gotten under my skin
 And I don't know how
 To get out of this place that I'm in

I don't ask for much
 All I want is love
 Someone to see
 That's all I need
 Somebody to be
 Somebody to be
 Somebody to be
 Good to me
 Good to me
 Gotta be good to me
 Good to me
 Please

I don't ask for much
 All I want is love
 Someone to see
 That's all I need
 Somebody to be
 Someone to be
 Somebody to be
 Good to me
 Good to me
 Gotta be good to me
 Good to me
 Please---Lyrics submitted by Vernonica.
