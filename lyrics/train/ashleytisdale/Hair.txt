Im in disarray
Im unkempt
And I love ya, sugar

Yeah this is what you do

When you run your fingers through my hair
In the morning Im feeling like a sexy superstar

Wow, wow
You rock my party
Wanna make you say
Youre the only one that keeps me singing la la la
I love to smell your t-shirt
I like the way you are
But most of all I like it - like it

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good
I like what you do to my hair
Toss it and tease it
Run your fingers through it
Love how you do it

Now go and mess it up, mess it up
Baby, mess it up
Mess it up, mess it up
Do it till I cant get enough

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good

Im imperfect
So Im me
But I love ya, sugar

See this is what you do

You get my ponytail beside my bangs unlockable
But I dont mind cause I think its kinda super cool

Wow, wow
You rock my party
Wanna make you say
Youre the only one that keeps me singing la la la
I love to smell your t-shirt
I like the way you are
But most of all I like it - like it

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good
I like what you do to my hair
Toss it and tease it
Run your fingers through it
Love how you do it

Now go and mess it up, mess it up
Baby mess it up
Mess it up, mess it up
Do it till I cant get enough

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good

Tonight Im gonna fix it up real nice
Ill surely tell grab the girls
I want you to mess em up
Ill put on a bow
Cause I want you to know
That you got your name on my heart
Youre wicked bad
And I like the way that you do it baby

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good

I like what you do to my hair
Toss it and tease it
Run your fingers through it
Love how you do it

Now go and mess it up, mess it up
Baby mess it up
Mess it up, mess it up
Do it till I cant get enough

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
