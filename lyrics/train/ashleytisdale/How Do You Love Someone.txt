Momma never taught me how to love, daddy never taught me how to feel,
Momma never taught me how to touch, daddy never showed me how to heal
momma never set a good example, daddy never held mommas hand
momma found everything hard to handle, daddy never stood up like a man

Ive walked alone, broken, emotionally frozen
Getting it on, getting it wrong


How do you love someone, without getting hurt
How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, How do you love someone
How do you love, How do you love someone

I was always a chosen child, the biggest scandal I became
They told me Id never survive, but survive was my middle name!

Ive walked alone, hoping, just barely coping
Getting it on, getting it wrong

How do you love someone, without getting hurt
How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, How do you love someone
How do you love, How do you love someone

Its hard to talk
To see whats deep inside
It's hard to tell the truth, when you've always lied! 

How do you love someone, without getting hurt
How do you love someone without crawling in the dirt
So far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, How do you love someone
How do you love, How do you love someone

How do you love someone, and make it last, how do you love someone, without shrinking on the past
so far in my life clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love, How do you love someone
How do you love, How do you love someone
Someone.---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
