I'm a mess when it comes to you, 
I've got no inhibitions whatsoever, 
It's true, 
I'm not the kindda girl who runs around like this, 
Caught up in a kiss, 
Best friends with benefits, 
No, 
But you're so racy, 
You're my favourite guy, 
So unruly, 
So uncivilized, 
Cupid got me right between my eyes, 
You know you got bit real bad, 
Doin' things that you never did, 

Ooh, Ooh, 
You wake up in your bra & your make-up, 
Ooh, Ooh, 
Car in the driveway, 
Parked sideways, 
Yeah, I know this is killin' me, 
I'm leavin' every peice of my conscience behind, 
Ooh, Ooh, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
With you, 

With you, 
I never knew, 
Never knew it could be so fun, 
It's true, 
I was such a good good girl, 
Before you came along, 
But you're so racy, 
You're my favourite guy, 
So unruly, 
So uncivilized, 
Cupid got me right between my eyes, 
You know you got bit real bad, 
Doin' things that you never did, 

Ooh, Ooh, 
You wake up in your bra & your make-up, 
Ooh, Ooh, 
Car in the driveway, 
Parked sideways, 
Yeah, I know this is killin' me, 
I'm leavin' every peice of my conscience behind, 
Ooh, Ooh, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
With you, 

I'm getting speeding tickets, 
I'm acting just like a misfit, 
I've got all my mail piled up to the ceiling, 
You're making me irresponsible, 
'Cause I just wanna be with you, 
Act rambunctious and see what I do, 
Go hard, 
Hit the gas, 
Live your life like it's all you had, 
Just push harder, 
Make it last, 
All this love is worth it, 
Hot mess, 
Hot mess, 

Ooh, Ooh, 
You wake up in your bra & your make-up, 
Ooh, Ooh, 
Car in the driveway, 
Parked sideways, 
Yeah, I know this is killin' me, 
I'm leavin' every peice of my conscience behind, 
Ooh, Ooh, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
I'm such a hot mess, 
With you---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
