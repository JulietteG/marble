Youre dead! (Dead!)
Dead to me, Im dead (Dead!)
Dead to you, youre dead (Dead!)
Dead to me, Ill always be with you

Remember the day I lost you.
Remember the day we died.
Youll never forget, and never regret, 
The day that could never die.

Forever Ill be around you. 
Forever Ill be your side.
And now we can say, and as we play, 
The day that could never die. 
The day that could never die!

Youre dead! (Dead!)
Dead to me, Im dead (Dead!)
Dead to you, youre dead (Dead!)
Dead to me, Ill always be with you

No longer will I bleed my trust 
My blood is turning into rust
Were stranded, were screwed, 
I'm stuck here with you 
The day that could never die.

Together were going crazy.
Together were out of our minds. 
Were stuck in this cell, 
This personal hell, 
The day that could never die.
The day that could never die!

Youre dead! (Dead!)
Dead to me, Im dead (Dead!)
Dead to you, youre dead (Dead!)
Dead to me, Ill always be with you

(Guitar Break) 

Youre dead! (Dead!)
Dead to me, Im dead (Dead! Dead!)
Dead to you, youre dead (Dead!)
Dead to me, Ill always be with you (Dead!)
Dead to me, Im dead (Dead! Dead!)
Dead to you, youre dead (Dead! Dead!)
Dead to me, Ill always be with you!---Lyrics submitted by Ket Lyonesse.
