release this body
cleanse my soul
from the begining
bring on the exorchrist 

release this body
cleanse my soul
from the begining
bring on the exo christ

Take my life
I dont want purity
No longer weak inside
This evil's taking over me
Set me free from this insanity
I offer you this soul
Fill it with your prayer for me

My shattered bones and blackend heart
Will tear your fucking face apart
No longer will i walk alone
My body now becomes it's own

I feel a presence taking over me

release this body
cleanse my soul
from the begining
bring on the exo christ

Free of rage, no longer will i fear
My eyes see past the light 
can see the world for what its worth
time has come to leave this world behind
no longer bound to crash this darkness carries me away

I feel a presence taking over me

release this body
cleanse my soul
from the beggining
bring on the exochrist

Help them drag me to hell
set me free drag me to hell
help them drag me to hell
set me free fucking drag me to hell

I feel a presence taking over me

release this body
cleanse my soul
from the begining
bring on the exo christ

release this body
cleanse my soul
from the begining
bring on the exo christ

Take this life
uplift the exochrist---Lyrics submitted by Stephen Jones.
