Home for the holiday
Thinking I'd stay away, oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby, I'm on my way home
We been together for awhile now, oh oh
And there's nothing more important
Than being with you

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I'd stay away, oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby, I'm on my way home

We made the most of not much at all, yeah
Survive on our faith and our love, oh
Look at our family so beautiful, yeah
And I can't wait to get home
In love with you

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I'd stay away, but oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby, I'm on my way home

I'll never leave you for long
You are the beat of my heart
Baby, hold on
We have memories of love, love
Home

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I'd stay away, but oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby, I'm on my way home

I'll be home for the holidays
You was thinking I'd stay away, but oh no
Can't wait to see your smiling face
Baby, I'm on my way home

To see you
Home, home
To see you
Home, home
Home---
