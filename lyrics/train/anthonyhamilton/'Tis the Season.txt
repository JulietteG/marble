I wish, every day would feel like this
Wish every moment could be like this
A home filled with love, family and friends
Will toast to the season, 'tis the season

I'm so glad I found today ('tis the season)
Hear the children while they play ('tis the season)
I'm so glad that we're all here ('tis the season)
May another year ('tis the season)

I wish every day would smell like this
Stuff every meal with love this this
But gather round the table (and joy) and bliss
and toast every season ('tis the season)

I'm so glad about everything (ohh everything)
I'm so glad about everything (everything my heart desires)
I'm so glad about joy and I'm not praised, for us
for us, woaaah

Tis the season, 'tis the season,
I'm glad we're here, ('tis the season)
Made another year, yeah ('tis the season)
As we watch the children while they play
I'm glad, as we watch the children.. while they play

Ooh the love we had,
I'm so glad, we're together
watching the children whilst they play, woah, woah---
