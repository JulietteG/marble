I cant see the stars 
anymore living here. 

Let's go to the hills 
where the outlines are clear. 

Bring on the wonder 
Bring on the song 
I've pushed you down deep 
In my soul 
For too long.

I fell through the cracks 
at the end of our street.

Lets go to the beach 
get the sand 
through our feet.

Bring on the wonder 
bring on the song 
I pushed you down deep
in my soul 
for too long.

Bring on the wonder 
We got it all wrong 
We pushed you down deep 
In our souls for to long.

I don't have the 
Time for a drink 
From the cup.

Let's rest for a while 
'Till our 
Soul's catch us up 


Bring on the wonder 
We got it all wrong 
We pushed you down deep 
In our souls for to long.

Bring on the wonder 
We got it all wrong 
We pushed you down deep 
In our souls,so hang on.


Bring on the wonder 
We got it all wrong 
We pushed you down deep 
In our souls for to long.---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey Landis.
