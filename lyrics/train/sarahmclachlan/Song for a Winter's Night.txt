The lamp is burning low upon my tabletop 
Snow is softly falling 
The air, still, in the silence of my room 
I hear your voice softly calling 

If I could only have you near 
To breath a sigh or two 
I would be happy to just hold the hands I love 
On this winter's night with you 

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead 
My glass is almost empty 
I read again between the lines upon each page 
The words of love you send me 

If I could know within my heart 
That you were lonely too 
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love 
On this winter's night with you 

The fire is dying, the lamp is growing dim 
The shades of night are lifting 
The morning light steals across my window pane 
Where webs of snow are drifting 

If I could only have you near 
To breath a sigh or two 
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love 
On this winter's night with you 
And to be once again with you---
