You turn the radio on play your favorite song and cry cry
You let it all disappear push back the doubt and fear they try try

To hold your head under the waves but youre breathing all the same
You are stronger than their hate

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on you are your own woman

You never asked for trouble but youve got fire that burns so bright bright
You turn and face the struggle when all the others turn and hide hide

You hold your head above the waves above the war they try to wage
You are stronger than their hate

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on cause you are your own woman

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on you are your own woman move on yeah
Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Say whats on your mind with pride cause you are your own woman

Youve got a light that always guides you
You speak of hope and change as something good
Live your truth and know youre not alone

You turn the radio on play your favorite song and sing out so loud ---
