I wander through fiction
to look for the truth,
buried beneath all the lies.

And I stood at a distance
to feel who you are,
hiding myself in your eyes.

Hold on.
Before its too late, 
until we leave this behind.
Dont fall.
Just be who you are, 
it's all that we need in our lives.

And the risk that might break you
is the one that would save, 
a life you dont live is still lost. 

So stand on the edge with me,
hold back your fear and see, 
nothing is real 'til its gone. 

Hold on.
Before its too late, 
until we leave this behind.
Dont fall.
Just be who you are, 
it's all that we need in our lives.

So live like you mean it.
Love 'til you feel it. 
It's all that we need in our lives.

So stand on the edge with me, 
hold back your fear and see, 
nothing is real 'til its gone.

Hold on.
Before its too late, 
until we leave this behind.
Dont fall.
Just be who you are, 
it's all that we need in our lives.

Hold on.
Before its too late, 
until we leave this behind.
Dont fall.
Just be who you are, 
it's all that we need in our lives.
Its all that we need in our lives. 
Its all that I need in my life.---Lyrics submitted by Kelsie.
