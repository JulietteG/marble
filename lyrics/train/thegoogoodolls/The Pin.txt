I would give what's left of me away
Twist and turn just to hear you say
That you still think I'm beautiful
I'm worth a chance
Even still today

The battle plan has left me weak and worn
Into directions I feel like I've been torn
We used to live without the shame
We used to love without the blame

We're going up and down
Hold on
We're crashing to the ground
And anytime you kneel
I'll open up again
You reach inside of me
And then you pull the pin
And then you pull the pin
Oh, you pull the pin
And then you pull the pin

We're doing penance for all our petty crimes
On our knees, oh we're just killing time
First we bend and then we break
And I don't wanna be too late to change

Oh, I saw your light when I looked into the mirror
And then the past began to disappear
You know my lies were full of fear
And can you still forgive me, dear

We're going up and down
Hold on
We're crashing to the ground
And any time you kneel
I open up again
You reach inside of me
And then you pull the pin
And then you pull the pin
Oh, you pull the pin
And then you pull the pin

Your words can lift me up or crush me to dust again
Can't tell if we are flying or falling to the end
Your words can lift me up or crush me to dust again
Can't tell if we are flying or falling to the end

We're going up and down
Hold on
We're crashing to the ground
And any time you kneel
I open up again
You reach inside of me
And then you pull the pin
And then you pull the pin
Oh, and you pull the pin
And then you pull the pin---
