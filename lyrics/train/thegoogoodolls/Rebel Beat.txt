We keep heading in the same direction
You become my own reflection
Is that your soul that you're trying to protect
I always hoped that we would intersect, yeah

You need time to cope and time to heal
Time to cry if it's what you feel
Life can hurt when it gets too real
I can hold you up when it's hard to feel

Alive alive
Alive is all I wanna feel
Tonight tonight I need to be where you are
I need to be where you are

Hey you look around
Can you hear than noise it's a rebel sound
We got nowhere else to go
And when the sun goes down and we fill the streets
You're gonna dance till the morning to the rebel's beat
You can take everything from me
Cause this all I need

You know that life is like a ticking clock
Nobody knows when it's gonna stop, yeah
Before I'm gone I need to touch someone
With a word with a kiss with a decent song, yeah

And it gets lonely when you live out loud
When the truth that you seek isn't in this crowd
You better find you're voice better make it loud
We've gotta burn that fire or it will just burn out

Alive alive
Alive is all I wanna feel
Tonight tonight I need to be where you are
I need to be where you are

Hey you look around
Can you hear than noise it's a rebel sound
We got nowhere else to go
And when the sun goes down and we fill the streets
You're gonna dance till the morning to the rebel's beat
You can take everything from me, oh yeah
You can take everything from me
Cause this all I need

We are free tonight
And everything's alright
Put your arms around me
Baby show me how to move you

Cause there's no worry there's no cares
Feel the sound that's everywhere
We'll take what's ours for once
And baby run like hell

Hey you look around
Can you hear than noise it's a rebel sound
We got nowhere else to go

Hey you look around
Can you hear than noise it's a rebel sound
We got nowhere else to go
And when the sun goes down and we fill the streets
You're gonna dance till the morning to the rebel's beat
You can take everything from me, oh yeah
You can take everything from me
Cause this all I need
Yeah this is all I need---Lyrics submitted by Kat Blackburn.
