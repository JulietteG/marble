Even though the moments past me by 
I still cant turn away
All the dreams you never thought you'd lose
are tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send 
were lost and thrown away

Now we're grown up orphans
I never knew there names
We don't belong to no one that's a shame
You could hide beside me
maybe for awhile
And I won't tell no one your name
I wont tell em' your name

Scars are souveniers you lose
the past in never far
Did you lose your self out there somewhere?
Did you get to be a star?
Don't it make you sad to know that life
is more than who we are?

We grew up way to fast 
now there's nothing to believe
When re-runs all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
I won't tell em' your name

I won't tell em' your name

mmm mm mm

I won't tell em' your name

Ow!

I think about you all the time
I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are 
Come back down
And I won't tell em' your name---Lyrics submitted by janelle.
