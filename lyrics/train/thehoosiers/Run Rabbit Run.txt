I saw a fox by the rabbit hole 
You saw a prince from a fairy tale 
He promised that he'd watch over you 
Turned out to be the fox we all knew 

If i've got to be true, what chance did you stand. 
Tall guy, tall tailed, get out while you can. 

Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 
Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 

He'd dance to your beat, and steal your heart 
And smile with those teeth and tear you apart. 

High on those heels, dance like a brook?? 
The way you survive, till there's nothing left 

Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 
Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 

Ahhh 

Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back. 
Don't look back. Don't look back. 

Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 
Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 
Run rabbit run, as fast as you can. Don't look back. 
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back. 
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back. 
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back. 
Don't look, Don't Look, Don't look back.
