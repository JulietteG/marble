yeah, yeah, yeah
hey, wooooo, 
uh huh yeah yeah, uhh

steppin out tonight with my people
everybody's fly
watch me now my dress it gets attention
whenever i walk by
they say ooh! she walks around like she's the one important
like she owns the world
catching eyes and [new] haters but respect from all my girlz
i don't know what it is
but it's got me [fly] and i like it
i don't know what it is
but i'm alright, and the best way to describe it is...

i feel good, like the moon is shinin just for me
tonight i'm fly as i can be, though
don't u try to bring me down
it's not like you could
i feel too damn good!~ say oooh
i feel too damn good!~ say oooh

tippin in my heels with such swagger
fellas how are you?
mmm, debonnaire, sexy, with so much charm
yeah i'm talking to you, so let's go!
let me make u smile with my caress
lead you to the floor
let's dance like we know everybody's watchin
cuz that's what we're here for...

i feel good, like the moon is shinin just for me
tonight i'm fly as i can be 
don't u try to bring me down though, 
it's not like you could
i feel too damn good!~ say oooh
i feel too damn good!~ say oooh

back offa me, that negativity
don't wanna hear what u say
i'm gon dance away my drama
so u best get out my way... heeeey!

i feel good!  ooh!
i feel good, like the moon is shinin just for me
...the moon is shinin just for me
tonight i'm fly as i can be 
...tonight i'm fly as i can be 
don't u try to bring me down, though
it's not like you could
...it's not like you could
...feels good feels good feels good

the moon is shinin just for me
...the moon is shinin just for me
tonight i'm fly as i can be
...tonight i'm fly as i can be
don't u try to bring me down though, oh!
