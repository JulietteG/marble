Hey no ... noo oooooh
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better boy than I am
Than I am

Johnta Austin
When your out at night and your in the streets
And you have time  to yourself
Think of all the love that you get from me
That you can't find nowhere else
When your far away and I'm not around
And temptation fills your heart
Think of all the ways that I'm faithful babe
To replace me would be hard
Cause ain't nobody

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better boy than I am
Than I am
(nobody, nobody) than I am (3x)
Ohh Ain't nobody gonna treat you better than I am

You can try to act single if you wanna
You can go ahead and mingle if you wanna
You can even behave like you don't care
But you know (but you know) like I know (like I know)
That you ain't that foolish
Who you foolin'? You won't ruin
What's been here all along, you ain't movin'
From what you've got at home

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better boy than I am
Than I am
(nobody, nobody) than I am (3x)
Ohh nobody gonna treat you as good as I am

I just want you to know
Baby I love you so
There is no need to go lookin' for nothin more
Cause I've got everything you'll ever need right here
But if you feel that you need to leave
Just know!!

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better boy than I am
Than I am
(repeat)
(nobody, nobody) than I am (3x)
Ohh nobody gonna treat you as good as I am---Lyrics submitted by christella.
