Woohoohoo, whooohooohoo,
Whoohoo, whoohohohohoo

There's something that I want to say,
But I feel like don't know how.
Still I just can't hold it one more day,
So I think I let it out.

You're on my mind more than I may sure
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want,
Is to you to fall apart.
To you I will be clearer,
I want you to remember.

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Make you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

We can't change the things,
That we done that's in the past.
But fighting won't get us anyway.
So if you want, Here's my hand

Every night there is one thing I do
I bow my head and pray for you (pray for you)
And the last thing that I want,
Is for you to fall apart
To you I will be clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

Your much more than a struggle that you go trough
From nine till five I open things so let it go?
You' re not a victim, your more like a winner
And you're not defeat you' re more like a queen

In each tear
There's a lesson,
Makes you wiser than before
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger than you know)
In each tear (in each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

In each tear (each tear)
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know
In each tear (Make you so much broke)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

No no we can't be held out
No no oh noo I I I can't held out
You you you can't be held out
We we we can't be held out

Love
It makes you so much stronger (stronger)
It makes you so much wiser (wiser)
In each tear (in each tear)
And You so close to your dreams and no dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak can't take away you're meant to---Lyrics submitted by oceola.
