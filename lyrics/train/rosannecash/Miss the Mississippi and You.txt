Im growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamour, and tired of the sites
And all of my dreams, I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary
Far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you, dear
Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you
Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heavens door
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue
Memories are bringing happy days of yore
Miss the Mississippi and you, dear
Longing for my homeland,
Muddy water shore
Miss the Mississippi and you---Lyrics submitted by Dave.
