If I were a man. I'd be so sweet.
I'd give me everything I need.
I'd be so glad to go this deep,
If I were a man.

If I were the moon, I'd hang so low.
I'd bring sweet love to all below.
I wouldn't change and hurt you so,
If I were the moon.

Well it goes on and on forever,
and there's just no way to know.
I can change just like the weather,
I'm solid as a stone.

If I were the wind, I'd blow and shout.
I'd clean our souls and bodies out.
I'd shake the memories from this house,
If I were the wind.

If I were God, I guess I'd know.
I guess my friend's would tell me so.
It would be a heavy line to tow,
If I were God.

Well, it goes on and on forever,
and there's just no way to know.
I can change just like the weather.
I'm as solid as a stone.

Repeat last verse.

If I were a man, I'd be so sweet.
I'd give me everything I need.
I'd be so glad to this deep.
I'd change the way the whole world thinks.

If I were a man....if I were a man---Lyrics submitted by Terri Nielson.
