You can count on me (you can count on me)
You can count on me (you can count on me)
Im as sweet as can be
Sweet like a honey bee
You can count on me

Ill be coming around (Ill be coming around)
Ill be coming around (Ill be coming around)
I want your mama to see
That Im as nice as can be
She can count on me

Any time, any time of day
Im alone, run for day
I want you to believe

Woke up this morning, rise and shine
Trading my coffee for a glass of wine
Im trying to get to you on time
So Im picking up the keys, dont cross the double yellow lines

You can count on me (you can count on me)
You can count on me (you can count on me)
Im as sweet as can be
Sweet like a honey bee
You can count on me

Im your honey bee
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me---Lyrics submitted by Meagan Morrow.
