And my brother is not the same as you and me
And I know this to be true cuz what he said to me
Id rather live my life for love
Instead of Fighting to be free
It takes me my whole life
Well it seems be

Whered you get that from boy?
And whered you hear that from?
And whered you get that from boy?
And whered you hear that from?

Stay (Stay Golden)
Stay for me (Stay Golden)
Stay (Stay Golden)
Stay for me

And if you get goin down
When you lose your shine
And if it breaks your heart
You can still rely on me

Whered you get that from boy?
And whered you get that from?
And whered you get that from boy?
And whered you get that from?

Stay (Stay Golden)
Stay (Stay Golden)
Stay for me (Stay Golden)
Stay 

The sins of our fathers ends here
Whered you get that from boy?
Whered you get that from?
Whered you get that from boy?
Whered you get that from?
