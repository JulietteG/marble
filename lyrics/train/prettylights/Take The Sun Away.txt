Starts at 8:00.     Words in parenthesis I'm not sure about it sounds right though.

(One set foot forth?) Sellin crack fuck niggas wanna jack.
Shit tight no slack. 
Just bought a Cadillac.
Took it to the chop shop. 
Got the damn top droped.
Two colored flip flop.
Candy red lollipop. 
(I) was in the parking lot.
Still got my glock cocked 
New money mother fucka don't you see the big knot?
Don't you see the big chain?
Don't you see the big wheels?
wonder who they hatin on lately baby it's him.

I never slip i never fall.
A lot of hoes give me they numbers but i never call.
A real O.G look at the V.I.P and see a nigga ball.
Then after we hit the club then baby imma hit them draws.

Yea imm break you off. (Repeats 9 times)

Starts at 9:17

Hit the block on some new 10,000 dollar wheels
Can't explain how i feel.
Touch gator on my wheel.
Got peanut butter ice cream.
Peterpan seats.
Just got a fresh cut now we lookin for them freaks.
Take a bad bitch make her drop her draws.
Imma show you how to ball.
Middle finger to the law.
So fuck them niggas "what they gonna do".
Hatin on a playa cause my 'lac skated 22's.
When i pull up imma park at the front.
Lean in my cup, purp in my blunt.
Imma real pimp ain't playin like a trick.
Just bought a new 'lac.
Bought to put them thangs on the bitch.---Lyrics submitted by Austin Duckworth.
