Every time I open my mouth I feel a little bit lower and a little bit slower, 
At times I feel like time and space are a race and I'm feeling like I'm chopping a mountain. 
Inside and I feel like this is why...

Why!(4)
Whhh!

every time i open my mouth i feel a little...(3)
every time i open my mouth i feel a little...shit!

sounds like shit.(4)

Every time I'm looking for you I set a bear trap open every wire I go, 
Design life's tweak in timed sequence getting operatic over cuz its already started, 
Its life... 
but I feel like my life. 
isn't mine...(4)
isn't maaa!
life...life...life...(~) 

Every time I open my mouth i feel a little...shhh.(4) 
Shhh (~)

Shit. 
sounds like shit(3) 

Same scene daydream like mind daze.(2)
Daze,
Daze,
Daze,
Daze... 

With both of these noble thighs wrapped firmly around my neck 
I do believe I've found my way to go soaring off the wall, 
I took them to fall. 
Tube around the back misshapen a world thats filled with giants feasting.---Lyrics submitted by Irjie.
