Yeah, (ha ha) 

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 

Get out of bed, look in the mirror, oh yeah 
Fresh kicks, out the box, oh yeah 
Fitted cap to match, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 

Posted on the block, girls screaming "oh yeah" 
Tap to my fellas, on the corner, oh yeah 
Hear them from bodega, tastes good, oh yeah, oh yeah 

[Bridge] 
Then i peep to little miss muffin, fresh out the oven 
Can i take a bite? 'cause you look so scrumptious 
Voluptuous, I'm loving it 
Now you've got me singing' oh yeah 

[Chorus] 
Now i bet you i can tell a million, singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
In the club, in the hood, in the building singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
You don't even know why you're turning up your radio 
Bobbin' your head in your car, cause you feel me though 
Don't be mad cause i got you singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
Singing with me, oh yeah 

I know this song a little annoying, oh yeah 
But now I'm making' dollars, so i really don't care 
Now i got the whole world singing oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 

Say it in Spanish, it's the same, oh yeah 
Now i can hear your ring tone playing oh yeah 
This gonna be my claim to fame, oh yeah, oh yeah 

[Bridge] 
can i get a little miss muffin, fresh out the oven 
can i take a bite? cause you look so scrumptious 
voluptuous, I'm loving' it 
now you got me singing oh yeah 

[chorus] 
Now i bet you i can tell a million, singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
In the club, in the hood, in the building singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
You don't even know why you're turning up your radio 
Bobbin' your head in your car, cause you feel me though 
Don't be mad cause i got you singing' oh yeah, oh yeah 
Singing with me, oh yeah 

If you're up on your game, and you've been hustling for days 
Don't let nobody stop you, just say, say it with me oh yeah, with me oh yeah 
See our haters just wave, cause you've been hustling for days 
Don't let nobody stop you, just say, say it with me oh yeah, with me oh yeah 


[Chorus] 
Now i bet you i can tell a million, singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
In the club, in the hood, in the building singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
You don't even know why you're turning up your radio 
Bobbin' your head in your car, cause you feel me though 
don't be mad cause i got you singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
singing with me, oh yeah 

Now i bet you i can tell a million, singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
In the club, in the hood, in the building singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
You don't even know why you're turning up your radio 
Bobbin' your head in your car, cause you feel me though 
Don't be mad cause i got you singing oh yeah, oh yeah 
Singing with me, oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Lailanie.
