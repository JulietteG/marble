Baby I got amounts in accounts
That these other cats just don't
I don't mean to brag, so I won't
See I don't mean nothing
Nothing without you, girl

You lookin' better than a Scarface starter kit
All hundreds, small faces nothin' counterfeit
You want this ghetto D?
Or that over the counter shit?
Catch you strippin' in the kitchen, on the counter shit
Oh shit, what's up?
I guess I pause for these bitches
I guess I'll ball for these niggas
But it's my last three swishers
On my grown man shit I'm about to kill these bitches

Baby you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby you've got everything money just can' t buy

All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy
(Money just can't buy)
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Got a diamond on my lap and my sunroof off
Her mind strong but her body so soft
Tattoo on her hip read "Only for a Boss"
She ain't impressed with the way I ball
She said "You've seen one ghost, you seen 'em all"
Even though that thing cold
She said "A Rolls Royce
You're a Civic, Daddy I'mma roll with you"
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that's how she do
I pulled up close and I tell her what's true

Baby you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby you got everything money just can' t buy

All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy
(Money just can't buy)
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy

Shawty where you at? Meet me at the mall
Told her "Let me buy you something" she replied "Naw"
She said her love won't be bought
I don't need to spend no money
Spend some time that's all
I told her "Daddy don't mind spending"
I wanna see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant
(Shine girl)
She told me she don't care for the flash
Want affection not cash, girl I ain't even mad at you
She ride for me, die for me, love me, that's how she do
I pulled up close and I tell her what's true

Baby you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby you got everything money just can' t buy

All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy
(Money just can't buy)
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy

What's happening with it baby?
Hope you don't think that I'm crazy
Say me and you, get us some practice makin' a baby
I will take some out the stash
And buy you that new Mercedes
Then be all up in that ass in the back of that new Mercedes
You're confident, protect me, yeah, send me your issues
They ain't about to be playing with her
Me and these pistols

See that thirty-six four deuce, I'm the provider
Come scoop me in that 458, you be the rider
(Yeah) Oh well, that's that, back to the party
Bet you niggas anything I'm leaving here with shawty
Got a feeling that she fuckin' with me for me
She got me feeling like I got a million on me

Baby you know I got some money
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me
But when I look in your eyes
Baby you got everything money just can' t buy

All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy
(Money just can't buy)
All the things money can't buy
All the things money can't buy

Priceless
Ne-Yo, Jeezy---
