Baby when I touch you feels so good you wanna cry
Baby, baby watchin', feel so good you wanna cry
Baby-baby-touch-you-good-you-good-you-cry-cry

They don't understand the love between you and I

I don't give a damn about their jealousy
Seem like they just don't want to see you happy
Baby girl is me for you and you for me
Don't try to hide it baby let dem see

I don't give a damn about their jealousy
Seem like they just don't want to see you happy
Baby girl is me for you and you for me
Don't try to hide it baby let dem see

Even though you're friends, tried to tell u that it can't be real

Only wanna break u heart
Only wanna break u heart
Only wanna break u heart
Only wanna break u heart

Baby when I touch you feels so good you wanna cry
Baby, baby watchin', feel so good you wanna cry
Baby-baby-touch-you-good-you-good-you-cry-cry ---
