Who's taking you home
We been partying all night long
So before the night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home

Who's taking you home
Please correct me if I'm wrong
But I feel this connection is so strong
So tell me who's taking you home

Girl I'm looking at your body
And there ain't nobody better
(Ain't nobody better)

And we're the flyest in this party
We're supposed to be together
(Supposed to be together)

So I'm asking

Who's taking you home
Tell me who's taking you home
Girl before the night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home

Who's taking you home
Tell me who's taking you home
Girl before the night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tell me who's taking you home

Who's taking you home
Hope I'm not coming on too strong
But you way too fly to be alone
Tell me who's taking you home

This attraction is full on
Girl your body's got me gone
So let's dance to one more song
Tell me who's taking you home

Said I'm looking at your body
And there ain't nobody better
(Ain't nobody better)---
