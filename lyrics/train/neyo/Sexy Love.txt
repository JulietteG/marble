My sexy love 
So sexy 
Mmm 
Hm 

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up 
With just one touch and I erupt 
Like a volcano and cover her with my love 
Baby girl you make me say 
OoOOo 

And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do) 
Then to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do) 
Oh, when we do our thing (when we do the things we do) 
Baby girl you make me say OooOOo 

Sexy love 
Girl the things you do (oh baby, baby) 
Keep me sprung 
Keep me running back to you (oh baby, I) 
OoOo I love 
Making love to you 
Baby girl you know you're my 
Sexy love

Just enough Still too much
