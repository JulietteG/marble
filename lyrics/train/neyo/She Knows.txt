(feat. Juicy J)

You know, from the moment she turn around
She know, how to back it up and drop it down
She know, she what all the fellas looking at
Cause they know, soon as her song come on it's a wrap

And she loves the attention
That she get when she moves, yeah
Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh

And she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I know, I know, she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And I know, I know, she knows

She bad, mix of ratchet with the classy, oh
So bad, I just couldn't let her pass me, no
I told her, "Shawty, you so right, but you so wrong"
(So wrong, so wrong, so wrong)
She said, "Daddy, I'll be back after this song"
"Then you takin' me home"
Said I know

Said I know she loves the attention
That she get when she moves
Showin' out with her home girls
And she got me watching too girl

And she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I know, I know, she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And I know, I know, she knows

She know what she working with
(She know, she know, she know)
I see you, uh
You got my attention baby, go do what you do
I think she noticed, know you gon' have to make a move
All this ice in my rolley, no wonder I play it cool
Eyes on you, I watch it bounce
When she walk, she lick her lips
When she talk
I throw her in that Bentley coup with the top off like Mardi Gras
All that cake, come get you some filling
Like a soap opera come watch all my children
Hit it so long that she might lose feeling
With her legs in the air, she gon' walk on the ceiling

Said I know she loves the attention
That she get when she moves
Showin' out with her home girls
And she got me watching too girl

And she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I know, I know, she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And I know, I know, she knows---
