[Intro]
Yes, its a beautiful day
Its gone be a beautiful night
Break out the champagne
Everybody get a glass
Lets start it off sexy
What do you say

Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh)
Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

Welcome to champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
And we gone do it like this (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Got an addiction for life in this living
Like everydays my birthday, I know what Im getting
And reserved for time cause thats where Im sitting
Me and my friends and found 6 Miss Independents (Independents)
And my attitudes so chilled and so breezy (breezy)
My design is suit, I make this look easy (easy)
Sexy baby , dont you dare act like you dont see me
Baby, I know you see me

[Chorus]
Its all about them, fast car nights and them big wheel days
Living the champagne life, everythings okay
Lets toast it up (Oh)

Said we play all night and we play all day
Living the champagne life, everythings okay
Lets toast it up (Oh)
Baby, lets toast it up (Oh)
Champagne life

[Verse 2]
Got bent out property on cloud nine (Oh)
I got the sun jealous cause the way I shine (Oh)
And reserved for time cause thats how I do mine
Nice meal and a good wine, definition of a good time (time)
Living out my dreams, watching them come true (come true)
Baby, Im the boss, I dont know what they do (they do)
Youve put down the ride, come on and Ill take you
I know you want me to take you

[Chorus]
So if its all about them, fast car nights and them big wheel days
Living the champagne life and everythings okay
