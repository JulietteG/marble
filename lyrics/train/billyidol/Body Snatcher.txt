Full moon glow
Steals the light
When headless horsemen ride
In the distance hellhounds cry
And banshee wails arise
Turn your fear into fantasy
Concealing all the pain
You the victim of perfection
The dark side gets its way
The dark side gets its way

Ain't no use singing the blues
Ain't to one finding no clues
And you can't walk away
No stopping, no escape

Tired eyes you cannot fight
The body snatcher comes tonight
Wired mind embraced the sight
The body snatcher comes tonight

Creeping shadows cross the walls
What are they trying to say?
Lucy Love died in this place
I've come to take you away
Turn the spirit when you sleep
And leave an empty space
I'm the demon of destruction
The gods have now been swayed
The gods have now been swayed

Ain't no use singing the blues
Ain't no one finding no clues
And you can't walk away
No stopping, no escape

Tired eyes you cannot fight
The body snatcher comes tonight
Wired mind embraced the sight
The body snatcher comes tonight

Well you cannot run you cannot hide
'Cos evil has its dark design
You cannot run you cannot hide
'Cos evil has its dark design

I have reason to believe
There's power in the signs
Look she turns ghostly grey
The dark one has arrived

Tired eyes you cannot fight
The body snatcher comes tonight
Wired mind embraced the sight
The body snatcher comes tonight

Well you cannot run you cannot hide
'Cos evil has its dark design

The body snatcher comes tonight
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah you cannot run you cannot hide

Cos evil has its dark design

The body snatcher comes tonight

Ain't to use singing the blues
Ain't no one finding no clues
And you can't walk away
No stopping, no escape ---Lyrics submitted by Chuck Palansky.
