Hey, hey, hey ,hey
Watching ooh... yeah

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing and you know it baby

Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out, out
Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on

Slow change may pull us apart
I'll get us back together at heart, baby

Don't You Forget About Me
Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't You Forget About Me

Will you stand above me?
Look my way and never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down

Would you recognise me?
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Watching ooh..... yeah

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity and security

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing and you know it baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

Don't You Forget About Me
Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't You Forget About Me

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
(As you walk on by)

Or will you walk on by?
Will you walk away?
Come on - call my name
Come on - call my name
Will you call my name?

I say
La la la...

Will you walk on by?
Would you call my name?
As you walk on by
Would you call my name?
When you walk on by?
Oh yeah
Come on and call my name
As you walk on by
Hey baby call my name!
When you walk on by
Would you call my name
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah....---
