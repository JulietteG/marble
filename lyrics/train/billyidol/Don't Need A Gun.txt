A human heart goes out tonight
Yes a red hot love on a red stop light

I see a scene so cold it echoes in blue
Oh those twisting tongues they are after you

Wop bop a lu bop Son you gotta move up
Flip flop fly
Lawdy Miss Clawdy
Of what a story dreams to buy
Don't need a knife to violate my life
It's all so insane

When the other man has none
You don't need a gun
Yes a Russian roulette no fun
I don't need a gun
I just need someone
I don't need a gun

Blood red lights a domination street yeah
Just need your love and I feel that heat yeah
You can drive me through
That red stop light
With a whiplash smile

Wop bop a lu bop Son you gotta move up
Flip flop fly
Lawdy Miss Clawdy
Of what a story dreams to buy
Don't need a knife to violate my life
It's all so insane

When the other man has none
You don't need a gun
Yes a Russian roulette no fun
I don't need a gun I just need someone
I won't need a gun Oh yeah

You will always be crying yeah
Oh you will always be dying
Oh you will always be dying

Elvis a fight the dying light
Johnny Ray he's always crying
Gene Vincent he cried who slapped John, John, John.

Yes and me, I'm movin', movin', movin', movin' on.
Yeah to be someone
I don't need a gun.---
