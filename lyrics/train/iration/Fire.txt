Reggae music is the fire, Burn inside us everyday
Babylon tried to stop us, but they could never take away
Iration rise through the ashes, with the new roots sound
Dub operator creates the base line, burn Babylon to the ground

Chorus:
Fire let the fire out, Fire out my door (yeahhh)

It's the next generation, of the positive way
We remember our history, march forward to the next day
Raised to those who be before us, and we join in the fight
Now everybody on the dance floor, screamin' the music all night

Chorus

Reggae music is the fire, Burn inside us everyday
Now Babylon can't stop us, cause they could never take away
Iration rise from the ashes, with the new roots sound
Dub operator creates the base line, burn Babylon to the ground

Chorus

Repeat---Lyrics submitted by Ian Peace.
