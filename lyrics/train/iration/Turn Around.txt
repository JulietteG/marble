It's hard I know, to let it go
I treated you so badly
I'm changing my ways just give me one more chance
I'm missing your love madly
Dying inside, I got to let you know that you were my heart. Yeah
So I'm making it clear before you're out that door, I'm not letting this go to chance

Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around
Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around

It's hard I know, to let it go
I treated you so badly
I'm changing my ways just give me one more chance
I'm missing your love madly
I'm dying inside to let you know that you were my heart. Yeah
So I'm making it clear before you're out that door, I'm not letting this go to chance

Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around
Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around

Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around
Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around

Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around
Can't let you go, I won't let you down, so won't you turn around
