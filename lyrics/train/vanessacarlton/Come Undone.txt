I've seen myself in a thousand faces 
Strung out on life's path 
I would add up what you mean to me
But I cannot do the math 

And this fashionista's garden party
Well I had enough of that 
Cause the only one I come undone for is you 
Oh the only one I come undone for... 

I'm a special lover sometimes 
But you only touch a ghost
I'm a sycophantic courtier
With an elegant repost 

Needless to say you're the one that I need
The most 
Cause the only one I come undone for is you 
Oh the only one I come undone
For is you 
The only one I come undone for is you 

I know I'm done
And now I see the truth
I know I'm done
I come undone for you 
You've been gone so long,
Waiting here for you 
You've been gone so long,
Come undone for you 

There are people in this lifetime
That we should never meet 
Cause to be here now without you, well,
My life's so incomplete 

I tell you what you mean to me,
Maybe then you'll see 
Cause the only one I come undone for is you 
Oh the only one I come undone for is you 
The only one I come undone for is you---Lyrics submitted by moussa.
