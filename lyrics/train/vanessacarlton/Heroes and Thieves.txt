Well, disaster it strikes on our daily basis
im lookin for wisdom in all the wrong places
but still wanna laugh in disappointed faces
and you cant help me 
im blinded by these 

Heroes and thieves at my door 
I cant seem to tell them apart anymore
and just when I figured it out
darling its you im without

Im stubborn and wrong but atleast I know it
keep movin along until I can get through this
but baby this song is the best I can do it
so im patiently 
wating on these  

Heroes and thieves at my door
I cant seem to tell them apart anymore 
and just when I figured it out
darlin its you oh darlin its you im without
your comforting logic like
these days are the ones ill miss and 
and I seek a solitude that I cant find without you ooooh
dadada

Seems like im getting closer somehow
A flicker of peace that I finnaly found
Thank you for belieing in me now
cause I do need it
give me a year or two and ill mend my ways and see these mistakes 
when I see the truth darling trust me, when I can see
ill be comin back
ill be comin back
cause there are

Heroes and thieves at my door I cant seem to tell them apart anymore
just when I figured it out 
farlin its you oh darlin its you oh darlin its you im without
dadada
