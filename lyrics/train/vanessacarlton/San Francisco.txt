(Vanessa):

I, I know what you did
Like a boy of summer gives his first kiss
Love, is dancing on my finger
He got to the heart of the matter and lingered
Now I'm walking with the living
I always liked Steinbeck and those old men whistling

We're back, we're back in San Francisco
We're back and you tell me I'm home

Talking in the Mission
Over coffee this is my utopia
Then I'll be your lady
As the ocean rises, the sun is fading ...

We're back, we're back in San Francisco ( 2 x's)
We're back
We're back in San Fran, And Now

 I feel the ever after
Over red wine on the eve of summer
The buzz, the buzz of the city
As we settle in it's majesty
I, I know what you did
Like a boy of summer gives his first kiss

We're back, we're back in San Francisco
We're back and you tell me I'm home

You tell me I am home
oh oh oh
oh oh oh
You tell me I am home
oh oh oh 
oh oh oh
You tell me I am home
Back in San Francisco

And I know what you did 
In San Francisco
I know what you did 
In San Francisco
