Over the mountain down in the valley 
Lives a former talk-show host
Everybody knows his name

He said there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints 
I've seen them all and man, they're all the same.


Well, the sun gets weary and the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up on the black pit town.
Somebody says whats a better thing to do?
Well it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world.


Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere
There's a former army post
Abandoned now just like the war
And there is no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints 
That's what that old army post was for


Well, the sun gets bloody and the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up on the black pit town.
Somebody says whats a better thing to do?
Well it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world.

Over the mountain down in the valley
Lives the former talk-show host 
Far and wide his name was known
He said there was no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints 
Thats why we must learn to live alone.---Lyrics submitted by Thomas M.
