I was having this discussion
In a taxi heading downtown
Rearranging my position
On this friend of mine who had
A little bit of a breakdown
I said, Hey, you know, breakdowns come
And breakdowns go
So what are you going to do about it?
Thats what Id like to know

You dont feel you could love me
But I feel you could

It was in the early morning hours
When I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers
I slammed into a brick wall
I said, Hey, is this my problem?
Is this my fault?
If thats the way its gonna be
Im going to call the whole thing to a halt

You dont feel you could love me
But I feel you could
You dont feel you could love me
But I feel you could

I was walking down the street
When I thought I heard this voice say
Say, aint we walking down the same street together
On the very same day?
I said, Hey Senorita thats astute
I said, Why dont we get together
And call ourselves an institute?

You dont feel you could love me
But I feel you could
You dont feel you could love me
But I feel you could

I was having this discussion
In a taxi heading downtown---
