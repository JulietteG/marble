Fat Charlie the Archangel
Sloped into the room
He said, I have no opinion about this
And I have no opinion about that
Sad as a lonely little wrinkled balloon
He said, Well I dont claim to be happy about this, boys
And I dont seem to be happy about that

I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love
I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love
I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love
I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of this crazy love.

She says she knows about jokes
This time the joke is on me
Well, I have no opinion about that
And I have no opinion about me

Somebody could walk into this room
And say, Your life is on fire
Its all over the evening news
All about the fire in your life
On the evening news

I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love
I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love

Fat Charlie the Archangel
Files for divorce
He says, Well this will eat up a year of my life
And then theres all that weight to be lost
She says the joke is on me
I say the joke is on her
I said I have no opinion about that
Well, well just have to wait and confer

I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love
I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love

I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of your love
I dont want no part of this crazy love
I dont want no part of this crazy love---
