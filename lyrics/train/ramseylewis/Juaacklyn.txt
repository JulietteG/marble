I'm counting stars, lying under
Watching you through my walls
All the lights have gone out

I know, you're listening now
You've been spinning around
Turning slowly, orbiting round my house

And it's a feeling I get
I know, you're listening now
Warm me today, warm me today
Filter in my lonely room

Warm me today, warm me today
Look outside, the sun
It's bursting through, bursting through
Oh it's filling up this room

Now my fingers are cold
But I have touched you
You're all I need to know

Don't fade from me now
I know you're listening somehow
All you can give, all you can give
Twisting by, it's more than a lot

It's all you can give, all you can give
Look outside, the sun is bursting through
Bursting through
Oh it's filling up this room

Warm me today, warm me today
Look outside, the sun is bursting through
Bursting through
Oh it's filling up this room---Lyrics submitted by errol.
