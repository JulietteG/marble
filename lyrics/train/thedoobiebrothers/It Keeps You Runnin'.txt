Where you gonna go,
Where are you gonna hide?
You go on leaving out your heart
And all it's saying deep inside.

I can feel your heart beat
You got me all wrong.
You don't have to worry 
You just been lonely too long
I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago -

[Chorus]
It keeps you running
It keeps you running etc.

I know how you feel
You know I been there
But what you've been keeping to yourself
Well you know it just ain't fair

Are you gonna worry
For the rest of your life
Why are you in such a hurry
To be lonely one more night?
I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago ----Lyrics submitted by Randy.
