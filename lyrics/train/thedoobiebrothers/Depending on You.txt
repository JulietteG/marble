When I was so low
You were there to lift me up
Well, there's one thing I know for sure
You're gonna win life's lovin' cup.

Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue.

When I get too high
You were there to pull me down
So fine, someone to turn to
Keepin' my feet on the ground.

Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Dependin' on you, babe
Darlin', you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue.

I just keep dependin' on you
Someone to turn to
Keepin' my feet on the ground
So fine...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Darlin', you're always there by my side
Well, dependin' on you...---Lyrics submitted by Elijah.
