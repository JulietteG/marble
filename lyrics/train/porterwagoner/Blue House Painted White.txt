The party's all over they're dimming the lights
Our friends are all leavin' and saying good night
It's time to go now to where the tears dim my sight
Where I live all alone in my blue house painted white

My teardrops start when I open the door
The silentness tells me that she's not here anymore
I guess it's by habit I call her name through the night
But to me there's no answer in my blue house painted white

[ steel ]
Just a small bungelow we built just for two
We painted it white and we left out the blue
But too many parties and stayin' out nights
Is what put the blue in my blue house painted white

My teardrops start when I open the door...
To me there's no answer in my blue house painted white---Lyrics submitted by D Malley.
