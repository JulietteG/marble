There is just one thing that I need to say.
Before I close my eyes and walk away.
There's just one thing that I need to feel
Before I walk away against my will.

There's just one thing that I need to hear,
Before I walk away, for the last time.

There's just one thing that I need to see,
Before I take this chance and set us free.

Don't forget me,
Don't regret me,
Don't suspect me,
Don't neglect me.

The memory of this still reminds me of you,
the memory of this still reminds me. 
The memory of this still reminds me of you,
and that is where you'll find me.

Stars in your eyes, did you take the time too realise.
Can you count the stars in your eyes?
Did you take the time too realise?

There's just one thing that I need to say,
befor I close my eyes and walk away.
There's just one thing that I need to feel,
before I walk away against my will.

Don't forget me,
don't regret me,
don't suspect me,
dont neglect me, 
 (The memory of this still reminds me of you)
   (The memory of this still reminds me)
    (The memory of this still reminds me fo you)
     (The memory fo this still remind me)

Stars...in your eyes
Did you take the time, too realise.---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
