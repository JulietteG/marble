You horrify and petrify me
To wear the crown that just astounds me
You terrorise and paralyse me
You've lost the plot and should be shot down
You have it all
You're just a whore and nothing more
Your smile is pain yet you remain
Walking tall and that appalls me
You're bred like swine but still
You'll die in our arms
'Cause you have it all---
