Theres a look on your face I would like to knock out
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Though we wont ever meet I remember your name
Cant believe you were once just like anyone else 
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
But I dont think I can so fuck you anyway
You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
Now the world needs to see that its time you should go
Theres no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow
Cant believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say 
But I dont think I can, so fuck you anyway
Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out it must take you all day
Theres a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me

Why the fuck why the fuck are you looking at me
(Repeat x 4)

Theres a time for us all and I think yours has been
Can you please hurry up cos I find you obscene
We cant wait for the day that youre never around
When that face isnt here and you rot underground
Cant believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say 
But I dont think I can so fuck you anyway 

So fuck you anyway (Repeat x 11)---Lyrics submitted by Voula.
