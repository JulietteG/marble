It hurts to feel
It hurts to hear
It hurts to face it
It hurts to hide
It hurts to touch
It hurts to wake up
It hurts to remember
It hurts to hold on

Turn my head

The hurt's relentless
The hurt of emptiness
The hurt of wanting
The hurt of going on
The hurt of missing
The hurt is killing me

Turn my head
Off
Forever
Turn it off
Forever
Off forever
Turn it off forever

Ever blind---
