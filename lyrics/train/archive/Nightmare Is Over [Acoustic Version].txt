Take the sound from my head
Take me down
And empty out my heart
Cos the nightmare is over
Cos the nightmare is over

Shape my face how you want to
Drag me down
Control my every thought
Now my nightmare is over
My nightmare is over

Wont matter now
Wont matter now
Wont matter now
Wont matter now

Make me feel so much hate
Turn me grey
Fuck my everyday
My nightmare is over
My nightmare is over

No longer ill at ease with the crazy people
No longer afraid of the shit put in my face
Now my nightmare is over
Now my nightmare is over

It wont matter now
It wont matter now

It wont matter now
It wont matter now

It wont matter now---
