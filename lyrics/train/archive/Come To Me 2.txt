'Love Song '
All this time Im distracted from the world
The world outside of your arms
All I need is here

Try and find, a way to say the things
The things I feel when you smile 
They take away my words

You know, that people come and go
Its here for me
When things in life run me down
All I need is you

You wanted a love song
You asked for a love song
You wanted a love song from me
You asked for a love song from me
Now theres a love song for you

Yeah, I know, I dont hear you, I dont see you, I cant feel you
You know, its always my fault, communication is such a let down
I aint proud of my behaviour
I thank the lord, youre still here (Repeat x 6)

Yeah I know that I push you
Yeah I know that I push you
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know that I push you

I know that I push you (Repeat x 7)

Try and find, a way to say the things
The things I feel when you smile 
They take away my words
You know, that people come and go
You wanted a love song from me
You asked for a love song from me
Now theres a love song for you---
