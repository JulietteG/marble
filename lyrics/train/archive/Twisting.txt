Never really know what happens
Never really know what's there
Always have to tell me nothing
Nothing's ever really there

Baby, well you know that I love you
But loving you is just too obscene
Baby, well you know I hate you
But hating you would be too fair

Never really know what happens
You never really take me there
Fair to you is so important
Nothing's ever really there
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Emptiness is so distorted
Twisting me and bending my heart
Emptiness is so distorted
Leaving me here
It's so dark

EMpathy is so tormenting
Disturbing me and bending my soul
Emptiness is so distorted
Twisting, devastating my heart

Leaving me here
It's so dark 
Twisting me, twisting me...

Still, the lights are far away
And the shadows overlay

Twisting me, twisting me...
It's so dark
Twisting me, twisting me...
It's so dark---
