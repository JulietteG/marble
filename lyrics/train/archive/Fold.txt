I've been walking through the park
I've been walking in the dark
I've been walking in the rain
I've been walking so much pain 
I've been walking in the sun
It's bought me so much fun
Lying on a beach
Darkness out of reach
The world is not so cold
But it still makes me fold

So hold me and keep me sailing
Hold me close to you
Keep me from failing
Disappearing from you

Keep those clouds dispersing
Never leave my side

Don't let that peaceful water
Don't let it subside
Don't let my head confide
Don't let my head collide

With those cynical lies
With those cynical lies
With those cynical lies
With those cynical lies---
