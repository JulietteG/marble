Talk to me
I havent said a word in days
Please talk to me
And I can tell you of my ways
In which I numb myself
In which I numb myself

Drink with me
I will talk of things I want
To do in life but know I cant
Find the energy
Find the energy
Find the energy
Find the energy

Time has come
Come to me at such a speed
And given me the time I need
To waste

Waste on you, Ive got time to waste on you
Waste on you, Ive got time to waste on you
Waste on you, Ive got time to waste on you
On you

On and on and on and on with you

Waste on you, Ive got time to waste on you
Waste on you, Ive got time to waste on you
On you

On and on and on and on and on with you (Repeat x 14)---
