Old cranes lift your head
Arms laid down to rest
Clear skies overhead
Put revenge to bed
'Cause I believe in love

There's a light that burns
With the strength to hold
Us inside when hearts collide
To the end

New bird sing your song
Ghosts no longer roam
Life no more betrayed
Safe to call this home
'Cause I believe in soul

There's a light that burns
With the strength to hold
Us inside when hearts collide
To the end

Light us inside
When hearts collide
To the end---
