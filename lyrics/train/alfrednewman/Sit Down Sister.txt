Refrain:
Oh won't you sit down! No, I can't sit down!
Oh won't you sit down! No, I can't sit down!
Sit down, Sister! No, I can't sit down,
'Cause I just got to heaven--want to look around!

Who's that yonder dressed in red?
Must be the children that Moses had.
Who's that yonder dressed in white?
Must be the children of the Israelites.

Refrain

Who's that yonder dressed in blue?
Must be the children that are comin' through.
Who's that yonder dressed in black?
Must be the hypocrites a turnin' back.
