Jesus, my soul is fearless
For You are with us
Fighting for us
In the valley of shadows
You are still with us
Fighting for us
[x2]

Fighting for us

My Defender
You are invincible
My Strong Tower
You are unshakable
Mighty Saviour
Your love's unbreakable

You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart

Stronger than any weakness
You are my fortress
You are for us
Yes, You're reigning forever
Ruling in power
You are for us
You are for us

My Defender
You are invincible
My Strong Tower
You are unshakable
Mighty Saviour
Your love's unbreakable

You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart

Your love is holding on
Your love is holding on
Through every valley
When life has failed me
You hold on
[x2]

My Defender
You are invincible
My Strong Tower
You are unshakable
Mighty Saviour
Your love's unbreakable

You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart
You're the strength of my heart

Your love is holding on ---
