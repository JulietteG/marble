We were born for greater things
We were born to chase Your dreams
Come my Lord, awaken holy fire

We are turning from our sin
We are praying once again
Come my Lord, awaken holy fire

We are aching for the real thing
Hearts are open wide

Burn like a star
Light a fire in our hearts
[x4]

Send revival start in us
Set Your holy spark in us
Send us out in resurrection power

History's about to change
We are rising once again
Send us out in resurrection power

We are aching for the real thing
Hearts are open wide

Burn like a star
Light a fire in our hearts
[x4]

For Your glory
For Your fame
In this darkness
Light a flame in us

Burn like a star
Light a fire in our hearts
[x12]

For Your glory
For Your fame
In this darkness
Light a flame in us ---
