Everybody's wondering if mankind is cursed
He's ruining the sky and the ocean even worse
But I'll predict the cause of his eradication from the earth
Oh, oh, oh, oh, plutonium is forever

Now oil slicks someday will disappear
We'll stop dumping PCPs in a few years
But there is one pollutant that we should really fear
Oh, oh, oh, oh, plutonium is forever

When will it go away?
For our purposes never
It will be here past today
Yes, plutonium is forever

Now carbon monoxide can only steal your breath
Asbestos poisoning give the workers a horrible death
The aerosol in the concord make sure there's no ozone left

Now some want the oil companies to have to face divestment
And some want the utility to be denied the rates adjustment
But now they're all after plutonium, they think it's such a good investment
Because oh, oh, oh, oh, plutonium is forever---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
