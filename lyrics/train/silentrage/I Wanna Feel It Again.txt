Been so long since l've seen your face
There's no way l could forget you
Right on time we fall into place
Come on baby, let me see your next move

Dont hold back start the show
We both know where this things gonna go

Chorus
I wanna feel it (I wanna feel it)
I wanna feel it (I wanna feel it again)

I wanna feel it (Girl wanna feel it)
I wanna feel it (I wanna feel it again)

So tell me how have all the boys been
Its good to see you haven't changed your style
Is this the place where I first came in
Who's that hidin behind your smile
Lets use the night Ill be your one and only
Start me up the way ya did before

I dont know whatcha do to me
But you're more than just a memory

Chorus
Gotta feel it, oh oh oh
Gotta feel it, oh oh oh
