Wake before the dawn
You will lie, but youre older
Neither right or wrong
Who is that in the mirror?

Ask my broken heart
For the damage
I just need your love
To make me feel brand new
Brand new, brand new

Come on, get yourself together
Hurry up, babe
Now or never
Cause what weve got wont
Last forever
So come on, get yourself together

Struggle to keep up
In your head, from the water
Were letting down to luck
Or a thing, could it top you?

Ask my broken heart
For the damage
I just need your love
To make me feel brand new
Brand new, brand new

Come on, get yourself together
Hurry up, babe
Now or never
Cause what weve got wont
Last forever
So come on, get yourself together

Come on, get yourself together
Hurry up, babe
Now or never
Cause what weve got wont
Last forever
So come on, get yourself together

Wake before the dawn
You will lie, but youre older ---
