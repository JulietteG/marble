High ho triple salco
I got a feeling like a tidal flow
but I know what I am, they know what they are so let me be


Gasoline saccharine
I got no reason for the state I'm in
But I know what I am they know what they are so let me be

Hotel taco bell
I got the hit that you know damn well
But I know what I am, they know what they are so let me be

Cut teeth
better believe
I got a feeling that I'm underneath
But I know what I am they know what they are so let me be

But it's alright
it's ok
I got the time but the time don't pay

it's alright
it's ok
I got the time but the time don't pay

it's alright
it's ok
I got the time but the time don't pay

It's alright
it's ok

Flick flack
no sack
I got the wit that my enemies lack
but I know what I am, they know what they are so let me be

Trick some just begun
giving you more when you only want one
Cause I know what I am they know what they are so let me be

Hot sweat got debt
Keep your liquor in the locker cause you don't know yet
But I know what I am they know what they are so let me be

Ship shape ticker tape
Looks to me like a narrow escape
But I know what I am they know what they are so let me be

But it's alright
it's ok
I got the time but the time don't pay

it's alright
it's ok
I got the time but the time don't pay

it's alright
it's ok
I got the time but the time don't pay

It's alright it's ok

I know what I am they know what they are so let me be(repeats)---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
