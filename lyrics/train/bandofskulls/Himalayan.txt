Himalayan, bigger than you and me
I'm just saying, it's natural that it do
But only Bonnie and Clyde when we back up on sin
And when you feel the coin drop desperate, it's gonna begin

Feelin' for you, bad, bad,
You couldn't walk, it's good you feel, yeah
Better have some quick aid heals in that
Next to the beat

Himalayan, Himalayan, Himalayan (x2)---
