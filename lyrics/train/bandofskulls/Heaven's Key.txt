See the lightning, hear all the thunder
What you gonna do?
Feel the ones and zeros above you
Now you feeling blue

Watch the ships into the harbor
Now youre on your own
When they see your own reflection
But youll never gonna

Take my heart or take my hand
And keep your conscience clear
Well, I got a feeling its a burning desire
And I dont know what it means

So listen, are you looking in hell for heavens key?
So listen, are you looking in hell for heavens key?

All the friends that said they were with you
Seem to disappear
Even that most focused of feelings
Now its not so clear

How can you just stand beside me
In my hour of need?
Well, the second cut is deeper
So you better let it

Take my heart or take my hand
And keep your conscience clear
Well, I got a feeling its a burning desire
And I dont know what it means

So listen, are you looking in hell for heavens key?
So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven?

Take my heart or take my hand
And keep your conscience clear
Well, I got a feeling its a burning desire
And I dont know what it means

So listen, are you looking in hell for heavens key?
So listen, are you looking in hell for heavens key? ---
