Spending ?retreated?
What you need?
With the kitchen lights out
It's time to sleep
But the storm's a-rising
The rest is unknown
The sun's waking, oh, I'm gone

Hey, man

Beams of light come from the sea
And ??? rises, to an ?act of creed?
Whatever crown she wants, oh no
Oh won't you see, you do not own
You pound initials into piece of gold
And your eyes, two moons, in a row
And as a rabbit run, so free
What do you see?
What do you see?

Canopy, burning gold
I'll make peace on my own
Canopy, what is foretold?
Up in the sky, exploding ?row?

See the case to ??? to celebrate
?And one thing meaning for, sounds great?
Fall down my windowpane, into my arms
See like the sun you are so warm
And we go silently into the door
?Yeah, like that red bag, takin' so long?
So bow your head
Bow away
Why won't you see
It may not stay

Canopy, burning gold
I'll make peace on my own
Canopy, what is foretold?
Up in the sky, flowers unfold
Canopy, turning gold
I'll make peace on my own
Canopy, what is foretold?
Up in the sky, exploding ?rows?

Canopy, burning gold
I'll make peace on my own
Canopy, what is foretold?
Up in the sky, flowers unfold
Canopy, burning gold
I'll make peace on my own
Canopy, what is foretold?
Up in the sky, there we go---Lyrics submitted by Gina Tallman.
