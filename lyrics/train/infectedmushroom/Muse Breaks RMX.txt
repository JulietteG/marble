Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel this on the sun and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near?
You're the only tool to Reggae music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not a muse breaks
Feel me get in
Feel me get in

Take me up and out
Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had
more time for, you...

Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel it when the sun is up
and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near?
You're the only tool for break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not a muse breaks
Feel me get in
Feel me get in
Feel me get in
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Take it straight up and watch me get in
Feel it when the sun is up
and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near?
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not a muse breaks
Get in

Take it straight up and watch me get in
Feel it when the sun is up
and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near?
You're the only tool to break music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not a muse breaks
Feel me get in
Feel me get in
Feel me get in
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Take me up and out
Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had
more time for, you...---Lyrics submitted by michael.
