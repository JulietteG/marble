The simple fact it still remains,
Theres no reason to complain
Its only chains surrounding you

And if the cusp keeps growing higher
Then there wont be much more
I could try to settle

And as you walk in line
Every time you try to fall behind
And I could only carry you so far

And as you try to talk your way around
The facts by now Im sure youve found denial,
it isnt who you are

Ive heard enough from you
All your expectations too
Theres not enough explaining you could do

Just turn around and walk away
Theres nothing more that you could say
No words could ever take away this taste from me

Slowly replacing what weve done 
Or where weve been or come and gone
Thats not the point right now Im trying to make

The simple fact it still remains,
Theres no reason to complain
Cause this is your mistake---Lyrics submitted by Taylor Rosenfel.
