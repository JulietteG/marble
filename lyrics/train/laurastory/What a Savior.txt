Atoning Sacrifice, keeper of this life
Hallelujah, You are Savior
Beginning and the end, forgiver of my sin
By your mercy, You have saved us
    (chorus)
Jesus, You are stronger, more than any other
Hallelujah, what a Savior
Jesus, You are higher, my souls deepest desire
Hallelujah, You are Savior

You are the shepherd King, You lead us by still waters
Hallelujah, You are Savior
You are my only hope, Your kindness is my friend
In Your presence, You restore us

    (chorus)

You are the way, the truth and the life
You are my joy and my salvation
Stood in my place, taking my shame
Upon Your shoulders---Lyrics submitted by alexis.
