I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming out loud
I'm searching the missing part of my heart
Uuuuu uuuu uuuu,you catch me every time i fall
When i look into your eyes
I just know you tell me lies


Ref: This,this is my life I'm looking for you searching love in your eyes
This, this my life I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night


Can you get to my soul,
I'll make you lose the control,
I'll be your sun in the night

Just come here inside
I'm playing with you
I'm falling for you
When i look into your eyes
I just know you tell me lies

Ref: This,this is my life I'm looking for you searching love in your eyes---Lyrics submitted by youness.
