Ill be the bad guy,
Ill take the black eye,
When I walk out,
You can slam the door,
Ill be the S.O.B,
If thats what you need from me,
So you dont have to love me anymore.

When you and our friends talk,
Make it all my fault,
Tell em Im rotten to the core,
Ill let it all slide,
Get em all on your side,
So you dont have to love me anymore.

I will keep,
All those memories, of the good times.
Yeah, there were some good times.
So when you think,
Of you and me,
They wont even cross your mind.

If the wine youre drinkin,
Leads you to thinkin,
That you want what we had before,
Girl you can call me,
Ill let it ring and ring,
So you dont have to love me anymore.

Yeah, I will keep,
All those memories, of the good times.
Yeah, there were some good times.
So when you think,
Of you and me,
They wont even cross your mind.

If you need me to make you cry,
I dont want to but Ill try,
So you dont have to love me anymore.---
