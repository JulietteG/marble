Have you been to Jesus for the cleansin' power
are you wahsed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trustin' in his grace this hour
are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you wahsed (are you washed) 
in the blood (in the blood) 
in the soul cleansin' blood of the lamb
are your garments spotless
are they white as snow
are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  
lay aside the garments that are stained 
with sin and be washed in the blood of the Lamb
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean oh be 
washed in the blood of the Lamb
are you washed (are you washed) in the blood (in the blood) 
in the soul cleansin' blood of the Lamb.  
Are your garments spotless are they white as snow?  
Are you wahsed in the blood of the Lamb?  
Some glad mornin' when this life is over I'll fly away
to a home on God's Celestial shore
I'll fly away
I'll fly away
oh Glory 
I'll fly away 
oh, when I die Hallelueiah 
by and by
I'll fly away
ya just a few more weary days and then 
i'll fly away
to a land where joy shell never end
i'll fly away
ya, i'll fly away oh glory i'll fly away  
ya, when i die hallelueiah by and by i'll fly away
oh when i die hallelueiah by and by i'll fly away---Lyrics submitted by claire.
