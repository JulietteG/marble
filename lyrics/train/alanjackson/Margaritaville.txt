Nibblin' on sponge cake,
watchin' the sun bake;
All of those tourists covered with oil.
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing.
Smell those shrimp
They're beginnin' to boil.

Wasted away again in Margaritaville,
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
But I know it's nobody's fault.

Don't know the reason,
Stayed here all season
With nothing to show but this brand new tattoo.
But it's a real beauty,
A Mexican cutie, how it got here
I haven't a clue.

Wasted away again in Margaritaville,
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
Now I think, - must be Buffet's fault
I blew out my flip flop,
Stepped on a pop top,
Cut my foot twice, had to limp on back home.
But there's booze in the blender,
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on.(hang on)

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
But I know, it must be Alan's fault
Yes, and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's our own damn faults---Lyrics submitted by Jared.
