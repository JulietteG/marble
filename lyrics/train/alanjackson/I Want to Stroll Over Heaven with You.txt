i want to stroll over heaven with you

If I surved all the good things that come to me from above
If I count all the blessings from the storehouse of love
I'd simply ask for the favor of him beyond mortal king
And I'm sure that he'd grant it again 

(Chorus)

I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new         
I want to stroll over Heaven with you

Break: 

So many places of beauty we long to see here below          
But time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of the rapture together we'll stand anew                  
While I stroll over Heaven with you 

I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new         
I want to stroll over Heaven with you

I want to stroll over heaven with you---Lyrics submitted by jason.
