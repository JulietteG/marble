Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walk in
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, and I'd be obliged to take you

I'm a country boy, I've got a 4-wheel drive
Climb in my bed, I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'cause I'm a country boy

You sure look good, sittin' in my right seat
Buckle up, I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up, or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right uptown

Big 35's whinin' on the asphalt
Grabbin' mud, and slingin' up some red dirt
'cause I'm a country boy

My muffler's loud, dual Thrush tubes
I crank the music, the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're gettin' close
You can slide on out, or we can head on down the road

Bucket seats, soft as baby's new butt
Lockin' hubs, that'll take you through a deep rut---
