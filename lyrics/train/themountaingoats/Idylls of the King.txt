This place with its old plantations 
These roads leading out to the sea 
This day full of promise and potential 
More clay pigeons for you and me 
All of them all of them 
All of them all of them 
All of them all of them all of them all of them 
All lined up 

Huge crows loitering by the curb 
Our shared paths unraveling behind us like ribbons 
And I dreamed of vultures 
In the trees around our house 
And cicadas and locusts 
And the shrieking of innumerable gibbons 
All of them all of them 
All of them all of them 
All of them all of them all of them all of them 
All lined up 

How long will we ride this way about? 
How long 'til someone caves under the pressure? 
My dreams are haunted by armies armies of ghosts 
Faces too blurry to make out 
Numbers far too high to measure 
Your face like a vision straight out of Holly Hobby 
Late light drizzling through your hair 
Your eyes twin volcanoes 
Bad ideas dancing around in there 
All all of them all of them 
All of them all of them 
All of them all of them all of them all of them 
All lined up---Lyrics submitted by Stacy.
