Well, 
Guy in a skeleton costume 
Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit 
Runs through him with a broadsword. 
I flipped the television off 
Bring all the bright lights up 
Turn the radio up loud 
I don't know why I'm so persuaded 
That if I think things through 
Long enough and hard enough 
I'll somehow get to you. 
But then you came in, and we locked eyes. 
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other. 
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall... 
Quickly lit another. 
Look at that. 
Would you look at that? 
We're throwing off sparks. 
What will I do when I don't have you 
To hold onto in the dark? 

Yes, 
Everybody's going to need a witness. 
Everybody's going to need a little backup 
In case the scene gets nasty. 
You throw the attic window open 
And I throw myself all around you. 
And night comes to Tallahassee. 
I don't know why it's gotten harder to keep myself away 
Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back 
It all came back today 
And then we fell down. 
And we locked arms. 
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor. 
I don't mean it when I tell you 
That I don't love you any more. 
Look at that. 
Would you look at that? 
The way the ceiling starts to swerve. 
What will I do when I don't have you... 
When I finally get what I deserve?---Lyrics submitted by Stacy.
