Lying in a bathtub, lying there Im load
Lying in a bathtub, lying all alone

Lying in a bathtub, holding to the sides
prosing to the steam and everything we had
Deep in the bathtub, make it good and hot
Make it out and under wash everything out

Yes, Im lying in a bathtub, lying there Im load
Lying in a bathtub, lying all alone
Lying in a bathtub, lying to myself about me and you
and everybody else

Lying in a bathtub, lying there Im load
Lying in a bathtub, lying all alone

Yes, Im lying in a bathtub, looking through a cloud
And watching my lucky stars go out

Lying in a bathtub, curled up my toes
Trying to remember how that song goes
The one about the bathtub, the one about the cloud
And watching my lucky stars go out
Watching my lucky stars go out

Yes, Im lying in a bathtub, looking through a cloud
And watching my lucky stars go out

Lying in a bathtub, lying there Im load
Lying in a bathtub, lying all alone
Im lying in a bathtub, lying to myself about me and you
and everybody else

Still here, Im lying in a bathtub, looking through a cloud
And watching my lucky stars go out---Lyrics submitted by Magali Pilu.
