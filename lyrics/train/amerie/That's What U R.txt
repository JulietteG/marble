Want you to turn the lights off...me on 

[Spoken:] 
Hey...I know its been a minute...I'm ready 

Want you to try to relax...close your eyes 
Don't act like you're so surprised 
Feel the silk against your skin 
Let the games begin 

Don't waste time come get me right now 
Don't worry 'bout a thing it's 'bout to go down 
Don't be scared nobody's around 
We've waited so long 
It's about to go down 

Cause your so 
Sexual 
That's what you are 
Sensual 
Ooh you're looking so 
Beautiful 
It's about to go down 
Me and you 

Now we're about to take off 
It's on 
Pressures growing 
Going strong 
Hold me close and don't let go 
Inhibitions out the door 
One...judge...no 
Tell me what you dream of 

I'm everything you thought I was 

Don't waste time come get me right now 
Don't worry 'bout a thing it's 'bout to go down 
Don't be scared nobody's around 
We've waited so long 
It's about to go down 

Cause your so 
Sexual 
Ooh...That's what you are 
Sensual 
Can you hear the sound? 
Beautiful 
It's about to go down 
Me and you 

Don't waste time come get me right now 
Don't worry 'bout a thing it's 'bout to go down 
Don't be scared nobody's around 
We've waited so long 
It's about to go down 

Cause your so 
Sexual 
Ooh babe...That's what you are 
Sensual 
Ooh you're looking so 
Beautiful 
It's about to go down 
Me and you 

Me and you [repeat] 
Ooh ooh whoa 

So beautiful 
That's what you are 
Sexual 
That's what you are 
Sensual 
And you're looking so 
Beautiful 
It's about to go down 
Me and you 

You're so---Lyrics submitted by Sasha.
