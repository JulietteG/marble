A-A Merie, Ah Ah
A-A Merie,Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah

It's Amerie, I Took A Little Time Out
Took A Vacation, But Boys I'm Back
(Pardon The Interruption Be We Got A News Flash
Someone In The Building Said Amerie Is Back)

I Done Heard Them All Talk 'Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain't Never Had Nobody Put It On Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me

Some Of Them Wonder What It Takes To Be My Lover
First You Gotta Be My Drummer
Don't Move Fast, You Can Pop Tags On The Louie Bag But It Won't Get Under My Covers

Ah Ah, Hoh Oh, Hey Aye, Hoh Yaye
Ah Ah, Hoh Oh, Hey Aye, Hoh Yaye

I Done Heard Them All Talk 'Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain't Never Had Nobody Put It On Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me

I Done Heard Them All Talk 'Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain't Never Had Nobody Put It On Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me

Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah (Keep It)
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah (Keep It)
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me

You Asked Me To Let You Explain, I Done That
Same Talk, Same Game, Same Thang, I Done That
I Need A Kingston Feature
That's Who Never Run When The Dance Floor Heat Up

Ah Ah, Hoh Oh, Hey Aye, Hoh Yaye
Ah Ah, Hoh Oh, Hey Aye, Hoh Yaye

I Done Heard Them All Talk 'Bout How Much They Want Me
But Ain't Never Had Nobody Put It On Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me

Sometimes I Want A Man To Make Me Feel
What I Really Need To Feel
But Do You Really Know What I Want This Time
But Sometimes I Want Him To Know What It Is
Cause Lately What I Been Getting Ain't So Real

Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah (Keep It)
Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
(Hey!)Keep Doing What You Doing Cause It Ain't Been Done To Me
