[Amerie]
Is it a crime to want that old thing back?
Can it be wrong to miss the way you used to kiss me?

(Back!) Back in the day
(Back!) Back to the way you used to love me (you used to love me)

Now you've got me ready to break the law again,
Cause I made a vow to rock with you til the end
So, tell me why lately you ain't been the sam?
Cause I remember when you said!

[Trey Songz]
Right from the door, said can we talk?
You had me caught, got to admin it love
Let's cut straight to the point,
You know with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start

[Amerie]
Let's cut straight to the point

[Trey Songz]
Baby you know with me is where you belong

[Amerie]
Pretty brown eyes! You know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I!
Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty Brown Eyes!

[Trey Songz]
So let's go, let me know
You know where you belong,

Wht's the hold?
Baby you know with me is where you belong

[Amerie]
It's like one minute your warm,
and then the next your so cold,
I never know when your coming or going, HEy!

[Trey Songz]
Tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
I still remember when you said
Right from the door, said can we talk?
You had me caught, got to admit it love
Let's cut straight to the point
You known with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start

Pretty brown eyes! You know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I!
Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty Brown Eyes!

And I don't want to be the one to tell you everything!
Cause I've been spending all my time give you a chance to change!
You say your in love, But!
If this is love, What!
Can I do to make it feel better?

And wht about the feeling that there's someone on the side?
Cause lately you've been acting like you got so much to hide!

Cause I know that lately you ain't been the same,
And so I got to let you know that!

Pretty brown eyes! You know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I!
Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty Brown Eyes!

Don't move on, don't move on,

We belong together!
Forever! Ever! Ever!
