I'm walking behind you
Calling the way you
Give away all your secrets

You're taking the high road
And picking your battles
Just like the day I found you

I just want to make you go away
But you taste like sugar
Yeah you taste like sugar
I just want to make you go away
But you taste like sugar
Yeah you taste like sugar

Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh

I'm starting to want you
More than I want to
This ain't my finest hour

There's something about you
That I could get in to
Something that's deep inside you

I just want to make you go away
But you taste like sugar
Yeah you taste like sugar
I just want to make you go away
But you taste like sugar
Girl, you taste like sugar

Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh

If I turn away, away
I'll come back someday

Cause I just want to make you go away
But you taste like sugar
Yeah you taste like sugar
I just want to make you go away
But you taste like sugar
Yeah, you taste like sugar

Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
(Yeah, like sugar)

Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
(Like sugar)

Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
(Like sugar)---
