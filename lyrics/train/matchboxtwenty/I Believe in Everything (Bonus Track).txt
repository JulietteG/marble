I want to make you sing, darlin'
I want to make you run
I want to sew on wings, darlin'
And fly right over the sun

There's a bustle in the wind, darlin'
There's a bustle in the road
I want to tell you what I see, darlin'
When I look over to you

See I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

No more

Some people want to bring the change, darlin'
Some people want to be the one
I only want to see your face smilin'
When all our livin' is done

Well everyone around us feel their heart is stomping
Crowding up the air with words they cannot know
They hate this world they'll hate this song, ya
So I won't ever belong
No I won't ever belong

Still I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

Is every conversation
Gonna make you smile and hold your heart
We'll take this life and make it dark
Because it's hard enough to be the way you are

See I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

Well I believe in everything
But sometimes life don't work that way
All the love, and all the waiting
I don't want to wait no more
I don't want to wait no more

No more, no more---
