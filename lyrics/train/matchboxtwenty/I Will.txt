Tonight
Looking back on all this life
Its funny how the time goes by
And how, sometimes
It slides away

Time
Sliding through the day to night
Shaking till you start to cry
Your eyes wont dry
Till light of day

And sleep away
Dont let it go
Dont let it fade
Your dreams may cave
And falling apart
Its the only way
We go so low
When you dont know
I will

I will

If you go
Take a little piece of me
Hang it by the place you sleep
And dream of me
Dont leave

Just sleep away
Dont let it go
Dont let it fade
Your dreams may cave
And falling apart
Its the only way
We go so low
When you dont know
I will

We go so low
When you dont know
I will

I will

Tonight
Looking back on all this life
Its funny how the time goes by
And how, sometimes
Its slides away---
