So many times with you and I,
Thought it was right but I was wrong,
It's true.

But I wouldn't feel the way I do,
Without a sense of something real,
For you.

It's all about a good thing,
So I don't mind holding on.

But how long
Are you gonna make me wait?
And how long
Are you gonna hesitate?
'Cause I love the way we're carrying on,
But baby how long?

You know the way they always say,
"Don't make it never it's better late,"
Well that's true.

But tell me why my cautious angel,
Must you put it in my face,
Like you do?

It's all about a good thing,
So I don't mind holding on.

But how long
Are you gonna make me wait?
And how long
Are you gonna hesitate?
'Cause I love the way we're carrying on.

But baby I don't ever wanna make you feel to rushed,
Make you feel like love wouldn't be enough,
But that's just another "Don't mean much",
Like a high school crush, make you wanna run,
Can't you see the way I need you crazy,
And I want you in my arms every night,
Of my life.

So tell me,
How long
Are you gonna make me wait?
And how long
Are you gonna hesitate?
'Cause I love the way we're carrying on,
But baby how long?

How long,
How long?

How long,
How long,
How long?
Tell me how long?---
