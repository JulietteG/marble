Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

Annie lives in a small town in Oklahoma. 
She sells antiques outside of town. 
A simple life she chose,
She says it keeps her from growing old.
To her, the best part by far is meeting people.

Today, I saw Sarah Lynn walk into Annies store;   
She opened the door and with a soft voice said,  Hey, Annie. 
Annie turned to her and smiled 
And said, "I havent seen you for a while.
Its sure good to see you here today."

Annie sells antiques at the house down on Hope Street. 
People come from miles around to rummage through their past, 
to find the things that are worth remembering.  

Time flew on by as the two were laughing.
Then, Sarah Lynn turned to looked away.
She said, I cant believe Ive come this far; 
I dont know what Im looking for.
Its been 10 years since Joseph passed away.

Annie walked from the shelf back in the corner. 
She wiped her tears and began to pray,
Lord, give Sarah Lynn the strength to see 
And the faith to believe
That Your love is still with her here today.

Every now and then, you find that special person.
The Lord gives them exactly what to say.
Like an angel sent from heaven, watching your life pass you by, 
Giving you hope and peace inside . 
Giving Gods hope and peace inside.
