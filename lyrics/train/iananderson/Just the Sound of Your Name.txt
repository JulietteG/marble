Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

When I take a good look at my life, I see a simple man
With a precious family and a wife.
And I cant help but say, "Thank You Lord.
Yes, I know You are the keeper of their lives."  

Jesus.  Just the sound of Your name brings me home.
Home.  Your love is everlasting. 

Lord, when I think about how Your Son has set us free,
and as I serve You today, I cant help but hope for tomorrow.
When I fall in Your presence, Your love is lifting me.
You hold and comfort me.  Your love is my eternity.    
C 2004, Ian Anderson (BMI)---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
