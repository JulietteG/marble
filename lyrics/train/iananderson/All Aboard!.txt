Lyrics and Music Written By: Ian Anderson

The train left the station at a quarter 'til nine. 
Departed from Bryson City, as we waved good-bye.
My wife and I sat on the last open cart 
To see the view and get an Appalachian high.

Up along steep mountain sides, 
We journeyed on, as if a passage through time. 
I watched an older man tryin' to take it all in.
I saw him smile.  Then he shouted, "Praise the Lord." 

"All Aboard!"  Don't let the train leave the station. 
"All Aboard!"  Your fare has been paid.
"All Aboard!"  Can't you hear the whistle blowing? 
Jesus is coming back.  One day, we're going home to stay. 

We passed Fontana Village.  Ate at Slow Joe's caf.
I heard the Captain call, "All Aboard."  Again, we went on our way. 
I couldn't help but watch that man as his joy overflowed. 
He was watching the leaves of gold fall over scenic meadows.
