Lyrics By Ian Anderson and James Dodd
Music By Ian Anderson

When the storms of life are raging, you see no shelter from the rain.
All the hurt and pain around you bring you to your knees again.
Hes always there beside you.  He made you from the clay:
With His own hands, with His own hands.

Then the sea begins to rise.  You see no ship, no sign of shore.
Hes the boat that floats beneath you, like Hes always done before.
Hes always there beside you.  He made you from the clay: 
With His own hands, with His own hands.

Think of all the peace thered be if wed put our trust in Jesus. 
Think of all the joy wed share.  His grace will never leave us.
 When the storms of life are raging, Hes the shelter from the rain.
C 2004, Ian Anderson (BMI)---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
