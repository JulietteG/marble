Rude Boy wearing handsome hats
Policeman knocking with a rat-a-tat-a-tat 
Them bored around the streets at night 
They're not looking but they find a fight

I say inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence

Policemen coming there's no relief 
Even your best friend is a thief 
Soon locked up in your council flat 
Machine gun go a rat-a-tat-a-tat

I say inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence

Hey hey hey

(instrumental break)

Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence

Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence
Inner London violence---Lyrics submitted by Carl.
