I've been trying real hard to realize
But some things take a long long, long long time
A long time

Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep

Aberdeen
Way back, way back, way back

Never saw my dark side in your eyes
Back and forth, bloody fingers
Painting up the sky
The sky

Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep

Aberdeen
Way back, way back, way back

Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep

Aberdeen

Aberdeen
Way back, way back, way back---Lyrics submitted by Biskit.
