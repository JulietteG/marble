One two three four five six
There was a guy, and his name was Johnny B.
The loudest man in the land

Alright 
Ok
Alright 
Ok
Alright 
Ok
Uh huh

How many more times you cross the line
Run for days with eager eyes
Screaming smile left alone
These crazy things you do
In the forest of your mind
Haunted by the loss of time
Feet stuck frozen in the snow
These crazy things you do

Shame 
Shame 
Shame
Oh oh oh

Shame 
Shame 
Shame
Oh oh oh

Alright 
OK
Alright 
OK
Alright 
Ok
Uh huh

Japanese from head to toe
Red to green, green to gold
Waiting on that buffalo
These crazy things you do

????????????????????
????????????????????
????????????????????
????????????????????

Shame 
Shame 
Shame
Oh oh oh

Shame 
Shame 
Shame
Oh oh oh

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind put me 
Always aside
Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone 
We can play by the rules or just 
Leave it alone

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
That your heart turned to stone
Now your heart's turned to stone

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind put me 
Always aside
Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone 
We can play by the rules

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame---Lyrics submitted by David.
