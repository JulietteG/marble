Early in the morning
Rise to meet the sun
Work so hard to feed your wife
No time to show her love

And in the madness of the evening
With diamonds in your hand
Came home an hour early
Caught her with another man

It's always something
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always something waiting for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always something
You know it's always something

On your way back home again
A good samaratin
You see a man stuck in the rain
Stranded with no friends

And from the goodness of your heart
You save him from the flood
A couple miles down the road
He's covered in your blood

It's always something
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always something waiting for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always something
You know it's always something

Moving around, you never see it coming
Burned by the life, you thought that you were running
Blinded again, you're floating like a feather
Why can't you see, you can't control the weather

Sometimes I caught myself
Looking in the mirror
With my eyeballs out
And i'm looking at the fear

In the bottom of the drain
Saw it growing like a plant
But it never works out
The way I wrote it in my hands

It's always something
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always something waiting for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always something
You know it's always something
You know it's always something
You know it's always something---Lyrics submitted by Biskit.
