Tonight
Bleeding from the holes in my face
But I don't wanna give it away
You did it for the family name
Crash collide in to space
You
Your favorite color red
I guess that I'm the hypocrite
You're not responsible
I'm responsible

Who's to blame
Tell me who's to blame
Tell me who

I don't wanna do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Don't wanna do that again
I'll never do that again

You
You call me baby blue
For all the evil schemes I pull
You sit and watch the waves break
I made a lot of mistakes
Crash collide in to space

Who's to blame
Tell me who's to blame
Tell me who

I don't wanna do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Don't wanna do that again
I'll never do that again

Aaaahooo
Aaaahooo

I don't wanna do that again
I've been all over the place
I watched the strawberry fields
Dry up and wither away
And if you ask me to stay
You know that's where I will be
Don't wanna do that again
I'll never do that again

Aaaahooo
Aaaahooo ---
