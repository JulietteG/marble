Looking out my window
wonder how it came to be

Feels just like a tempo
 Lifted by a gentle breeze

Ugly as a suitcase
 I can see it stretch for days

Hanging on a sunset
 Softly trampled by the rain

[Chorus]
 Way too long
 Hold on
 Hold on
 Dead and gone
 So long
 Hold on
 Way too long
 Hold on
 Hold on
 Dead and gone
 So long
 Hold on
 So long
 Hold on

Looking out my window
 Trying to find a hiding place

Climb up to the tree tops
 Watch it all just drift away

[Chorus]
