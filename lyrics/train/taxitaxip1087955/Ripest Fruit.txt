You are the ripest fruit of all
Made from sugar and sun
I hold you with my loving eyes
Though I feel you're trying to run

I cried over a jealous wolf
I know I will will walk out into the woods
Tomorrow again
Tomorrow again

Impossible to let go of you
It's warm and yellow when you're in the room
But I've been taught to call for help
If I ever meet that awful wolf again

'Cause he has got a troubled soul
Five years old
And he has got a troubled soul
Five years old---Lyrics submitted by Sophia Soray.
