Hospital, the only thing she knows
Waiting around can feel like forever
She knows she's not there at all
And everything I see repeats over and over.

I, I, I can't breathe.

Eyes toward the silver screen
We watch a tape 'till black
One last romantic scene
We watch the roles played back

It's not right
He leads a double life

A silver bullet tonight
She's been advised
But nothings right
All the things he's done have come to destroy their lives

And in her mind she's terrified
Of all the things she's yet to find
The moon is full, and she's done her fill of life

Pushed away into the side-lines
Where she's waiting most of her life

She's bonded to his ways, she can't be dead
She's been that way for a long time

Hospital, the only thing she knows
Waiting around can feel like forever
She knows she's not there at all
And everything I see repeats over and over

I, I, I can't breathe

Look at you now, all your worries and regrets
(Won't forget, won't forget)

Why she still comes to stay with me.. (I'll forget.)

(Is he okay?..)
