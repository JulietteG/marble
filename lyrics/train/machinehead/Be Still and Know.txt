In this struggle are we dead or alive?
Freedom is not existence it's how we survive.
Shake our grief, hold on to belief,
It can't enslave us forever, there is relief.

No change will be permanent.
Our strength enduring bright incandescent.
Take a chance before we fall,
Backs against the wall.

And the sun will rise.
Dawn will break through the blackest night.
Distant in it's glow,
This shall pass be still and know.

And there's heartache as we search to connect.
Even just for a moment, pretend we're content.
There is love, know that we are one.
We are all in this together, weather the storm. 

Look into each other's eyes.
Make the connection before it dies.
It will all disseminate, 
As we consummate. 

And the sun will rise.
Dawn will break through the blackest night.
Distant in it's glow,
This shall pass be still and know.

Is it hopeless? Will the fear take control?
Don't succumb to the numbing sting of defeat.
Take this hate, let the bile stagnate,
Hoist the head of Goliath, bask in it's grace. 

Stars realign in the sky. 
Glaciers may melt and the oceans rise.
Waves will come crashing ashore,
But withstand the roar.

And the sun will rise.
Dawn will break through the blackest night.
Distant in it's glow,
This shall pass be still and know.---Lyrics submitted by John R Merritt.
