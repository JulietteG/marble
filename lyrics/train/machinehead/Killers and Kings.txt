The bleeding read me the future!
Angel-white, sinning away
I've turned from the ever-gray, and...

The devil keeps us enraptured!
Hope and mind become the sage
An ancient power rage

Ancient power...
Darkest hour...
Open your third eye and you'll see...

(killers and kings!)
Inheritors of earth
(killers and kings!)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
The diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

Look to earth, summon the master
Awake the human living inside
This is religiouside, and...

The hangman keeps his intemperance
The sun shines over the fool
High priest, express our rule

Death and rebirth...
Decay and mirth...
Open your third eye and you'll see...

(killers and kings!)
Inheritors of earth
(killers and kings!)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
The diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

The diamond bears our ring!
Yeah!

The king of pentacles is here
Strength in forty two,
You'll have to push away the fear
We stand atop the mountain
With the hermit and the lamb
As the lovers in the night
Is what's walked into the damp

What do the cards say?
Then tell me this and pain
The devil and the emperor
Could keep us locked in chains
The chains they left you know too well, you're wrong!
The chains are here to put you, now fenced in now
To you!
Terror denied!
This power,
Wasted nature

(killers and kings!)
Inheritors of earth
(killers and kings!)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
The diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

(killers and kings!)
Inheritors of earth
(killers and kings!)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
The diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings---
