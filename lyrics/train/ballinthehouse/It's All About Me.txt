I've had enough, I'm tired of Crawling
Had enough of waiting for you
All my life is passing before
And You don't care, not at all
It's all right 
If that's the way it has to be
You said you wanted to be free
I think it's time I see I can't do nothing for you
So now it's all about me
It's all about me
So now it's all about me
I'm not trying to just run away
But I'm so tired of waiting for you
I just need you to give it a chance
But no---you don't care---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey.
