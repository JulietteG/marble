One sided love broke the seaside down
And I took it rough when I hit the ground
That you went your way and I went half wild
But girl yould understand, if your heart was mine

If we had an exchange of hearts,
Then yould know why I fell apart
Yould feel the pain when the memories start
If we had an exchange of heart

Id never wish a lonely heart ungood,
Its not your fault I choose to play the fool
One day may come when youll be in my shoes,
That your heart will break and youll feel just like I do

If we had an exchange of hearts,
Then yould know why I fell apart
Yould feel the pain when the memories start
If we had an exchange of heart

Oh time turns the tables, and soon Ill be able
To find a new romance
And if youll remember my love warm and tender,
Too late for a second chance---Lyrics submitted by maverick.
