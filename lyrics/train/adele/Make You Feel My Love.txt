When the rain is flowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace,
To make you feel my love.

When the evening  shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years,
To make you feel my love.

I know you havent made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong,
Ive known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind that you belong.

Id go hungry; Id go black and blue,
Ill go crawling down the avenue,
So theres nothing that I wouldnt do,
To make you feel my love

Instrumental

The storms are raging on the rolling sea,
And on the highway over there,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You aint seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy make your dreams come true,
Nothing that I wouldnt do,
Go to the ends of the earth for you,
To make you feel my love.
To make you feel my love.---Lyrics submitted by Ilse.
