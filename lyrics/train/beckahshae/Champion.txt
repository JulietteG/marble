I know better
then I stayed down for too long (too long)
'Cause it don't matter whether I feel it or I don't, I'm strong

I know why I'm taking blows like it's all good (it's all good)
'Cause I'm still winning
I'm just a little misunderstood

Even when I want to quit
I just keep on pushing it

Determined to make a hit
I just keep on aimin' to win

Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion

It's in my blood

If loosing didn't hurt so bad, winning wouldn't feel so good
So I own all this pain and I consider it gain like it should

'Cause I'm motivated and it's the only way I can go higher (higher)
Until my good is better and my better is the best
Yea, I'm that girl that's on fire

Even when I want to quit
I just keep on pushing it

Even when I want to quit
I just keep on pushing it

Determined to make a hit
I just keep on aimin' to win

Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion

It's in my blood

No matter how hard it gets, I'm not afraid of it
I'm gonna reach the end 'cause I'm a winner

Yea, I know where I'm going
My confidence is showin'

'Cause I know why, why, why, I'm a winner

Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion
Like a champion

It's in my blood---
