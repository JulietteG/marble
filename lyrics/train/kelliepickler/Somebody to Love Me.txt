Sometimes the nights seem so long
When youre lying there all alone
And tomorrow seems so far away
I dont want to live another day this way

Scared to let someone in
Cant bear to get hurt again 
But my body needs to feel a touch
Someone come and wake me up

Chorus

I just want somebody to love me
I just need somebody to hold me
Somebody to love me

Dont want to let life pass me by
Never knowing what its like
To be as real as real can be
To share my life and know my dreams

Chorus

Cause Im hurt and Im scared and Im lonely
All I want is somebody to want me
Cuz Ive got so much to give
