I wanna be your vacuum cleaner 
Breathing in your dust 
I wanna be your Ford Cortina 
I won't ever rust 
If you like your coffee hot 
Let me be your coffee pot 
You call the shots babe 
I just wanna be yours 

Secrets I have held in my heart 
Are harder to hide than I thought 
Maybe I just wanna be yours 
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be yours 

Wanna be yours x4 

Let me be your 'leccy meter 
And I'll never run out 
Let me be the portable heater 
That you'll get cold without 
I wanna be your setting lotion 
(Wanna be) 
Hold your head in deep devotion 
(How deep?) 
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean 
I wanna be yours 

Secrets I have held in my heart 
Are harder to hide than I thought 
Maybe I just wanna be yours 
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be yours 

Wanna be yours x9 

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner 
(Wanna be yours) 
Breathing in your dust 
(Wanna be yours) 
I wanna be your Ford Cortina 
(Wanna be yours) 
I won't ever rust 
(Wanna be yours) 

I just wanna be yours 
(Wanna be yours) 
I just wanna be yours 
(Wanna be yours) 
I just wanna be yours 
(Wanna be yours)---
