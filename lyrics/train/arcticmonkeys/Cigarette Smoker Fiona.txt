Sat at the side, at the pool at one of your houses, with wet white trousers on
And worlds collide, as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
Her brothers gone off to the strippers, to mak up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches, but shes actually alright

(Cigarette smoker) I'm sorry but we're all unsure, how much you've had but
(We think that you oughta) Maybe not have any more

The country home, even if we reali tried, wudn't cease to surprise us now
And i bet your dad, would like to give us all a slap, when are your parents back d'you know?
Well i never came from no ghetto, well it wasn't nowhere near here
Well spoken girls and stiletos, aren't something to fear

(Cigarette smoker) I'm sorry but we're all unsure, how much you've had but
(We think that you oughta) Maybe not have anymore
                                      x2

(Cigarette smoker) Cigarette smoke doesnt hide, as well as you think and 
(Youd think that it oughta) Act as the perfect disguise---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
