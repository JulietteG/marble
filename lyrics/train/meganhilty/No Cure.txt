I got this fever running through my veins
Keep on trying but I just can't shake it
All this medicine that I keep taking
It ain't working, I keep hurting
It's something more
What if there's no cure

Pick me up, take me back to my bed
Put a cold towel on my head
You said try some of this instead
Then you tell me that it's working
But I'm not sure
What if there's no cure

I've been blind since you left
I can see no way out
I've been deaf since you left
To any words of hope now
And the scary thing is
It ain't getting any better
What if there's no cure

I light a candle and I say a prayer
I might need a miracle right here
Cause I'm fading and I feel so scared
I'm disappearing,
I used to feel you so much more
What if there's no cure

I've been blind since you left
I can see no way out
I've been deaf since you left
To any words of hope now
And the scary thing is
It ain't getting any better
What if there's no cure

I keep trying to pull out
Of this spiral that I'm in
But you're burning up my heart
And you're underneath my skin
They say when you lose it all
That you can't lose anymore
What if there's no cure
What if there's no cure

I've been blind since you left
I can see no way out
I've been deaf since you left
To any words of hope now
And the scary thing is
It ain't getting any better
What if there's no cure
What if there's no cure
There's no cure---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
