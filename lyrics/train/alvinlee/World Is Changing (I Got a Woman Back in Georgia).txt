The world is changing far too fast
I wonder just how long we'll last
The smoke is filling up the sky Oh my
Don't want to die, here's the reason why

I got a woman back in Georgia
A mother and child in Tennessee
I want a world that they can live in
With air to breath and skies to see
And they're all trying to be free
I guess they're just like you and me
Don't want to die, here's the reason why

The world is all we have to give
A place where children grow and live
What good's a world without a sky or sea
It's up to you, Honey it's up to me---Lyrics submitted by Dakota.
