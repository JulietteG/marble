Just keep on lovin you
Just keep on lovin you
Just keep on lovin you

There comes a time in your life
When things just don't seem so right
Make you doubt what you do
It's got that hold on you
Just let that feeling go
It's time to take control
It's time to start lovin you

Just keep on lovin you
Keep on lovin
Just keep on lovin you
Keep on loving
Just keep on lovin you
Keep on lovin you

Just keep on
Keep on loving you
Just keep on
Keep on loving you
Just keep on
Keep on loving you
Loving you, loving you

I know you can never wait
Keep thinking everything would change
But I keep telling you
Nothing more you can do
Just let that feeling go
It's time to take control
It's time to start lovin you---
