Life belongs to people who believe 
in the beauty and potential of their dreams. 
So people let me share a simple truth: 
Never forget the dreams of your youth

When youre a dreamer
Life is more than what the eye can see
So much sweeter 
Is life for those whose minds are young and free  

Some people are afraid of what may come
And the grief of what once happened may kill some
Some people search for answers far and wide
But dreamers keep their treasures deep inside	

When youre a dreamer, 
your life reflects the longings of your heart. 
So much sweeter
is life when worries lighten and depart.

A task may seem too hard to achieve
But less unlikely with an ounce of belief
And when the fire starts to burn inside
all the doubts you had will move aside. 

When youre a dreamer, 
life is getting better day by day.
Oh so much sweeter, 
is life when optimism grows to stay.

When youre a dreamer
Life is more than what the eye can see
So much sweeter 
Is life for those whose minds are young and free---Lyrics submitted by Ike Gerre.
