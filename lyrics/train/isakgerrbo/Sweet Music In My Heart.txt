We went to sea only you and me, 
a story within reality. 
We where in love kissing under trees, 
climbing 25 degrees.

And we were crowned on the mountain, 
and I heard angels sing sweet music in my heart. 
And we were bound on the mountain, 
and I believe that it is written in the stars.

I took your hand and helped you to the top. 
You trusted me to get you up. 
And oh that view the world beneath our feet, 
a king and queen becomes complete.

And we were crowned on the mountain, 
and I heard angels sing sweet music in my heart. 
And o we danced on the mountain, 
and I believe that it is written in the stars.

And there we were, 
we wrote our names in stone, 
sitting on a golden throne. 
And on that day you gave me rich supply with potential never to run dry.

And we were crowned on the mountain, 
and I heard angels sing sweet music in my heart. 
Oh we began on the mountain, 
and I believe that it is written in the stars.---Lyrics submitted by Ike Gerre.
