Im sitting in the living room, with my father by my side
Telling him bout true success, being blinded by my pride
Been listening to Brian T, Ive been dreaming on the train
Hes like a rush of heroine, he is concurring my brain, 
Making me insane.

And my fathers getting weaker now, he just cant get out of bed
And I am thinking bout the man he is, about the wise things hes said.
I am thinking about that day when, he will raise above this life
When nothing else can do him no harm, no more pain and strife.

If daddy would have told me to be friend with what you are
If daddy would have told me straight to find my northern star
I would have thought that he was wrong, Im done with singing that old song. Then daddy went to heaven, and I was lost in thought 

Hes laying in his bedroom now, he is calling out my name
I know that I cant help him now, he is fighting with the pain
Hes asking me to open up, cause the doctors on his way 
I answer that I have to go, really whish that I could stay(balloon),
The last thing that I said---Lyrics submitted by Ike Gerre.
