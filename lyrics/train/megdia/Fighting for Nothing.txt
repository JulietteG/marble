When I was younger, 
I wish that I would have known better.
Better love makes a fat romance, 
that lasts for more than a shoe shine.
Im older, took all the words of my mother, saying,
It could be worse, 
could be born with that disease,
instead of catching it first.
So lets go back, to the first time,
that I met you, in your Chevy, 
with your hands stretched, 
and me crying, screaming, Mercy. Mercy.
But I know that, I was put here, to fight Vikings
in the cold war, with my arms out, 
in the front lines, singing, Dare me. Dare me.

But these things take time love.
These things take backbone.
And theyll tell you what you want to hear 
cause they think its better. Better.
But you better know how to point out the liars.
Youve got to weigh your wars make sure youre not fighting for nothing. Nothing.
Are you fighting for nothing?

It feels like this world has been 
growing slowly upside down.
Maybe I should move to China, 
and straighten this mess out.
Maybe Ill be a poet.
Watch all the sky for falling words.
And write about my grandmas curtains, 
or the lady who put the Chinese buffet in her purse.
Ive got my mouth.
Its a weapon. Its a bombshell.
Its a cannon. Ive got my words.
I wont give them mercy. Mercy.

But these things take time love.
These things take backbone.
And theyll tell you what you want to hear 
cause they think its better. Better.
But you better know how to point out the liars.
Youve got to weigh your wars make sure youre not fighting for nothing. Nothing.
Are you fighting for nothing?

Ive got my words. I hope they hurt you.
I hope they scar you. I hope they heal you.
I hope they cut you open, 
make you see youve been warring 
for all the wrong reasons.

Make you see that some things are worth bruising for.
Make you see that your name is your honor code.
Make you see that your hands youre accounted for.
Pick and choose where your sweat and your blood will go.
Make you see your lifes not to be lived alone.
Run their spit through your hair, youre worth nothing. Nothing.

But these things take time love.
These things take backbone.
And theyll tell you what you want to hear 
cause they think its better. Better.
But you better know how to point out the liars.
Youve got to weigh your wars make sure youre not fighting for nothing. Nothing.
Are you fighting for nothing?---Lyrics submitted by Yvonne.
