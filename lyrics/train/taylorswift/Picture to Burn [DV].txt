state the obivous
 i didn't get my perfect fantsy
 i realized you love your self 
more than you can ever love me
 so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy 
that find 
you worn't mind if i say
by the way 
i hate that stupid old pickup truck 
you never let me drive 
your a redneck heartbreaker 
who's really bad at liying 
so watch me strick a match on all my wasted time 
as far as i'm concerned your
 just another picture to burn 
there's no time for tears i'm just sitting here 
planig my revenge there's nothing 
stoping me 
from going out with all of your best friends
 and if you want to come and say sorry to me my daddy going to sjow you how sorry you'll be cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive you're a redneck heartbreacker who's really bad at lieing so watch strick a match on all my wasted time as far as i'm conceroned your just anther puicture to burn and if your missing me you betterkeep it to yourself cause coming back  around here will bebad for your health cause i hate that stupid old pick up truck you never let me drive your a redneck heartbreacker who's really bad at lieing so watch me strick a match on all my wasted time in case you haven't heard i really really hate that stupid truck you never let me drive you'rea redneck heartbreacker who's really bad at liying yeah so watch me strick a match on all my wasted time as far as i'm concerned  your just another picture to burn burn,burn, burn, babay burn just another picture to burn baby burn.---Lyrics submitted by raquel.
