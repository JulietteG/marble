I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light, go,
Hey, skip the conversation and you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the storys got dust on every page,
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in the next room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in the next room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.---
