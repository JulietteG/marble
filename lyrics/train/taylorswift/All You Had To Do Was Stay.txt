People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say youve changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

(Stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then whyd you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up
But I dont know what to stay
Ive been picking off the pieces
Off the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me, are gone forever
When you say goodbye

(Stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then whyd you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this

(Stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then whyd you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then whyd you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)---
