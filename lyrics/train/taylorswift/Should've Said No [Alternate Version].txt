It's strange to think 
the songs we used to sing 
the smiles the flowers everything 
is gone 
yesterday i found out about you 
even now just looking at you 
feels wrong 
you say that you'll take it all back 
given the one chance 
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes 

you should've said no 
you should've gone home 
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go 
you should have known the word 
'bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
and i should've been there in the back of your mind 
i shouldn't be asking myself why 
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet 
you should've said no baby and you might still have me

you can see that i've been crying 
baby you know all the right things to say 
but do 
you 
honestly expect me to believe 
we could ever be the same 
you say that the past is the past 
you need one chance it was a moment of weakness and you said yes

you should've said no 
you should've gone home 
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go 
you should've known the word 
'bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
and i should've been there in the back of your mind 
i shouldn't be asking myself why 
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet 
you should've said no baby and you might still have me

i can't resist 
before you go tell me this 
was it worth this? 
was she worth this? 
no no no no no no

you should've said no 
you should've gone home 
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go 
you should've known the word 
'bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
and i should've been there in the back of your mind 
i shouldn't be asking myself why 
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet 
you should've said no baby and you might still have me---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
