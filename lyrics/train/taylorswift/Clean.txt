The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
You still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I cant wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust
They covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you clean, dont mean you dont miss it
Ten months older, I wont give in
Now that Im clean, Im never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
I think I am finally clean
I, I
Think I am finally clean---
