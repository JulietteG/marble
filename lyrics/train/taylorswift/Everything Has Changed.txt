(duet with Ed Sheeran) 

All I knew is the morning when I woke 
Is I know something now, something now I didn't before 
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago 
Is green eyes and freckles in your smile 
In the back of my mind making me feel right 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you know you know you 

'Cause all I know is we said "Hello" 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know it's simple ain't it? Everything has changed 
All I know is you held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 

And all my walls stand tall painted blue 
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you 
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies 
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time, 
Taking flight, making me feel right 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you know you know you 

'Cause all I know is we said "Hello" 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know it's simple ain't it? Everything has changed 
All I know is you held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 

Come back and tell me why 
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh 
And meet me there tonight 
And let me know that it's not all in my mind 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you know you know you 

'Cause all I know is we said "Hello" 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know it's simple ain't it? Everything has changed 
All I know is you held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 

All I know is we said "Hello" 
So dust off the highest hopes 
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed 
All I know is the new found grace 
All my days I know your face 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed ---
