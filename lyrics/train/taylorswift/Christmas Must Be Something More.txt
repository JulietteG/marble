What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing.
Would the song still survive without 5 golden rings.
Would you still want a kiss without a mistletoe.
What would happen if god never let it snow.
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find

(chorus)

You see that today called something special something holy not superficial. so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives. Something that we all tried to ignore and put a wreath upon your door. Here's something you should know that is for sure. Christmas must be something more.

What if angels did not pay attention to all the things that we wish they would always do.
What if happiness came in a cardboard box then i think that's something that we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away.
Tell me what you would find

(chorus)

We get so caught up in all of it.
Business and relationships
hundred mile hour rides
and its the time of the year and everybody's here its the last thing on your mind

Is that the day called something special something holy not superficial.
So here's the day that Christ has saved our lives.
its something that we all tried to ignore and put a wreath upon your door
and here's something you should know that is for sure.
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
there's got to be more
got to be more---Lyrics submitted by Angel.
