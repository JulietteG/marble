your beautiful eyes, stare right into mine
and sometimes i think of you late at night
i don't know why
i wanna be somewhere where you are 
i wanna be where...

your here, your eyes are looking into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your...
I'm looking through your eyes

i wake up, I'm alive 
in only a little while, ill cry
cause your my lullaby
so baby, come hold me tight
cause i
i wanna be everything you need
i wanna be where...

your here, your eyes are looking into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
im looking through your...
im looking through your eyes

just as long as your mine
ill be your everything tonight
let me love you, kiss you
oh baby, let me miss you
let me see your...
dream about, dream about  dream about your eyes
eyes, eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes...---Lyrics submitted by Taryn.
