Clear blue water
High tides came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grow darker, currents switch you out again
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggle through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

(This love, this love, this love, oh)

Your kiss, my cheek, unwashed, you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When youre young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

(This love, this love, this love, oh)---
