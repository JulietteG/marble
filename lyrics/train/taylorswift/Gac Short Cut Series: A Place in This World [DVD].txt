I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
cause I'm still trying to figure it out 
don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though im not the only one
who feels the way I do...

CHORUS
I'm alone, On my own, and that's all i know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in 
this world

got the radio on, my old blue jeans
and I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine 
could you tell me what more do I need
and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
but that's ok

REPEAT CHORUS

maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
but I'm ready to fly...
