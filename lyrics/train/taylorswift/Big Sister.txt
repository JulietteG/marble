You held my hand and led me through the door
I know I always asked you for more
Youd give me everything just to see me smile
too bad you were only here for a little while

you taught me the difference between right and wrong
when mom and dad would fight youd tell me to be strong
i swear you told me you wouldnt be long
but im still waiting to see ur face again
tell me when

my big sister is gone for now
please dont make me tell u how
theres no one to walk me back from school
no one to hold me and say boys suck girls rule
my big sister knew me right
she tucked me in every night
my big sister watch out for the car
my big sister i dont where u are

so tell me how do u expect me
to forgive u after u left me
i had to listen to the fights
with tears rolling down my eyes---Lyrics submitted by HoLlY.
