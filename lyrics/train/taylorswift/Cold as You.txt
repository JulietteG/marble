You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight because I need to feel something.
You do what you want because I'm not what you wanted

Oh what a shame.
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no used to fulling words that you will never say.
Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you.

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with a nerve to adore you

Oh what a shame.
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no use to fulling words that you will never say.
Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you.

You never did give a damn baby honey
But I cry cry for you
And I know you wouldn't tell nobody 
If I die die for you.

Oh what a shame.
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you make is so condescending 
counting all the scars you made. 

Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you.---Lyrics submitted by Amy Venusio.
