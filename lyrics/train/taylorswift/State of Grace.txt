I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I love the Sades are wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mostly of broken hearts
But this love is raging and wild

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same again

This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right---Lyrics submitted by isabella lim.
