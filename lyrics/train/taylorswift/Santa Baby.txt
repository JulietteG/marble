Santa baby
Slip a sable
Under the tree
For me
I've been
An awful good girl
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Santa baby
A '54 convertible
Too, light blue
Well
I'll wait up for you
Dear, santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight
Yeah

Think of all
The fun I've missed
Think of all the boys
I haven't kissed
Next year I could be
Just as good
If you check off
My Christmas list

Santa baby
I want a yacht
And really
That's not a lot
I've been an angel
All year
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Santa, honey
There's one more thing
I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Come and trim
My Christmas tree
With some decorations
Bought at Tiffany's
I really do
Believe in you
Let's see
If you believe in me

Santa baby
Forgot to mention
One little thing
A ring
And I don't mean
On the phone
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
