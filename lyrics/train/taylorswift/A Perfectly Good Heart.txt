Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now, why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the sign
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still cant believe
That you would walk away, it don't make sense to me

But why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now, why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
Why would you wanna break a?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?---
