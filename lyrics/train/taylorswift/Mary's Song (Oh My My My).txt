she said i ws sseven and you wee nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried 
just two kids you and i...
oh my my my my

i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasnt that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed wed really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my...

take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. riding in you truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my

a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spote in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before 
well rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i

ill be eighty-seven youll be eighty-nine
ill still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my my...---Lyrics submitted by kayla.
