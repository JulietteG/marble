Its 2am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
You say its in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
Its all good, I wish you would

Its 2am, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Itd makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
Its all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here, right now
Its all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
Were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
Its all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
Its all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here, right now
Its all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would---
