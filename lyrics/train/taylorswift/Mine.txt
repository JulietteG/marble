Oh, oh
Oh, oh

You were in college, working part time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin
Wonderin why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, can you believe it?
As were lyin on the couch
The moment I can see it,
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sittin there by the water
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Flash forward and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But weve got bills to pay
Weve got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sittin there by the water
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Oh, oh
And I remember that fight, 2:30am
As everything was slippin right out of our hands
I ran out cryin and you followed me out into the street

Brace myself for the goodbye, cause thats all Ive ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt sittin by the water
And every time I look at you, its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on, youll make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) Were gonna make it now
(Hold on) I can see it
(Yeah, yeah) I can see it now---Lyrics submitted by Kate Maher.
