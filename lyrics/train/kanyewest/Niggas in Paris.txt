So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
first niggas gotta find me
Whats 50 grand to a muhfucka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Yall dont know that dont shit phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We aint even spose to be here,
Ball so hard, since we here
Its only right that we be fair
Psycho, Im liable to go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that dont tick tock
Audemars thats losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, Im shocked too, Im supposed to be locked up too
you escaped what Ive escaped
Youd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, lets get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin Ace on my sick Js
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, Im movin the Nets to BK

[Hook]
[x2]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit cray [x3]

[Kanye West]
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray (that shit cray), aint it Jay?
Ball so hard
What she order (what she order), fish filet
Ball so hard
Your whip so cold, this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like youll never be around muhfuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she dont wanna dance
Excuse my French but Im in France (Im just sayin)
Prince Williams aint do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say Im the illest
Cause Im suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!

[(Chazz) & Jimmy]
I don't even know what that means.
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not
(It gets the people going!)

You are now watching the throne
Dont let me get in my zone [x3]
These other niggas is lyin
Actin like the summer aint mine

[Jay-Z]
I got that hot bitch in my home

[Kanye West]
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Dont let me get in my zone [x4]
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know Im bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Dont let me into my zone [x2]

[Jay-Z & Kanye West]
