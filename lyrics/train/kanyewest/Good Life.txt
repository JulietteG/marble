Like we always do it this time
Chorus- (Kanye) [T-pain]
(I go for mine I got to shine)
[Now throw your hands up in the sky]
(I go go for mine I got to shine) 
[Now throw your hands up in the sky
Ima get on this tv momma ima it down
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay Im Good]
Welcome to the good life where the ***** stay on d
Wont even get pull over in they new v
The good life, lets go on a living spree 
They say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta it feel L.A
It feel like Miami it feel like N.Y summertime-time Chi
Ahhhhhh now throw your hands up in the sky
So i roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk i pop the hood ferarri
And she got the goods
She got that a** i got to look sorry
Yo its got to be cause i sees them haters givin me salty looks lawrys
50 told me go head switch your style up
And if they hate let em hate an watch the money pile up
Chorus
Welcome to the good life where we like the girls who aint on tv
Cause they got more a** than the models 
The good life so keep coming with the bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life it feel like Housten it feel like Philly
It feel like D.C. it feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yae 
Ayyyyyyy this is the good life welcome to good life
Homey tell me whats good
Why i only got a problem when you in the hood
Like im new in the hood the only thing i wish, i wish you f****** would
He probably think he coud but but i dont think he should
50 told me go head switch your style up
And if they hate let em hate an watch the money pile up
Chorus
Have you ever pop champagne on a plane 
While gettin some in with that i never seen snakes on a plane
Whether your broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin money nots everything but havin it is
I was sprlurgin on tred
But when i get my card back activated im back to Vegas
Cause i always had a passion for flashin and before i had it
I closed my eyes an imagened
Is the good life better than the life i live
When i thought i was gonna go crazy
Now my grand-mama aint the only girl callin me baby
If you feeling me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyy Im Good---Lyrics submitted by zero.
