As the axe comes, crashing down
Dragging us, beneath the ground
Abandoned here, you're gone without a sound
All you've taken, all you've said

Still hear your voice, inside my head
Beaten, broken down, and left for dead
Leave me to die

No more denial, no more restraint, no more conscience
And I will seal your fate

So close your eyes
And live in the unknown
Forsaken by the world
Your life has turned to stone

Balanced of your mind decays
Only flesh and bone remains
The fire of the afterlife awaits

No more denial, no more restraint, no more conscience
And I will seal your fate

Just close your eyes again
 There's no escape
Just close your eyes
Your life is mine to take

So close your eyes
And live in the unknown
Forsaken by the world
Your life has turned to stone

Just close your eyes again
And I will seal your fate

So close your eyes
And live in the unknown
Surrender, your free will
Your life has turned to stone
There's no escape this

So close your eyes
And live in the unknown
Forsaken by the world
Your life has turned to stone---Lyrics submitted by Erica Thompson.
