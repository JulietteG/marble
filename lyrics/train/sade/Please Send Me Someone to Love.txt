Heaven please send to all mankind, 
Understanding and peace of mind. 
But, if it's not asking too much 
Please send me someone to love. 

Show all the world how to get along, 
Peace will enter when hate is gone. 
But, if it's not asking too much, 
Please send me someone to love. 

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles. 
My answer is always the same. 
That unless men put an end to all of this, 
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame. 
Just because I'm in misery. 
I'm not begging for no sympathy. 
But if it's not asking too much, 
Just send me someone to love. 

Heaven please send to all mankind, 
Understanding and peace of mind. 
But if it's not asking too much, 
Please send me someone to love. 
HMMMMMmmmmmm---
