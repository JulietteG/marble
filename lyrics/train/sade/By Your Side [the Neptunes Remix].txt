You thnk  d leave your sde baby 
You know me beter than that
Thnk  l leave you down when you r down on your knees
I wouldn t do that 
 I ll do you rght when you want 
And f only you could see nto me
Oh when you re cold 
I ll be there hold you tght to me
When you re on the outsde babe and you cant get n
I ll show you . you re so much beter than you know
When you re lost 
You re alone and you cant get back agan 
I ll fnd you darlng and  ll brng you home
If you want to cry 
I am here to dry your eyes
And n no time . you ll be fne
You thnk  ll leave your sde baby
You know me better than that
You thnk  d leave you down  when you re down on your knees
  wouldnt do that
I ll do you rght when you want 
And f only you could see nto me 
Oh when you re cold
I ll be there  hold you tght to me
Oh when  you re  low
I llbe there by your sde baby
Oh when you re cold 
I ll be there to hold you tght to me
Oh when you re low
I ll b there by your sde baby---Lyrics submitted by Hoda.
