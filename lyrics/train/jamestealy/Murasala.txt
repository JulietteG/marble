Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah, Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah.
Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah, Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah.

One Father, one Son, one Holy Spirit
One mission that all the world might hear it.
Were the army of God.
We stand together as one.
We wont give up until the task is done.

One Father, one Son, one Holy Spirit
One mission that all the world might hear it
Were the army of God
We stand together as one
We wont give up until the kingdom comes (echo).

Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah, Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah.
Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah, Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah.
Nihna kulu murasala la Yasuah.
