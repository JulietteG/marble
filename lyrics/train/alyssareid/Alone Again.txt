[Alyssa]
 Till now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone?

[Jump Smokers]
 This ones for you girl
 Yeah, I think about you all the time
 Tell myself that Ill be fine
 But they know that Id be lying
 Do my best to get you out of my head
 And Ill be trying to fake a smile through my daze
 Though inside Im steady dying, uh
 Back in Chi-town everything reminding me
 I turn on the radio and even music haunts me
 I know I told you this and I told you that
 But the bottom line is, babygirl, I want you back, ugh

[Alyssa]
 When you said I could move on and go
 You said Im weak and it shows
 I couldnt go on with out you
 Now Im sitting in this house alone
 Wondering why I left home
 And Im hoping that you know that

[Chorus]
 Till now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone?

[Jump Smokers]
 Ive been out with other girls
 And no, it aint the same
 And I still turn my head every time I hear your name
 Staring at the phone, can make somebody go insane
 So Im hanging at the club trying to drink away the pain
 This is a nightmare, tell me when Im waking up
 I regret the day that I decided we were breaking up
 Without making up even though our minds are stacked
 Bottom line is, babygirl, I need you back, ugh

[Alyssa]
 When you said I could move on and go
 you said Im weak and it shows
 I couldnt go on with out you
 Now Im sitting in this house alone
 Wondering why I left home
 And Im hoping that you know that

[Chorus]
 Till now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone?

I wonder where you are tonight
 No answer on the telephone
 And the night goes by so very slow
 Ohhhh, I hope that it wont end though
 Alone
 And Im hoping that you know that

[Chorus]
 Till now, I always got by on my own
 I never really cared until I met you
 And now it chills me to the bone
 How do I get you alone?
 How do I get you alone?---Lyrics submitted by aaron.
