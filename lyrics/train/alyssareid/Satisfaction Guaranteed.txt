I screwed up I know 
And I did wrong I know 
What let you down 
you're the best thing around 

There's a hole in my heart
And it tears me apart 
Cause I let you down 
You're the best thing I felt 

Chorus:
I know what you like
I know what you need 
And if you come here tonight 
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Just call me baby again 
I ain't to proud to pled 
I will take care of you 
Satisfaction guaranteed.

The clocks ticks it's time 
But still I can't unwind 
Cause I need your lips 
And your heart next to mine. 

So I do pass the plates 
Just to see your face
Won't let your down 
You're the best thing around 
This hole left in town 

Chorus:
I know what you like
I know what you need 
And if you come here tonight 
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Just call me baby again 
I ain't to proud to pled 
I will take care of you 
Satisfaction guaranteed.

I'm only human
You make mistake too
And nobody knows 
do you like , do you like I do 
Forgive and try to walk in my shoes 
And nobody else 
do you like? do you like I do 

2 x Chorus:
What you like
Baby I know what you need 
And if you come here tonight 
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Just call me baby again 
I ain't to proud to pled 
I will take care of you 
Satisfaction guaranteed.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
