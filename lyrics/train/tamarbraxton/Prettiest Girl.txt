See I got the best man in the world
What more can you ask for ladies
When he makes you feel like you're the prettiest

He wakes me up early in the morning
With the smell of breakfast in bed
It's like a fairytale beginning
A heart full of love, and there's no win
It's got me looking kinda crazy
It's too good to be true
Ain't no man that will make me ever feel like you do
And I love it everyday, all day, 24/7
I love it I feel like cupid done shot me from heaven
Undescribable
How it feels with you

I wanna say thank you for making me feel like I'm the prettiest girl in the world
No matter what I got on, he says I'm beautiful, it's a fact that keeps me so in love
And I wanna thank him, I feel like I'm the prettiest girl in the world
May disagree, but it don't really matter to me,
Say what you want
Cause to him, I'm the prettiest girl in the world

Rose petals on the floor
You don't let me to steam and shower
Now it's time to show me
Everything that he's planned for hours

And I love it everyday, all day, 24/7
I love it, it feels like cupid done shot me from heaven
Undescribable
How it feels with you
Undescribable
How it feels with you

And I wanna say thank you for making me feel like I'm the prettiest girl in the world
No matter what I got on, he says I'm beautiful, it's a fact that keeps me so in love
And I wanna thank him, I feel like I'm the prettiest girl in the world
May disagree, but it don't really matter to me,
Say what you want
Because to him, I'm the prettiest

He says I'm the prettiest girl in the world and ain't a chick got nothing on me
I know I'm the prettiest girl in the world that's why they all be hating all over me

When my hair looks a mess, yeah he gon' tell me that I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful
Check it, when I run around here, I ain't got no make up, I'm beautiful
He says I'm beautiful

He makes me feel like I'm the prettiest girl in the world
No matter what I got on, he says I'm beautiful, it's a fact that keeps me so in love
And I wanna thank him, I feel like I'm the prettiest girl in the world
You may disagree, but it don't really matter to me,
Say what you want
Cause to him, I'm the prettiest girl in the world---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
