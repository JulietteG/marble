What you got to understand is
I'm still here
I could've been with any man I wanted 
so let's be clear

Yea I know that she hurt you 
there are those circumstances 
you got a lot of things to work through
you don't want to take no chances
what you got to understand is, 
even with all that I'm still here

If you just show me where it hurts 
I can kiss away the pain
I can make you good again if you let me
if you just show me where it hurts 
I'll make it alright if you want me to 
all you got to do is show me where it hurts
show me where it hurts, baby

I know it's hard to give in
but just try
cause you know that you can trust me
love you right
yea I know that she hurt you
there are those circumstances 
I'll never be the one to hurt you
don't miss out on this chance
just let yourself go 
'cause I'm still here

If you just show me where it hurts
I can kiss away the pain
I can make you good again if you let me
if you just show me where it hurts
I'll make it alright if you want me to
all you got to do is show me where it hurts
show me where it hurts, baby
show me where it hurts
show me where it hurts, baby

I know you see that I'm the one you need
(one you need)
and its just not fair to compare her to me
she can not compete
we're better together than a part 
you have my heart 
so come and show me babe

Show me where it hurts
I can kiss away the pain 
I can make you good again if you let me
just show me where it hurts
and I"ll make it alright if you want me to
now all you got to do is show me where it hurts
show me where it hurts
just show me where it hurts---Lyrics submitted by Lola Thompson.
