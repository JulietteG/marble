I- I know what you're thinking,
And there's no reason why, 
You should be set on leaving,
'Cause we just started.

You're not going to sneak away this time,
'Cause we've got to meet the sun at 5,
Do you really want to say goodnight?

Don't stop, it's just the beginning,
It's not the end of the night,
Tick-tock, your clock is ticking,
Don't say it's over,
I don't want to go, x4
don't want to go home.

Oh, what do you think you're doing?
When did you get so old?
The second hand is moving,
You're wasting my time.

Take a look at your watch,
It's only one,
And we've got to meet the morning sun,

Do you want to leave it all undone?

[Chorus]

(Come on, we're just getting started) x6

Yeah,

[Chorus] x2---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
