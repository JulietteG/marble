Tell me why,
Your eyes never find their way to me

It's like I'm in disguise,
Am I really that hard for you to see?

Don't want to be invisible,
Let me be unforgettable,

Tonight- is the night,
I'll make you cry 'cause you're laughing so hard,
Watch you lie asleep in my arms,
And though you don't even know my name,
All of that will change,
Tonight.

Just a matter of time,
Before your heart skips a beat,

And you're wondering why,
It took so long for you to see,

That this could be incredible,
So unbelievable,

[Chorus]

If all will change,
Tonight,
And all of that will change.

[Chorus] x2---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
