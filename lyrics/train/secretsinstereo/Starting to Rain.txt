I've never been good at saying goodbye
But everyday I wake up, and I try
I'm haunted by memories, of things I can't change
They're changing me

Still hurts to let go
But everyday I do
I'm looking for some hope
This cloud will pass through
I'm pressing rewind
I'm searching for when
We have the skies
But it's starting to rain again

You're like a movie
Playing in my mind
I get lost in your laughter
And your smile
But it's just the beginning
Of a winding storyline
That leads to the ending

Still hurts to let go
But everyday I do
I'm looking for some hope
This cloud will pass through
I'm pressing rewind
I'm searching for when
We have the skies
But it's starting to rain again

Starting to rain again
Starting to rain again

Still hurts to let go
But everyday I do
I'm looking for some hope
This cloud will pass through
I'm pressing rewind
I'm searching for when
We have the skies
But it's starting to rain again

Everyday
Everyday

Starting to rain again

Everyday
Everyday

Starting to rain again

Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
