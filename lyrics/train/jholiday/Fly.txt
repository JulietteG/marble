Flyyyuuu fly fly fly..ooo aahhh..mmm..
I know people change, but I hate we change
And its killing me just tryin to figure out 
Where we are..cuz it aint the same
Girl Ill take the blame and im willing to take this 
chance If you feel weve traveled too far, lord knows I wanna keep you life 
Without you I just cant see it.. but sometimes you gotta let 
love be what its gonna be

[chorus] ooooo I ima let you fly and pray you come back to me
Cuz I do believe, if I let you fly, then u fly right back and it was meant to be..soo fly

It was only me taking flights over seas, but now its you cuz weve finally realized ur a star
Whenever in the same place at the same time, now we dont feel the same way
Upon a rewind.. take it back to where things made sense I think weve flown too far..
Lord knows I wanna keep you life without you damn I cant see it.. 
sometimes you gotta let love be Wat its gonna be

[chorus] oooo fly ima let you fly and pray you come back to me cuz I do believe if I let you fly then ull fly right back then It was meant to be..so fly fly fly.. 

oh fly fly..and all i know to let you do was to let you fly fly fly.. hey i wanna fly with you.. but fly i know u fly..i know u gotta see wat u gotta see yeahh..fly fly fly and i hope you fly back to me if i let ya..

[chorus]..fade away..---Lyrics submitted by Erika.
