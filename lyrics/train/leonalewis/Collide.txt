Ill pick you up when youre down
Be there when no ones around
When youre in unfamiliar places
Count on me through lifes changes

Im in tune with how you feel
Everything bout this is real
When youre in unfamiliar places
Count on me through lifes changes

Youre all I want, yeah yeah
I know youre the one, yeah
Youre all I want, yeah
I know youre the one, yeah

Crash into me
At full speed
Crash into me
We can collide, we can collide

Crash into me
At full speed
We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide

Crash into me
We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide

When youre in unfamiliar places
Count on me through lifes changes

Know that youre never alone
In me you can find a home
When youre in unfamiliar places
Count on me through lifes changes

Youre all I want, yeah (yeah)
Youre all I want (oh), yeah (yeah yeah)
Youre all I want, yeah (you are the one)
I know youre the one, yeah (you are)

Crash into me
At full speed
We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide

Crash into me
We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide

We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
