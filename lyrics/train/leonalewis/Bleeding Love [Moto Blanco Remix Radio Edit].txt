closed off from love 
i didnt need the pain
once or twice was enough
and it was all in vain
time starts to pass
before you know it your frozen

ohhhh

but somthing happened for the verry first time with you
my heart melts into the ground found something true
And every ones lookin round thinkin im goin crazy

ohhh eyey

( chorus)
but i dont care what they say 
im in love with you
they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth
my hearts crippled 
by the vein
that i keep closing
you cut me open and i
keep bleedin 
keep, keep bleedin love
i keep bleedin 
i keep , keep bleedin love
keep bleedin 
keep keep bleedin love
you cut me open

tryin not hear
but they talk so loud
their peircing sounds fill
my ears
try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that the goal
Is to keep me from fallin

eyyyeyyy

But nothings greater
than the rush with your embrace
And in the world of loneliness
i see your face
Yet everyone around me
thinks that im goin
crazy , maybe , maybe

chorus

And its draing all of me
oh they find it hard to believe
ill be wearing these scars 
for everyone to see
