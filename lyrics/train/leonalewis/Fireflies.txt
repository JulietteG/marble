If I could only see this night as another day 
Id know you found your silence, 
Instead of being wrapped up in me, 
Wrapped up in this violence. 

Im back floating on water, 
Looking out at the night. 
Theres a hole in the sky, 
All those fireflies. 

Dont believe in the sun, 
Or the night-time skies, 
Theyre only fireflies. 

Took a walk out the door, 
On the day you would die. 
And I looked up to the sun 
And I saw fireflies. 

And now I cant see no boarder 
Between the day and the night 
You were torn all your life 
Between those fireflies. 

Fire, its only fire, 
Its only fire, its only fireflies 
Fire, its only fire, its only fire, 
Its only fire, its only fire. 
Its only fire, its only, its only fire.---Lyrics submitted by Trn T M.
