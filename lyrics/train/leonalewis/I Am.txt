I thought the moment I was leaving
Barely breathing
Fall to pieces, couldn't face this
Why would I be leaving?
I was believing
It's you and me against the world

Not saying I was afraid of you
Won't put the blame on you
But I won't change for you
Just when you thought you dropped me
I gotta drop the news, I'm still existing
I'm still here

I am with or without you
I am breathing without you
I am somebody without you
I am, I am
I am free without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

First steps that I was making
On this new planet
Never done, found all I wanted
The world was so forgiving
Open-hearted
Warm and loving, amazing

I never once regretted it
And I'll break my bread
I'm revealed again
All of the mistakes that I made
Finally led the way
To a better place

I am with or without you
I am breathing without you
I am somebody without you
I am, I am
I am free without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

First my remedy, now my poison
Won't get down to love until I'm afraid to live
Oh yeah

I am with or without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

Ooh yeah
I am me
Ohhhh---
