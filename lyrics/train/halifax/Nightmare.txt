It's second nature for you
And it's the first to make u the last one
The last one in my line
The first to make you cry

So let's drink this bottle to the very last drop
Tell me what you find at the bottom
And don't say you forgot what I need
'cause all I need is you.

Tonight, tonight I send out apologies
The time is cut off right over the edge
And if I try to say your name I'll just bite my tongue
It's your nightmare make sure to handle it well
I turn up your evil turn down your care

It's your nightmare make sure to handle it well
Turn up your evil turn down your care

I point this troubled ambulance
The passenger is nowhere to be found I escaped
What will they think of me?
What will they think of me?
When I lock my body in the trunk of your car
Put all the pressure to the gas
Turn the Autopilot on
Let's see if we can fly tonight

Tonight, tonight I send out apologies
The time is cut off right over the edge
And if I try to say your name ill just bite my tongue
It's your nightmare make sure to handle it well
Turn up your evil turn down your care
It's your nightmare make sure to handle it well
Turn up your evil turn down your care

If I'm the cure
She's the disease
Do what you will
Just know what this means
If I'm the cure
She's the disease
Do what you will
Just know what this means

Tonight, tonight I send out apologies
And if I try to say your name I'll just bite my tongue
It's your nightmare make sure to handle it well
Turn up your evil turn down your care
It's your nightmare make sure to handle it well
Turn up your evil turn down your care---Lyrics submitted by elaina.
