No matter what has ever come to me,
I got my own brand of company, 
I got da da da inside my head 
And I play songs back to back until I go to bed, 

Wake up by myself inside an empty room 
There's no body next to mine to ooh ooh ooh, 
But my skin is warm and my heart is full, 
It's the do do da do do doo, 
Walking waking on a crowed street 
With my headphones loud so my hips can swing, 
So my head can nod to the rock & roll 
To the boom boom beat

~CHORUS: 
And I find that I'm never alone 
And I find that my heart is my home
And the music within makes me whole
A world that I built on my own
And I know that I'm never alone 
And I know that my heart is my home 
Every missing piece of me 
I can find in the melody 
I can find in the melody
~
No matter what has ever come to me 
I got my own kind of company 
I got ba ba ba inside my head 
And I sing songs back to back until I go to bed
There's a river in my mind that's never still
Swimming to it all the time gives me a thrill
Swimming in the notes that go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Wondering waking in an empty world
It is quiet here 
I am powerful
I look down below 
Serenade the world 
From inside my soul

~CHORUS~

BRIDGE: 
(Sha-dup sha-dup) When the walls begin to creep in (Ahh ahh)
(She-bop she-bop) And the sky falling down (Ahh ahh)
(Sha-dup sha-dup) When I'm swallowed up in feelings (Ohh ohh)
(She-bop she-bop) I get lost inside the sound
