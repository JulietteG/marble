Girl, I hate the way he broke your heart
I hate to see you torn apart
I hate to see you take it so hard
Oh but girl I believe in destiny
I bless the day he set you free
And I know that it sounds selfish of me, but

I love the way he left you
I hate the way you hurt
I'd give my lucky stars above
if I'd have been there first
But don't you see he led you 
right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry
but I love the way he left you 

Girl, I know that you still see his face
It's something that I can't erase
but that's a chance I'll just have to take
Whoa and Girl,
I know it's gonna take some time
but I know you're gonna be alright
once I drive him out of your mind

I love the way he left you
I hate the way you hurt
I'd give my lucky stars above 
if I'd have been there first
But don't you see he led you 
right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry
but I love the way he left you

I love the way he left you
I hate the way you hurt
I'd give my lucky stars above
if I'd have been there first
But don't you see he led you
right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry 
but I love the way he left you---Lyrics submitted by Melinda Baird.
