Lost in the day, in a way, it's same as the one before this,
And I wish I could say that's it's all black and white
But it's grey. It's the same, it's the same and I'm so tired
But you are what I'm coming home to

Oh and I'm thinking about a red wine buzz and takin' it easy,
And I got you in my arms, takin' a break from crazy

And I'll say "hey! "
You'll say "baby, how's your day? "
I'll say "crazy"
But it's all gonna be alright
You'll kiss my smile
I'll pull you closer
Spend a while just getting to know ya
But it's all gonna be alright
Loving you tonight
Loving you tonight

And you are there on my heart at the start of my every morning
And I can't deny by the end of the day that I'm running on empty
But you make me full, steal my breath
You're so unpredictable
That's what I'm coming home to

Oh I'm dreaming about a romance, slow dancing with you
When I got you in arms, then I don't care what we do

And I'll say "hey! "
You'll say "baby, how's your day? "
I'll say "crazy"
But it's all gonna be alright
You'll kiss my smile
I'll pull you closer
Spend a while just getting to know ya
But it's all gonna be alright
Loving you tonight

'Cause every day is just the in-between
The hours separating you from me
I know you'll be waiting
I know you'll be waiting

And I'll say "hey! "
You'll say "baby, how's your day? "
I'll say "crazy"
But it's all gonna be alright
You'll kiss my smile
I'll pull you closer
Spend a while just getting to know ya
But it's all gonna be alright
Loving you tonight
Loving you tonight---
