Let me tell you something
Dont you worry about a thing tonight
I promise you that everything is gonna be alright
Hold your head up high
Look up to the sky
Everything is gonna be "Alright"
He's everything that you'll ever need "Alright"
Just when you think it and it's gonna be "Alright"
Just call his name and you'll see what I mean "Alright"
Because HE loves you unconditionally

CHORUS
Forever, he loved you always
Don't worry he'll be there always
And just because you've had yourself a couple bad days
Dont mean its gonna be this way always
REPEAT

REPEAT CHORUS

No matter what you're going throooough
And then you dont know what to dooooo
Don't turn and run away
Fall on your knees and praaaaaaay
Remember that he's witcha

CHORUS

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh

CHORUS

pause

Forever forever
Forever forever
Forever forever
Forever forever---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
