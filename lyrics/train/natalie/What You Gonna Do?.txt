So what you gonna do 
What you, what you gonna do 
Well, it's the King of the Trill, Bun B on the flip 
Coming down dripping that candy with grain and grip 
You see my tippin' my fours, see me bangin' my screws 
See me lookin' for something jazzy baby, just like you 
So what you gonna do, so what you gonna do 
So what you gonna do, so what you gonna do 

[Chorus: Natalie] 
What you gonna do if I say I'm gonna leave with you tonight, tonight, tonight 
What you gonna do if I say I'm gonna leave with you tonight, tonight, tonight 
So you can call me up, and you can pick me up 
We can do whatever you wanna do 
I know you wanna touch, well let me know what's up 
We can do whatever you wanna do 

I spotted you and I noticed you were lookin' at it 
It's up to you, however you want to get at it 
Well make your move 
Because I'm waiting for you tonight, tonight, tonight 

So can I roll with you 
You can roll with me 
If it's what you wanna do 
Let me know girl 

So I'll be down with you 
You'll be down with me 
If it's what you wanna do 
Let me know boy 

I got the whip outside 
When you're ready, we can roll 
It's sitting on the thang 
So you know we about to roll 

I'm trying to get at you 
So you can leave with me tonight, tonight, tonight 

So what you gonna do 
What you, what you gonna do wit' it 

[Chorus: Natalie] 
What you gonna do if I say I'm gonna leave with you tonight, tonight, tonight 
What you gonna do if I say I'm gonna leave with you tonight, tonight, tonight 
So you can call me up, and you can pick me up 
We can do whatever you wanna do 
I know you wanna touch, well let me know what's up 
We can do whatever you wanna do 

I like the way you comin' at me 
Boy it feels good 
You put it down like I know you would 
It's me and you alone 
Boy let's take our time 
And no need to rush 
So we'll do what's on your mind 

So can I roll with you 
You can roll with me 
If it's what you wanna do 
Let me know girl 

So I'll be down with you 
You'll be down with me 
If it's what you wanna do 
Let me know boy 

I got the whip outside 
When you're ready, we can roll 
It's sitting on the thang 
So you know we about to roll 

I'm trying to get at you 
So you can leave with me tonight, tonight, tonight 

So what you gonna do 
What you, what you gonna do wit' it 

You wanna go with a rider 
You wanna ball out in style 
Well get behind the wheel with the trill 
I'll make it worth your while 
I'll show you just how it feels, feels 
To live like a queen 
And cut you out a slice of life baby that you've never seen 
The best cars, clothes, cribs, and shine 
Not to mention, the thug love makin' to blow your mind 
Anytime she want more than just a one hitter quitter 
She already know 
Call me up and mayne i'm comin to get her 

What you gonna do if I say I'm gonna leave with you tonight, tonight, tonight 
What you gonna do if I say I'm gonna leave with you tonight, tonight, tonight 
So you can call me up, and you can pick me up 
We can do whatever you wanna do 
I know you wanna touch, well let me know what's up 
We can do whatever you wanna do
