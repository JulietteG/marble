Rachelle Ferrell:
Oh Lord
What did I do to deserve him
Heaven knows
I'm not like You I'm not perfect
When he sees
Will he leave
Or will he stay anyway
Anyway

Will Downing:
Oh Lord
What did I do to deserve her
Heaven knows
Lord knows I'm only human
Can this be
Someone truly for me
Or is it a cruel fantasy

Both: Chorus
Nothing has ever felt like this
Nothing has ever meant the whole world to me
Nothing has ever been this good
And nothing has ever been this right
Nothing so sweet
In my life

Rachelle:
I know
That you treasure me

Will:
And I, I know
That I'm the only man you see yeah

Rachelle:

Nothing has ever felt
Quite like this, oh no
Nothing has ever meant
(Will) The whole world (Rachelle)The whole world to me ye yea yeah

Both:
Nothing has ever been this good
And nothing has ever been this right
Nothing so sweet
In my life

Rachelle:

Will:
And nothing has ever
Felt this right before my love

Both:
Ain't nothing Ain't nothing ever been so sweet
