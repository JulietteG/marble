Lord you are faithful your love never ends
you've proven to be an infallible friend
your my protector you cover my soul
new mercies and grace you unfold
ooh my soul's been anchored in your word alone
you are my creator can't stand on my own
im depending on you to direct me each day
i trust you so lord have your way
Chorus:
You are my refuge and you are my fortress
my God in you i will trust


Verse 2 :
In you there is no doubt or nothing unfair
for you are the righteous one none can compare
i am persuaded your my everything
you are the soon coming king
your my perfect sacrifice you fill my space
when i deserved death Lord you stood in my place

my greatest love of all yes that's who you are
i will follow wherever you are
Chorus:
You are my refuge and you are my fortress
My God in you i will trust (over and over)---Lyrics submitted by keimani.
