Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (get gone)

Now look whos coming, yeah, look whos back
Quick, drop the bombshell straight to the track
21st century killing machine
Burnt on the inside, a five-headed team
Now Im not the same because youre not the same
And youre not the same because Im not the same
And were not the same this could never be the same
And we just want to survive

:Chorus:

Now you want to save us and you want it all
And you want the trasmit because you want the call
And you want the one that makes the worlds the collide
But since that has happened it has grown twice inside

(Im not the same)

:Chorus:

Get up, get up (drop the bombshell)

:Chorus:

(everybody should drop the bomb)

Yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
