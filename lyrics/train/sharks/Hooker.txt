Come on over baby. Yah, come on now honey.
You got the time. And I got the money.... Hey!
You ain't lazy standing on the corner.
Come on over baby, yah I think you outta.

You got the time and I got the money!
Come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.... Hey!
You got the time and I got the money!
Come on over baby. yah, come on over honey.

Pull up on the sidewalk. Give you all the sweet talk.
Get you in my door. I come and then you go.
You treat me real nice, like a sugar 'an a spice.
I give you all my money and then you leave me honey. 

You got the time and I got the money!
Come on over baby. Yah come on over honey.... Hey!
You got the time and I got the money!
Come on on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.

I take you to my room and lay you on the bed...
Pull down your panties, and then you give me head. 
Hey!..You gotta suck!
You gotta blow. You gotta treat me real mean!
Come on over sugar. I dont know where you be.

You got the time and I got the money!
Come on over baby. Yah come on over honey.... Hey!
You got the time and I got money! 
come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.

You`re a HOOKER!
You`re a LOOKER!
Hey! You`re a HOOKER!.... Wheew, SHOOKER!
Yah, suck me now!

...........I`m not waiting for you...........

Come on over baby. Yah, come on now honey.
You got the time and I got the money.... Hey!
You ain't lazy, standing on the corner.
come on over baby. Yah, I think you outta.
You got the time and I got the money!
Come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.... Hey!
You got the time and I got the money!
Come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.... Hey!
Come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.... Hey!
Come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.... Hey!
Come on over baby. Yah, come on over honey.... Hey!
