Drowning in love  

	First i was scared to go down to the water
	Everyday trieeed harder and harder
	Told my self i could stick and could win
	Should have known i have to jump right in
	Here i am drowning in love with you 

	Be chaired please keep me knockin
	Pull me in i felt more stoppin
	Little merrmaid tipted me
	now im tangled in the deep blue sea
	Here i am .. drowning in love with you  

	Over my head, coming for sure
	Over my haiiiir sure it feels goooood

	Throw conscieus through the wind 
	Ive been down twice and im ready again
	Over my head drowning in love with you 

	I thought live begin was gonna be trouble
	Im so happy now here making bubbles
	Under the way calling your hand
	Im so glad you pulled me of that land
	Here i am .. drowning   in love  with you 
	Over my head, coming for  sure 
 	Over my haiiiir sure it feels  goooood

	Throw conscieus   to the wind 
	Ive been there twice and im ready again
	Here i am ..  drowning in   love with you  3x---Lyrics submitted by freek.
