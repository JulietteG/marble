It's time for training and we're getting started
It's on, you know
And we wanna see you whip and shout it
We rock, you roll

They say, go slow
And everything just stands so still
We say, go go
We're ready for the fight, we know the drill

Monday morning and we feel defeated
Seems so long ago
Tuesday's comin', we just keep on beatin'
'Til we're in our zone

They say, go slow
And everything just stands so still
We say, go go
You'll see us rip into it, just

Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, we're gonna do it again, we just

Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, and do the Weekend Whip

Wednesday morning and we soon discover
We gotta push our game
We slept on Thursday just to get it over
The whip's a day away

They say, go slow
And everything just stands so still
We say, go go
You'll see us rip into it, just

Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, we're gonna do it again, we just

Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, and do the Weekend Whip

They say, no no
But we don't wanna sit around no more
We say, go go
You'll see us rip into it, just

Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, and do the Weekend Whip

Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, come on and do the Weekend Whip
Jump up, kick back, whip around, and spin---Lyrics submitted by Ralph Cobarde.
