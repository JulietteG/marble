Mother nature must have made her
With perfection in mind
I'm so happy that I found her
That girl is one of a kind
There's nobody else
In this wide world

Yeah she's my baby doll (baby doll)
Our love's a lock
It's solid as a rock
Yeah she's my baby doll (baby doll)

From the first time
That I saw her
I never seen a girl so fine
In the cradle of creation
That girl is one of a kind
There's nobody else
In this wide world
Can do the things to me she do

Cos she's my baby doll (baby doll)
Our love's a lock
It's solid as a rock
Yeah she's my baby doll (baby doll)

Ooh, ooh she's my baby doll
My baby doll
Ooh, ooh she's my baby doll
Ain't nobody else
Ooh, ooh she's my baby doll
I keep her to myself
Ooh, ooh she's my baby doll---Lyrics submitted by Chris Cruz.
