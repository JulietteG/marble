We're all slaves to the sun
We circle around
Until our time comes
We're all slaves
To the sun

We're unknown
To The Stars
Too small to show
And anyway much too far
We're unknown to the stars

Dont take this life too hard
If you think you're gonna fall apart
Don't take this life too hard
Lose your dreams
Your'e gonna lose your heart

Whenever you want to cry
Remember
That I tried to tell you why
Whenever you want to cry

Cos we're all slaves to the sun
We circle around
Until our time comes
We're all slaves
To the sun

Dont take this life too hard
If you think you're gonna fall apart
Don't take this life too hard
Lose your dreams
Your'e gonna lose your heart

Don't take this life too hard
If you think you're gonna fall apart
Cos we're all slaves to the sun
Yeah we're all slaves to the sun
We're all slaves to the sun---Lyrics submitted by Chris Cruz.
