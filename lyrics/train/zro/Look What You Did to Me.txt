[Z-Ro] 
They tell me put the dope down, and it won't hurt no more 
But the only thing I really seem to understand, is murda mo' 
They tell me keep my trigga finger 
easy, I'll open up your body 
Too many casualties around here, dead bodies around here 
And I can't get caught up, preacher can you save me, save me 

They said it was gonna get greater later 
But now I can't help to think that it ain't 
But a nigga was fed up with this 
life, thinking about running 
a razor blade 
Cross my wrist, every last drop till I faint 
Taken out there, pulling smith for 
the thangs that I never did 
Coming up as a a young kid 
Trying to get rid of all the animosity towards me 
That was shown by the other kids, what did I do wrong, 
why do everybody wanna see a nigga fall 
Mama dead an daddy can't be found 
So when I'm stressed out, who the fuck can I call 
All alone in my own zone, with no friends, 
So I chose, to make friends with drugs 
Cause everyday, everybody around me 
Trying to clown me, so I got afraid and I got buzzed 
Out of frustration came aggravation 
Depression coming down in my mind 
Kept a nigga confused and straight crying 
Dying, from sweet sticks in line 
Throwed off in tha mind 
Trying to wonder why do Jesus let this keep happening 
To a nigga that's steady being on his knees 
And I'm begging you please, have mercy on me 
Find a nigga a better way, right about now I'm to the point 
Somebody better take this infrared away 
Cause if it go too long, and I got a piece of chrome 
And I want to you to come and look and see 
The monster that you've created, look at what you did to me 

[Z-Ro] 
They tell me all the liquor ain't good for me 
But it drowns out the vision of my casket 
It's either my life or your life, that's right 
I'm gon let you haaave it 
Everyday haters, can't understand 
The way I move my hands in ways, not known to man 
Cause I can't get caught up 
Preacher can you save me, save me 

Could it be the invisible, individual nigga 
That got to get more bigger 
Got a hell of a one hitter quitter knock out, bigger

Motherfucker got mo' skills with a trigga 
Shootung scud missiles, dropping a bomb 
Chucking hand grenades, C4's explode 
When I be sleeping on the same bench, for nine days 
Living off of hot water and cheerios 
Here it goes, my click back gotta roll 
Nigga mind was thinking throwed 

A 24 fists apposed to those 
They acting like nothing but bitches and hoes 
Suppose, all a nigga wanted was the good life 
Live in upper class, laid back on my ass 
With a maid and a butler 
Sipping on a ice cold glass 
God damn it, I'ma do it but I had to start introdcin em' 
To mac nine plus one that's ten 
Better think, many murders would of been avoided 
I just wanted a friend, feel me 
But they can't kill me, but I don't give a fuck 
If I bust with a gun, cause I don't give a damn no mo' 
You ain't dealing with the same 
motherfucker from three years ago 
will a nigga fight fair, knocking out a patch out your hair 
with a quick lick, from a damn breaking, a nigga done went crazy 
Look at what civilization done made me 
This is my era of terror, I am the man with the gun 
That admitted never to miss, would of ever miss 
When it be busting, a lot of you gonna be rushing 
Cause a nigga war like this 
Innocent child with a smile with a dream of advanced 
To the top, but I got a gun in your mouth 
You want to respect me now, should of 
Respected a nigga when you had a chance 
Haters, been making me into a punk trying to figure me weak 
Better get ready, fore' them put zip-locs 
And a whole of cops, and a whole lot of blood stained 
Sheets, drunk a lot of beers, shed a bunch of tears 
When I reminisce on them years, when I 
see little boys and girls 

Living the life that I wanted to live 
Since I really couldn't live with it 
It's gonna be hard for the other motherf**kers to try 
Cause they dying, hey mama 
I want my Tunker toys right now 
Don't make me cry, I don't wanna have to kill again 
I kill em out, till the world is empty 
Look at the the album cover 
That's what you did to me 

[Spoken] 
If I done told you once 
I done told you a thousand times 
It's plain to see that you can't change me 
Nigga cause I'ma forever be a nigga for life 
A thug nigga, a Guerilla Maab nigga 
A Killa Klan nigga, a Mo City nigga 
Mo City mean mo killers, mo blood spillers 
Mo burglars, mo murderers 
Mo kick door burglars, mo niggas 
That'll slap a patch out your motherf**king ass 
For real, count on it, respect it 
Trust it and believe it, we ain't no 
Fake ass niggas we real, packing loaded steel 
Ready to bust at will, we don't love you 
Look at what you did to me---
