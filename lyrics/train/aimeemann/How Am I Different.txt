I can't do it,
I can't conceive,
you're everything you're trying to make me believe.
cuz this show is too well designed,
too well to be held with only me in mind.

and how how am i different?
how how am i different?
how how am i different?

i can't do it so move along,
do you really wanna wait until i prove you wrong?
and dont tell me, let me guess.
i could change it all around if i would just say yes.

and how how am i different?
how how am i different?
how how am i different?

just one question before i pack,
when u fuck it up later do i get my money back?

i can't do it and as for you,
could you in good conscience even ask me to?
cuz what do you care about the great divide?
as long as you come down, on the winner's side?

and how how am i different?
how how am i different?
how how am i different?

just one question before i pack,
when you fuck it up later do i get my money back?
just one question before i pack,
when you fuck it up later do i get my money back?
just one question before i pack,
when you fuck it up later do i get my money back?---Lyrics submitted by dumott.
