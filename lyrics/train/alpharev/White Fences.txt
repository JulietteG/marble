Last night 
you left a note that your white fence was gone
Where is your head?
Stuck in a hole

It was the first time you had a chance 
and you gave it all up 
With nothing left
Stuck in a hole

and I feel like I'm in hell
cause I tried to save myself
I didn't think I needed help
Was it too late, walking through the wasteland

Great light has kept my compass pointed 
down in the dirt
I've got nothing left
Stuck in a hole

and the light shines into the darkest places
for a desperate heart when I was left
Stuck in a hole

and I feel like I'm in hell
cause I tried to save myself
I didn't think I needed help
was it too late, walking through the wasteland
crawling through the wasteland
looking for a true friend
standing out with both ends

I'll never stop looking
for the way out
for the way out
I don't wanna stay in---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
