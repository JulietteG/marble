Chorus:

(Justin Timberlake):
Ooooooo
I've been travelin
On this road to long
Just trying to find
My way back home
The old me
Is dead and gone
Dead and gone
Ooooooo
I've been travelin
On this road to long
Just trying to find
My way back home
The old me
Is dead and gone
Dead and gone

(T.I.)
Ever had one of dem days
U wish woulda stayd home
Run into a group of niggas
Getting they hate on
U walk by
They get wrong u reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion
Way past discussion
Just u against them,
Pick one then rush em
Figure u get your hair?
That next
They don't wanna stop
There now they bussin
Now u gushin, ambulance
Rushin u to the hospital
With a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times
Plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down
Now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now
U lucky to be alive,
Just think it all started u
Fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way
But ya pride is the way u
Could fuck around
Get shot die anyday
Niggas die
Every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice
Game ordinary hood shit
Could this be
Cuz of hip hop music
Or did the ones
With the good sense
Not use it
Usually niggas
Don't kno what to do
When their back
Against the wall
So they just start shootin
For red or for blue
Or for blo I guess,
From Bankhead
Or from your projects
No more stress,
Now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take
Time to think,
Before I make mistakes
Just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away.

(Chorus)

(T.I.)
I aint never been scared,
I lived through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead
Lookin back at it
Most of that shit
Didn't even have to happen
But u don't think about it
When u out there trappin
In apartments hangin
Smokin and rappin
Niggas start shit didn't
Next thing ya kno we cappin
Get locked up
Then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn
What a life I had
Most of that shit
Look back just laugh
Some shit
Still look back just sad
Maybe my homboy
Till be around
Had I not
Hit the nigga
In the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga
Walkin out that door
Whoda thought I'd never see
Philant no more
Got enough dead homies
I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job,
Cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin
Now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there
Talk shit all night
Cuz I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take
Time to think
Before I make mistakes
Just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away.

(Chorus)

(J.T.)
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
The new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
The new me will be alright
