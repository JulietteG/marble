She came along like she was hiding some deep secret,
but now she's gone and I carry on to keep it.
The cow's are grazing, boys, the fishing's getting good.
If fate's an old woodpecker, I'm an old chunk of wood.

Some mysteries we will never know,
the turtle dove and the crow made a nest.

We shared a line etched in stone between two years
I aim to pack my grave someday and go see her
Want to climb that ladder, Jacob won't you hold the door.
Just got to drop me a line this side of Jordan.

Some mysteries we will never know,
the turtle dove and the crow made a nest. 

She came along like she was hiding some deep secret,
she saw the future, boys, and I was her ticket.
The American dream suited us just fine.
I'm a lay down easy in my time of dying.---Lyrics submitted by Sam B.
