Went out on the town for just one round
And it seemed one down, just one enough
I have no broken heart
my soul is far from torn apart (But I know enough to play the part)
Heres one more down, and thats just the start

Well i'm fool for the finest girl
But shes no fool for me
I try and try to catch her eye
And pray someday that she may see

But time is my answer?
Draggin' water through the crowd
I ain't a-dancing, dancing on my cloud

Well I hear tale of that morning dove
She flies from pine to pine
So i'll take wing, mourn and sing
Until that girl for me is mine

Well I laid there with circles in my head
And I dreamed that dream I never had
I was coming down a mountain into a deep dark core
But in that dream it didnt seem all that bad---Lyrics submitted by chLc.
