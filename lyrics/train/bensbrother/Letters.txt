I spy with my little eye,
Something beginning with U
'Cause A faded away
B, C and D faded too
I've tried all the others,
But they just won't do.

Cause nothing is better,
Than our two love letters
Perfect are U and I

So lets lie here together,
Come bright or bad weather
and write ourselves into the sky

Now O put on a show but I wouldn't go there again,
and G was special to me, I know we'll always be friends
but I, I don't know why, she's just not U

'Cause nothing is better than our two love letters,
Perfect are U and I
So lets lie here together, 
come bright or bad weather
and write ourselves into the sky

I spy with my little eye
Something beginning, beginning, beginning...

'Cause nothing is better than our two love letters
Perfect are U and, and I
So lets lie here together come bright or bad weather
and write ourselves into the sky.---Lyrics submitted by Steve Lawton.
