It's been, it's been, it's been, it's been
su-su-su-such long time, long tiem, long time
since any body touched me, touched me, touched me
the way that you touch me

so if I stutter, stutter, stutter
then I fell so so so unsexy
so maybe I'll just keep my mouth shut
at least until you kiss me

so kiss me again
'cause only you can stop this stu-stu-stu-stu-stuttering
kiss me again
ease my su-su-su-su-susususuffering
woaa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah....oww

I know, I know, I'ts so so so symbolic
of everything, everything that's wrong with me and you
so tell me what Im supposed to do

ooh it's been ages, since we've been rally honest
but I can make ch-ch-ch-changes
if you really want this

so kiss me again....---Lyrics submitted by jorge.
