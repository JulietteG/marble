Sitting in my bedromm
Thinking of a love gone
Wondering why it went wrong
Over again

You didn't really know me
And it feel like you owe me
But i guess at least you showed me 
Not to do it again

Coz i've been knocked out,
Found out
About time that it turned around
Coz i've got to find the one thing that
Will get me over you,so

One day you've gotta find me an 
Angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together 
Again
One day you've gotta send me an angel
Coz i'm back at the beginning but i'm
Holding out for more
This time

I'm tired of being lonely
I'm getting to it slowly
But i'm running out of patience
Running out if strength

There's got to be a reason
For everything i'm feeling
But i think i've learned my lesson
I'm never doing it agin---
