I've been left out a while
I sold the family plot for time
Sold the only thing I liked
So I could taste it

You've been drinking all night
We both know when you're drunk
The future rewinds
It happens every fucking time
But you erase it

All that I really wanted to do was to leave it all
All that I really wanted to do was to leave it all
For you

These days that you finally find
That pure restitution is not on your side
There's never been a place to hide
You have to face it

Nobody thinks you're actually right
It feels like a battle, it's more like a fight
You always bark, you never bite
I don't believe it

All that I really wanted to do was to leave it all
All that I really wanted to do was to leave it all
To you

Let me make up my mind [x3]
So I can change you

All that I really wanted to do was to leave it all
All that I really wanted to do was to leave it all
For you ---
