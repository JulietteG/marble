I could of sworn that I saw you knee bent on the bedside,
Arms stretched like a kite that time will eventually grow.
I'm so sure of it
And I've got a reason, too long, for songs
That tells why your legs and arms are actually able.

Cause I confide in wolves at night
have you seen my baby girl, she's lonely.

I've got to crucify myself if I am gonna believe you
I've got to promise that I'll finish all the things I said I'd do to begin with too
I've got to make my bed if I am gonna lay with you
Cause a disaster's a disaster no matter what Christian language you drag it through

Cause I confide in wolves at night
Well have you seen my baby girl, she's lonely, so lonely
Cause I confide in wolves at night
I'm like a virgin losing a child, so lonely, so lonely

I swear I did what I could for your rights,
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try nothing, try something, try anything
I swear I did what I could for your rights,
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try something, for nothing, for something.
Something
I swear I did what I could for your rights,
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try something, try nothing, try anything.---Lyrics submitted by Lindsay.
