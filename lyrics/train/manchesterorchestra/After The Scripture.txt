After the scripture
We started to pray
Holding our hands up
Waitin for change

I hardly knew you
You knew me the same
So we built a shelter
While we turned the weak away

Your mother beside me
Rattling her brain
Making an offering
Pacing the pain
We took a picture
Placed it in frame

We built a fire 
And we turned the cold away

And I know its not what you desire
This pain, cant crumble 
Wont soon retire

Everybody there was trying to hide some great desire
Put away the positives and let that good girl die
Everybodys prayers were tuned into a gradual sigh
So I paced around the backyard for a while

That was a bee sting
A spec in my eye
A casual movement
A thief in the night
Now I cant forget you
Sword in my side
Candle that burned me
Deliver me life

And I know its not what you desire
This pain cant crumble
Wont soon retire---Lyrics submitted by Kayla Anne.
