All my life, I've tried to do what's right.
First star i see tonight,
Make my wish come true.

Why can't we join hands around one tree?
let live and let it be
Make Christmas last forever..

REFRAIN:
When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh,
Goes all around the world in just a day
From the north pole to the southern tip
He makes his trip with love to give away
Hear him say

CHORUS:
It's Christmas all over the world tonight
It's Christmas all over the world

All my life
I learned if i was good
And did everything i should
My dreams would all come true

I can see
A special time when we
Join hands around one tree
And make christmas last forever

REPEAT REFRAIN:

REPEAT CHORUS _till fade---Lyrics submitted by julieanne luis.
