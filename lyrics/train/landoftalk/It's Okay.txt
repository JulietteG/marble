It's Okay, 
I don't even cry
All I think about is a memory
In that dream when you kissed my arm
As I look away, don't hear
What I say

That maybe when I die
I get to be a car
Driving in the night
Lighting up the dark.
Something in your voice
Sparks a little hope
I'll wait up for that noise
Your voice becomes my home

Long way round, don't care what I find
A little thunder's good, I thought maybe you would
But it's okay, we all feel left out
Sometimes growing up, it can get you down.


I give you something that no one's gonna to give you
My sleepin' skin and my heart deep down in you
I'll never tell you, but you're my little scar
Goodbyes are hard and they're hard and they're hard

Maybe when I die
I get to be a car
Driving in the night
Lighting up the dark
Something in your voice, 
Sparks a little hope
I'll wait up for that noise
Your voice become my home---Lyrics submitted by Maegan.
