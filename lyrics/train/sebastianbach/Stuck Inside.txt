Stuck Inside 

I feel you taking on
Everything that I said
That I Want
And then you said it's over

Cause I'm stuck inside
Cause I'm stuck inside

I'll take all you got
And everything you said
That I can't
And then you said it's over

Cause I'm stuck inside
Cause I'm stuck inside

I won't let you break away
I know your feelings change
From everything you said today
Peeling the layers of emotions away

I'm breaking down again,you'll see
I need just one more special thing
Now I,1 2 3 4 5 6,I count away my time
All my life is empty; Now I said it's over

Cause I'm stuck inside
Cause I'm stuck inside---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
