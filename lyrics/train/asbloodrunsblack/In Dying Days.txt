Leaders are hard to come by,
followers are omnipresent.
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle
Satisfied!
No one is setting a path for us to follow,
no ones striving to be on top.
No one is setting a path for us to follow
we will all fall in the end.
In dying days!
The path has been set,
you're leading far astray.
Far Astray!
The path has been set,
you're leading far astray.
Far Astray!

BRING DA MUTHAFUCKIN RUCKUS!

In Darkness!
Unfortunate as u may be,
you'll never see the light.
Someone must rise above,
someone must precede.
Unfortunate, you must precede!
Unfortunate!
Leaders are hard to come by,
followers are omnipresent.
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle,
Staisfied!
No one is setting a path for us to follow,
we will all fall in the end.
In dying days
As the time to rise approaches
No one will take responsibility---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
