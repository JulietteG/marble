'cause it's the pick
of destany
child you'll know where we'll be rockin' cause it's f**kin' insane
It's just the pick
of destany
child more precious than a dimond on a platenum chain
in venis beach there was a man named kage
when he was buskin' he was all the rage
he met jables and he taught him well
all the techniks that were developed in hell
cock push-ups and the power slide
gig stimulation now theres know where to hide
they formed a band they named tenacious d
and then they got the pick of destany
'cause it's the pick
of destany
child you'll know where we'll be rockin' cause it's f**kin' insane
'cause it's the pick
of destany
child our tasty moves are better than a chicken chow men
'cause he who is sleasy
is easy to pleasy
and she who is juicy
must be loosy goosy
and he who is groovy will be in my movie
so come on
the wizard and the demon had a battle royal
the demon almost killed him with an evil capow
but then he broke his tooth and thus the demon said oww
'cause it's the pick
of destany
child you'll know where we'll rockin' 'cause it's f**kin' insane
it's just the pick
of destany
child you know our movies better than the citizen kain
'cause he whos a geezer
must live in my freezer
and she who is starky
is full of malarky
and he who is groovy must be in my movie
so come on
oh
'cause if you're a diva
then go to geniva
and if you're a krony
then suck on my boney
and if you are groovy
then get it my movie
it's called the pick of destany
the pick of destany---Lyrics submitted by Dylan.
