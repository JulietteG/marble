Can't you see he's the man
Let me hear you applaude
He is more than a man
He's a shiny golden god.

If you think it's time to fucking rock
and fucking roll out of control
Well then you know you got to rock the block
You fucking suck, my fucking cock

'Cause when you rule
your fucking school
all of the fools
out of their jewels
'Cause if you think it's time to
if you think it's time to
if you think it's to fucking rock

He is going to kick your fucking ass
and you know his name is Kyle Gass
Rocking and fucking rolling
and fucking rocking and fucking rolling
and fucking
