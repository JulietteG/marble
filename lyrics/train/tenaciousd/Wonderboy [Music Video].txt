High above the mucky-muck, castle mad of clouds, There sits WONDERBOY, sitting oh so proudly. Not much to say when you're high above the mucky-muck. Yeah, yeah. WONDERBOY,what is the secret of your power? WONDERBOY, wont you take me far away from the mucky-muck man? 

[spoken]
Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman,
archrival and nemesis of WONDERBOY,
with powers comparable to WONDERBOY.
what powers you ask?
i dunno how 'bout the power of flight?
that do anything for ya? 
That's levitation, holmes. 
how 'bout the power to kill a yak from 2oo yards away...
with mind bullets! That's telekinesis, Kyle.
How 'bout the power to move you?

[sung]
History of WONDERBOY and Young Nastyman,
Riggah-goo-goo, Riggah-goo-goo.
A secret to be told,
a gold chest to be hold,
And blasting forth with three-part harmony,
yeow!
WONDERBOY, what is the secret of your power?
WONDERBOY, won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck man?

[spoke]
Well, WONDERBOY and Young Nastyman,
joined forces" they formed a band the likes of which have never been seen,
and they called themselves TENACIOUS D.
That's right,

[sung]
Me! And KG!

[KG[spoken}:) That's me.

[sung]

We'er now Tenacious D!
Come fly with me, fly

WONDERBOY, what is the secret of your power?
WONDERBOY, won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck man,
oh!

[spoken]
Take my hand!
Young Nastyman, and we'll fly!
Bring out your broadsword.
there's the hydra.
slice his throat!
and grab his scroat.
you take the high road,
i'll take the low.
there the crevasse,
Fill it with your mighty juice.---Lyrics submitted by Christopher.
