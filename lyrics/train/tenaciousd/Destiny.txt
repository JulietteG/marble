Beelz: I am complete!

The D: Fuuuuuuuuck!

Beelz: Yes, you are fucked,
Shit out of luck!
Now i'm complete
and my cock you will suck
This world will be mine
and your first in line
you brought me the pick
and now you shall both die!

JB: Waaaaiiit! Waaaaiiit!
Waaaaiiit, you motherfucker!
We challenge you to a rock off!
Give us a chance to rock your socks off.

Beelz: FUCK! FUCK!
Fuuuuck!
The demon code prevents me
from declining a rock off challenge
What are your terms?
What's the ca-a-atch?

JB: If we win you must take 
your sorry ass back to hell.
And also you will have to pay our rent.

Beelz: And what if i win?

JB: Then you can take Kage back to hell.

KG: What!

JB: Trust me Kage, its the only way.

KG: What are you talking about?

JB: To be your little bitch

Beelz: Fine! Let the rock off begin!
Hahahahahahaha!
I'm the devil, i love metal!
Check this riff is fucking tasty!
I'm the devil, i can do what i want!
Whatever i got, i'm gonna flaunt.
There's never been a rock off i've ever lost.
I can't wait to take Kage back to hell.
I'm gonna fill him with my hot demon gel!
I'll make him squeal like my scarlet pimpernell.

JB: NOOOOOOOOO!!!
C'mon Kage, lets fight his music,
with our music!

KG: There's just no way that we can win,
that was a masterpiece

JB: Listen to me.

KG: He rocks to hard 'cause he's not a mortal man

JB: God damnit Kage!
He's gonna make you his sex-slave.
Your gonna gargle mayonaise.

KG: No..

JB: Unless we bust a massive monster mamajam! 

KG: Dude, we've been through so much shit.

JB: Deactivated lasers with my dick.

The D: Now it's time to blow this fucker down!

JB: C'mon Kage, now it's time to blow doors down.

KG: I hear you Jables, now it's time to blow doors down.

JB: Light up the stage, 'cause it's time for a showdown.

KG: We'll bend you over, then we'll take you to brown town.

The D: Now we've got to blow this fucker down.

KG: He's gonna rape me if we do not blow doors down.

JB: C'mon Kage 'cause it's time to blow doors down.

KG: Uuuu, we'll piledrive ya, it's time for a smackdown.

JB: Hey, Anti-Christ-a, Beelzeboss
We know your weakness, our rock it sauce.
We rock the Kashbah, and blow your mind
We will defeat you, for all mankind.
You hold the septre, we hold the key.
You are the devil, we are the D!

We are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
we are the D, we are the D,
WE ARE THE D!

Beelz: You guys are fucking lame
C'mon Kage, you coming with me.
Taste my lightning fucker!

JB: Noooo!!!

Beelz: Aww, FUCK! MY FUCKING HORN! Ohh, noo!

JB: From which you came, you shall remain,
untill you are complete again!

Beelz: Nooo!!!
Fuck you Kage, and fuck you Jables!
I'll get you Tenacious D!
