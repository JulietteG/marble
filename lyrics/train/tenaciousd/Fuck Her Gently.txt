This is a song for the ladies 
But fellas listen closely 
You don't always have to fuck her hard 
In fact sometimes that's not right to do 
Sometimes you've got to make some love 
And fuckin give her some smoochies too 
Sometimes ya got to squeeze 
Sometimes you've got to say please 
Sometime you've got to say hey 
I'm gonna Fuck you softly 
I'm gonna screw you gently 
I'm gonna hump you sweetly 
I'm gonna ball you discreetly 
And then you say hey I bought you flowers 
And then you say wait a minute sally 
I think I got somethin in my teeth 
Could you get it out for me 
That's fuckin teamwork 
Whats your favorite posish? 
That's cool with me 
Its not my favorite 
But I'll do it for you 
Whats your favorite dish? 
Im not gonna cook it 
But ill order it from Zanzibar 
And then I'm gonna love you completely 
And then I'll fuckin fuck you discreetly 
And then I'll fucking bone you completely 
But then I'm gonna fuck you hard 
Hard
