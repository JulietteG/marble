There is a name that is so precious
A name so wonderful to me
This name is worthy of all praises
Because of Him, I am made free

That name is Jesus, Oh, how I love Him
The One who gave His life for me
Because of Love so unconditional
I will have life eternally

This name speaks peace unto my storm clouds
This name speaks calm unto my fears 
And when I feel that no one loves me 
His loving presence is so near

That name is Jesus, Oh, how I love Him
The One who gave His life for me
Because of Love so unconditional
I will have life eternally

Praise that Name, Praise that Name 
Praise that Name, Praise that Name...
Someday I'll leave this earthly dwelling
Through time and space my soul will soar
And finally see the face of Jesus (I'm gonna see Jesus!)
And praise that Name forevermore

That name is Jesus (Jesus), Oh, how I love Him (I love Him)
The One who gave (Jesus), His live for me (gave His life for me)
Because of Love so unconditional I will have life eternally

Oh, (Praise) Matchless is that Name! (That name Jesus)
Oh Glorious (Praise) is that Name (That name Jesus)
Oh Wonderful (Praise) is that Name (That name Jesus)
Just Praise (Praise) That Name!---Lyrics submitted by Aynjel.
