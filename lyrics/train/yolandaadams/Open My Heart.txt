Mmm. Oh, oh, talk to me. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, talk to me!
Alone in a room, it's just me and You.
I feel so lost, cause I don't know what to do. 
Now, what if I choose, the wrong thing to do, 
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing You.

So, I need to talk to You,
And ask You for Your guidance,
Especially today, when my mind feels so cloudy,
Guide me, until I'm sure.
I open up my heart, Oh yeah.

My hopes and dreams, are fading fast,
I'm all burnt out, and I don't think, my strength's gonna last,
So, I'm crying out, crying out to You.
Lord, I know, that You're the Only One,
Who is able to pull me through.

So, I Know, I need to talk to You, and ask You for Your guidance,
Especially today, when my world seems so cloudy,
Lord, guide me, until I'm sure.
That's why I open up my heart.
Oh yes, I do.

So, show me how, to do things Your way,
Don't let me make the same mistakes, over and over again,
Your will be done, and I'll be the one,
To make sure that it's not doubt.
I don't want any doubt.

That's why, I want to talk to You, Yes, I do,
And ask You for Your guidance,
Especially today, when my world seems just a little bit cloudy,
Lord. You guide me, until I'm sure.
That's why, I open up, I open up my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart.
All, I need to do, is just hear a single Word from You,
Oooh, I open up, I open up , open up my heart,
Just one Word will make a difference in what I do,
Guide me until I'm sure.
I open, I open, I open, I open my heart, 
Oh, You just say one word, one word, one word, one word, one word, one word.
I open up, I open up, open up my heart, my heart to You to You
You're the Lover of my soul,
You're the Captain of my sea,
I need a Word from You.
That's why I open up my heart!---Lyrics submitted by Connie Peters.
