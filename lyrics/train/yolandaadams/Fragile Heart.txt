I rember the first time you laughed with me
And I remeber the promies that you would never leave my side
Now I'm standing with the news of a tradgity
Standing here with a fragile heart

See I never shead a tear
I stayed strong for them, O yes i did
When everybody dissapeared, It'sonly you who keeps me strong
And I can't imagine going on, Without you in my life
Going on with a fragile heart

When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you
I forget aout everyting else, there's only you and I
And I can't think about ever giving up, can't give up the fight
The ony thing that matters lord is you

I ain't got no time to pretend that i'm not missing you
I know your in good hands
Saying hands that hold my heart 
And I'll cherish every moment we spent, as a gift from God above
For He takes care of all fragile hearts

When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you
I forget about everyting else, There's only you and I
And I can't think about ever, ever, ever giving up the fight
For the only thing that matters, when i'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

You see my fragile hearts been broken
An your the only one who can put it all together again
So i'm trusting you Lord, For seeing me through

There's only you and I 
I can't think about ever giving up, can't give up the fight
Only thing that matters, When i'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

When I think about my life
I forget about everything else
Only you and I
I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up, Can't give up
For the only thing that matters Lord is you---Lyrics submitted by Mikaya.
