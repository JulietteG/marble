It almost goes unnoticed to the naked eye 
But a half-moon finally turns full all in good time
And I've been making headway inch by inch since you've been gone
I've accepted the fact you're not coming back, I'm moving on and

Little by litle, I'm letting go
Slowly but surely, I'm holding my own      yes
Little by little, I'll make it through
Hey, I took the fall, but in no time at all I'll be over you

Taking these first steps like a child
Living alone without you is shaky at times
But you don't get where you're going in this life by leaps and bounds
It's a small victory just to be making ground       and

Little by litle, I'm letting you go
Slowly but surely, I'm holding my own       yes
Little by little, I'll make it through
Hey, I took the fall, but in no time at all I'll be over you

A love that once burned so bright
Won't die down, don't go out overnight     and

Little by litle, I'm letting go  
Slowly but surely, I'm holding my own
Little by little, I'll make it through
Hey, I took the fall, but in no time at all I'll be over you---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
