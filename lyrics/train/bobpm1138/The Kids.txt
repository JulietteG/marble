(feat. Janelle Monae)

Drug boy said it's show time
Streets don't give a damn
They filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're fill with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance

I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance

Well, since I was planted at birth
I abandoned my own planet and I landed on earth
As I kid I never understood what I observed
Some of it was strange but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You could call it deficit, really I just didn't listen
And I was always missin'
The teachers like, where is bobby simons?
But tryna get a record deal is all I can I remember
It's funny cause lookin back on the past that I had all my days in the streets tryna prove that I was bad
I still elevated to the level that i'm at
Still elevated to the level that i'm at

Drug boy said it's show time
Streets don't give a damn
They filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're fill with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance

I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance

Sometimes it's hard to grow
While livin in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
When no love is in his heart?
A child can barely see that i
Do worry bout tomorrow
And what it beholds,
He drowns himself
Deep down in his sorrow
Will you run or will you share your light
Tell a story of the live and try
See it when we're given hope
That we know that we can grow

Drug boy said it's show time
Streets don't give a damn
They filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're fill with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance

I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance---Lyrics submitted by Noah.
