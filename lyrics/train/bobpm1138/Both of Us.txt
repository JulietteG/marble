[Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[B.o.B]
Ever thought about losing it
When your moneys all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you do for rent
And the grass so green on the other side

Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Were never freezed by two hundred times
Open up the fridge about twenty times
But still cant find no food in it

Thats foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?

Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
But yall tryna climb with the same ol ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol paddle

Why so shallow? Im just asking
Whats the pattern to the madness?
Everybody aint a number one draft pick
Most of us aint Hollywood actors

But if its all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of yours

[Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[B.o.B]
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
Thats why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no ones ever spoke for us

To every single time that they play this song
You can say that thats what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like youre just another person

Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we wont be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds

These are the things thatve molded us
And if life hadnt chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up
'Cause if it was up to me, Id make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey

But if its all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of yall

[Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us---Lyrics submitted by Britney Patricia Marie.
