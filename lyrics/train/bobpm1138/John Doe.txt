(feat. Priscilla Renea) 

[Priscilla Renea] 
Seems like your heart stops working 
The minute they close the curtain 
And take off your mask 
And take off your costume 
And if anyone asks you're taking a smoke break 
Drinking some coffee 
But everyone knows what you're doing 
Seems like the bus moves slower 
Just cause you got somewhere to go 
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills 
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription 
You got an addiction 
Who do you think that you're fooling 

[Priscilla Renea] 
John Doe, I just want the John I know 
Once you put the drinks on hold 
Maybe you could come back home 
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh 
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh 
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

Errybody's addicted to something 
Errybody's got to grip onto something 
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal 
Maybe once, maybe twice 
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times 
Without it, it's just harder to function at times 
You race to the bottom of every single bottle 
As if there was someone or something to find 
You're struggling in your mind 
And you tell yourself lie after lie 
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private 
People that you work with noticed the signs 
When you walk in the room 
It gets noticeably quiet 
So you break up the silence, you say you've been at the gym 
But the way that you look, you can't blame on the diet 
So what you hiding?

John Doe, I just want the John I know 
Once you put the drinks on hold 
Maybe you could come back home 
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh 
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh 
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

Yeah, I've probably had too many things 
Smashed too many freaks 
Had too much to dro...(I mean) 
Had too much to drink 
Left the club, ended up in custody 
Random drug test, passed it luckily 
My girl broke up with me cause she walked in suddenly 
With a woman up under me 
I told her "Wait! 
It ain't what it look like! 
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!" 
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do 
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it 
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different 
I love all the money, the fame 
And the parties with beautiful women 
I'd spent so much time as an underground artist 
Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business 
And what I'd become 
But that what you'd judge I become 
The path with the greatest resistance 
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot 
And change your perspective and flip your entire position 
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience 
Everything possible 
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical 
Now, I can see it - it's optical 

[Priscilla Renea] 
John Doe, I just want the John I know 
Once you put the drinks on hold 
Maybe you could come back home 
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh 
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh 
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh---
