You know we have been banished from most counties, states, and towns,
From Ottowa to Paris and we made that list of Mao's.
We gathered up a group of gals to do our bidding low
The gals they lay with all the men; it seems they can't say no

No milady, no milady, no milady, no
No milady, no milady, no milady, no

While our girls are laying down with these jackanapes,
We crawl from underneath the bed, hunting down our take.
Finished up, slow and spent, they spent more than they know,
And thank our girls for their cheap fare, they guess they can't say no

No milady, no milady, no milady, no
No milady, no milady, no milady, no

Once in DC City, the mayor came for a see,
Proclaiming his importance he asked for one for free.
Our best said "sure," flashed a grin, and lifted up her skirt.
He bared it all to the city press when they asked him "where's your shirt?"

A Catholic township in the north a priest asked for a spin,
We robbed him of his rosary before he did begin.
He fell upon both his knees, cried "gentlemen, be fair!
"Either way, it's a sin," so we we gave him his share.

So he did 

know my lady know my lady know my lady know 
know my lady know my lady know my lady know 
know my lady know my lady know my lady know 
know my lady know my lady know my lady know 

No milady, no milady, no milady, no
No milady, no milady, no milady, no

We've learned the traits of all the men who leap in for a go,
They spy us hidin' 'neath the bed but still they can't say no
Diamond rings and money clips and men's teeth made of gold--
Nothing's quite as valuable as our ladies in the know!

No milady, no milady, no milady, no
No milady, no milady, no milady, no

No milady, no milady, no milady, no
No milady, no milady, no milady, no---Lyrics submitted by Geoffrey Moses.
