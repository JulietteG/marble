Bar-Ba-Sol 

When I woke up I could see 
The daylight had already passed me 
It was such a fight to fade away asleep 
It's a fugue 

Come on 
Found to chase down the dawn 
And I fell every night as it turns 
Into light with my eyes just shut tight 
Sailing all alone 
I thought I made it home 
But I threw it all away 

Oh I leave myself strong now 
I suppose it's not a dream 
Falling in between 
I feel sick, I feel nervous 
I know just what I did to deserve this 
Though I know it's not a dream 
Keeping quiet 

Laying low 
Holding on to what I don't want to know 
Till the daylight turns to ash and blows away 
Missing keys 
Bloody nose 
Consequences of what I chose 

Keep an eye on me 
Don't all my memory 
Cause it's definitively---Lyrics submitted by joenevir.
