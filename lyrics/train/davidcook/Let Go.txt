I got a happy trigger finger
And I know not to let it linger
This moment is potent
'cause I'm feeling a transition
From the city of tradition
One action: reaction

Has it been that long since you opened up your eyes
To look out below
'cause it'll hit you when you're not watching
I don't know why you won't let go
So let go

A release of some proportion
The event is set in motion
This white line is defined
So take your hands away from my eyes
'cause you can't escape the sunrise
One action: (reaction)

Has it been that long since you opened up your eyes
To look out below
'cause it'll hit you when you're not watching
I don't know why you won't let go
So let go, let go

Has it been that long since you opened up your eyes
To look out below
'cause it'll hit you when you're not watching
I don't know why you won't let go
So let go, let go---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
