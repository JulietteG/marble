Are you waiting for something 
'Cause there's a tension in the air 
Of something unresolved 
I can smell it in your hair 
So step down (step down) 
Look around (look around) 
You could leave it all behind 
Never hear another sound 
Say you're holding onto someone 
They will never show you the same 

[CHORUS]
So don't say a word 
That I wouldn't say 
Just crumble it up 
And throw it away 
We're just wasting time 
We're taking up space 
So don't say a word 
That I wouldn't say to you 

Are you breathing for nothing 
'Cause there's a vision in my eye 
Of something unresolved 
I swear it feels like this could die 
I can see (I can see) 
To a degree (to a degree) 
A broken back is always something 
If you did it saving me 
Say you're holding onto nothing 
And it's showing all over your face 

[CHORUS]

So don't say a word 
That I wouldn't say 
Just crumble it up 
And throw it away 
We're just wasting time 
We're taking up space 
So don't say a word 
That I wouldn't say to you [x3]---
