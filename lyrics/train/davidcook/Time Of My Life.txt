Ive been waiting for my dreams 
To turn into something 
I could believe in 
And looking for that 
Magic rainbow 
On the horizon 
I couldnt see it


Until I let go 
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn 
Now Im coming alive 
Body and soul 
And feelin my world start to turn 

And Ill taste every moment 
And live it out loud 
I know this is the time, 
This is the time 
To be more than a name 
Or a face in the crowd 
I know this is the time 
This is the time of my life 
Time of my life 

Holding onto things that vanished 
Into the air 
Left me in pieces 
But now Im rising from the ashes 
Finding my wings 
And all that I needed 
Was there all along 
Within my reach 
As close as the beat of my heart---Lyrics submitted by Cosmas.
