quit acting so friendly
don't nod don't laugh all nicely
don't think you'll up-end me
don't sigh don't sip your iced tea
and don't say it's been a while
and don't flash that stupid smile

chorus;
don't ask me x2
don't ask me, 
ask me,
ask me how i've been

don't think i've forgotten
you never liked that necklace
so cordial so rotten
kiss kiss let's meet for breakfast
don't show up so on time
don't act like you're so kind

chorus

don't sit there and play just 
so frank, so straight, so candid
so thoughtful, so gracious, 
so sound, so even-handed,
don't be so damn benign,
don't waste my fucking time

chorus---Lyrics submitted by husk.
