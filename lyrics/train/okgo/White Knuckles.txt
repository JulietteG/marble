You'll never get that taste,
Out of your mouth.
You'll never get the paw prints,
Out of the hen house, now.
And you can't go back,
Same way you came.
Round all the pieces up,
But they just don't fit the same.

White Knuckles.
Maybe it's not so bad.
So, let your hair down now.
White Knuckles.
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
Oh, go ahead and let it down.

Some come and let it all out,
Let it bleed.
Did you get what you want?
Did you get what you need?
And behind the lines,
Behind the wall,
Tell me was the bed you made,
Really that bad after all?

White Knuckles
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad.
So, let your hair down now.
White Knuckles
Oh, maybe it's not so bad.
So, let it all come down, now.

So, just how far,
Is far enough?
Everybody needs to sleep at night,
Everybody needs a crutch.
But couldn't good,
Be good enough?
'Cause nothing never doesn't change,
But nothing changes much.

Yeah, maybe it's not so bad.
So, let your hair down now,
White Knuckles.
Maybe it's not so bad.
Let it all come down, now.
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad.
Just let your hair down, now.
(White Knuckles)
Oh, maybe it's not so bad.
Just let it all come down.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
