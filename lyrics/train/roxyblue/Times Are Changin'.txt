Oh yeah!
You caught on up by my side every night
Just lean on me darlin, wanna hold you so tight
tell me all the words when we're miles away
Just close you eyes and remember and I'll be there for you baby, yeah

Times will come, times will go, i know
We still in love, baby let it show
[chorus]
Lady I know, times are changin'
When it's cold outside, I know
Times are changin'
woah!

hand in hand we walk down the Golden Roller
but now it feels like the road is runnin' short on love
times will come, times will past, I know
with love ours, we gotta make it last

[chorus]
Lady I know, times are changin'
When it's cold outside, I know
Times are changin'
Oh baby!

All the times that we had I'm still yearning
Precious times that we had now we runnin'
Woah!

Times will come, times will go, i know
We still in love, baby let it show
[chorus]
Lady I know, times are changin'
Don't you feel the same?
Baby, I know, times are changin'
Woah!
Baby, I know, times are changin'
Won't you please tell me why
Baby, I know, times are changin'
Woah! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh! Yeah!
Woah! ---Lyrics submitted by susan sowell.
