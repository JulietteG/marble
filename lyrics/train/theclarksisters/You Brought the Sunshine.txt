You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine in my life
You are the lifeline
Since that I have found Christ
There has been such a change in my life

You made my day

You heard me every time I pray
You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine
You are the lifeline
Since that I have found Christ
There has been such a change in my life

You made my day
You came my way
You heard me every time I pray
You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine
You are the lifeline
You brought the sunshine
You are the lifeline
Since that I have found Christ
There has been such a change in my life

I'm a witness that Jesus
He'll make a difference in your life

You made, You made my day
You came, You came my way
You made my day
Oh you you you you gave me grace
You gave me peace
When the storms were raging you set me free

You made, You made my day
You came, You came my way---Lyrics submitted by Marshon.
