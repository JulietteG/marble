Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us?
Never molested though in the wrong

When we see Jesus coming in glory
When He comes down from His home in the sky
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by ---Lyrics submitted by Kimberly Davis.
