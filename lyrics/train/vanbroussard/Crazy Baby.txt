Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
Thats what I am over you

Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
You know I love just you

You got me runnin round in circles
Waiting for you to decide

Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
Cmon and be my wife

All of my life
 I waited for someone like you

Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
You know I love just you

SOLO

All of my life
 I waited for someone like you

Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
You know I love just you

Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
Thats what I am over you

Crazy, crazy, crazy Baby
You know I love just you---Lyrics submitted by Terri.
