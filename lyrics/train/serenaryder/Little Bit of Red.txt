Ooooh......

Hey you say you want to start over again 
like i ever wanted it to be any different. 
I've been watching all your colours fade, 
too blue......
said you'de come back like I'd want you want you 
stop pretending everything's all right. 

Chorus: 
Oh baby blue, oh baby blue 
come here I'm gonna smear another colour over you 
get out of bed you little sleepy head 
your black and white needs a little bit of red. 
your black and white needs a little bit of red. 

Oooh...... 

Couldn't handle pressure life had put you through 
thought you might have bit a little more than you could chew. 
no i don't believe it when you say i will make it up to 
you said you'de come back didn't want you to want you to 
still pretending everything's all right. 

Chorus:
Oh baby blue, oh baby blue 
come here I'm gonna smear another colour over you 
get out of bed you little sleepy head 
your black and white needs a little bit of red. 
your black and white needs a little bit of red. 


Baby blue oh 
Baby blue oh 

Chorus:
Oh baby blue oh baby blue 
come here I'm gonna smear another colour over you 
get out of bed you little sleepy head 
your black and white needs a little bit of red. 
your black and white needs a little bit of red.---Lyrics submitted by Clare.
