I don't know what you think that you're trying to prove
I don't know what you think that I can do for you
I don't believe in who you think that I should be
Because my world is so much bigger than you see

So get off the way
Out of my way
You are in my way

Got a heavy love
Rolling like thunder
Coming from above
Made sure that you're under
Falling like the rain
Burning like fire
Got a heavy love, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Oh, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Oh, oh
Do you think you're strong enough

Why did you tell me you wanted me to be free
Then turn around and hold me so tight I couldn't breathe
Getting so angry I didn't see what you'd seen
Have you forgotten that you used to love me

All the way
In every way

Got a heavy love
Rolling like thunder
Coming from above
Made sure that you're under
Falling like the rain
Burning like fire
Got a heavy love, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Oh, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Oh, oh
Do you think you're strong enough

To catch me when I'm falling
Open up your heart and let it feel
You know my love's for real

Got a heavy love
Rolling like thunder
Coming from above
Made sure that you're under
Falling like the rain
Burning like fire
Got a heavy love, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Got a heavy love
Rolling like thunder
Coming from above
Made sure that you're under
Falling like the rain
Burning like fire
Got a heavy love, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Oh, oh
Do you think you're strong enough
Oh, oh
Do you think you're strong enough---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
