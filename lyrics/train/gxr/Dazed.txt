You enlighten my mind
Taking me places few ever find
Seasons change, time goes by
We play, we smile, we cry

You turn the key deep within
Justify what Im feelin'
Clear my way, so we can share
A love so rare

You got me in a daze, wont have it any other way
Life will not be the same, living from day to day
You got me so amazed, can feel you when you're miles away
Love is here for you to claim, don't let it slip away, away
No, no

My heart once drowned in sorrow
Gives me life in a new tomorrow
Beats in the sky with love in my eyes
Giving me the freedom to rise

You turn the key deep within
Justify what Im feelin'
Clear my way so we can share
A love so true, so rare

You got me in a daze, wont have it any other way
Life will not be the same, living from day to day
You got me so amazed, can feel you when you're miles away
Love is here for you to claim, don't let it slip away, awa...

(You got me) [2x]

Show you feelings inside, giving you the freedom to rise [4x]

You got me in a daze, won't have it any other way
Life will not be the same, living from day to day
You got me so amazed, can feel you when you're miles away
Love is here for you to claim, don't let it slip away

You got me in a daze, won't have it any other way
Life will not be the same, living from day to day
You got me so amazed, can feel you when you're miles away
Love is here for you to claim, don't let it slip away, away
No, no
