With a worried mind
We give it all to make you happy
And leave it all behind

One smile, all night
You gonna be alright
One smile, all night
All aboard for the fun time

All you need is one smile
We will give you all night

All you need is one smile

A happy face was all we wanted
Now let it shine
Yeah boys and girls, it's where your heart is
Put on your biggest smile
