The freakiest show i know
is the show of my own
living my life in and out
of the twilight zone

bust my britches
bless my soul
i'm a freak of nature
walking totem pole
look and see i think you'll agree
nobody weird like me

intercourse with a porpoise
is a dream for me
hell bent on inventing
a new species

bust my britches
bless my soul
i'm a freak of nature
walking totem pole
look and see i think you'll agree
nobody weird like me

riding down the path
on the back of a giraffe
me and the giraffe laughed
cause i passed some gas

bust my britches
bless my soul
i'm a freak of nature
walking totem pole
look and see i think you'll agree
nobody weird like me

enchanted as a rabbit
that my life is a dream
well everything is never
just as it seems

the freakiest show i know
is the show of my own
living my life in and out
of the twilight zone---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
