Lucy Reibart, 
she's a friend of mine 
later she'll go 
back and redefine the line 
it's getting longer all the time 
oh yeah 
drinking sunshine
she likes the taste of it 
she had a goldmine
but then she wasted it away
you should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah

Sent along the way 
nothing stops the 

Sugar daddy 
loves her madly 
cosmo sheeva 
God oh made you a believer 
I don't need to 
tend her
why do I believe you 
Annie wants a baby now 
Annie wants a baby
any way she can

Missing pieces 
she's got a lot of em 
time decreases 
I wish I thought of em before 
before it's time to close the store 
Oh yeah 

Installation 
a lonely sink of fame 
some liberation
the only seed we ever plant 
I wanna help you but I can't
no no

Sent along the way
nothing stops the

Sugar daddy 
loves her madly 
lover keeva 
God oh made you a believer 
be our soldier
let her 
now you've gotten older 
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can

It's getting longer all the time
it's time to redesign the sign
oh yeah
sent along the way---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
