Im an ocean in your bedroom 
Make you feel warm
Make you want to re-absume
Now we know it all for sure

Im a dance hall dirty breakbeat 
Make the snow fall
Up from underneath your feet
Not alone, ill be there
Tell me when you want to go

Im a meth lab first rehab 
Take it all off
And step inside the running  cab
Theres a love that knows the way

Im the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of
Everything youve ever smelled
Not alone, ill be there
Tell me when you want to go 

Sideways falling 
More will be revealed my fiend
Dont forget me i cant hide it 
Come again get reignited

Im a inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread 
Inside the tool shed 
Now we know it all for sure

I could show you
To the free field
Overcome and more
Will always be revealed 
Not alone ill be there
Tell me when you want to go

Chorus

Im the bloodstain
On your shirt sleeve 
Coming dowm and more are coming  to beliede 
Now me know it all for sure 

Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance
Inside the funny farm
Not alone ill be there
Tell me when you want to go---Lyrics submitted by paolo.
