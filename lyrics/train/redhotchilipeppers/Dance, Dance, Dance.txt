You got yours and I got mine 
she got his and she got shine 
under moon and overseas 
she got those and we got these 

Dance, dance, dance, dance, 
all night long, yes all night long 
dance, dance, dance, dance, 
we got strong, as we got strong 
we say hello
it's safe to go 

Dance, dance, dance, dance, 
all night long, yes all night long 
dance, dance, dance, dance, 
we got strong, as we got strong 
the light is right 
let's play tonight 
let's play

Give yourself a chance
to find a way 
The holiness appeared
is here to stay 

They got this and we got there 
he got his and she got bad 
you got mine and I got yours 
I got love but you got more 

Dance, dance, dance, dance, 
All night long, it's all night long 
Dance, dance, dance, dance, 
We got strong, as we got strong 
We say hello
it's safe to go 
Let's play

Give yourself a chance
to find a way 
the holiness appeared
is here to stay 
tell your mom and dad
it's all okay 
the holiness appears
it's here to stay 

I got another one
I got another one
I got another one
I got another one 
Whoa
I got another one 

You got yours and I got mine 
he got his and she got shine 
we got all but she got high 
some got hot and then gone by 

Dance, dance, dance, dance, 
all night long, yes all night long 
dance, dance, dance, dance, 
we got strong, as we got strong 
we say hello
it's safe to go 

Dance, dance, dance, dance, 
all night long, yes all night long 
dance, dance, dance, dance, 
we got strong, as we got strong
the light is right 
let's play tonight 
let's make the ride 
the summer thrives 
let's play
let's play---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
