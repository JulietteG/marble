(C'mon c'mon)

[Verse 1:]
I'm coming for you cause cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has has got me cringing well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go
Unwrap the package with a much persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go
I wanna dance to every day's occasion

[Chorus:]
This I know, yeah this I know! (Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we not alone! (Take me home, take me home)

[Verse 2:]
When we invision, lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on ya you said I grew on ya
Turns out that we are all the one solution
GO!

[Trumpet Solo]

I'm coming at you well, you are the cap too and
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and maybe espouse her well
She showed me love with out the stipulations

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3:]
I wanna lean on you, get jan and dean on ya
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like your cheeky well, so mose and peaky and
I think the world could use a clear connection

[Chorus x2]

Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?---Lyrics submitted by Tom Godlewski.
