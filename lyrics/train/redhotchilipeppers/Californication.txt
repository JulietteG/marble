Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your minds elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
Its Californication
Its the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
Its understood that Hollywood
sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war your waging

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
Its Californication


Space may be the final frontier
But its made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderons not far away
Its Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
everybodys been there and
I dont mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girls guitar
Theyre just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldnt save the world
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest
There is no test
But this is what you've craving
First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication---Lyrics submitted by bryan.
