Keep on turnin'
Cause it won't be too long.
Powers
Keep on lyin',
While your people
Keep on dyin'

Keep on turnin',
Cause it won't be too long.

Chorus:

I'm so darn glad He let me try it again,
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin.
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then.
Gonna keep on tryin' till I reach the highest ground.

Teachers,
Keep on teachin'
Preachers,
Keep on preachin',
World, keep on turnin',
'Cause it won't be too long.
Oh, no
Lovers,
Keep on lovin'
While believers
Keep on believin'.
Sleepers,
Just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long.
Oh, no!

Chorus

(Spoken) An' Stevie knows that, uh, no-body's gonna bring me down.
Till I reach the highest ground.
(Spoken) 'cause me 'n' Stevie, see, we're gonna be a sailin' on the funky sound
Till I reach the highest ground.
(Spoken) Bustin' out, an I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailin' on.
Till I reach the highest ground
(Spoken)Just, uh, sailin' on sailin' on the higher ground
Till I reach the highest ground---Lyrics submitted by Adrienne.
