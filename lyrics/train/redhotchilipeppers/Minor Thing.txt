[verse 1]
I change the key from C to D
you see to me it's just a minor thing, yo
he knows everything

To readjust you've gotta trust
that all the fuss is just a minor thing, yo
he knows everything

It's just a minor thing
and I'm a minor king
he knows everything

[bridge/chorus]
you've got your bit part, Mozart
hot dart acceleration
pop art, pistol chasin'
cat fight intimidation

[verse 2]
To read a mind you've gotta 
redefine the line and make your circle sing, yo
he knows everything

You make a sound the
spell is bound to come around 
it's just a minor thing, yo
he knows everything

It's just a minor thing
and I'm a minor king
he knows everything

[bridge/chorus]
You've got your bit part, Mozart
hot dart acceleration
pop art, pistol chasin'
cat fight intimidation

Art house, interfacing
black, stop, motivation
bam, pop, sugar junkie
data facing infiltration

[guitar solo]

[verse 3]
I change the key from C to D
you see to me it's just a minor thing, yo
he knows everything

To readjust you've gotta trust
that all the fuss is just a minor thing, yo
he knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king---Lyrics submitted by Aled.
