Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

I've gotta cousin making beats
Deep down in Arizona
We're gonna rocket to Ramone's
In the city of Pomona, go

Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I break in two I'll stay the night
Come get it

Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

I've got a sister making babies
With a black and decker blow torch
We're gonna fop it all night
In the middle of the back torch, yeah

Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I break in two I'll stay the night
Come get it

Clean it up, Johnny!

Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

I've gotta brother making trouble
In the state of California
I wish I knew another way
But I'm gonna have to clone you, hey

Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I break in two I'll stay the night
Come get it---Lyrics submitted by Jayme Weston.
