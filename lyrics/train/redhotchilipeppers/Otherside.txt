How long how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat 
It's all I ever...

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never changed my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad 
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtrays full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat 
It's all I ever

Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that It's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide
Seperate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat
It's all I ever had (how long) 
I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit'in my throat 
It's all I ever---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
