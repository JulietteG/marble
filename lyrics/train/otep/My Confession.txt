... my confession

Because i'm diluted
&
Perfectly flawed

I shall
Live by passion
&
Not by law

And i'm
Insecure ...
I need aggression

To
Feed the spiders
Of perception

And i'm
Supposed to be strong
& have
All the answers

A
Cannibal
In the
New church of cancer

But i'm
Nothing special
I'm not unique

I have
Many secrets
& i
Eat the weak

And i'm
At an end

I'm at an end .....

And there's ...
NO WAY OUT!!

[chorus]

I need to find my sanctuary
..... someplace safe
Gotta get this outta me
..... this is my escape

II.
And i
Think about it
All the time

I'm
Volatile
&
Afraid to cry

But i'm
Still not comfortable
In my skin

And the
Anesthetics slowly
Wearing thin

& i
Need to talk to
Someone new

I need a different
Latitude

& i'm
In this void

All alone!
Feeling needy

... hungry to grow

But i'm
Suffocating
-- can't come down

And .... no ....
THERE'S NO WAY OUT!!!

[chorus]

I need to find my sanctuary
.... someplace safe
Gotta get this outta me!
.... THIS IS MY ESCAPE!!!

--- all i see is sadness
All i see is sadness ....
What's left?

-- this will teach them.
This will teach them,

......you've got to......
Push.
Push.
PUSH....
YOUR WAY OUT!!!

FOLLOW ME!
FOLLOW ME!
THIS IS YOUR WAY OUT!!

........you are not alone

- this is where i hide my power
- this is where i become free
- this is where i take control
- and slowly choke your fantasies

- i want to know my day is coming
- see my enemies be punished
- she'd my skin again
- this will be my best revenge!!

SHED MY SKIN AGAIN
THIS WILL BE MY BEST REVENGE!---Lyrics submitted by Irasema.
