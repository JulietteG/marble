And she's a killer
And she's a keeper ...

[verse 1]
Am i blurry
In your vision

Was i just
A poor decision

Cut me open
With precision

& we'll finger
The incision

Tell me what have i done
(quid pro quo)

To watch you lose
Control

[tunnel]

I will give you sanctuary
In these hymns of Thanatos ...

I will give you sanctuary!

[verse 2]
You want to
See me burn
I am living fire!

You want to
See me burn
I am LIVING FIRE!

You will know me
By the scars i bare

You will know me
By the hate i swear

You will know me
By the scars i bare

Shapeless vengeance!

[tunnel]

We are the 1000 children of death.

We're in-between, on the fence
Non-descript antagonists

I'm in-between, on the fence
Non-descript antagonist!

I'll split you open
& climb inside
Lose myself
Eaten alive

We are the 1000 children of death!

From seraphim!
To nephilim!
To exodus!

[v3]
She's picking ghostflowers
From her soul

She's clipping the wings
Of fallen angels!

She's picking ghostflowers
From her soul

She's tonguing splinters
Of broken halos!

You will know me
By the scars i bare.

You will know me
By the hate i swear.

You will know me
By the scars i bare.

YOU WILL KNOW ME!

[bridge]

From gelatin
To specimen
To emptiness

I WILL BE AVENGED.
I WILL BE AVENGED.

These are the secrets
That kill. that kill.
That kill. that kill.
That kill. that kill.
That kill. that kill.

We are the 1000 children of death---Lyrics submitted by Nichole.
