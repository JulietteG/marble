He hurts me 'cause he cares

He hurts me and it's all my fault!

Roaches and cigarettes,
A sink of hungry dishes.
Flies in the afterbirth,
I miss you when you're timid.

Loving you is nothing new,
It's self mutilation.
I crave the pain, I'm so ashamed
But I love the stimulation.

The last time I died
The last time I died, wasn't nearly this much fun.
Welcome...
Welcome...

Welcome to the family
This drug addict,
Sex fanatic,
Alcoholic tragedy.

Welcome to the family
This drug addict,
Sex fanatic,
Alcoholic fantasy.

I fell down some stairs...
I ran into a wall...
He hurts me 'cause he cares..
It's all my fault!

He likes to kill small animals
And blame it on the weather.
Father was Andronicus
My secret name was terror.

Loving you is nothing new,
It's self mutilation.
I crave the pain, I'm so ashamed
But I love the stimulation.

The last time I died
The last time I died, wasn't nearly this much fun.
Welcome...
Welcome...

Welcome to the family
This drug addict,
Sex fanatic,
Alcoholic tragedy.

Welcome to the family
This drug addict,
Sex fanatic,
Alcoholic fantasy.

He hurts me 'cause he cares
He hurts me and it's all my fault.

It's all my fault.
It's all your fault.
It's all your fault!!!!!!

Fuck you,
You insecure piece of shit.
Fuck you,
Now look what you made me do. [2x]

FUCK YOU!!!

If you
TOUCH US AGAIN
I will
FUCKING KILL YOU!

I will make you pay.
I WILL MAKE YOU PAY!

Now you know how it feels.
