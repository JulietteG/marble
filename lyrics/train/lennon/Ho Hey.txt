I've been trying to do it right
I've been living a lonely life
I've been sleeping here instead
I've been sleeping in my bed,
Sleeping in my bed

(Ho!) So show me family
(Hey!) All the blood that I would bleed
(Ho!) I don't know where I belong
(Hey!) I don't know where I went wrong
(Ho!) But I can write a song (Hey!)

I belong with you, you belong with me you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me you're my sweetheart

(ho!) I don't think you're right for him
(hey!) Look at what it might have been if you
(ho!) Took a bus to Chinatown
(hey!) I've been standing on Canal
(ho!) And Bowery (hey!)
(ho!) And she'd be standing next to me (hey!)

I belong with you you belong with me you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me you're my sweetheart

And love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
so, we're bleeding out

I belong with you you belong with me you're my sweetheart
I belong with you you belong with me you're my sweetheart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
