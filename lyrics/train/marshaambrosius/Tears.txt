hey baby
i thought id never see you again
i cant believe youre here
please
please listen to what i have to say

first of all let me say that i missed you baby
for real
im worst off than ive been i feel so much pain
cried so many tears
leaving you was the biggest mistake i could have made
and i did oh yes i did
what i could without you baby
but it just aint the same without you here

oh oh the tears
falling all down right now
please could you hear me out
see im a grown women and i aint too proud


so im begging you stay with me
i want you back dont you leave me here

tears
all these tears
my dear
im begging you baby

begging you stay with me i want you back dont you leave me here here here here
im begging you stay with me i want you back dont you leave me here here here oh here
