Run
Runaway from all the pain I feel now
Now that you're gone
I been so alone
So I runaway and then you followed me out
Out of the dark
Try to catch my breath
If only for a second
Just a small confession
Straight from my heart
Break
I break

Couldn't talk
Couldn't sleep
Didn't know
What you need
Got me feeling so weak
Cause you came in too deep
Wanna stay
Wanna leave
I'm so caught in between
Now I finally see
That you just weren't the one for me

Run into the new and better you oh how
How did I let you go
So stubborn so cold
Wanna see the sun
Wake up early morning
You can keep me warm
I look at you and showed
The worse caught in my throat
I never even wrote'em
We came so close
So close to love
Tried to catch my breath
If only for a second
Just a small confession
Straight from my heart
Break
I break

Couldn't talk
Couldn't sleep
Didn't know
What you need
Got me feeling so weak
Cause you came in too deep
Wanna stay
Wanna leave
I'm so caught in between
Now I finally see
That you just weren't the one for me

Run through the storm
Sunrise too long
These tears will fall
My tears will run
Run

Couldn't talk
Couldn't sleep
Didn't know
What you need
Got me feeling so weak
Cause you came in too deep
Wanna stay
Wanna leave
I'm so caught in between
Now I finally see
That you just weren't the one for me ---
