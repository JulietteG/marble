Sitting here staring at the wall
Another lonely tear falls
I'm trying to write you this song
But I can hardly see the page at all
'Cause it's breaking my heart when I look in your eyes
And I don't see me anymore
When you're all I'm living for

Baby tell me that you still believe
That you still love me
The way I love you
If you take your love away from me
You know I would die 
'Cause I'm not ready for goodbye

Baby please pick up the phone
Tell me I'm crazy I got it all wrong
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know how to live without you
You are the first song my heart ever heard
Baby I believed every word
You are my heart, my soul,my world

Baby tell me you still believe...

Every breath that I take
Every beat in my heart
You know it's all for you
I wanna hold you
I wanna love you
Forever and always

Baby tell me that you still believe...---Lyrics submitted by Rana.
