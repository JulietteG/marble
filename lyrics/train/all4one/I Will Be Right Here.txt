Wherever you go, whatever you do,
Whenever you need me
How can I say how much you've done for me
How much I have just knowing I had you
You touched my world
And I'll never be the same
You touched my heart
And know everything has changed
You are the one in this life I'll remember
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Wherever you are
My heart is with you
No matter how far I'll always be near
Whenever you need me
I will be right here

There'll always be a part of you with me
I hope there'll be a part of me with you
Oh baby just call my name
And I'll here you on the wind
Just close your eyes
And I'll find you once again
Just know I'm on your side and remember

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Wherever you are
My heart is with you
No matter how far I'll always be near
Whenever you need me
I will be right here

And when the wind touches you
It will touch me too
And the same star you see
Will be the one that shines on me
I'll be here when you need me
I'll be here any time
Baby I'm on your side so remember

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Wherever you are

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Wherever you are
My heart is with you
No matter how far I'll always be near
Whenever you need me
I will be right here
I will be right here
I will be right here---Lyrics submitted by Cecily.
