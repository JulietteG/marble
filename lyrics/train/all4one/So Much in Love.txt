As we stroll along together.
Holding hands, walking all alone.
So in love are we two,
that we dont know what to do.

So in love, in a world of our own.
As we walk by the sea together.
Under stars twinkling high above.
So in love are we two.
No one else but me and you.

So in love, so much in love.
So in love, so much in love

We stroll along together. 
I tell you I need you oh, so much.
I love, I love you., my darling.
can you tell it in my touch?

As we walk down the aisle, together.
We will vow to be together till we die.
So in love are we two.
Just cant wait to say I do.

So in love, in a world of our own.
So in love, are you and I.

(Baby, I hope you realize. 
That you mean so much to me.
Youre everything I ever wanted in a woman.
To touch you, to feel your body close to me.
I just want to hold you in my arms forever.)

As we walk down the aisle, together.
We will vow to be together till we die.
So in love are we two.
Just cant wait to say I do.

So in love, are you and I.
So in love, are you and I.

So in love, So in love.
So in love.---Lyrics submitted by Ronald.
