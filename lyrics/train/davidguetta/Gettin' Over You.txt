[Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over
No gettin over'
There's just no getting over you.

[Chris Willis]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse, just to have you back again
There's no getting over
There's no gettin over
There's just no getting over you (you)!

[LMFAO]
We're back
Hey hey I cant forget you baby
I think about you everyday
I tried to mascarate the pain
Thats why im next on the booth
D-d-d dance to the groove
There is no there is no getting over you.
Baby it feels so right
To dance to the beat up night
The heat between you and I retreat to the morning light
We like to live like class
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no,there is no getting over you.
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...

[Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over
No gettin over'
There's just no getting over you.

Wish I could spin my world into reverse, just to have you back again
There's no getting over
There's no gettin over
There's just no getting over you (you)!

[LMFAO]
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...

[Fergie]
People in the place
If you ever felt love
Then you know what I'm talking about
There is no getting over
Aaaaaahhhhhh

[LMFAO]
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...---Lyrics submitted by camila.
