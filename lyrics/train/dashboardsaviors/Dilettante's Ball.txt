Got a guitar last Christmas and you learned to play
In between the classes for your MBA
Got you a band up on the stage
Can't wait to start playing so you can get laid
Rock n roll star, nine feet tall
Got a new hero for Dilettante's Ball

Well, she's never been shackled by society
Well, she's far too superior socially
She goes where she wants and does what she please
Her daddy owns the building, so the rent is free
She's a trust fund bomb hanging out at the mall
Always on the guest list at Dilettante's Ball

Well, he's a sensitive poet, now he's a renaissance man
He likes his clothes from India, gets his food from Japan
He's always talkin' 'bout his opinions and his novels he's planned
He's a goddamn genius, he's his number one fan
Back in the corner, face to the wall
Never missed a minute of Dilettante's Ball

Well I suppose you're all wondering what made me so wild
How did I get the scoop on all them other guys?
I must be quite honest, ain't gonna tell no lies
It's about now, I know you've surmised
Used to skip school, smoke dope in the hall
Long time dancing with Dilettante's Ball

A long time---Lyrics submitted by Tracy Carroll.
