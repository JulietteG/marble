Verse 1-
Take your baby by the hand,
And make her do a high hand stand,
And take your baby by the heel,
And do the next thing that you feel

Chorus-
We were so in phase,
In our dance hall days,
We were cool on craze,
When I you and everyone we knew,
Could believe do and share in what was true,
I said:Dance hall days love,

Verse 2-
Take your baby by the hair,
And pull her close and there there there,
Take your baby by the ears,
And play upon her darkest fears

Chorus-
We were so in phase,
In our dance hall days,
We were cool on craze,
When I you and everyone we knew,
Could believe do and share in what was true,
I said:Dance hall days love
Dance hall days
Dance hall days love!

Verse 3-
Take your baby by the wrist,
And in her mouth an amethyst,
And in her eyes two sapphires blue,
And you need her and she needs you,
And you need her and she needs you,
And you need her and she needs you,
And you need her and she needs you,
And you need her...and she needs you

Chorus-
We were so in phase,
In our dance hall days,
We were cool on craze,
When I you and everyone we knew,
Could believe do and share in what was true,
I said:Dance hall days love,
Dance hall days,
Dace hall days love!,
Dance hall days---Lyrics submitted by Shereese.
