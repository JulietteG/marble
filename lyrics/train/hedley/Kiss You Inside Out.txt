I dont know if youre ready to go
Where Im willing to take you girl
I will feel every inch of your skin
And you know I can rock your world
Imma be the calm in the storm youre looking for
Ill be the shipwreck that takes you down
I dont mind if you lie in my bed
We can stay here forever now.

Ouuu oohhhhh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo

Ouuu oohhhhh
Give up the fight
Im in control
Why dont you let it go.
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
Ill spend my life trying to figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
And let me kiss you inside out.

I dont care if you steal all my air
we can breath in together as one
its all right if youre here every night
waking up with you in the sun
we start with an hour and we find we waste the day
kicking back with the love we found.
I dont mind if you lie in my bed
we can stay here forever now

Ouuu oohhhhh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo

Ouuu oohhhhh
Give up the fight
Im in control
Why dont you let it go
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
Ill spend my life trying to figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
And let me kiss you inside out.

let me love you, let me love you
let me love you babe.
let me love you, let me love you
let me love you babe.
let me love you, let me love you
let me love you babe.
let me love you, let me love you
let me love you babe.

I dont mind if you lie in my bed
We can stay here forever now.

Ouuu oohhhhh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo

Ouuu oohhhhh
Give up the fight
Im in control
Why dont you let it go
Just let it go.
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
Ill spend my life trying to figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
And let me kiss you inside out.
I wanna know you inside out.
Ill spend my life trying to figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth
And let me kiss you inside out. ---
