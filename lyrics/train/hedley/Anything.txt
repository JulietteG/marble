Everbody said, you better be in school
Get a real job boy dont be a fool
Burn that guitar you can never be a star
I can, I can, I can so

A thousand disbelievers couldnt keep me on the ground
Ive invented a momentum that will never slow me down
I Believe it cause i feel it and i shout it out loud
I can, I can, I can so

Everybody said boy dont go any higher
Fuck that, I can do anything
Never push the limit and dont play with fire
Fuck that, I can do anything

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na x2

Wear my heart on my fist take you by surprise fighter
Fuck that, I can do anything

Be a movie star or rock the main stage
An Xbox tester or an astronaut in space
I f they tell you that you cant then you can shove it in thier face
I ca, I can, I can so

A thousand disbelievers couldnt keep me on the ground
Ive invented a momentum that will never slow me down
I Believe it cause i feel it and i shout it out loud
I can, I can, I can so

Everybody said boy dont go any higher
Fuck that, I can do anything
Never push the limit and dont play with fire
Fuck that, I can do anything

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na x2

Wear my heart on my fist take you by surprise fighter
Fuck that, I can do anything

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

Everybody said boy dont go any higher
Fuck that, I can do anything
Never push the limit and dont play with fire
Fuck that, I can do anything

Everybody said boy dont go any higher
Fuck that, I can do anything
Never push the limit and dont play with fire
Fuck that, I can do anything

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na x2

Wear my heart on my fist take you by surprise fighter
Fuck that, I can do anything

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na x2

Everybody said boy dont go any higher
Fuck that, I can do anything---Lyrics submitted by Sahanya Viswasm.
