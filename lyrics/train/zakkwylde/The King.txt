Although I may have faltered
I'm just a man
For I've been broken
Time and time again
But in your moments of doubt
When there's nowhere left to run
Within these tears of darkness
I would steal the light from the sun

I may not be a king
But I'll carry you through it all
Your shelter from the storm
To catch you when you fall
I may not be a king
But I'll give you my world
All and everything

Enslaved and condemned
By the fears that hold your hand
Abandoned and betrayed
Time and time again
But in your moments of doubt
So empty and afraid
When it all falls to pieces
I will not walk away

I may not be a king
But I'll carry you through it all
Your shelter from the storm
Catch you when you fall
I may not be a king
But I'll give you my world
All and everything

For I may not be a king
But I'll carry you through it all
Your shelter from the storm
Catch you when you fall
I may not be the king
But I'll give you my world
All and everything---
