Lord I question weather I've had my fill
Lord question weather I can take much more
You may laugh as I lay here bleeding baby
No more afters or befores

Someday you'll know just how it feels
As you left me there twice before
Someday you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, strip of your pride like you were never nothing special
Made to feel like another spoke in the wheel

So you say I'm just another dollar
So you say I'm just another day
Once my blood was strong and now dated and its thin
But unlike you, I can still tell right from wrong

Someday you'll know just how it feels
As you left me there twice before
Someday you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, strip of your pride like you were never nothing special
Made to feel like another spoke in the wheel---Lyrics submitted by Tucker.
