Your crossroads have come
And as they knock upon your door
Choices to be made
For this life in which you led
Will you leave or will you stay?

In your darkest hour
Tell me what's it gonna be?
In your darkest hour
Will you walk with me?

And what was certain becomes unclear
As the Doubts of Thomas whisper in your ear
And all that you knew
And all that you believe
Starts to fall away
Will you leave or will you stay?

In your darkest hour
Tell me what's it gonna be?
In your darkest hour
Will you walk with me?
In your darkest hour
Tell me what's it gonna be?

The crossroads have come
And as they knock upon your door...---
