Well, I woke up this morning; I best get rolling on.

Well, come here baby, sit down on daddy's knee.
Well, come here baby, sit down on daddy's knee.
I want to tell you about the way they treated me.

Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long.
Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long.
When I woke up this morning, all I had was gone.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
