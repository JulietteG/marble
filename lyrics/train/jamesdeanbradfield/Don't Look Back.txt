Sing another song
As long as the words dont break your heart
Have another drink 
As long as you dont fall down again

If you think you can hear that same old sound
Dont look round
Dont look now
If you think you can see a way back home
Dont look back
Dont look back

Take another train
As long as it doesnt take you home
Tell another joke
As long as it doesnt make you cry

If you think you can hear that same old sound
Dont look round
Dont look now
If you think you can see a way back home
Dont look back
Dont look back

If you think you can hear that same old sound
Dont look round
Dont look now
If you think you can see a way back home
Dont look back
Dont look back---Lyrics submitted by Tim Bustin.
