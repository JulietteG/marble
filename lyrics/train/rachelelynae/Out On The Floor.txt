Me and my girls now here we go
Another Friday night and we're in party mode
When the musics loud, we get our dance on
We work the line and we sing that song

We're gonna, we're gonna have fun
Gotta tear it up, we need everyone
Guys in the back with your two left feet
Don't ya worry bout that, get up off your seat

Come on, get out on the floor
And don't hold back anymore
Rock the beat til you're soaking wet
When the dj stops we'll say we ain't done yet
Tonight, we're gonna have the time of our lives
Baby you and me
Right now
Don't stand around
It's going down on the floor
What are you waiting for

Hey boy what ya looking at
I see you propping up the wall in your Titans cap
You seem real cool, and you're lookin fine
But can you feel the groove can you move in time

Don't ya wanna, don't you wanna have fun
Be a good time cowboy son of a gun
I see it in your eyes I know that you can do it
Baby don't be shy, hurry lets get to it

Come on, get out on the floor
And don't hold back anymore
Rock the beat til you're soaking wet
When the dj stops we'll say we ain't done yet
Tonight, you're gonna have the time of your life
Baby you and me
Boy right now
Don't stand around
It's going down on the floor
What are you waiting for

Ain't no sense in sitting alone
All my party people come on---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
