Round about dinner time
Every summer night
I'd wander out a little too far chasing one last firefly
Mama'd come calling from the porch swing
Child come on in and get clean

Summer left and sixteen came
Couldn't wait til that bell rang
I'd go running like my hairs on fire
To Tommy's 69 Mustang 
We'd lose ourselves for awhile til the phone rang
Child come on home and get clean

Just a little soap and water in the kitchen sink
Mama's arms when I scrape my knee
Dancing by the fire while daddy sings 
The first rain in the spring
Oh come on home and get clean

First time in that back pew
In at least a year or two
I'd wondered out a little too far to chase a man I thought I knew
Fallin to my knees, the preacher spoke to me
Child come on down and get clean

Just a little soap and water in the kitchen sink
Mama's arms when I scrape my knee
Dancing by the fire while daddy sings 
The first rain in the spring
Front porch light when the road's been long
A little bit of mercy when my grace is gone
First tear falling during alter call
Hear the choir sing
Oh, come on home and get clean

Years had flown since I'd been home 
Daddy's voice swung low 
Child you've been gone too long
Your mama's tired, time is come
Oh get back home

Just a little soap and water in the kitchen sink
Mama's arms are all I need
Dancing by the fire while daddy sings 
The first rain in the spring
Front porch light when the road's been long
A little bit of mercy when my grace is gone
First tear falling during alter call
Hear the choir sing
Oh, come on home and get clean---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
