[chorus]

Go hard, today
(Fabolous) They past is the past you know
Can't worry 'bout the past cause that was ye-sterday
(Fabolous) It's a new day bro 
Ima put it on the line cause it's my time
(Fabolous) My day, gotta do it now
Hey hey hey hey 
I gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time (hey)
My time (hey) my time (hey) 
If you're with me let me hear you say, common 
Ma ma, ma ma 
If you're with me let me hear you say, 
Ma ma, ma ma
It's my time 

(Fabolous) 
Guess what time it is, my my my time
You can check your i-phone, better say it's i-time
I don't even need a watch
I don't even see a clock
As soon as i walk in it feel like me o'clock
Give me a clock
Every time I check
Singers don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex
Damn, ima do it bigger than a 5-ex
Can't ride with an L so i don't drive lex
Games so bickery, so full of trickery 
Nursery, rhyming, hickory, dickory
Blowing that side, the hood call it pickory
Biggie, puffy, busta victory

[chorus]

Go hard, today
Can't worry 'bout the past cause that was ye-sterday
Ima put it on tonight cause it's my time
Hey hey hey hey
I gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time (hey)
My time (hey) my time (hey)
If you're with me let me hear you say, common
Ma ma, ma ma
If you're with me let me hear you say
Ma ma, ma ma
It's my time

(Fabolous)
My time is more like fly time
Don't call to get dressed, call it in a sky time
If you ain't a pilot, you probly couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you wonder what to do with this
First i take the time out, then i put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the water mark, Flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like a favor, i feel like a savior
They clock in my neck, i feel like i'm flavor
I go so hard, glow so god
Dance, scream

[chorus]

Oh now i know mine, it's been a few years
Now i've seen 'bout time
You know i've got committed with the system up in the zone 
Sign the dotted li-i-i-i-i-ine
Now is on, so ya'll better check your wrist piece
Why? Cause it's time to make history
Just hop in here, bullets history
Howda, howda, howda hell you gonna evict me?
You know i'm here to stay, never cocky now
With bottles we poppin now, no tellin where we stopping now
And i represent the chick a g o
On the track with f a b o
You know we
