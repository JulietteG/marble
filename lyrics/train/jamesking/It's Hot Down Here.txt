All of my life  (all of my life)  lived a life of sin (lived a life of sin)
I wouldnt let (i wouldnt  let ) my dear savior come in (dear savior come in)
But i thought that i would go (but i thought that i would go)
Up to heaven anyway (up to heaven anyway)
But i found that i was wrong when i faced the lord on judgement day

Oh its hot down here   (need a cool drink of water)
Has anybody seen    (my wife and little daughter)
Well theyve all gone    (up to heaven no doubt)
Up to heaven no doubt   (gonna sing and shout)
Lord its hot down here 
Lord send me some rain and get this fire put out

Well listen to me sinner   (listen to me sinner)
Dont you want to go  (dont you want to go)
Up to heaven some day  (up to heaven some day)
Just to see your dear lord  (just to see your dear lord)

Dont you be like me  (dont you be like me)
Lived a life of sin  ( lived a life of sin)
Fall down on your knees and open up your heart
And let the lord come in..   Chorus-break-chorus---Lyrics submitted by Andre.
