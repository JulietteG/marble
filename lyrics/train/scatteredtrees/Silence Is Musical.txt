Honestly baby, let me tell you truth
Here we are lately, wondering what we should do
I won't hold back the words that i have for you

i tell you that, you're my favorite
you're the closest of friends
so much closer than others have been
if you've been knockin, girl, you know i'd be letting you in

more than just beautiful, oh i wish i could say it with words,
you're more than just beautiful,

honestly baby, let me tell you the truth
here we are lately wondering what we should do
i won't hold back, that i had before

i tell you that you're my favorite
you're the closest of friends
so much closer than others have been
you know i've been playin, boy you i've been lettin you in

more than just beautiful, oh i wish i could say it with words
more than just beautiful, when i whispered i knew that you heard
more than just beautiful, i'd explain it to you if i could

silence is musical---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
