It's time to strap our boots on,
This is the perfect day to die,
Wipe the blood out of our eyes.
In this life there's no surrender,
There's nothing left for us to do,
Find the strength to see this through.

We are the ones who will never be broken,
With our final breath,
We'll fight to the death,
We are soldiers! We are soldiers!

Woah!
We are soldiers!

I stand here right beside you,
Tonight we're fighting for our lives,
Let me hear your battle cry.
Your battle cry!

We are the ones who will never be broken,
With our final breath,
We'll fight to the death,
We are soldiers! We are soldiers!

We are the ones who will not go unspoken, (Not go unspoken)
No, we will not sleep,
We are not sheep,
We are soldiers! We are soldiers!
Yeah!

We stand shoulder to shoulder,
We stand shoulder to shoulder,
We stand shoulder to shoulder,
You can't erase us,
You'll just have to face us.

We stand shoulder to shoulder!
We stand shoulder to shoulder!
We stand shoulder to shoulder!
You can't erase us,
You'll just have to face us!

We are the ones who will never be broken, (Never be broken)
With our final breath,
We'll fight to the death,
We are soldiers! We are soldiers!

We are the ones who will not go unspoken, (Not go unspoken)
No, we will not sleep,
We are not sheep,
We are soldiers! We are soldiers!
Yeah!

We are soldiers!---Lyrics submitted by Courtney C.
