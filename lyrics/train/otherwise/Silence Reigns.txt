I saved a piece of myself, 
From the ashes of a burning misery.
You tried deceiving yourself, 
But what you get from me is what you see.
It breaks me down, what's left of me, 
And all your pain is fading away from me.

I'm over you, I've realized, 
You're not the only one.
I'm free of you, I've opened my eyes, 
You're not the only one.

Imprisoned under your skin, 
Is an angel bound by calloused apathy?
I feel it growing within, 
A better life for me now that I'm finally free.
It broke me down, what's left of me, 
And all your pain has faded away from me.

I'm over you, I've realized, 
You're not the only one.
I'm free of you, I've opened my eyes, 
You're not the only one.

I see your face in my dreams, 
The way you taste is haunting me.
Do you see reflections of my sorrow?
Or hear my voice where silence reigns?

I'm over you, I've realized, 
You're not the only one.
I'm free of you, I've opened my eyes, 
You're not the only one---Lyrics submitted by Alison Maldaner.
