Oh uh, oh uh ..

I could do anything
I did say anything
I would try anything
For your love
I will run anywhere
I would go anywhere
I will walk anywhere
For your love

Girl I probably said some corny lines
That I know you've heard a thousand times
I would do anything and everything to express my love with you
I don't care what I gotta do

A thousand armies couldn't stop me no
Cause there ain't nothing impossible
There ain't nothing nothing
Nothing impossible for your love, your love

No matter what people say
No matter how far you stray
I would go all the way
For your love, your love
No matter how great or small
No matter how tall the wall
Winter spring summer fall, yeah
I'll do it all for your love
Your love

And I know I said some corny lines
That you probably heard a thousand times
I would do anything & everything to express my love with you
I don't care what I gotta do

A thousand armies couldn't stop me no
Cause there ain't nothing impossible
There ain't nothing nothing
Nothing impossible for your love your love, no no
Stormy weather couldn't stop me no
Cause there ain't nothing impossible
There ain't nothing nothing
Nothing impossible for your love, your love, your love

There is nothing nothing, nothing, nothing nothing nothing impossible
Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing impossible
Oh no, nothing, nothing for your love, your love

There ain't nothing nothing, nothing, nothing nothing nothing impossible
Nothing nothing nothing, nothing impossible
Oh no, nothing, nothing for your love, your love, your love, your looove

A thousand armies couldn't stop me no
Cause there ain't nothing impossible
There ain't nothing nothing
Nothing impossible for your love, your love
Stormy weather can't stop me no
Cause there ain't nothing impossible
There ain't nothing nothing
Nothing impossible for your love, your love, your love---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
