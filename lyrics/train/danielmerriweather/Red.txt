And I'm alright
Standing in the streetlights here
Is this meant for me
My time on the outside is over
We don't know how you're spending
all of your days
Knowing that love isn't here
You see the pictures
But you don't know their names
Cause love isn't here

Chorus
And I can't do this by myself
All of these problems, they're all in your head
And I can't be somebody else
You took something perfect
And painted it red

No sympathy
When shouting out is all you know
Behind your lies
I can see the secrets you don't show
We don't know how you're spending
All of your days
Knowing that love isn't here
You see the pictures
But you don't know their names
Cause love isn't here

Chorus
And I can't do this by myself
All of these problems, they're all in your head
And I can't be somebody else
You took something perfect
And painted it red
When - you took something perfect
And painted it red

You take the best things from
Then everything gets empty
That's not a world that I need
Oooh, you take the best things from me
Then everything gets empty
That's not a world that I need
Oohhhh

Chorus
And I can't do this by myself
All of these problems, they're all in your head
And I can't be somebody else
You took something perfect
And painted it "red"

When - you took something perfect
And painted it red
(repeat)
You took something perfect
And painted it red---Lyrics submitted by Eesha.
