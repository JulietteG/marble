To settle our thoughts
Never minding what for
nothing of a harm to dread
On my mind
So tell me what belies
oh tell me what I could have
Oh
well tell me what for

No more of this living dying
Just scientific analyzing
Forgive us oh life
The sin of

Death oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good

Is this it
Maundering about and
All I have is too much time
To understand
now one can only love
Life until its ending
Oh
And I can't forget

No more of this living dying
Just scientific analyzing
Forgive us oh life
The sin of

Death oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good

Death oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good

(instrumental break)

Death oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good

Death oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good---Lyrics submitted by Lex.
