Oh I most
I mostly feel I had a good day
Oh I most
I mostly feel I had a good day
It wasn't that great

But if I start to move
Because I'd rather be
Given to wonder
Why don't you stay here
But on the contrary
I live a lonely place
So lonely
So lonely

Come on and dance with me
Pretty sweet fool
(Oh to be your toy)
(Oh to be your toy)
Come on and dance with me
Pretty sweet fool
(Oh to be your toy)
(Oh to be your toy)

Oh I most
I mostly wish I had it that way
Oh I most
I mostly wish I had it that way
That would be great

I'd be so up for it
You wouldn't slow me down
I'd always want to
But in another minute
I could run far
Oh it's all the same
If you
Want we can try today

Come on and dance with me
Pretty sweet fool
(Oh to be your toy)
(Oh to be your toy)
Come on and dance with me
Pretty sweet fool
(Oh to be your toy x10)
I wasn't bad
I never thought of myself

Come on and dance with me
Pretty sweet fool
(Oh to be your toy)
(Oh to be your toy)
Come on and dance with me
Pretty sweet fool
(Oh to be your toy)
