You may ask me why I serve the Lord.
Is it just for heaven's gain?
Or to walk the mighty streets of gold,
And to hear the angels sing?

Is it just to drink from the fountain
That never will run dry.
Or just to live forever, ever and ever
In the sweet ol' by and by.

But if heaven never was promised to me
Neither God's promise to live eterally
It's been worth just having the Lord in my life.
Living in a world of darkness, 
He came along and brought me the light.

If there were never any streets of gold,
Neither a land where we'll never grow old,
It's been worth just having the Lord in my live
Living in a world of darkness
He came along and brought me the light.

He's been my closest friend all through the years.
And every time I cry, He dries my tears.
It's been worth just having the Lord in my life.
Living in a world of darkness,
He came along and brought me the light.
