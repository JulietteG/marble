Hey, let's kick it
Stop, just lick it
let you start it
'cause 'cause it's so easy
you like it my way
and I know it
so let's do it
do it do it real good
ha, it's sweaty
now, I'm ready
just take it off
cause cause you tease me
I like it that way
and I know it
do it do it real good

OOOO
This song is not for you lovers
Woo-oo-oo
don't stop push it now
and I will give it all to you
don't just stop now
and try to give it all up
