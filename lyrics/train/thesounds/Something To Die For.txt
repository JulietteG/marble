Working for another hour tonight,
Staring at the wall and let the time just pass me by,
You might think you know me, but it's all just a face,
Trying to ignore when people screaming my name,
Screaming my name!

Walking by a house with colorful light,
There's a sign, an invitation from the woman inside,
Talk about your boyfriend, talk about your wife,
It's just a different way of living your life.

When something's right,
Then something is worth to die for.
When I feel that something is wrong,
Then something is worth to fight for.

Don't say goodbye, just leave an open door.
I wanna hear you say,
You give me something to die for.

Searching for another reason to stay,
Slowly my regrets are fading away.
You leave me on my own to find out what's real
You say you want your freedom, but it's not how I feel.

When something's right,
Then something is worth to die for.
When I feel that something is wrong,
Then something is worth to fight for.

Don't say goodbye, just leave an open door.
I wanna hear you say,
You give me something to die for.

When I feel that something is right,
You give me something to die for.

When something's right,
Then something is worth to die for.
When I feel that something is wrong,
Then something is worth to fight for.

When something's right,
(Something to give, something to die for)
Then something is worth to die for.
When I feel that something is wrong,
Then something is worth to fight for.

Don't say goodbye just leave an open door.
I wanna hear you say,
You give me something to die for.
I wanna hear you say,
You give me something to die for.
I wanna hear you say,
You give me something to die for.---Lyrics submitted by Jacob Melchor.
