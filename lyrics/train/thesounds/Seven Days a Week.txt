We've been talking on the phone for hours and hours.
You can give me a call whenever you like to.
And if you would fall you know I will catch you.
Yeah I'll stick around, I'll be right beside you.
Whooo ohh ohh..
I'm sure you always knew what you had to do.
And I'm sure you had your reasons you change 'em every season.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm taking a vacation, I'll se you at the station.
Hey, Hey, Hey.

Seven days a week, every minute of the day.
Oh Whooo oh oh, Whooo oh oh.
I've been thinking about you and what you've been up to.
Seven days a week, every minute of the day.
Oh Whooo oh oh, Whooo oh oh.
Girl you're living in danger you're sleeping with strangers.
No nothing can change us, no nothing can keep us from falling, from falling.
