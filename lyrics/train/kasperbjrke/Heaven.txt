Smell of you baby, my senses,
My senses be praised
Smell of you baby, my senses,
My senses be praised
Kissing and running,
Kissing and running away
Kissing and running,
Kissing and running away
Senses be praised
Senses be praised
Nothing will harm you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing will stand in your way
Senses be praised
Senses be praised
Kissing and running,
Kissing and running away
Kissing and running,
Kissing and running away
Senses be praised
Senses be praised
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Nothing will stop you
Nothing will stand in your way ---Lyrics submitted by choden wangmo.
