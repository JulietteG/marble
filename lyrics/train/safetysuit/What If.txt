What if it makes you sad at me 
And what if it makes you laugh now but you cry as you fall asleep 
And what if it takes your breath and you can't hardly breathe 
And what if it makes the last sound be the very best sound 

What if what I want makes you sad at me 
And is it all my fault or can I fix it please 
ohh
Cause you know that I'm always all for you 
Cause you know that I'm always all for you 

What if it makes you lose faith in me,
 what if it makes you question every moment you cannot see 
And what if it makes you crash and you can't find the key 
What if it makes you ask how you could let it all go 

What if what I want makes you sad at me 
And is it all my fault or can I fix it please 
Cause you know that I'm always all for you 
Cause you know that I'm always all for 
I'm always all for you

And if this be our last conversation 
and If this be the last time that we speak for a while 
Don't lose hope and don't let go 
Cause you should know 

If it makes you sad 
If it makes you sad at me 
Then it's all my fault and let me fix it please 
ohh
Cause you know that I'm always all for you 
Cause you know that I'm always all for you 

What if what I want makes you sad at me 
And if it's all my fault then let me fix it please 
ohh
Cause you know that I'm always all for you 
Cause you know that I'm always all for 
I'm always 
I am all for you---Lyrics submitted by desiree.
