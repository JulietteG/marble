Hold on. What's the rush, what's the rush. We're
Not done, are we
Cuz I don't need to change this
Atmosphere we made if 
you can stay one more, can you stay on more hour

You know I'm gonna find a way 
To let you have your way with me.
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch your  hand,
And make you stay...

Hold on. I'll be here when it's 
All done, you know...
Cuz what's the point in chasn'
If I can enjoy your face and
We can be wrong tonight. 
Can we be wrong tonight

You know I'm gonna find a way 
To let you have your way with me.
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch your  hand,
And make you stay.
I don't care what clothes you wear,
It's time to love and I don't care.
You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me.

And if I was running, 
You'd be the one I was running to.
And if I was crying,
You would be lining the cloud that would pull me through.
And if I was scared,
Then I would be glad to tell you and walk away.
But I am not lying,
I am just trying to find my way to you...

You know I'm gonna find a way 
To let you have your way with me.
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch your  hand,
And make you stay.
I don't care what clothes you wear,
It's time to love and I don't care.
You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me.
(x2)

And if I was running... 

And if I was crying...

And if I was scared...

You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way 
With me...---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
