I'm so confuse I must be loosing it this cant be right
I never knew that you could choose to love someone then change your mind
So i just wonder why and was it something i said?

You tell me once, you tell me twice, you tell me three times more
Tell me everything i want to hear and nothing more, cause you
know i am on your side no matter what you do
With every consequence its your defense and why its mine
And i could take it if i knew just why i waste my time with you
So i just have to find out was it something i said?

To you, was it something we can work through
Or was it something i made u do, or was that something you?

So let me ask you i just have to know that you're not mine
Do you feel free how you needed. Do you still feel scared inside?
Cause i am on the line and don't know what to do
No you know I'm on the line. So was it something i said?

To you, was it something we can work through
Or was it something i made u do, or was that something you?

Sometimes i'm bold and brash and sometimes i prone to crash,
Sometimes i say too much, sometimes it not enough
But I'll never hold you back from something you want so bad 
Just tell me so i'm not sad, was it something i said?
...... SOMETHING I SAID !!

To you, was it something we can work through
& was it something i made you do, 
Or was it something i said to you, to you.
Was it something i just cant work through? Something..something. 
Something you.---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
