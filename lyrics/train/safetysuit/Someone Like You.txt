if i was strong enough,
if i were wrong enough to be someone like you
would you have let me come to be with you
if i had made my own
and i had overcome to be someone like you
would you have come to be with you

and if i could be with someone like you
would you, would you be strong enough for me
oh, and if i could stay with someone like you
would you, would you be strong enough for me

if i had made my way
if i had chose to stay oh, i would be someone like you
would you have come to be with you
if i had made myself become like someone else
to be someone like you
would you have let me come to be with you

and if i could be someone like you
would you, would you be strong enough for me
oh, and if i could stay with someone like you
would you,  would you be strong enough for me

can you see me
holding you right in my arms, right in my

and if i, i cold be, with someone just like you
would you, would you, would you be strong enough for me
and if i could be with someone like you
would you, wolud you be strong enough for me
and if i could stay with someone just like you
would you, would you, would you be strong enough for me
would you be strong, strong oh.
would you be strong, strong oh.---Lyrics submitted by vick.
