Packed my bags and kissed your cheek
turned around so I didn't see you cry (you cry)
Sometimes you just can't explain
The reasons why you have to say goodbye (goodbye)

(chorus)
It took stumbblin
It took fallin
It took distance
It took time
It took a lot of getting
lost to realize
I was already home
Right where I was supposed to be
You were right in front of me
I was not alone
I was already home
Sometimes you're to close to see
A one thing that you really need
It's been there all along
It took leaving you to know
I was already

It took a long long road to see
What matters most in life to me 
Was gone (was gone)
What I thought I was looking for
Was here waiting at your door
I was wrong so wrong

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by YALI.
