Listen to me (2x)
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Hey Rikki-Tikki, Rikki-Tikki, Rikki-Tikki Tavi 
I am not a machine so don't treat me like buttons
Rikki-Tikki, Rikki-Tikki, Rikki-Tikki Tavi 
We're not identical twins So don't finish my sentence
Tell me the truth, or don't tell me anything
I'd rather have heart than courage or a brain
Rikki-Tikki, Rikki-Tikki, Rikki-Tikki Tavi 
Don't pay any mind to a voice behind curtains

If you meet the Devil's wife
Make sure you wear a suit and tie
And leave him wear he stands
And if he tries to shake your hand
Just hit him with her frying pan
And leave him where he stands

AHHHHHHHHHHH (Run Tikki-tikki Run Tikki-tikki Ruuunnn
Run Tikki-tikki Run Tikki-tikki Ruuunnn)

Listen to me (7x)

Rikki-tikki, Rikki-tikki, Rikki-Tikki Tavi
If you want a Picasso you better start diggin'
Rikki-tikki, Rikki-tikki, Rikki-Tikki Tavi
If I build the ark will you wait for the water?
The only thing that ever turned him blue
Was thinking the sky is what he should be turning to
Rikki-tikki, Rikki-tikki, Rikki-Tikki Tavi 
There are snakes in the grass so we better go hunting

If you meet the Devil's wife 
Make sure you wear a suit and tie
And leave him where he stands
If he tries to shake your hand 
Just hit him with her frying pan
And leave him where he stands
Let her take the kitchen sink 
And cut her from her apron strings
Just leave him where he stands 
All you need is amnesty 
So grab my hand and come with me
Just leave him where he stands

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIKKI---Lyrics submitted by Lace Phantom.
