Oooooh-
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

Ridin high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

I need you, (yeeah) to understand
Tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin over me

A broken man
Without a none
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone

I'm holdin on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin ---
