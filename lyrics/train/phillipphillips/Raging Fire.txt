We are dead to right, morning rays
We are thicking thin to our last days
So hold me close and I'll surrender to your heart
You know how to give and how to take
You see every hope I locked away
So pull me close and surrender to my heart
Before the flame goes out tonight
Yeah we live until we die

So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Till we lose control
Into a raging fire, Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire

You know time will give and time will take
All the memories made will wash away
Even though we changed I'm still here with you
If you listen close you'll hear the sound of all the ghosts that bring us down
Hold on to what makes you fear
Don't let go, this one will make you win
If the flame goes out tonight
Yeah we live until we die
So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Till we lose control
Into a raging fire, Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire

Let the world leave lost behind
Let your heart be next to mine
'Fore the flame goes out tonight
We can live until we die

Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire

Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Till we lose control
Into a raging fire, Into a raging fire---
