Oh, it's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life
Alright

Oh, it's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine, hey
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine

Let's go
Sexy ladies going crazy, put your hands in the air
We can party, get retarded, acting like we don't care
All my fellas grab them bottles, put your drinks in the sky
Glasses high, feel the vibe, it's a beautiful life

Never stayin' lonely, it could be forever
Be yourself, oh live your life
Oh oh oh
Don't you feel lonely
We can stay together
We could spent a wonderful time

Oh, it's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine, hey
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine

Let's go

Hey yo Sasha, turn the music up
Let's get this club jumping
This the anthem (?)
Put your hands up and pump it
If you came to have a party
Get it started tonight
Feeling right, day and night
'Cause with Big Ali you live a beautiful life

Never stayin' lonely, it could be forever
Be yourself, oh live your life
Oh oh oh
Don't you feel lonely
We can stay together
We could spent a wonderful time

Oh, it's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine, hey
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine

You don't have to worry like you did before
I will tell you the truth
All you need is more love and more things to adore
'Til your eyes and spirit let's you to see
All the beautiful places and things that I made just for you and for me

Go, go, go...

Hands high, hands high, get 'em high, get 'em high...

Oh, it's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine, hey
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life,
Make ya move and make love 'til the sunshine

Oh, it's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life
Hey, oh yeah
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful life
Hey, oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
