In a perfect world
I could fall asleep
And the word I give
Would be the word I keep
In a perfect world
People smiling and wave
And the quiet life
Is the life you crave
In a perfect world

In a perfect world
Anyone can fly
On a moments whim
Just take it to the sky
In a perfect world
You can sing with me
And well harmonize
In a perfect key
In a perfect world

In a perfect world
Youll forget my past
And youll take my hand
I wont need to ask
In a perfect world
I dont need no help
Living day to day
Dont need no one else
Dont need no one else

In a perfect world
Aint no killing fields
Aint no shock and awe
Aint no wounds to heal
In a perfect world
Aint no left and right
Aint no second class
Aint no rebel fight

In a perfect world
I can fall asleep
In a perfect world
Help me fall asleep
Cause I cant fall asleep
I cant fall asleep (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Krystal.
