Ideology used as a weapon with lines that cut so deeply to the truth
Your head's on the clock and still you threaten
A wretched way of life for those that choose and abuse

Believe, nothing worth believing in
Believe, stand for nothing care for nothing
Believe, empty words a false doctrine
Blooded in your holy word's goal
Look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did
The evil twin of devotion then now you're dead

You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs,
(no martyrs)

Refuse and resist dictated terror
fighting a war with both feet in
Savage that our planet is the venue
for a festival of massacres

Believe, nothing worth believing in
Believe, stand for nothing care for nothing
Believe, empty words a false doctrine
Blooded in your holy word's goal
Look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did
The evil twin of devotion and now you're dead

You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs,
(no martyrs)

Broke and sickened by the senseless atrocity
and repulsion for this old world reality
Forcing fear to dominate
hate a loaded gun
When in doubt, have no doubt
death has just begun

You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs,
(no martyrs)---
