You can die screaming
Or you can give me what I want
I'm gonna get it, get it either way
And I can't let it be
Viciously
Relentless pursuit of vengeance
And I won't let it be
Viciously

Impaled
You all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail

You gotta believe, you gotta believe

You're slowly dying
There's no more lying
I'm not your friend I never was I work alone
And I won't let it go cause you're so
Brutal i
In your refusal

I just won't let it be
Viciously

Impaled
You all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
The holy grail
Your goddamned soul is my white whale
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled

And you all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe in me

In the small numbers when order sleeps and the streets are mine
It's a time and a place where I can thrive
And burn you with my demon eye
In my life the things I've seen
Inhumanly brutal the worst extreme
I torture me because I can
Obscene the soul of every man
In my life the things I've seen

Inhumanly brutal the worst extreme
I torture you because I can
Ive seen the soul of every man is fucking damned to a fate,
and dead if you don't, and damned if you do, and dead if you won't
Impaled

Impaled
You all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
In me---
