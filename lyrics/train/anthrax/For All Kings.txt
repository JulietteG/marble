For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through

My insides pulled front to back
Nothing is solved in this act
Teaches you what humanity lacks
Compassion and empathy

Everything tears at, tears away at all else
And all the darkness, inside of my world breathes
And I can't leave

For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through

When the noise is gone you're there
Through the storm our souls laid bare
Given all beyond too much
The strongest love lifts me up

As my sky turns black, turns black as if asleep
The king is dead so
Long live the man in me, by divine right

For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through

I'd do anything, with all my power brings
I'd do anything
To save you
For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through

I'd do anything, with all my power brings
I'd do anything
To save you
I'd do anything---
