Can peace keep this from happening? 
Waging fear we can't forget 
A disease, his words are spreading it 
There is no need to argue 
Now just do what he says 

You must learn to trust no one 
Smile as we charge into the sun 
And when it's over we can say 
I saw it on TV 

The need, no there's no stopping it 
And you won't believe your eyes this time 
The last message we tried to send 
Fell into the wrong hands again 
Remember they can make up anything 

You must learn to trust no one 
Smile as we charge into the sun 
And when it's over we can say 
I saw it on TV 

Let the truth unfold 
We're waiting for an answer 
This silence is our hymn 
Our fists are raised and it's time 
To take back what is mine 

You must learn to trust no one 
Smile as we charge into the sun 
And when it's over we can say 
I saw it on TV, yeah 

You must learn to trust no one 
Smile as we charge into the sun 
And when it's over we can say 
I saw it on TV, yeah---Lyrics submitted by roxana.
