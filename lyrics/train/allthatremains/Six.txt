I wish I was free of this

I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasnt there
But she still haunts me and I
Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
But I know that would kill me

No damn her
Still I choke on her lies
Still reeling from her last caress her goodbye

Oh how this sickens me
This wretched fools affair
I cant erase this from me
And now it permeates
In every thought I feel
The anger burns in my soul

No damn her
Still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back hold my head high im strong

No damn her
Still I choke on her lies
Not reeling im strong

No damn her
Still I feel my stomach turn
choke back hold my head high im strong

No damn her
Still I choke on her lies
Not reeling im strong

I wish I was free of This---Lyrics submitted by peter.
