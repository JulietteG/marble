Never one to be held back or held down
Id write my name so the king he could see
I will follow the true declaration
And find some hope in what mankind could be

Ive worked so hard
Let my deeds be my witness
And let my words flow through everyone
When free men stand
Against what would bind them
No hope for tyrants
We will overcome

Do not do not do not obey
No masters now
Do not do not do not obey
Not subjects
We have held on for so long
Do not do not do not obey

Talking heads tell the masses the story
They shape the lie in the schools and tv
Our fathers work and intent is unwritten
By the lazy who dont know that theyre free

I hear the story and it makes me determined
To spread the word that we cant just lay down
What we read and we see drawn before us
Is a lie and we must hold our ground

Do not do not do not obey
No masters now
Do not do not do not obey
Not subjects
We have held on for so long
Do not do not do not obey

Not a subject

Do not don not do not obey
No masters now
Do not do not do not obey
Not subjects
We have held on for so long
Do not do not do not obey

Its found in you
Its found in me
From birth to stone
We remain free as always---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
