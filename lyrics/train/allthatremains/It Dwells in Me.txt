Now hold this tight 
Don't let go 
No burden 
I can't forget the past is real 
No longer fight this feeling 
No burden 
I can't erase what you've become this time 

And I cast doubt (no longer) 
And I am able, I am strong 
And now it dwells in me 

True to this cause I hunger 
I count the days that pass me by 
I'll do what I know is right 
No failure shall befall me this time 

And I cast doubt (no longer) 
And I am able, I am strong 
And now it dwells in me 

And I cast doubt (no longer) 
And I am able, I am strong 
And now it dwells in me 

I cast doubt aside 
I cast doubt aside 
I cast doubt aside (cast doubt aside) 
I cast doubt aside 

And I cast doubt (no longer) 
And I am able, I am strong 
And now it dwells in me 

And I cast doubt (no longer) 
And I am able, I am strong 
And now it dwells in me 

I'm strong and it dwells in me 
I'm strong and it dwells in me---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
