Im not a man on a mission
but the rising anger forces me to stand and count my voices defiantly
im not opposed to the process but the facts demenstrate that we must stand united 

Ohh let substance blind us all
let fact enforce our words
watch the nations fall and tremble 
before free men united

I know my past i know where I came from
I wont go quietly give in to you 
I know my past my voices became wrong
well come together be as one 

As one 
Look at the pattern we see your futures are set off right before our eyes

I know my past i know where I came from
I wont go quietly give in to none
I know my past my voices make me able
well come together we will be as one---Lyrics submitted by Brennan.
