Touch me , tell me what you want me to do
I want to take a trip around you
You set me on fire
Ooo you set me on fire

(Chorus)
Lock me up in side of this room
I just want to be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all might
Tangled up in your love

Kiss me, kiss me till the sun comes up
Slow, sweet, i can never get enough of your love
Taking me higher
Ooo taking me higher

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in you sheets, tangled up in your bed
Tangled up in your hair, tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
