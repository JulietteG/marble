Another paper in my front yard
Another wave at the crossing guard
Parking lot spot 29
Ain't nothin' different but the car next to mine
And I let that song on the radio fade before I ever open the door
And it's a Xerox copy, identical twin of the 24 hours before

[Chorus:]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothin' left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby

It ain't Cheers but they all know my name
A coke can, a beer can, it's all the same
I always leave at 11:03
I know what's good and what's bad for me
I could roll thru this routine in my sleep if only I could sleep at all
And the news and the weather say, it's gonna get better but not if you never call

[Chorus:]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothin' left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby

And I could roll thru this routine in my sleep if only I could sleep at all
And the news and the weather say, it's gonna get better but not if you never call

[Chorus:]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothin' left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby

Just another day without you, uh, huh
Oh yeah, baby
Livin' just another day without you baby, mmm, hmm
No, no, no ---
