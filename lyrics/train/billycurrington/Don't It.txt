Baby, dont say no so quick 
This aint about me trying to see how far I can get 
Aint gonna lie 
Wouldnt mind a little eye to eye, lips on lips 
Swayin to the music, real close 
We could both use a little let go 
Kind of night, Baby if you want a good time 

We could get on it 
Let's Take a shot or you can sip on it 
Well find a floor that we can dance on it, Slow song it, 
as far as I can tell, that finger aint got no ring on it 
So come on baby, bring on it 
It's one of those stars fallin, love callin 
Get you feelin alright nights, 
Sounds good dont it, dont it 
Every little thing, youve got to know 
That I want it, want it 
Sounds pretty good dont it. 

Well, Ive just now seen that smile 
I bet its a minute
Since youve tapped into your wild and crazy side 
So baby, lets do this tonight 
Baby, that moon looks just right, dont fight it 

So baby let's get on it 
Let's Take a shot or you can sip on it 
Well find a floor that we can dance on it 
Slow song it, 
As far as I can tell 
That finger aint got no ring on it 
So come on baby, bring on it 
It's one of those stars fallin, love callin 
Get you feelin alright nights 
Sounds good dont it, dont it 
Every little thing 
Youve got to know that I want it, want it 
Sounds pretty good dont it. 

So baby lets get on it 
Youre gonna love it you can bet on it 
Karaoke we can microphone it 
Whatever you want, 
As far as I can see 
That finger aint got no ring on it 
So come on baby, bring on it 
It's one of those stars fallin, love callin 
Get you feelin alright nights, 
Sounds good dont it, dont it, 
Every little thing 
Youve got to know that I want it, want it 
Sounds pretty good dont it.
