I don't think you'll like it,
I hear that cities cold.
And the people are much warmer
Two good reasons not to go.

You fight traffic all day long, 
Then you've gotta pay to park.
You have to go 'round locking all,
Your doors there after dark.

Don't know why you feel you've gotta go somewhere,
Have you ever thought about just staying here.
If you'll let me, I can give you don't you know,
Every reason not to go.

Their football team is lousy,
No matter what they do.
You can bet come Sunday,
They'll find a way to loose.

You'll hate the way the smog
And the buildings block the sky.
Got the prices jacked so high, 
Takes a million to get by.

Don't know why you feel you've gotta go somewhere,
Have you ever thought about just staying here.
If you'll let me, I can give you don't you know,
Every reason not to go.

There must be something in this town,
You'd be missing if you moved.
Cause I know if you weren't around,
I'd be missing you.

Don't know why you feel you've gotta go somewhere,
Have you ever thought about just staying here.
I'm in love with you and baby now you know,
Every reason not to go.

Every reason not to go.

Baby please don't go.---Lyrics submitted by Jenna.
