A mother lost her child, I tried to ease her pain
It's only God's will, she said she felt the same.
It's funny how the sun will up and battle rain
As if the clouds couldn't stand to see me outside a-gain
Wrote a rhyme that was kind, with some vision to it
Bottom line, it might expand yo mind if you listen to it
Too much shine can dull the soul

If you feel how i feel then I rap some mo'
How can the Devil take my brother if he's close to me
When he was everything I wasn't but I hoped to be
I get a little honest, and I ask my self
If the time come will you save me if I ask for help
Send my mind on a journey to the outermost
To document what it had seen, and Cc: me the notes
And ask Kurt Cobain why, cause I need to know
He stopped when he had such a long way to go
I saw love in the eyes of a perfect stranga
She overlooked my caring heart in search of a gangsta
Will we ever be together? Only time will tell
She called my phone and talk to me as her eye was swelled
I put my problems in box beside my tightest rhymes
On a lock and key, buried deep of in my mind
And when it gets too full, and I can't close the lid
I spaz on my family and my closest friends
Trade my materials for a peace of mind
Im so close to Heaven, Hell I need some time
Who cares about life, and the highs and lows
Maybe I should write another song about pimps and hoes
Cars and clothes, Idol Gods, Golden Cabs, Louie Scarfs
I do this for the love, and it's free of charge
I don't need jail to be behind bars
This is purely art, in my Grandma's household this was surely taught
Don't be naive, yea these time's is hard. In the mist of all the glamor, hope you find god
I never wished to be the burden bearer
But souls need saving and it's now or never
Shock value is all they wanna see
It's us against them, and it's just you and me
Tryna take heat what I say in my songs
Forgive me if I ever ever stilled you wrong
Most people stop for signs, but I've driven through it
If it don't touch my soul, then I can't listen to it
The radio don't play the shit I used to love
Or maybe I'm just growing up
I never seen a star on a red rug
If I wanna see a stars I just look above
To the Heavens

I know you been down so long, So I'll be stronger for you
I know you been down so long, Cause I've been down too
Yes I understand, What you're goin through
Yes I understand, Cause I'm goin through it too
I pray you find your way, and all things old become new
I pray you find your way for my sake, cause I'm lost too
Yes I Understand, What you're goin through
Yes I understand, Cause I'm goin through it too
I lost my friend this mornin', woke up screamin her name
She meant so much to me, I'm scared I won't be the same
Hope you understand, what I'm goin through
Hope you understand, when I call out for you
To vent.---Lyrics submitted by Maurice White.
