I've been such a good girl
living in a bad world
feeel like I could use a gun.
You've been on the run now
living up shooting down
time is up you better run!

Run too my house tonight,
comb your hair like Elvis Presley.
Put on your blue suede shoes
and your letter jacket.

CHORUS:
I'm gonna be your girl tonight
i'm gonna make you appler pie
i'm gonna wear my cherry red
i'm gonna give you lots of...

i'm gonna be your stepford wife
you can cut me like a knife
I'm gonna where my cherry red
i'm gonna give you lots of...
Room In My Bed.

Meet me at the rivver boat where all the freaks go
'Round at twelve o'clock tonight.
Diamond lit casino where everyone that we know is
blowing money on cock fights.

they say we're the mean ones
round us up like clean ones
put on your blue suede shoes
and your letter jacket!

CHORUS:

I'm gonna be your girl tonight
i'm gonna make you apple pie.
i'm gonna wear my cherry red
i'm gonna give you lots of...

i'm gonna be your stepford wife
you can cut me like a knife
i'm gonna where my cherry red
i'm gonna give you lots of...---Lyrics submitted by Hayden Bagley.
