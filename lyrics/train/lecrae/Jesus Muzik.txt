One thang that's fasho, everywhere I go people caught up in theyself money cars and clothes (yep) 
They talk about it all the time and put it in they songs 
They drive around and play it loud like it ain't nothin wrong 
And all they talk about is sinful stuff, got everybody actin bad thinkin that they a thug (weeelll)

Now that stuff that we bump bring the sound of Christ

In the dark hearts stop but we found the light now it's soundin right 
Suicide to the good and the phantom life cuz the gospel is good

You like music from rap to gospel but ya prolly neva heard nobody rap the gospel 
Different sound but the truth's the same no choirs no bands but the truth remains 
We got fam and the clique set the booth on flames St Louis others philly 
Like Duce and Flame's if ya lost in the flow don't lose the name 
It's Jesus Christ the king of the jews my mayn 
This ain't entertainment dawg it's timeless truth 
Would you rather hear a song about shiny coupes, nope 
Non-fat non-gat non-killa rap, 100% christ da blood spilla rap 
Yall feelin that, rap wrapped up with the gospel, ay trip dawg run it back 
Yall feelin that? Rap wrapped up with the gospel ay trip dawg run it back 

Trip Lee: 
If in our car you hear that boom-bep and you hear some dude's rep 
It ain't dem folks that boast, it's folks that tell you where the truth's at 
We don't wanna hear about dimes and dope (nope) 
We don't wanna hear about nines and smoke 
We don't wanna hear about movin packs and foolish cats 
Who lie and boast 
We do wanna hear about Christ the king 
Do wanna hear how lives is changed 
We do wanna hear how God is pleased 
And theology of the Bible mayn 
This Jesus music turn heads, so turn it up and let em know 
In all we do he's first and, this Jesus music's better bro (yeah)
