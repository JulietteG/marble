One thousand
Biz busy on the bars

I hear them cheering from the sidelines
Wait, hold up, I think they hatin'
People told me take my time right?
They tired of waiting

They say "Crae, you sold your soul, man"
For real? Who bought it?
"Let the Spirit take control, man"
I don't go nowhere without Him, man

They scared I'm gonna cause these babies to stumble
They scared my integrity is gon crumble, appreciate the prayers
But all that pressure either gon make you humble
Or make you hang out on the sidelines, and fear you gon fumble
Put me in coach, ain't out here flexin for nobody
I was born to do it God don't make mistakes say I'm sorry
He don't never drop the ball
I don't never plan to fumble
Catch me running with the lions
Reggie Bushing in the jungle, uh
Came from nothin', I remember spending summers
On the corner with my cousin shootin dice and playing dozens
Me and BJ in the Cutlass, CD playing miss and buttons
Up at Lincoln High in Dallas with that Jesus Muzik bumpin'
Now it's Joseph gradution
Turn on that radio and T-Dot on the station
I remember when we used to split the rent up
UGK was banging loud outside his pickup
Wait, let me pick-up
Back when, promoters would let me back in
Unless I pay 'em on a back end, that ain't happenin'
We just pray to God that He would let us crack in
Tore that door off of them hinges
Told us get it crackin'

I hear them cheering from the sidelines
People told me take my time right?
Hear 'em cheering from the sidelines
Hold up, I think they hating
People told me take my time, right?
They tired of waiting

They bragging they in the building
Ain't building nothin'
We building the children, you know I love 'em
Boy, spit it how I live, feel it in my breath
Walking it like I talk, put it to the test
Gina, get to steppin, we get to starting
You dream of being the king but you watching the wrong Martin
Bruh man, this ain't the fifth floor, it's the penthouse
Either you change your outlook, or get out
And life ain't never been a dream you just oversleepin'
If it wasn't hard work, they probably cheatin'
Yeah, give that arrogance some rest
This ain't happen overnight, that's why I do this thing to death
I might do this 'till I'm deaf
Dumb and blind, you know I don't need my eyes to see my fate
Working fine, nevermind me
I worried how they define me, long as they can find me
They'll never confine me

I hear them cheering from the sidelines
People tell me take my tie right
Yeah, I'm cheering from the sidelines
Hold up, I think they hating
People tell me take my time right
They tired of waiting---
