Ladies and gentlemen
Good afternoon from the flight deck
Were cursing at 37,000 ft and we just passed over the coast
We will be beginning our descent in about a 30 minutes
Like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

Uh I was made in America land of the free, home of the brave
Right up under your nose you might see a sex slave in your tradeAnd will do anything for the money
Boy, a momma might sell her babies
Sell porn sell pills anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch gotta scratch them ticks
Aint rich but I might be
And I'mma shoot these flicks I'mma turn these tricks anything for a slight fee
Yea made in america
Momma told me that I belong here
Had earn all the stripes had to learn all rights had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kinda doctor
Instead of hold-in guns and crack
I was born in the mainland
Great-grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave here
But I was made in america
So I dont know a thing about that
All I know is uncle sam look-in for me working on his corner so I know I gotta pay tax
Gettin paid in America
I was raised in America
And this is all I ever known
If Im wrong then you better come save me America

Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Welcome to America

Man Id die for America
I serve my time for America
Got shot shot back with the war
Got back and aint nobody even jack in America
I could lost my life boy I lost my wife
I cant even get right in my home land
Pulling sweats hold ticks paranoia
Looking out for a threat in own land
I was trained in America
How they get up in the planes in America
People running into buildings
Taking out them buildings
People getting killed in America
And Im still in America
Though America aint feeling me
I went to war for this Country
Turn around came home and you rid of me
When yall free here saying you dont wanna be here
Well you probably could breathe here if I didnt load a couple magazines here
Yall just complain in America
Im jumping out of military planes for America
Aye I was made in America
Thats why Im out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now
Cause he wanted yall safe
And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to here about face
We bled for America
To keep yall fed in America
But whats the point of talking a lot of yall dont really even care America

Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Welcome to America
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

Uh
I wish I lived in America
Wanna raise my kids in america
Heard everybody rich all I gotta do is run jump kick
I might hit in your area
So please pick me America
I know you probably never loved me
You never hear about me on the news
And youve probably never been to my Country
I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away
Got plenty food in your nation
I can tell cause a lot of yall are over weight
I already work for yall
Im at a sweatshops making these shirts for yall
Gnaw I aint gettin money
Go to bed hungry but I make some xpoints for yall
Yall dont know a thing about that
You was made in America
Im trying to find me a ticket
Where the sky is the limit catch a plane to America
It should be plane to America
Yall blessed people got it made
Heard yall dont play no more
Yall aint saved no more
Yall looking for another way
Well I hope it aint true
But Im packing my suit
Farewell to my mother land
Say-in bye to my loved ones
Fate hear I come Im gone to another land
I done made it to America
Im amazed at America
But I couldnt get approval to stay so they sent me away from America---
