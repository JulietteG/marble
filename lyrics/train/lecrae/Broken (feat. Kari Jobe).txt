Uh hu 
Yall broken 
We are broke 
We just a bunch of broken pieces 

We broke, we broke, we broke 

Uh 
Broken 
Pieces 
Yeah, yeah 

Im just a walking instrument, in the hands of the greatest 
So if the notes are off, its cause I aint nuthin to play with 
And you can fault me, but aint we all off key 
Majorin in the minors like they there no errors behind us 

So how we still make these melodies with my felonies 
I aint buyin nothing that they sellin me, what you tellin me 
Broken pieces actin like we aint cracked 
Man we all messed up and cant no one escape that 

We see, broken people, came from broken homes 
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul 
Alcoholics to addicts, English African Arabs 
Aint no riches to fix it, you still broke when you have it 

If you aint breakin bad, and you still chasin the habit 
It aint no one to land so we still chasin the rabit 
Aint a soul on the planet, thats better than another 
And we all need grace in the face of each other. 

All the pieces on the ground 
Are shattered 
All the dreams I thought I found 
Can you put me back together (back together) 

I need your grace for my faults 
Got broken in this mess I made 
I need you to restore me 
(We broke, we broke, we broke) 

Yeah, look 

From heaven we all small, cant nobody buy a ticket 
You better have will call, I repeat he will call 
They hurt just like me, work just like me 
Lust after flesh the Prada like flirt with like me 

Regardless of our money we all broken together 
And if we dont swallow our pride we gonna choke together 
Try to hold on to our lives with these clumsy hands 
Fall off the wall of purity doing that humpty dance 

Forget the kings horses, forget the kings men 
The king is coming to put us back together again 
Been fightin since my daddy left, been fightin for approval 
Think I dont know gettin this world to love me is futile 

We tally dirt and want a better burden of being less 
Than what we were made to be, like being what they suggest 
We are outsiders, outliers, outcryers, and loud and he can inherit the earth 
And God opposes the crowd, wassup 

All the pieces on the ground 
Are shattered 
All the dreams I thought I found 
Can you put me back together (back together) 

I need your grace for my faults 
Got broken in this mess I made 
I need you to restore me 
(We broke, we broke, we broke) 

Your presence in me, is all the strength that I need 
Your presence in me, is all the strength that I need 
And Ill always be whole 
And Ill always be whole 

All the pieces on the ground 
Are shattered 
All the dreams I thought I found 
Can you put me back together (back together) 

I need your grace for my faults 
Got broken in this mess I made 
I need you to restore me 

You never left me, you never ran out, you never gave up 
You never left me, you never ran out, you never gave up 
You never left me, you never ran out, you never gave up 
You never left me, you never ran out, you never gave up 
(We broke, we broke, we broke)---
