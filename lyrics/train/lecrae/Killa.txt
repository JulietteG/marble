Uh, I know it's gonna kill me but I just can't let it go
And the taste so appealing
Got a grip upon my soul
These honey-dip lies mesmerize me
Pride's got its crooked fingers twisted all inside me
Fools walk the path I'm on
Never to be seen again
Sipping on seduction while we eating on some secret sin
(No one will ever know)
Says the whisper in my ear
I know I should be over this but I ain't seeing clear
But I ain't leaving here
Unless somebody saves me
Walking to my grave, letting evilness enslave me
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies
And her silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind
Her fabrical fabrication is fueling my fascination
While I'm intoxicated, she starts her assassination
I'm losing all my honor and my years to the merciless
Giving all my life away
But I am so immersed in this

Chorus:
(Killa)
Baby, this is innocent
(Killa) 
And it won't even hurt a little bit
(Killa)
I'm only here for your benefit
I'm your every wish
Come on and let me in 
(Killa)
Baby, this is innocent
(Killa)
And it won't even hurt a little bit
Close your eyes and let's get lost tonight
It'll be alright
You'll see I'm a (killa)

My friends fell low when they were so high
Got me running scared of myself (no lie)
And I know I'm gonna die
I tried cold turkey
But when I'm feeling worthy Satan's sure to try to murk me
I'm doing myself dirty, flirting with what's perverted
I should follow the word but I guess I rather be murdered
(ahem)
Excuse me, I mean martyred 
Cuz I'm killing myself
My sin conceived a baby, and we gon' name it death
Breath (gasp) taken
She take my breath away
Replaces it with poison
And I'm so swept away
I need some bread today
Hope I wake up before they start my wake up
Somebody help me break up
I'm dating a
