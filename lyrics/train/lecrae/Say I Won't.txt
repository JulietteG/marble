(feat. Andy Mineo)

Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (we them outsiders, that's just how we live it)
Say I won't (x2) (and I bet I will)
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
We be like la, la, la, la

From the same city as the B-I-G
Wanna serve these bars, gotta see ID
Now I'm on their radar, where B-Dot be?
Was a slave for the cars, then we got free
Used to only wanna pull up in a black sport
Just a white man excelling in a black sport
Now I'm really doing pull ups
Gotta honeymoon for the summer tryn'-a getta six-pack for it
Say I won't catch Crae slipping in the studio at like 3 AM
Autograph that forehead with a Sharpie pen and then Instagram
Might swag out a fanny pack
I might bring the love back
Nobody wanna change the game, man y'all just want more trap
Okay, say I won't rap about bagpipes
Say I won't talk about that price
To know Christ and live life like every night my last night
Bout to switch up the program
I rock name-brand, I rock no brand
My whole life GoPro cam, got rap like I had no fans, nope
They say, I know I say, "veto"
Danny the vido, en el pachino, those are my people
Also I'm rocking the speedo
This that casino, you bet your revenue
Thinking you'll stop me, no never not letting you
You must be high on that medical thinking I won't
But I know better, know that I bet I do (kill em, ooh)

Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (we them outsiders, that's just how we live it)
Say I won't (x2) (and I bet I will)
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
We be like la, la, la, la

Say I won't sell my shoes and take my kids to Chuck E Cheese with the money
Say I won't bring my own bottle of Pellegrino to the movies with me
Say I won't
Look, I'm from an era of fast living and mass terror
Boys cover them cover girls like mascara
I don't need to keep a gun and a mask ever
I still make em put their hands up, ask Derek
My role manager damage all of you amateurs
Sneaking up on a tour bus with a demo to hand to us
When I was younger, I just wanted a chain
Now a chain of events has afforded a change
See, I been a rebel since back in the day, I don't follow the people
I follow the leader through valleys and shadows of death and I fearing no evil
So say I won't do it, say I won't turn the music up and get to it
Won't come down H-Town all the way to their town
In the old school, drop top Buick
And I'm getting, maybe 8 or 9 miles to the gallon
Still feeling like a stallion
I got Andy riding shotgun with 30 gold chains on, talking about he Italian
Say I won't go drop another album, and rap double time and all dub-steppin
Got no producers, just me rocking over beatboxing by Dougie Fresh
Say I won't

Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (we them outsiders, that's just how we live it)
Say I won't (x2) (and I bet I will)
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
We be like la, la, la, la---
