I don't want to waste my life
I don't want to waste my time
Only have a little bit
Before you know it's gone
In a blink of an eye

Don't want to break my stride
Don't want to fall behind
I don't care who
Doing what they do
I'm going to do what's right

You got to keep your head in the fight
You can't give up in the hardest time
Can't let your spirit die
If you're going to survive
You got to give love to your heart
A prayer on your tongue
Just when you feel that you've fallen off
Keep your head in the fight
If you want to come out alive

Fight for the kingdom come
Fight for the ones you love
When you feel weak
Butter on your knees
That's where your strength comes from

You got to keep your head in the fight
You can't give up in the hardest time
Can't let your spirit die
If you're going to survive
You got to give love to your heart
A prayer on your tongue
And even when you feel that you've fallen off
Keep your head in the fight
If you want to come out alive

Tell me
Who's going to stay in the fight
Who's going to stand for what's right
Who's going to carry the light, carry the light
I'm going to stay in the fight
I'm going to stand for what's right
I'm going to carry the light, carry the light

You got to keep your head in the fight
You can't give up in the hardest time
Can't let your spirit die
If you're going to survive
You got to give love to your heart
A prayer on your tongue
And even if you think you've already won
Keep your head in the fight
If you want to come out alive

On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
On the other side---
