Stayed out about 2 hours too late and now its hard gettin out of this bed
Man my boyfriend was a pain in the butt last night and now hes an ache in my head
I stubbed my toe on the dresser and i guess its too late to shower and do my hair, yeah
Throw a ball cap on
Hell, half the day is gone
Nothing else could go wrong, woah
50 bucks is all i got
when times are tough, its time to shop
your credit card will buy a lot, woah
Whats another bill to pay?
Its that kind of dayyyyy, hey hey heyyyyy
I got 26 messages on my voicemail and I've only called my best friend back
I told her when it comes to my life these days im somewhere between a cry and a laugh
She said my mom just called and said I look like I've gained 5 pounds! awhuh!
Slip into my fat jeans
Overalls I'm in ice cream
Treat the day just like a dream, woah
Hope I see someone I know
And I'll smile and put on a show
Say I got somewhere to go, woah
Everyone's got something to say
It's that kind of dayyyyy, hey hey heyyyyy
HEY HEY!!!
Standin still on the interstate and i swear some old lady just flipped me the bird?!
Did she just flip me the bird?! awhuh!
?Gotta go up from the year? (not sure if real words in this line)
Today is gonna disappear
And nothings gonna interferrrre, woah
I'm gonna buy myself some flowers
And then spend a couple hours
Talkin to my higher power, woah
Ask Him why my life's this wayyyy
Yeah, I'm gonna ask Him why my life's this wayyy
There's just no tellin what He's gonna sayyy
Yeah, it's that kind of dayyyyy
Oh yeahhh yeah
ya ya ya ya ya 
ya ya ya ya ya
oh yeaaahhhh---Lyrics submitted by kylzey.
