We are the future lived today
Get up and erase the barricade!

Breath in, blow out
It's like a hurricane
Red blood, riot
Call us whatever name
Serpent, sisters
Always in barricade
Oh, oh erase your barricade!

The barricade, the barricade
Barricade
Get up, get up
Erase the barricade....

We are the future lived today
Get up and erase the barricade!---
