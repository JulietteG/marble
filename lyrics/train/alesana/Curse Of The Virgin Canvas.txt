i am here to tell you a story
a story that will torture your thoughts by day and poison your dreams by night
and though i will do my best,
there are no words that can be written
nor brush strokes laid on canvas that can describe this dark and utter horror of the night that annabel died
the emptiness will haunt you

this is a nightmare
is my annabel really gone?
why have i stopped my day oh,
i find it hard to breathe
her body teases me
as the sun reveals the dawn
her smile reflects the gold
i kissed a sharp painful lie

baby lay in my arms
and cuddle me close
soon this will be
just an awful memory
(will i ever be able to sleep again?)

my angel lie to me
and tell me im dreaming
(please wake me up, please wake me)
a feel like you will always be
such a tradgic part of me
(ill watch to see you torture me)

i watch the blood drip
from the corners of your mouth
the watch seems vicious for me
ill frown and slit your throat

im starting to belive
what my eyes are seeing now
eyes look so beautiful
and you know what ill be now

baby lay in my arms
and cuddle me close
soon this will be
just an awful memory
(will i ever be able to sleep again?)

my angel lie to me
and tell me im dreaming
(please wake me up, please wake me)
a feel like you will always be
such a tradgic part of me
(ill watch to see you torture me)

sweet, raffish
it will be
mine
it will be
done

empty eyes accuse
a face so evil
im comming undone
the mirror says it all
eclipse and story
of innocence lost
empty eyes accuse
a face so evil
im comming undone

i said look at me my real angel
abyss, i know, i will speak against you
fly forgive me
my one i see, never say you know
never for me, though it was for you
fly me monster

such an awful memory
(will i ever be able to sleep again?)

my angel lie to me
and tell me im dreaming
(please wake me up, please wake me)
a feel like you will always be
such a tradgic part of me
(ill watch to see you torture me)

sweet, raffish
it will be
mine
it will be
done

(a mirror never lies
they know, everybody knows
do you not see what they see?
a mirror never lies
i see what they see
everybody knows, everybody knows)---Lyrics submitted by olegs.
