So I'm thinking we should maybe just run away from here with no plan of coming back
We can stay away forever Our anguished love will be all we have and

I will save your life 
It's happening again, it's happening again
I wont watch you die 
It's happening again, it's happening again

I can see it's not the first time you have come and taken her from me
Rest assured it's not the last time
I'm going to set you free

You took her once shame on you
You took her twice shame on me

Whisper softly and tell me that you love me
I'm losing you I don't know what to do
Please forgive me and know that I am sorry
I'm losing you I don't know what to do
Trapped inside a memory I'm falling apart

Do you realize it's over there's no chance of leaving here alive
You don't realize what I am saying 
Without me you cant survive

You took her once shame on you
You took her twice shame on me

Whisper softly and tell me that you love me
I'm losing you I don't know what to do
Please forgive me and know that I am sorry
I'm losing you I don't know what to do
Trapped inside a memory I'm falling apart

I'm falling apart (you've ripped out my heart!!)
I'm falling apart (I don't know where to start!!)

I don't want to go
it's happening again, it's happening again
But I cant let it show
I'll be with her again, together till the end

If I have to go
it's happening again, it's happening again
I'll be damned if I'm alone
I'll be with her again

Whisper softly and tell me that you love me
I'm losing you I don't know what to do
Please forgive me and know that I am sorry
I'm losing you I don't know what to do 
Trapped inside a memory I'm falling apart

I've lost it all...---Lyrics submitted by Hannah Green.
