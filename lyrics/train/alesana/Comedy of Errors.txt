Ive been here before am I losing my mind?
Look at me, tell me Im crazy
Were in danger
Follow me and youll see things are not what they seem
Take my hand or dont you trust me?
We are in danger and Im the one to blame

At the edge of mans reason there exist designs to escape reality
The tesseract calls to me
Cosmic strings shall be mine to pull
Failure met by failure
Try again! Try again!
Still she calls to me...

Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more
Im never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night

Hush sweet baby dont say a word
Im ignoring destiny for reasons I cant tell you
We try to fool our minds
How long do we wait for salvation?
Is it a sin to wonder?
Get off your knees!

Failure met by failure
Try again! Try again!
Shes insane!
Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more
Im never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night

Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Can you hear me? Someones talking
Can you see me? Someones watching

Delusions of grandeur, where the hell am I? Save me from myself!
cause I can no longer play this morbid game
Just when I thought it was over, here we go!
Galaxies welcome me inside!

Im insane!
Oh the horror! Oh the panic!
Paranoid and deranged! I am a God!
Psychotic and ashamed! Why! Why!

Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more
Im never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night
Im never closing my eyes
Forever one with the night

It was a dark and stormy night...
Ive traveled near and far, raced with all the stars
now alone Ill be, subtle tragedy
If I had one more chance to just explore
I would take your hand and do it all again---
