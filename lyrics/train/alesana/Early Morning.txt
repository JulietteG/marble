Last night I forgot
how the sound of your voice whispered sweet
Goodbyes, your eyes left to die
I'm alone to
understand why

Why not one more night
one last kiss goodbye
my sweet love tonight
I hope the stars
still spell out your name
where you are...

Kiss my closing eyes
Help me sleep
without you I'm so lost
Tonight I cry
Tell me why
I can't live
without your warm embrace

Why not one more night
one last kiss goodbye
my sweet love tonight
I hope the stars still
spell out your name
where you are...

I close my eyes and you
are everything I see
Goodbye

Goodbye to you my love
I won't forget you
I'll see you soon
Goodbye my love
Goodbye to you my love
I won't forget you
Let me live---Lyrics submitted by miranda.
