If only you could see 
(If only you could see)
You're the only girl 
I've ever dreamed of
If only you could see 
(If only you could see)

Should I apologize
with such pathetic eyes
Just the sight of you has made me
sick tonight (tonight)
It was your poison kiss
that turned me into this
Then again there is a chance 
you could be right.

Darling will you please (please)
take a walk with me
We could count the stars 
and disappear
(I wish you could see)
I wish you could see
You're the only girl 
I've ever dreamed of

Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?

What fate has led me here?
Oh please forgive me dear.
I don't know if I could survive 
on my own
I could have married you, 
instead I buried you
Now we'll see 
if I can fall asleep alone (alone)

Darling will you please (please)
take a walk with me
We can count the stars 
and disappear
(I wish you could see)
I wish you could see
You're the only girl 
I've ever dreamed of

Are you satisfied?
(Are you satisfied?)
The nightmare's coming true
Are you satisfied?
(Are you satisfied?)

Are you satisfied?
(Are you satisfied?)
I did it all for you.
Are you satisfied?
(Are you satisfied?)

I wish you could see
You're the only girl 
I've ever dreamed of

Darling will you please (please)
take a walk with me
We can count the stars 
and disappear
(I wish you could see)
I wish you could see
You're the only girl 
I've ever dreamed of

Are you satisfied?
(Are you satisfied?)
Are you satisfied?
(Are you satisfied?)

The depth of a man's soul 
can not be measured in a matter 
of meters and fathoms
but rather it is in my opinion 
only quantified by his proximity 
to heaven and hell. 

It was in such a state that 
I ushered myself past 
the town tavern,
bursting at the seams with 
the sounds of laughter and drunken piano playing.

and Had it only been a different night, 
a different place, a different kind 
of man passing by the threshold
of that innocent pub. 

The events that transpired 
at that point would have 
undoubtedly been drastically different. 

I can only guess if anyone outside that place 
had a clue when the exclamations
of mirth became the desperate 
screams of the helpless, 
begging for their very lives.---Lyrics submitted by David Gunter.
