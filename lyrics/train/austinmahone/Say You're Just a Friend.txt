(feat. Flo Rida)

Hey hey baby you've been on my mind I knew you for a long time
but I've been thinking baby that you should know (oh oh yeah eh uh)
Hey hey baby can we compromise I really want you to be mine
I've got a million places that we could go (o, oh yeah uh)

I wanna be your everything, I want to be the one you need
So tell me where ya been all my life, gonna make you mine tonight

Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
yeah you say you're just a friend
[x2]

Hey hey baby we've been on the phone
spending time together alone,
but every time we talk the words don't come out right
oh oh, yeah e uh

Hey hey baby when I look in your eyes
I can tell that you're holding something inside
I've been thinking bout you you you
I've been thinking bout me me me

I wanna be your everything, I want to be the one you need
So tell me where ya been all my life, gonna make you mine tonight

Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
yeah you say you're just a friend
[x2]

[Flo Rida:]
In carol city spent most of my nights,
Tryna make the world whistle
It's a hell of a life
How I made them all get low
Bring it back right around
Let the good times roll feeling good right now
But I remember Biz Markie
1989 or maybe 90,
Came to me like a song I wrote,
Cutting class
Chasing you 'cause you're all I want
Like you, you got what I need,
And if not I'll just pretend
Until I can get your friend
I'm playing though
But maybe there's a little truth sprinkle in 'em,
We be catching eyes and I can see the twinkle in 'em
Thought we'd be together until I seen the wrinkle in 'em
But I guess not

Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
yeah you say you're just a friend
