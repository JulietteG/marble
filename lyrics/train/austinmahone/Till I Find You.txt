Girl, I woke up with you on my mind, 
I found your picture on my phone,
I don't know what you did to me that night, 
I'm in the twilight zone.

Tell me, why I'm trippin', 
Still taken by the way you move, 
Tell me, am I crazy, 
Will I ever ever find you.

Chorus:
Every minute I'm without you I lose, 
Cause an angel touched my heart and took, my cool, 
Every second feels like fire, I'm blue, 
What I gon' do till I find you.

Gone, the chase I'm going Sherlock Holmes, 
Cinderella when the clocks go struck, 
It gets so hard to breathe on my own, 
Girl I'm runnin' out of ti-i-ime.

Tell me, why I'm trippin', 
still taken by the way you move, 
tell me, am I crazy, 
will I ever ever find you.

Chorus:
Every minute I'm without you I lose, 
Cause an angel touched my heart and took, my cool, 
Every second feels like fire, I'm blue, 
What I gon' do till I find you.

Bridge:
Wonder where what you're doing girl, 
baby I'm bout to lose it, 
I've been runnin' around the world, 
I wont stop till I find ya.
