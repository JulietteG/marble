Turn your radio up, Turn your radio up
Ain't no other Shawty I've heard of baby,
Put a million on that that that that,
I took my world and gave you half of it baby,
I pray I'll never get it back back back back.

I love your style,
I love your smile,
I love your eyes,
They look like diamonds to me!
But you could have it all,
All of it baby,
In your favorite store blowin' stacks stacks stacks.

Cus I know that all my dreams
Are coming true yeah
And I know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
I'll never feel the way I feel girl,
With you oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you,

I'll go up and get a star for you baby
Pick it out and bring it back back back back
I'm glad you opened up your heart for me baby
I ain't lying that's a fact fact fact fact

I remember us sitting up late in my one bedroom apartment
Memories runnin' thru my head head head head
You're the only one that I want if you were to leave me
I don't know what I would do instead stead stead stead
Cus I love you I love you
Even if I'm tempted
I swear I'll never put none of them others above ya
I hope I can get along with your big brothers
Cus I'm in it for the long hard like truckers
Party in love and the purple label kisses, just give me a minute
And I'll be making you my Mrs.
We can look exquisite, trips to the pacific
Look up in the sky like look Mma I did it

Cus I know that all my dreams
Are coming true yeah
And I know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
I'll never feel the way I feel girl,
You oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you,

Turn your radio up, Turn your radio up,
Turn your radio up, Turn your radio up,
Let me see them hands up, Let me see them hands up,
Let me see them hands up, Let me see them hands up

Cus I know that all my dreams
Are coming true yeah
And I know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
I'll never feel the way I feel girl,
You oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you,
You oh baby you yeah you
Yeah you.---Lyrics submitted by Katherine Phan.
