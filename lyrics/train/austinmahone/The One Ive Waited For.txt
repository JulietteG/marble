I built my walls up high
But now they're falling and you're the reason why
And with you I'm not alone
Cause you are the one I've waited for
But my heart's been locked away
I hid inside just so I'd feel safe
I'll give in, won't be afraid
Cause you are the one I've waited for

This is love, it's love, it's love
This is love, it's love, it's love
I've been searching so long for a feeling like this
Cause you are the one I've waited for
Girl you are the I've waited for

I said when the time is right
I'll meet that someone that'll make me shine
And right now that time has come
Cause you are the one I've waited for
I guess you have waited too
To fall in love with someone that's true, yeah
So tonight, don't let it go
Cause you are the one I've waited for

This is love, it's love, it's love
This is love, it's love, it's love
I've been searching so long for a feeling like this
Cause you are the one I've waited for
Girl you are the I've waited for

And will you believe?
I can be all you need
I won't ever leave
It may be you and me for eternity
Cause you are the one I've waited for

This is love, it's love, it's love
This is love, it's love, it's love
I've been searching so long for a feeling like this
Cause you are the one I've waited for
Girl you are the I've waited for

This is love, it's love, it's love
This is love, it's love, it's love
I've been searching so long for a feeling like this
Cause you are the one I've waited for
Girl you are the I've waited for

Yeah, you are the I've waited for ---
