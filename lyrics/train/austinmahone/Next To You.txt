Let the bass kick

Hey girl, just look at you
So beautiful and drop dead hot
Tell me, whats the thing?
What you do with a guy like him?
Hey girl, youre one of a kind
Youre the best one can be
Tell me, whats the thing?
Are you taking this love for real?

I see him tryin to break your smile
I Get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He dont really care about you
Like I will, I will
I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to be, to never be alone, believe it
I will, I will
I will be next to you
Baby
I will, I will
I will be next to you

Let the bass kick

Hey girl, whats up with you
Theres something bout the look in your eyes baby
What is wrong
Just tell what is going on
Why you wasting your time
Saying everything its alright baby
What you have, its never put a bag of mess

I see him tryin to break your smile
I Get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He dont really care about you
Like I will, I will
I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to be, to never be alone, believe it
I will, I will
I will be next to you
Baby
I will, I will
I will be next to you

Let the bass kick

I see him tryin to break your smile
I Get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He dont really care about you
Like I will, I will
I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to be, to never be alone, believe it
I will, I will
I will be next to you
Baby
I will, I will
I will be next to you---
