I see you walk by
Extra fly
Baby where you going?
Can I roll? (Is it cool if I come with you, baby?)

Livin' beach life
Feelin' right
You're the hottest everybody knows
Oh oh

Burnin' up, burnin' up
Show 'em what you got
Yeah you got it baby
Let it show
Uh huh

Turn it up, turn it up
Let me know what's up
Don't just stand there
Girl, I gotta know

Say Somethin'
If you're feelin' the vibe
Say somethin'
Baby don't be so shy
Say somethin'
Cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yea yea
Say somethin'
Cause you're driving me crazy
Say somethin'
Cause you're driving me wild
Say somethin'
The way you're working it baby
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yea yea

When we talk, girl, fireworks
Something like the 4th of July

You're super hot
Fire hot
Something like the sun in the sky

Burnin' up, burnin' up
Show 'em what you got
Yeah you got it baby
Let it show
Uh huh

Turn it up, turn it up
Let me know what's up
Don't just stand there
Girl, I gotta know

Say Somethin'
If you're feelin' the vibe
Say somethin'
Baby don't be so shy
Say somethin'
Cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yea yea
Say somethin'
Cause you're driving me crazy
Say somethin'
Cause you're driving me wild
Say somethin'
The way you're working it baby
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yea yea

Oh Yea
Hey baby
Tell me something lady
I gotta know what's up
I gotta know it right now
Hey baby
Tell me something lady
I gotta know what's up
I gotta know it right now

Say Somethin'
If you're feelin' the vibe
Say somethin'
Baby don't be so shy
Say somethin'
Cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yea yea
Say somethin'
Cause you're driving me crazy
Say somethin'
Cause you're driving me wild
Say somethin'
The way you're working it baby
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yea yea
OH YEA ---Lyrics submitted by Dezirea.
