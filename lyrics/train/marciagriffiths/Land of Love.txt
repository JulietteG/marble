Come let us go to the land of love
Where the love light shine so bright above
We will be so happy and free
All your pains will let you be
You're gonna find that love is real
By the feeling you feel

In that land where the people are free
Life will be better for you and me
We won't find true happiness appear
Come with me and have no fear
We're gonna find that love is real
By the feeling you feel

We will be so happy and free
All your pains will let you be
You're gonna find that love is real
By the feeling you feel

In that land where the people are free
Life will be better for you and me
We won't find true happiness appear
Come with me and have no fear
We're gonna find that love is real
By the feeling you feel

Come let us go to the land of love
Where the love light shine so bright above
We will be so happy and free
All your pains will let you be
You gonna find that love is real
By the feeling you feel---Lyrics submitted by Paul Grant.
