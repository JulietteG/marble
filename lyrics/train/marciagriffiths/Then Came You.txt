True love is hard to find, wow yeah yeah
I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do
I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do

Give your heart to no other
Be a true to life player
When the chips are down, down down
Love would be around 

I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do
I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do

Take some time to nurture
Cause the sweeter you treat him
is the longer you keep him
Let your feelings show
Love takes time to grow now now

I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do
Cause I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do

Some may say that im a fool to feel this way
But i know true love conquers all
If you ever ever knew the things the things i know
Then you know loves the way to go

I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do
I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do

I prayed for love and then came you
Now i know exactly what to do
I prayed for love
I prayed for love and then came you, now that i got you ive gotta keep you
Now i know exactly what to do---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
