These pearls from my mother, passed down from her mother, of everything she gave me i treasure them most. Cant wear them, cant hold them. Don't come from the ocean ohh. they're way more precious than anything i own. They're written in my soul.

(Chorus: Break off on yeah on the second measure)

Remember who you are and dont forget to pray, make sure hes your best friend before you give your heart away, Be kind be, strong be someone everyone can count on. ya someday im gonna give my little girl these pearls Oh yeah.. 

I'll teach her about makeup boyfriends and breakups, ill share all the wisdom ive ever learned like beauties on the inside and give it your best try, ill pass down the same words ive always heard and she'll carry them with her

(Chorus: Hold last note for 3 measures)

Remember who you are and dont forget to pray, make sure hes your best friend before you give your heart away, Be kind be strong be someone everyone can count on ya.. someday im gonna give my little girl these pearls, these pearls.

(Bridge)

she'll tell her daughter and she'll tell hers too ive saved these pearls just for you.. yeah. just for you.

(Chorus: high pitch low volume)

Remember who you are and dont forget to pray make sure hes your best friend before you give your heart away, Be kind be strong be someone everyone can count on ya someday im gonna give my little girl these pearls Ohhhh someday im gonna give my little girl.... These pearls. These precious pearls.---Lyrics submitted by Desha.
