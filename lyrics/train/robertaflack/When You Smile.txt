When you smile I can see 
you were born, born for me 
and for me you'll be due our try 
oh baby let me hold you 
you make me wanna hold you
when you (smile)x7 

When you smile I can see 
there is hope, hope for me 
and for you if you know what I mean
 Im gonna sing it to you
 Im gonna rock it to you 
Every (time)x7 

When you smile I can see 
me and you, you and me 
there is love in your eyes when you smile 
oh baby let me love you 
You gotta let me love you 
when you (smile)x7 

la la la, larala, la la la... 

When you smile I can see 
you were born, born for me 
and for me you'll be due our try 
oh baby let me hold you 
you make me wanna hold you 
when you (smile)x7 

la la la, larala, la la la...---Lyrics submitted by Toni.
