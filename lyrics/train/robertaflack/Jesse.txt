Jesse, come home, there's a hole in the bed 
 Where we slept, now it's growing cold 
 Jesse, your face and the place where we lay 
 By the hearth, all apart, it hangs on my heart 
 And I'm leaving the light on the stairs 
 No, I'm not scared -- I wait for you 
 Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home 

 Jesse, the stairs and the halls, recalling 
 Your step, and I remember too 
 All the pictures are shaded and fading in gray 
 And I still set a place at the table at noon 
 And I'm leaving the light on the stairs 
 No, I'm not scared -- I wait for you 
 Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home 

 Jesse, the spread on the bed, it's like 
 When you left, I kept it for you 
 All the blues and the greens have been recently cleaned 
 And are seemingly new -- Hey Jess, me and you 
 Will swallow the light on the stairs 
 I'll fix up my hair, we'll sleep unaware 
 Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home---Lyrics submitted by Patricia Novoselac.
