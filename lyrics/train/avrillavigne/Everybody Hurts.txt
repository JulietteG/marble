Don't know, Don't know if I can do this on my own 
Why do you have to leave, me 
It seems, I'm losing something deep inside of me 
Hold on, onto me 

Now I see 
Now I see 

Chorus: 
Everybody hurts some days 
Its okay to be afraid 
Everybody hurts 
Everybody screams 
Everybody feels this way 
And its okay 
La di da di da 
Its okay 

It feels like nothing really matters anymore 
When you're gone 
I can't breathe 
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way 
This can't be happening on me 

Now I see (now I see) 
Now I see 

Everybody hurts somedays 
Its okay to be afraid 
Everybody hurts 

Everybody screams 
Everybody feels this way 
And its okay 
La da la da la 
Its okay 
La la la la la 

So many questions so much on my mind 
So many answers I can't find 
I wish I could turn back the time 
I want to... 

Everybody hurts some days (some days) 
Everybody hurts some days (some days) 
Everybody hurts some days (some days) 
Its okay to be afraid (afraid) 

Everybody hurts somedays 
Its okay to be afraid 
Everybody hurts 
Everybody screams 
Everybody feels this way 
And its okay 
La da la da la 
Its okay 
La la la la la---Lyrics submitted by emelie.
