[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I dont like your girlfriend!
No way! No way!
I think you need a new one
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I could be your girlfriend

Hey! Hey! You! You!
I know that you like me
No way! No way!
No, its not a secret
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Youre so fine
I want you mine
Youre so delicious
I think about ya all the time
Youre so addictive
Dont you know what I could do to make you feel alright?
Dont pretend I think you know Im damn precious
And Hell Yeah
Im the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too and you know Im right

[Bridge:]
Shes like so whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And thats what everyones talking about!

[Chorus:]
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I dont like your girlfriend!
That's Right! No way! No way!
I think you need a new one
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I could be your girlfriend

Hey! Hey! You! You!
I know that you like me
No way! No way!
You know its not a secret
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
So come over here, tell me what I want to hear
Better yet make your girlfriend disappear
I dont want to hear you say her name ever again
(And again and again and again!)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Hey! Hey! You! You!
I know that you like me
No way! No way!
You know its not a secret
Hey! Hey! You! You!
I want to be your girlfriend

In a second youll be wrapped around my finger
Cause I can, cause I can do it better
Theres no other
So when's it gonna sink in?
Shes so stupid
What the hell were you thinking?!
[repeat]
