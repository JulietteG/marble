[Intro-Marilyn Manson]
Just lay your head in Daddy's lap, you're a bad girl

Bad girl, 1234

Hey, hey
I'll let you walk all over me, me
You know that I'm a little tease, tease
But I want it pretty please, please

You know, you know
You know I'm crazy
I just wanna be your baby
You can fuck me, you can play me
You can love or you can hate me

Miss me, miss me
Now you wanna kiss me

Choke me, 'cause I said so
Stroke me, feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know?
(Don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go

(1234)
Miss me, miss me
Now you wanna kiss me

Baby
You know I want a little taste, taste
So let me take you all the way, way
You know you'll never be the same, same
(You fuckin' bad girl!)

One night
You won't forget the rest of your life
So come on over to the wild side
Buckle up, but baby, hold on tight

Miss me, miss me
Now you wanna kiss me
We both know that you love me
Cause I'm so bad

Choke me, 'cause I said so
Stroke me, feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know?
(Don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(1234)

I'll be your bad girl
I'll be your bad girl
I'll be your bad girl
I'll be your bad girl

I'll be your bad girl
I'll be your bad girl
I'll be your bad girl
I got your bad girl

Choke me, 'cause I said so
Stroke me, feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know?
(Don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(Bad bad bad bad bad bad girl)---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
