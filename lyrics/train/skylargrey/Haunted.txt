They woke me up again;
It's going to be another restless sleep tonight.
The ghosts inside my head
Are moving furniture and eating dynamite.
They're moving furniture and eating dynamite.

Take me up the rill to haunted hill.
Past the floating bridge, the orphanage,
Where the spirits fly and never die.
Where the spirits fly and never die, die, die, die.
Die, Die, Die, Die.

There it's always cold.
Well I've got a fever and I'd like to make it snow.
That's why I feel so old.
All these specters need a better place to go.
All these specters need a better place to go.

We could get a chill on haunted hill,
Where the saddest parts inside my heart,
Can live in the past, leave me at last.
Can live in the past, leave me at last.

Leave me with good will on haunted hill.
Past the floating bridge, the orphanage,
Where the spirits fly and never die.
Where the spirits fly and never die, die, die, die.
Die, Die, Die, Die

Die, Die, Die, Die.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha Lawson.
