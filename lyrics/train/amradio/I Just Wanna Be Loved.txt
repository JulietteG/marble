I just want to be lost
in a crowded room
So I don't have to hear
your point of view
You know I don't care
about what you say
and it's the way you say it too

So why did you come to me?
When you knew that
you didn't believe
What did you expect 
to get from telling me?
You don't understand
anything or how I am

I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved 
I wanna be loved 
Wanna be loved

I just want you to stay
away from me
With all your lies
I don't believe

So why did you come to me?
When you knew 
that you didn't believe
What did you expect 
to get from telling me?
You don't understand
anything or how I am

I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

You don't understand
You don't understand
You don't understand

I just wanna be loved 
I just wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved by you 
I wanna be loved 
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved by you 
I wanna be loved
Wanna be loved---Lyrics submitted by minaP.
