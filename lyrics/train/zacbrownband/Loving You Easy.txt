Every morning when you come downstairs
Hairs a mess but I dont care,
No Makeup on youre shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right

Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you dont know
Cross out finding an angel off my list,
thinking it dont get no better than this

You making loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile, every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by so fast

You making loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile, every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Oh, I wanna sing it again

You making loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile, every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Easy
Easy---
