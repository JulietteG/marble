Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Jack dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
Like the king find no peace, his work is never done
Nightfall, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
... drown you for your sin

Its a lifelong expedition second guessing your decisions
Try to find out whats been missing, pages keep on filling

Cryin out, goin to wake the king
... for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, walls are closing down
Its do or die, do or die

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Nightmare, blood on the altar, the queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains long after hes dead
No soul knows hes trouble high upon his thrown
Loved by few and judged by many he bares that weight alone---
