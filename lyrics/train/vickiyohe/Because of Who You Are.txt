I worship you Lord
Lord, I love you, Lord 

Because of who you are, I give you glory
Because of who you are, I give you praise
Because of who you are, I will lift my voice and say
Lord, I worship you because of who you are
Lord, I worship you because of who you are

Because of who you are, I give you glory
Because of who you are, I give you praise
Because of who you are, I will lift my voice and say 
Lord, I worship you because of who you are
Lord, I worship you because of who you are

Jehovah Jireh, my provider
Jehovah Nissi, Lord, you reign in victory
Jehovah Shalom, my Prince of Peace
And I worship you because of who you are

Because of who you are, I give you glory
Because of who you are, I give you praise
Because of who you are, I will lift my voice and say
Lord, I worship you because of who you are
Lord, I worship you because of who you are

Jehovah Jireh, my provider
Jehovah Nissi, Lord, You reign in victory
Jehovah Shalom, my Prince of Peace
And I worship because of who you are

Jehovah Jireh, my provider
Jehovah Nissi, Lord you reign in victory
Jehovah Shalom, My Prince of Peace
And I worship you
And I worship you because of who you are

And I worship you because of who you are---Lyrics submitted by Vantresia.
