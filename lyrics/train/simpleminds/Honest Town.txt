Wounded, they say you got wounded
Say youre still haunted
Haunted by all this

Deep there, somewhere down deep there
It can still overbear
In ways so discreet

But theres one thing Ill point out youll see
And I hope that youll find these words comforting

When the light settles down here in Honest Town youll see
Theres still something between you and me
And when we turn on our ways back to honest days youll find
Theres still something between you and me

Feel it, I know you still feel it
Must I repeat it again
Till the healing is over

But theres one thing I want you to see
And I hope that youll find these words comforting
When the light settles down here in Honest Town youll see
Theres still something between you and me

And when we turn on our way, back to honest days youll find
Theres still something between you and me
'Cause when the light settles down here in Honest Town youll see
Theres still something between you and me

And when we turn on our ways back to honest days youll find
Theres still something between you and me

Something, still something
Something between, still something between you and me
Something, still something
Something between you and me
Something, still something
Something between you and me---
