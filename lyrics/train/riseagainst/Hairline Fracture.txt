A sinking ship, an awkward kiss 
A chance to set things straight 
The kind of hurt that burns and burns 
Like fires we can't contain 

We hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and there we'll wait 
So start again with steady hands 
This time nothing gets in our way 
But as we peek a little closer what do we see ? 

A crack in the surface 
A flaw in the plan 
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand) 
A cadence imperfect 
Like a building condemned 
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against) 

A promise kept 
The dirt unswept 
A poorly worn disguise 
A child unloved that then grows up 
To love what we despise 

We're broken but still breathing 
We are wounded but we are healing 
We pick up right where we left off 
Breathe on the ashed that remain 

So that these coals may become fire 
To guide our way 

A crack in the surface 
A flaw in the plan 
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand) 
A cadence imperfect 
Like a building condemned 
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against) 

I walk on wounds 
That seldom prove to slow me down 
I laugh this constant pain away 
So you can't tell 
But there it lies under the smiles 
It drains me mile after mile 
But seldom proves to slow me down 
Here I go 

Should we just hold on 
To what remains of 
What we thought was lost 

But it's just a crack in the surface 
A flaw in the plan 
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand) 
A cadence imperfect 
Like a building condemned 
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)---Lyrics submitted by matilda.
