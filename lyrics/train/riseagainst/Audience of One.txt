I can still remember
The words and what they meant 
As we etched them with our fingers 
In years of wet cement
Days blurred into each other 
Though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed but then we shifted gears
We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns

But even then we should of stayed 
But we ran away
Now all my friends are gone 
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved 
Run away
What are we running from? 
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone? 

Identities assume us
As nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches
To the seconds that we lost
And I looked up and saw you
I know that you saw me
We froze but for a moment
In empathy 

I brought down the sky for you 
But all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name 
And you ran away 
Now all my friends are gone 
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved 
Run away 
What are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone? 

We're okay, until the day we're not
The surface shines while the inside rots 
We raced the sun set and we almost won
We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on

And we ran away 
Now all my friends are gone 
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved 
Run away
What are we running from? 
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?---Lyrics submitted by Romy.
