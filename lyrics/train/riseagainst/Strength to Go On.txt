Welcome home 
While away 
They have tampered with the locks 
And your things they rearranged 
"We propose... 
...A better way" 
Said the note they left behind 
In their wake of disarray 

You fell in place 
Don't fall asleep 
They'll find us here 
I know a place 
To disappear 
As a voice proclaimed 

What we are is the sum of 1000 lives 
What we know is almost nothing at all 
But we are what we are 'til the day we die 
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on 
'Til we don't have the strength to go on 

Let us cry 
Let us be 
Let us open up our hearts 
Without fear of anything 
Faith alone's 
All we need 
To traverse this burning bridge 
Now before it gets too late 

You claim, "it's fine" 
But the heart reveals 
What smiles betray 
Your sad, sad eyes 
Gave you away 
Don't you know 

What we are is the sum of 1000 lives 
What we know is almost nothing at all 
But we are what we are 'til the day we die 
Or 'til we dont have the strength to go on 
'Til we don't have the strength to go on 

Our shoulders bear an awful weight 
But still we trudge on just the same 
Our colors run then leave a stain 
They blacken our once honest name 
How can we argue, tell me 
Over the fury and the fire 
How many times can we tell you that we 
Are not like you, we see right through 
The poor disguise that fails to fool 
The wary eye is trained on you 

What we are is the sum of 1000 lives 
What we know is almost nothing at all 
But we are what we are 'til the day we die 
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on 
'Til we don't have the strength to go on 

What we are is the sum of 1000 lives 
What we know is almost nothing at all 
But we are what we are 'til the day we die 
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on 
'Til we don't have the strength to go on 
Yeah, we don't have the strength to go on---Lyrics submitted by matilda.
