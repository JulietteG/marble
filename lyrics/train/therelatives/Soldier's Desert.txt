Soldiers desert, before you get hurt,
You don't know what they've got on this side. 
Soldiers desert, you're a plant in the dirt,
Boots in the mud, head in the sky. 

You can't forget sergeant said, 
"Think on your toes, with your gun."
So scared, you can take his heart beat. 
then he died, carving cards of
Soap boxes, and winding streets. 
Now he's chopping through the desert, 
He-

Soldiers desert, before you get hurt, 
you don't know what they got on this side.
Soldiers desert, you're a plant in the dirt. 
Boots in the mud, head in the sky. 

Heathens convert, go forget what you learned. 
Bury it beneath cold ground. 
See the blood spurt, 
through a hole in his shirt, and,
No one laughs as the cold darks the curtain. 
Soldiers desert, before you get hurt.
You don't know what they've got on this side. 
Boots in the mud, head in the sky.---Lyrics submitted by Atticus DiRe.
