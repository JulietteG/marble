Everyday takes figuring out how to live,
Sometimes it feels like a mistake,
Sometimes it's a winner's parade,
Delight and angers,
I guess that's the way it's supposed to be...

[Chorus:]
Please heal me, I can't sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
Call me, everything, make me feel unbreakable,
Lie and set me free

I feel the fear take hold
Afraid this hell I create is my own
Calm my franticness, I can't take it anymore,
This used to be my own world,
But now I've lost control

[Chorus]

Chasing leftovers,
Under the fading sun,
Searching for shelter,
I feel my time has come

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by matilda.
