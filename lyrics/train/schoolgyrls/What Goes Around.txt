Verse 1]
Uh, School Gyrls
Hmm, lets go
Get it Jacque
You gonna get what you asked for you know that right
So don't dish it cause I'll throw it back like dynomite
You better watch where you're steppin'
Cause girl with me you can't win
There's no need to compete and u know that right?

[Verse 1]
Don't be tryn' step where you know you shouldn't be
Because I'm the type of girl that you know can bring the heat
So you better step back, I don't wanna react
You don't want me to lose control
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'ma get you back
What go 'round come around girl (x2)
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back

[Verse 2]
I see what you're doin', so don't think you slick
And if you come around me, I'mma have to trip
I got all my girls around me, and they got my back
So meet me at the playground if you wanna throw back

[Chorus]
Don't be tryn' step, where you know you shouldn't be
Because I'm the type of girl that you know can bring the heat
So you better step back, I don't wanna react
You don't want me to lose control
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl (x2)
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl
Then I'mma get you back

[Verse 3]
Back, cause I hear that you been talkin' bout me, whoaa
So keep on talkin' and you're gonna see
I may be young, but I ain't playin' no games
Cause you'll get burnt when you're playin' with flames

[Chorus]
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl (x2)
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl
Then I'mma get you back
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl (x2)
Cause if you try to get me, whoaa
Then I'mma get you back
What go 'round come around girl
Then I'mma get you back---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
