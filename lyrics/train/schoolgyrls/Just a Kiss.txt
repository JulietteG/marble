(It's just a kiss)(2x)

Boy your steppin in
The danger zone
If you keep it up
Your gunna be on your own

We got rules

So you better check
Check yourself
Before you
Blow it all

So help me now
Figure out
Why your really here

(Chorus)
And all the girls say ay-ay ay-ay
Back off boys cuz you know we're just playin
And all the girls know oh-oh oh-oh
How to have fun

And your getting
In the way so
Get back get back get back get back

It's just a kiss I'm more than that

And all the girls say ay-ay ay-ay
Don't you wish don't you wish
But it was just a kiss

You thin you know
But your not in the girls room
Actin like a fool
But it's all in the attitude

It's like a dance that we do
When we first talk some dirt
Now you really know
It's just a kiss

(Chorus)
But it was just a muaha---Lyrics submitted by niyala.
