No, boy,I could be your everything

Can't compete with her energy

She want my powers, huh
Cause now, I got that super girl love

She's not a star and I'm a star
So let me light yo world up
(School gyrls watchoo say)
She got my moves
No matter wat she do she can't get like me
(No wezzo wezzay)
She ain't got no music
Tryna check my groove
But she can't get like me

Could, it, be the way I move my feet

She can't get it like I can
If you can then do dat dance

I know I can

She can't get it like I can
If you can then do dat dance
I think I can(x3)
I know I can...---Lyrics submitted by Latifah.
