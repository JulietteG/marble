We infiltrate the room
 something like a hot platoon
So many boys in here
that I don't know which one to choose

He's cute, he's not
He's a pretty boy thinks he's so hot
And I've got rent so many numbers
I think I've got to stop

(Chorus)
I'm keeping all these numbers stashed up in my party bag
And I know if i called you boy, I know you'd call me back
You'd probably break your fingers answering the phone so fast
It'd be your lucky day to wind up in my party bag

Party Bag, Party bag (3x)

Hey boys, admit the truth 
Us girls make all the rules
We calling all the shots 
Stand in line, look real hot

He's dope, he's cool
Isn't he the one we saw at school? (OMG)
Yo Nancy, get in line
Hey oh Wait, that boy is mine!

(Chorus)
I'm keeping all these numbers stashed up in my party bag
And I know if i called you boy, I know you'd call me back
You'd probably break your fingers answering the phone so fast
It'd be your lucky day to wind up in my party bag

Party Bag, Party bag (3x)

He's stuck in La-La Land
That boy's a Ga-Ga Fan
I'm hoping that  this song 
does half as well as Blah-Blah man!

I'm Good, He's bad
Mama tell me that these boys are fast (Sorry,Mama)
I love him, I dumped him
Back off! No kissing in public! -----------
(Don't kiss me!)

(Chorus)
I'm keeping all these numbers stashed up in my party bag
And I know if i called you boy, I know you'd call me back
You'd probably break your fingers answering the phone so fast
It'd be your lucky day to wind up in my party bag
 Party bag,Party Bag(3x)

I'm keeping all these numbers stashed up in my party bag
And I know if i called you boy, I know you'd call me back
You'd probably break your fingers answering the phone so fast
It'd be your lucky day to wind up in my party bag---Lyrics submitted by kisandra.
