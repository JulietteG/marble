Oooh, ooo,oooo, oooo, yeah, ooo, how you gonna spend your life, who you wanna be with when you close your eyes, is it gonna be withme or somebody that can love you better. Did you take me on just to past the time.

Where you gonna spend the night, theres no other place to be than by my side. Waiting for the sun to rise, watching as the moon surrenders. I can give you all you need, in spite of what you think you might believe.

Chorus:
Ill do anything, for your love, for your touch, Im only flesh and blood and youre the hope that keeps me alive. Id give you everything, all my world, all my soul, give you my heart to hold, and ya hands tell the end of time.

What is going through your mind, are you trying to find a way to say goodbye. All I want is one more chance. I can make it last forever, give you something you can feel. Theres something real, that you will never know.

Chorus:
Ill do anything, for your love, for your touch, Im only flesh and blood and youre the hope that keeps me alive. Id give you everything, all my world, all my soul, give you my heart to hold, and ya hands tell the end of time.

Who you gonna run to. How you gonna make it on your own. Im the one who wants YOU, and I dont wanna spend my life alone.

Chorus:
Ill do anything, for your love, for your touch, Im only flesh and blood and youre the hope that keeps me alive. Ill give you everything, all my world, all my soul, give you my heart to hold, and ya hands when you walk the line, baby you belong the my palms until the end of time.

How you gonna spend your life.---Lyrics submitted by Gost.
