Blind Man's Stick
Written by: W. Dire Wolff - 10/16/03

My Brother come back from a real big fight
You know he enlisted tried to set things right
Thought he'd be big, he thought he'd be brave
He listened to the words some rich folks say.

Now he can't see, he can't walk right
He can't love a girl on a Saturday night
He can't make money, cuz he can't dig a ditch
He did two tours of duty with just one hitch.

Hey now mama you'd better come quick
Here comes your baby with a blind man's stick
He sits by the window
Can't do no chores
Was it really worth it for some rich man's war?
There's just one thing you didn't count
This country's run from someone's bank account
Plain folks die
While rich folk spend
You got another child so they're knocking again
I love my country but this ain't the way
They line their pockets on our children's graves.

Fighting for things he didn't believe
While looking for folks who were truly in need
He learned a little thing he never knew before
He was just fighting some rich man's war.

I guess they're gonna check me for these words I said
What's the matter with me? my brother's not dead
He may be blind but he's still got his life
He'll just never love a girl on a Saturday night.

Hey now mama you'd better come quick
Here comes your baby with a blind man's stick
He sits by the window
Can't do no chores
Was it really worth it for some rich man's war?
There's just one thing you didn't count
This country's run from someone's bank account
Plain folks die
While rich folk spend
You got another child so they're knocking again
I love my country but this ain't the way
They line their pockets on our children's graves.

My Brother come back from a real big fight
You know he enlisted tried to set things right
Thought he'd be big, he thought he'd be brave
He listened to the words some rich folks say.

Now he can't see, he can't walk right
He can't love a girl on a Saturday night
He can't make money, cuz he can't dig a ditch
He did two tours of duty with just one hitch.
