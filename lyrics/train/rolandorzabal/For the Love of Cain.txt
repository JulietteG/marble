If I said I was Abel
Would you know my name?
I've swung from the trees in the Garden of Eden
And I have shorn off my mane

I've got no horns sticking out
I've got no sting in my tail
I've got no sins to pluck out
Because I do so well
And maybe I can raise the stakes

For the love of Cain
For the love of Cain
We'll dissolve our schemes
And indulge our dreams
For the love of Cain 

If you look out your window
With your Sunday smile
If you walk hand in hand through the Valley of Evil
You walk the miracle mile 

I just need someone to love
Straight from the cradle to the grave
Maybe it's you I'm thinking of
Because I know your game
And maybe I can raise the stakes 

For the love of Cain
For the love of Cain
We'll dissolve our schemes
And indulge our dreams
For the love of Cain---Lyrics submitted by Eiranna.
