Just another girl
With a dream and a heart
Wanna make a new start
With the fire inside of her
She had to go

She couldn't stay around
Everybody let her down
Stole the light, and the life
And the child inside of her
She's so alone

Running for the dream
Take her far away
From everything she knows
And the way they make her feel
She leaves today

Never look back
Never lose track
Already strong
She's seen too much at seventeen
The past will fade
With the future that she craves

Carolyna you've travelled so far
Trying to scape the pain
Start again
Where you are

Carolyna you keep following your star
Nobody said you're beautiful
You're beautiful
The way you are

Finally youre free
Way a long to be
But it won't take long
Till it gets reallity
The streets are cold

Big bad city gonna eat you up
How to survive?
How to keep your sanity?
Still felling low
But she's never going home

Carolyna you've travelled so far
Trying to scape the pain
Start again
Where you are

Carolyna you keep following your star
Nobody said you're beautiful
You're beautiful
The way you are

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

She tries to rest
All she need is a warm place
All she wants is happiness

Carolyna you've travelled so far
Trying to scape the pain
Start again
Where you are

Carolyna you keep following your star
Nobody said you're beautiful
You're beautiful
The way you are

Carolyna you've travelled so far
Trying to scape the pain
Start again
Where you are

Carolyna you keep following your star
Nobody said you're beautiful
You're beautiful
The way you are
