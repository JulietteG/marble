The day unfolds before me,
And my heart turns to you.
Lord, there's only one thing I will ask,
It's that in everything i do...

You would be first.
You would be all.
You would be everything.
Whatever it takes,
For my will to break,
And yours be done.
If i rise or fall, 
Won't matter at all,
Only that you receive the praise.
For better or worse,
You would be first.

The night sweeps in around me,
And the shadows build my fear.
And this test of faith
Has warn me thin,
But your purpose is so clear.

You would be first.
You would be all.
You would be everything.
Whatever it takes,
For my will to break,
And yours be done.
If i rise or fall, 
Won't matter at all,
Only that you receive the praise.
For better or worse,
That you would be first.

You would be first.
You would be all.
You would be everything.
Whatever it takes,
For my will to break,
And yours be done.
If I rise or fall, 
Won't matter at all,
Only that you receive the praise.
For better or worse,
You would be first.
That you would be first.

If I rise or fall,
Won't matter at all,
Only that you receive the praise.
For better or worse, 
That you would be first

For better or worse,
That you would be first.---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
