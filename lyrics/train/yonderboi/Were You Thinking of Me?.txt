It was the day when they put her on the cover
They found the corpse in the back of a Mercury
They got her laptop picking all the numbers
Trying to reach that they never meant to reach
They called a top doc messing with the data
Trying to help but they couldn't eventually
She's a rough cut
She's a top tough stuff

ref. 2x:
Oh, were you thinking of me?
Oh, were you thinking of me?
Oh, were you thinking of me?
With a love like that

It was a night,well a night just like the others
Picked up the pack that she always gave to me
She wore her lacquer top
Tripping undercover
Got in her car, just to never get back to me
Sneak in her room, she's missing all her lovers
I really hope I can get away with it
She's a top cop
She's a top ten stuff

ref. 4x---Lyrics submitted by dora bakos.
