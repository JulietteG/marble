Loneliness. No place to hide.
There's no need to run, When I'm at your side
Your looking for something. It's easy to see.
Your always changing things, No you won't let them be.

And in the still of the night,
When your ready to give up the fight,
Then you reach, for me.
In the still of the night I can take you where you want to play,
when you reach, for me,
In the still of the fight I can hold you tight and set you free.

You've been down this road.Day after day.
You've lived and loved, Your work is play.
You know your needs, And it brings you pity.
You do your deeds, Yeah the real nitty gritty.

And in the still of the night,
When your ready to give up the fight,
Then you reach, for me.
In the still of the night I can take you where you want to play,
when you reach, for me,
In the still of the fight I can hold you tight and set you free.

Your just a little girl inside,
You thought you'd come along
For just one more ride.
And when things didn't turn out
The way you want them to be
That's when I feel you
Reaching for me yeah!

And in the heat of the night,
When your ready to give up the fight,
Just come on around momma, Knock on my back door...

Then you reach, for me.
In the still of the night I can take you where you want to play,
when you reach for me,
In the still of the fight I can hold you tight and set you free.
When you reach, for me,
In the still of the night I can take you where you want to play,
when you reach for me,
In the still of the fight I can hold you tight and set you free.---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
