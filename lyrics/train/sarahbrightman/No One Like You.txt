And we too - will it not be soft and kindThat rest from life, from patience and from painThat rest from bliss, we know not when we findHow can i have enough of life and loveIn your eyes are my secrets that i've never shown youIn my heart i feel i've always known youIn your arms there's a comfort that i never knewYou're what i've been waiting for, there's no one like youSure as the sunrise, pure as a prayerYou fashioned hope right out of thin airevery dream i abandoned, seems it could come trueI believe in miracles, there's no one like youInnocent as a newborn in a world so frighteningIt's as if my world's been struck by lightningevery dream I abandoned, seems it could come trueI believe in miracles, there's no one like you---Lyrics submitted by widad.
