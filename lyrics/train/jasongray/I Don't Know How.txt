I wanna believe but I don't know how
Trust what I can't see but I don't know how
Baptized in the burning flame
When the troubles come my way
I wanna walk by faith but I don't know how

I wanna be clean but I don't know how
I wanna live free but I don't know how
It feels like I can't escape
The shackles of my shame
I wanna break away but I don't know how

I have no choice
But to cry out for You
Please help, cause I'm helpless now
You hear my prayer
When my whole world comes unglued
I know You can fix it, but I don't know how
I don't know how

I wanna be what she needs but I don't know how
I wanna find a way to peace but I don't know how
Like a martyr with guilty hands
Exiled from the promised land
I wanna get back in but I don't know how

I have no choice
But to cry out for You
Please help, cause I'm helpless now
You hear my prayer
When my whole world comes unglued
I know You can fix it, but I don't know how
I don't know how

I wanna forgive but I don't know how
I wanna feel forgiven
I want to follow You where
I can love without fear, but I'm still here

I have no choice
But to cry out for You
Please help, cause I'm helpless now
You hear my prayer
When my whole world comes unglued
I know You can fix it, but I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how

I know You can fix it, but I don't know how
Yeah, only You can fix it when I don't know how---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
