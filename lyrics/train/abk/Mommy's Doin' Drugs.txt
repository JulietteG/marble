Why these kids always smellin' like a butt
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
Two mismatched socks and hair fucked up why?
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
Never fed always sayin that they hungry
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's drugs
I guess now I know what happened to that money
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
A situation that I can't take now I'm angry
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
I can't belive she'd do this to the family
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs

Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear Mom

Alway mad taking it out on us
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
Turn into a person that no one can trust
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
It ain't our fault that she acts this way it's just
Mommy's doin drugs, mommy's doin drugs
And if she don't get help I swear we'll run away because

Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear Mom

It's been about six weeks and mom seems straight
hopefully it's the last time she'll have to rehabilitate
Actually it will be, for us that is 
Cause I'm a court date away from being granted the kids
All I know is it's time to make a change
To erase all the memories and wipe away the pain
Embrace my kids and give them nothing but love
And try to help em forget that they mom's is on drugs

Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear mom, how you doin? (how you doin?)
I'm just writing (I'm just writing)
to see if you're alright
Dear mom
