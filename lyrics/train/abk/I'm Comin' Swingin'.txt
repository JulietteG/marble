this time im coming swinging with my hatchet high,
im bout to let it loose 'cuze its do or die
go ahead spread the word ABK done lost his mind now he's disturbing the peace
hey i dont give a shit, ima let it be known and ima let it be shown
mother fucker im grown, ima swing if i want to and you cant stop me.
its to weak to do if your weak and sloopy, put your fists up 
swing em till somebody drops supersize a hater up with a orderin up the fries.
letem see just how we do, and whats its like havin somebody commin after you.

watchout tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin.

so im a physico i can deal with it, aint no thing 
its okay i agree i love bringin the pain, and im not the only one who loves they hatchet swingin it with profection with plenty of practice
im just a native who's out for a kill
its time to battle so understand it for real.
i dont think when it happens it just comes to me
and if i cant walk away i stand so i cant see.

when you step in the ring ready to do your thing  come swingin what come swingin,
if they love to talk cuz a fight wat they want come swingin what come swingin,

watchout tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin.

the hatchet warrior yet another physciopath known to kill anyone in his way.

sharp like an axe yet swift on my feet, bone to come home with my animal like instincts 
night crawlin till you watch your health, im the sound that you hear when your by yourself.
like a killer on the streats IB thats me.
commin hotter than the sun cuz im hotter than the sun. 
cuz im bringin the heat, so if your rollin with me come on, its time to get the show on, and bring it to these mother fuckers that actin there so grown,break them down like sum baggies of blue weed.
and tell them the way they was is so in the defeat.
put it out there show that its known that the hatchet better ome swingin or go home.

watchout tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin.
tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no let everybody you no tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin 
tell everybody you no this time im commin swingin.---Lyrics submitted by shelby bland.
