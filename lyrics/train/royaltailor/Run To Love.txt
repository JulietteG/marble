You hide secrets in your sleeves
You hope that no one else will ever see
The truth is everyone has scars
It doesnt matter who you are
Heartbreaks got you on the move
Tell me, wheres it taking you

(Chorus)
Run, run, run to love
Run to love
Cause love, love waits for us
Waits for us with open arms
Run to love

Always trying to impress your friends
Intoxicated by adrenaline
Youre racing down a dead end road
We all know how that story goes
You live like theres nothing left to lose
What if that isnt true

Come closer now
And hear the sound
Loves calling out---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
