I stay out too late
Got nothing on my brain
That's what people say
That's what people say

Go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
That's what people say
That's what people say

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Heart breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, Shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
That's all that they see
That's all that they see

I'm dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go
And that's all that they know
That's all that they know

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off

I, I, I shake it
Shake, shake, shake it
Shake, shake, shake it
Shake, shake it

Shake it
Shake, shake, shake it
Shake, shake, shake it
Shake, shake it
Let me see you shake it now

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off

Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off---
