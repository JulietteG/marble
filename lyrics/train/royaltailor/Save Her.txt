Night time comes, she's sitting there
All alone, she's all alone.
Thinks of love, that's just a word,
That people say, but not to her.
Loves not for her.

So what will it take, how long will we wait,
Can you feel the tears run down her face,
Haunted by mistakes, silently she waits, for love.
For love.

So tell her she can live, tell her he forgives,
Point her to the cross by how you live.
you can be the change, you can lead the way, to love.
To love.

And save her,
Save her,
Save her (x2)

Save her.

Locked away, lost in her pain,
No escape, no hope for change,
God is love is just a phrase, it doesn't mean, anything
Anything.

Night time comes, she's sitting there
All alone, she's all alone.
Thinks of love, that's just a word,
That people say, but not to her.
Loves not for her.

So what will it take, how long will we wait,
Can you feel the tears run down her face,
Haunted by mistakes, silently she waits, for love.
For love.

So tell her she can live, tell her he forgives,
Point her to the cross by how you live.
You can be the change, you can lead the way, to love.
To love.

And save her,
Save her,
Save her (x2)

Save her.

Oh-Ohhhh-Oh (x2)

La-La-La-Di-Da-Ta, La-La-Di-Da-Ta,
La-La-La-Di-Da-Ta, La-La-Ah-Yeahh,
La-La-La-Di-Da-Ta, La-La-Di-Da-Ta,

So what will it take, how long will we wait,
You can be the change, you can lead the way, to love.
To love!

And save her,
Save her,
Save her (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
