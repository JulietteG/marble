I know youre feeling weighted down 
Its all on your shoulders 
I know the dreams in your head 
Dont look any closer 

But Im gonna make you stronger 
Hold on just a little bit longer 
Cause Ill be there 
When you feel like youre going under 
Im gonna be there for you 
Yeah yeah 

The sky could fall 
The ground could shake 
The stars burn out 
And seasons change 
The time will pass 
And beauty fade 
But all my love will remain 
All my love will remain
All my love will remain

When theres a secret to tell 
Its locked and Ill keep it close 
And when youre walking through fire 
Ill take you to streets of gold 

Yeah Im gonna make you stronger 
Hold on just a little bit longer 
Cause Ill be there 
When you feel like youre going under 
Im gonna be there for you  
Yeah yeah 

The sky could fall 
The ground could shake 
The stars burn out 
And seasons change 
The time will pass 
And beauty fade 
But all my love will remain 
All my love will remain
All my love will remain 

And when the world all around you feels out of place 
You cant seem to find a familiar face 
Im here to remind you my love remains 
And you know 

The sky could fall 
The ground could shake 
The stars burn out 
And seasons change 
The time will pass 
And beauty fade 
But all my love will remain 
All my love will remain
All my love will remain---
