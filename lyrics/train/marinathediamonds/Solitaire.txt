Dont wanna talk anymore
Im obsessed with silence
I go home and I lock my door
I can hear the sirens
I see buildings and bars from the window
And I listen to the wind blow
I see people and cars covered in gold
And Im happy to be on my own

Hard like a rock, cold like a stone
White like a diamond, black like coal
Cut like a jewel, yeah I repair
Myself when youre not there
Solitaire
Something you consider
Rare
I dont wanna be compared
With that cheap shimmer + glitter
Solitaire

Im in love with ice blue grey skies of england
Ill admit all I wanna do is get drunk and silent
Watch my life unfold all around me
Like a beautiful garden
I see flowers so tall they surround me
Oh my heart, it became so hardened

Hard like a rock, cold like a stone
White like a diamond, black like coal
Cut like a jewel, yeah I repair
Myself when youre not there

Solitaire
Something you consider
Rare
I dont wanna be compared
With that cheap shimmer + glitter
Solitaire

And all the other jewels around me
They astounded me at first
I covered up my heart in boundaries
And all the fakes they called me cursed
But Im not cursed, Im not cursed
I was just covered in the dirt

Solitaire
Something you consider
Rare
I dont wanna be compared
With that cheap shimmer + glitter
Solitaire---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
