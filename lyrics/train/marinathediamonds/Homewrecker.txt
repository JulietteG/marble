Every boyfriend is the one
Until otherwise proven
The good are never easy
The easy never good
And love it never happens like you think it really should

Deception and perfection are wonderful traits
One will breed love
The other hate
You'll find me in the lonely hearts
Under 'I'm after a brand new start'

And I don't belong to anyone

They call me Homewrecker
Homewrecker
They call me Homewrecker
Homewrecker

Girls and their curls and their gourmet vomit
Boys and their toys and their six inch rockets
We're all very lovely 'til we get to know each other
As we stop becoming friends and we start becoming lovers

And I don't belong to anyone

They call me Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
They call me Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I broke a million hearts just for fun)
They call me Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
They call me Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I broke a million hearts just for fun)

I'm only happy when I'm on the run
I break a million hearts just for fun
I don't belong to anyone

I guess you could say that my life's a mess
But I'm still looking pretty in this dress
I'm the image of deception

When everything is life and death
You may feel like there's nothing left
Instead of love and trust and laughter
What you get is happy never after
But deep down all you want is love
The pure kind we all dream of
But we cannot escape the past
So you and I will never last

'Cause I'm a Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
'Cause I'm a Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I broke a million hearts just for fun)
'Cause I'm a Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
'Cause I'm a Homewrecker
Homewrecker (I broke a million hearts just for fun)
'Cause I'm a Homewrecker
Homewrecker---
