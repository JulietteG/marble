Couldnt relax
Couldnt sit back
And let the sunlight
In my lap

I sang a hymn
To bring me peace
And then it came
A melody

It felt so sweet
It felt so strong
It made me feel like
I belonged

And all the sadness inside me
Melted away
Like I was free

I found what Id been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be
Happy, Happy

Dont go out
much at all
Ive never been
the type to call

I realise to be happy
Maybe I need
a little company

So now you know
you know it all
That Ive been
desperately alone

I havent found the one for me
But I believe in divinity

I found what Id been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be
Happy, Happy

I believe in possibility
I believe someones watching over me
And finally I have found a way to be
Happy, Happy

From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness it followed me

I believe in possibility
I believe someones watching over me
And finally I have found a way to be
Happy, Happy---
