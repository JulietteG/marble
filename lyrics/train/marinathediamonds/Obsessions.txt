Sunday, wake up, give me a cigarette.
Last nights love affair is looking vulnerable in my bed
Silk sheet, blue dawn, Colgate, tongue warm
Wont you quit your crying? I cant sleep
One minute Im a little sweetheart
And next minute you are an absolute creep

Weve got obsessions
I want to wipe out all the sad ideas that come to me when I am holding you
Weve got obsessions
All you ever think about are sick ideas involving me, involving you

Supermarket, what packet of crackers to pick?
Theyre all the same, one brand, one name, but really theyre not
Look, look, just choose something quick
People are staring, time to come quick in
Skins are on fire; just choose something, something, something
Pressure overwhelming 
Next minute I am turning out of the door, facing one week without food
A day, a day when things are pretty bad
Dont let it make you feel sad, the crackers were probably bad luck anyway
Cant let your cold heart be free
When you act like youve got an OCD

Weve got obsessions
I want to erase every nasty thought that bugs me every day of every week
Weve got obsessions
You never tell me what it is that makes you strong and what it is that makes you weak.

Weve got obsessions
I want to erase every nasty thought that bugs me every day of every week.
Weve got obsessions
You never told me what it was that made you strong and what it was that made you weak
Makes you weak (we've got obsessions), makes you weak, make you weak (we've got obsessions), make you weak, make you weak
Make you

Sunday, wake up, give me a cigarette
Last nights love affair is looking vulnerable again
