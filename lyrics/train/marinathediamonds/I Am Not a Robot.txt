Youve been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside youre just a little baby, oh
Its okay to say youve got a weak spot
You dont always have to be on top
Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what youre not

Youre vulnerable, youre vulnerable
You are not a robot
Youre loveable so loveable
But youre just troubled
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot

Youve been hanging with the unloved kids
Who you never really liked and you never trusted
But you are so magnetic you pick up all the pins
Never committing to anything
You dont pick up the phone when it ring, ring, rings
Dont be so pathetic
Just open up and sing

Im vulnerable, Im vulnerable
I am not a robot
Youre loveable, so loveable
But youre just troubled
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot

Can you teach me how to feel, real?
Can you turn my power on?
Well let the drum beat drop
Guess what? I am not a robot
Guess what? I am not a robot

Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot 
Guess what? Im not a robot, a robot ---Lyrics submitted by Carira.
