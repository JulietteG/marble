Chorus 1:
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Have you lost your guts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Eating cigarette butts
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?

Verse:
Does your father beat you?
And your mother mistreat you?
And all your friends
They hate your guts
And you sit down to cry
And you're wondering why
And you say to yourself
"Am I, am I nuts?"

You lost your job
People call you a slob
And you mortgaged your house
To pay me
I'll keep you from the truth
That you squandered your youth
And by the time you're well
Well, you'll be eighty!

But then it doesn't matter
You'll sit in idle chatter
With roaches that crawl up the wall
You little booger
You're old and you're poor
And you live in the sewer
If you feel bad now
Give me a call

Chorus 2:
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Have you lost your guts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Eating cigarette butts
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?

Are you cracko? Are you cracko?
Are you wacko? Are you wacko?
Are you cracko? Are you cracko?
Are you insane?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Have you lost your guts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Eating cigarette butts

Bridge:
They're coming for me!
They're coming for me!
They're coming for me!
But they're never gonna get me!
No they're never gonna get me!
No they're never gonna get me!
Get your hands off of me!
No you're never gonna get me!
Get your hands off me!!

Chorus 3:
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Have you lost your guts?
Are you nuts, are you nuts?
Eating cigarette butts
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?

Are you cracko? Are you cracko?
Are you wacko? Are you wacko?
Are you cracko? Are you cracko?
Are you insane?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?
Why do you think you are nuts?---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Levy.
