Verse 1:
Cross out my eyes
Death doesn't die
Don't ask me why ask me why not
Everything doesn't die
Everything needs to die
Don't ask me why ask me why not

Pre-Chorus 1:
You can never read 
Your own obituary

Chorus:
Unbeing dead isn't being alive (Let's all die!)
Blackest black cause this light is too bright (Let's all die!)
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die (Let's all die!)
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die (Let's all die!)

Verse 2:
Don't believe in the up
I believe in the dirt
Don't ask me why, ask me why not.
No one really knows
Why they are alive
Until they know what they would die for. 

Pre-Chorus 2:
No reason to survive
No one gets out alive

Chorus:
Unbeing dead isn't being alive (Let's all die!)
Blackest black cause this light is too bright (Let's all die!)
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die (Let's all die!)
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die (Let's all die!)

Bridge:
Ladies and gentlemen,
The best day of my life 
Was the day I was born.
Because that was the day,
Because that was the day that I started dying. 

Chorus:
Unbeing dead isn't being alive (Let's all die!)
Blackest black cause this light is too bright (Let's all die!)
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die (Let's all die!)
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die
Let's all die (Let's all die!)---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Levy.
