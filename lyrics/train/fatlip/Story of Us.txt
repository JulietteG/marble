Because you just don't get it do you. 
You know thats alright though, one of these days you gon understand.
You gon understand.

Lonely cuz I'm the only one here
Hard to believe its been about a year
Since you've been out my life
My childrens moms no longer my wife
As i reflect in retrospect
i see we was incompatible and could not connect
Don't get me wrong the sex was perfect
But outside of that we lacked respect
For one another, even my own mother
Thought that you was the one for me
But there was a side she could not see

Listen girl it ain't all your fault
It take two to make it work
Yeah I been a dog, I been a jerk
I admit that, that's the past forget that
Lets sit back, have a mature little chit chat
No hard feelings or OJ killings
See we got feelings that's involved
Let me say what we do to get the problem solved

See who you wanna see (dont care)
Be what you gonna be (oh no)
Wear what you wanna wear (Yaow Yaow Yaow)
Baby I don't care
Just take care of these two
And I'll take care of you (do what you wanna do now)
So even though we're through 
We still can be cool (no no)

All the baby mama drama jump way play
Forget all the game this isn't an arcade
This is our lives
Even the memory's a history so lets put em in the archive
Even the memory's a history so lets put em in the archive
And stop
Trying to get me jealous 
Tellin me bout all the fellas 
That you see now that you single
Go 
Where you wanna go 
I'mma dip to the studio 
To make chips like pringles
Yo
I don't mind giving you a grip
Never greedy when you need me 
Sweety but don't trip
When I slide by to see my kids 
I wanna see nutritious food in the fridge
Fresh juices fruits and veggies
Not Mc Donalds and all that spaghetti
Yeah you got a steady career, great
But woman get your priorities straight

See who you wanna see (i dont care)
Be what you gonna be oh no
Wear what you wanna wear (dont care)
Baby I don't care
Just take care of these two
And I'll take care of you (oh)
So even though we're through 
We still can be cool (no no)

Pimpin ain't easy sippin isn't either
i never cup a breezy if she need a breather
i dont believe we the 
Only ones that be goin through this
Read a book said love don't truly exist 
Except in the context of exclusive sex
And when thats gone then your on to the next 
And then the next then the next
But with the kids its more complex
Wipe my eyes with the kleenex 
Then look on the bright side 
Cuz my boys is my pride and joy
So even though you annoy me and made me sad
You made me a dad
I can't be mad at you
Matter of fact, it's actually better this way
I don't got time to trip all day 
I'm trying to get paper in a major way
So baby when I see you all I gots to say is

See who you wanna see
(do what you wanna do)
Be what you gonna be
(live your own life)
Wear what you wanna wear
Baby I don't care (baby I don't care, AH)
Just take care of these two
And I'll take care of you (oh)
So even though we're through 
We still can be cool (no no)

See who you wanna see
Be what you gonna be
Wear what you wanna wear
Baby I don't care
Just take care of these two
And I'll take care of you
So even though we're through 
We still can be cool---Lyrics submitted by Li.
