One life is the way they live
Not far from a world of sin
Ride hard is the reason to
Live life with a fist of doom
No rest, no time, no fear
In the way they die
Last dance in the dead of night
A steel horse is what the henchmen ride

American bliss, American pride
In a world where they live and die
Respect for the members in
Their club when the henchmen ride

Forward, shifting gears
In the wind the henchmen ride
Engines roar with the energy
More miles and the wind and speed
Going fast is a way of life
Living life when the henchmen ride

Forward, shifting gears
In the wind the henchmen ride

Their brotherhood is blood
That's all they really need
Never asking for forgiveness
Their only love is life
Cause life is their machine
Riding hard is the future that they see
Freedom, rider, henchman, lifer

Forward, shifting gears
In the wind the henchmen ride

Ride

American bliss, American pride
In a world where the henchmen ride
Going fast is a way of life
No fear in the way they die

Forward, shifting gears
In the wind the henchmen ride---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
