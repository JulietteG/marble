Look outside
It's already light
And the stars ran away with the night
Things were said
Words that we'll try to forget
It's so hard to admit

I know we made mistakes
I see through all the tears 
And that's what got us here

If love is an ocean wide we'll swim in the tears we cried
They'll see us through to the other side
We're gonna make it
When love is a raging sea you can hold on to me
We'll find a way tonight
Love is an ocean wide

I'll stay right here
It's where I'll always belong
Inside with your arms
Days like this I wish the sun wouldn't set
I don't want to forget

What made us feel this way
You see through all my fears
And that's what got us here

If love is an ocean wide we'll swim in the tears we cried
They'll see us through to the other side
We're gonna make it
When love is a raging sea you can hold on to me
We'll find a way tonight
Love is an ocean wide 

Enough to forget
Even when we think we can't
Think we can't

Love is an ocean wide we'll swim in the tears we cried
They'll see us through to the other side
We're gonna make it
When love is a raging sea you can hold on to me
We'll find a way tonight
We'll find a way tonight
Love is an ocean wide
Love is an ocean wide---Lyrics submitted by Giann.
