When i'm feeling all alone
with so far to go
The signs are nowhere on this road
guiding me home
When the night is closing in
it's falling on my skin
Oh, God will you come close?

Light, light , light up the sky
light up the sky to show me
you are with me
I, I, I can't deny
No I can't deny that you are
right here with me
You've opened my eyes
So I can see you all around me
Light, light, light up the sky
light up the sky  to show me
that you are with me.

When stars are hiding in the clouds
I don't feel them shining
When I can't see beyond my doubts
the silver lining
When i've almost reached the edge
like a flood you're rushing in
Your love is rushing in.

Light, light, light up the sky
light up the sky to show me
you are with me
I, I, I can't deny 
No I can't deny that you are
right here with me
You've opened my eyes
So I can see you all around me
Light, light, light up the sky
light up the sky to show me
that you are with me.

So I run 
Straight into your arms
You're the brightened morning sun
To show your love
There's nothing you won't do.

Light, light, light up the sky
you light up the sky to show me
you are with me
I, I, I can't deny
No I can't deny that you are
rigt here with me
You've opened my eyes
So I can see you all around me
Light, light, light up the sky
light up the sky to show me
that you are with me
That you are with me
That you are with me.---Lyrics submitted by savannah.
