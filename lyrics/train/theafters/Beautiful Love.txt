Far away, I feel your beating heart 
All alone, beneath the crystal stars 
Staring into space, what a lonely face 
I'll try to find my place with you 

[chorus]
What a beautiful smile 
Can I stay for awhile? 
On this beautiful night 
We'll make everything right 
My beautiful love, my beautiful love 

Larger than the moon, my love for you 
Worlds collide as heaven pulls us through 
The secret of the world is written in the stars 
I'm carrying your heart in mine 

[chorus]
What a beautiful smile 
Can I stay for awhile? 
On this beautiful night 
We'll make everything right 
My beautiful love 

Maybe a greater thing will happen 
Maybe all will see 
Maybe our love will catch like fire 
As it burns through me 
[3x]

[chorus]

What a beautiful smile 
Can I stay for awhile? 
On this beautiful night 
We'll make everything right 
[2x]

My beautiful love 
La la la la love 
La la la la love 

My beautiful 
La la la la love 
La la la la love 

My beautiful love---Lyrics submitted by Jackie.
