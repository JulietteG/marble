I would kill a man down at the gas station for you.
I would kill your parents, and your baby sister too. 
I would rob a bank, take all of the cash.
Anything to be with you.

They can't take our love, It's all that we have.
Down the back road into the motel we will hide.
When we wake up there, In the sunlight
Everything will finally be alright.

So you go get your gun now, baby.
We could steal a car now, baby.
Let's keep running into the night is young.
So you go get your gun now, baby.
We could steal a car now, baby.
Let's keep running into the night is ours.

As the bullets fly, Shattering the glass.
I can feel your love, and I know it's gonna' last.
Through the smoke and fire, I can see your eyes.
Baby take my hand onto the other side. 

So you go get your gun now, baby.
We could steal a car now, baby.
Let's keep running into the night is young.
So you go get your gun now, baby.
We could steal a car now, baby.
Let's keep running into the night is ours.
