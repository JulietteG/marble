Now when it comes to fattening
There's no need for an end
And when it comes to herding my creations
I don't need a space pen

[CHORUS]
Sputnik, your theory
Alien, I creator

Everything started by me
It can end to begin
And it exploded into the cosmos from nothing but a clear night as I started it
Before infinity's infinite

[CHORUS]
Sputnik, your theory
Alien, I creator

Sunset mounts the rain
In the right place the sea
In the right time time time the stars
Are familiar before me
It was flying
It was flying
Would ultimate space be my replacing friend?
Ultimate knowlege theorizes null 
It dissolves before it begins

[CHORUS]
Sputnik, your theory---Lyrics submitted by Bustin Jieber.
