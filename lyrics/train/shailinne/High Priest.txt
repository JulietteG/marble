Verse 1

Theres commotion in my brain, strange is the notion
Words cannot explain my range of emotion
Im speechless, my flaws exposed and my weakness
Each breath draws me closer to a deep test
Its month number seven, its been ten days
Ive been awake all night reflecting on my ways
A threat to my peace in this greatest of moments
Because Im the High Priest and its the Day of Atonement
The LORD is so holy and perfect, Im nervous
Im floored that He chose me to worship through service
Dont ask me why the God who crafted the sky
Drafted this weak guy from the clan of Levi
Preceding generation taught me to read the regulations
Deep meditation on decreed revelation
Extreme trepidation breeds hesitation
Yet I must lead and be the representation
My occupation- to intercede for the nation
But indeed my own sins need expiation
The wrath of Jehovahs grim, sin is no joke to Him
The hope is slim for unholy men coming close to Him
Hes spoken in His Word the proper way of approach to Him
Nadab and Abihu got it wrong and He roasted them
These things I weigh as I sigh
This could either be the greatest day of my life or the day that I die!

Chorus
So you say that you wanna know the LORD?
Do you really wanna stand before the LORD?
Do you know what it takes to meet the LORD?
God is an all-consuming fire

So you say that you wanna know the LORD
Do you really wanna stand before the LORD?
Do you know what it takes to meet the LORD?
Be careful what you desire

Verse 2

For now, no time to focus on my sinning
I bathe in the laver though it seems extreme
I put on the holy coat made of white linen
Craving His favor- Im ceremonially clean
I check to inspect- no tangible faltering
Next I must collect the animals for the offering
A spotless ram and a bull- the components
God gives to make atonement for my own sins
This part of the ritual makes me real cautious
Because the very sight of blood makes me feel nauseous
Still I proceed by snatching him close, slashing his throat
when his blood splashed on my coat
Reacting, I choke- gasping thats when Im grasping
Gods reaction that sin provokes
I take a moment to reflect on the blood spilled in this
Staring at the goat to be sent into the wilderness
Ill confess Israels sins with my hands on his head
Symbolizing guilt transferred instead
to a substitute the living God provided and stamped
guilty of our sin, driven outside the camp
This beautiful picture of hope and grace motivates
And I dont want my fear to make this dope occasion go to waste
Change my outer garments, slow my pace- yo I brace
myself to stand before Jehovahs face in the Holy Place

Chorus
So you say that you wanna know the LORD?
Do you really wanna stand before the LORD?
Do you know what it takes to meet the LORD?
God is an all-consuming fire

So you say that you wanna know the LORD
Do you really wanna stand before the LORD?
Do you know what it takes to meet the LORD?
Be careful what you desire

Verse 3

The time has come, the great moment has arrived
About to enter in- what a lonely enterprise
Look at the other priests, they speak only with their eyes
Rope tied around my ankle just in case I dont survive
I enter through the first curtain to a dark room
Im standing in the Holy Place, my thoughts consumed
Im caught off guard, Im unraveling at this stage
My heartbeat so hard its rattling my ribcage
Feeling like Im disintegrating and I cant stand
Comforted by the light emanating from the lampstand
This helps my vision- I can see the showbread
I think of Gods provision, that helps me go ahead
I need courage to worship! Man, this is intense
I take burning coals off the altar for the incense
The sweet aroma fills the room
The smoke protects my eyes- one sight of Jehovah seals my doom
Its no mere coincidence Im here surrendering
With fear and trembling Im nearly entering
I feel like running scared, hoping Im not unprepared
Stunned with fear- no one comes in here but once a year
Nevertheless Im at the point of no return
Besides, I dont want my anointing to be spurned
After counting to three, next time I inhale
Im in the Holy of Holies beyond the veil!
The first thing I realize is Im thrilled that Ive
entered into Gods presence and yet Im still alive
Im awestruck by the weight of His terrible beauty
Its almost unbearable but I must fulfill my duty
Approach the ark, the first part of my works complete
when I sprinkle blood seven times on the mercy seat
Quickly I exit, impressed with the Hesed
that rescues the wretched and left us accepted!---Lyrics submitted by maui hausia.
