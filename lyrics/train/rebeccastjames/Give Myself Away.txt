I can't stay here anymore
There's no time for me to hideaway
Waste another day
But you oh Lord I can't ignore
Or the chance to know that I can change
Before it's too late

Here and now-I lay it all down
I take the road that leads to you
I won't look back, I won't turn around
I give myself away to you
Here and now-I lay it all down
I give myself away to you today

It's a mystery to me
How I'm tempted by the lies that shine
Make me blind
I try to run-try to flee
From the sin that's had me hypnotized
I've realized

Here and now-I lay it all down
I take the road that leads to you
I won't look back, I won't turn around
I give myself away to you
Here and now-I lay it all down
I give myself away to you today

I can't stay here anymore
There's no time for me to hideaway

Here and now-I lay it all down
I take the road that leads to you
I won't look back, I won't turn around
I give myself away to you
Here and now-I lay it all down
I give myself away to you today

(repeat)

I give myself away
I give myself away
I give myself away ---Lyrics submitted by Paule Quinones.
