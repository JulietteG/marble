Do you see me?
The questions in her eyes
Do you relate to the pain I cant disguise?
Oh, look beyond what you see
The outside is not all there is

Wont You tell me now when did I see
You in need of water?
Oh, and tell me now, when did I see You
Hungry on the street?
God, I hear You calling out to me
In the voices of the least of these
Calling me to reach beyond my world
To the beautiful stranger
Beautiful Stranger

He does not look like everyone else
Does not fit in anywhere I know
You ask me to be Your hands
And show him now that he is loved

Theres beauty that lies deep within
Waiting to be discovered
God help me see what You see
The diamond in the stone---Lyrics submitted by Bob.
