You ought to see my baby
You know that girl is so fine
She loves me in the morning and she loves me every evening
And she's always on my mind 
She got
Sugar-coated love, yeah sugar-coated love
She's a real-gone baby i don't mean maybe, she's mine

I don't have to worry 'bout money
I don't have to worry 'bout clothes 
I don't have to worry 'bout anything
 She's my baby
And goodness knows 
She got 
Sugar-coated love, yeah sugar-coated love
She's a real-gone baby i don't mean maybe, she's mine

Harp solo

You can take your pick of the others
You can take any one you may choose
I'm holding on to this baby of mine 
cause she got, what i can use 
And that's 
Sugar-coated love, yeah sugar-coated love
She's a real-gone baby i don't mean maybe, she's mine

You want to go to sugar-coated lovin' is
It's the best kinda lovin' they got
It's the kind of love make the old feel young, and make the north pole hot, 
And that's 
Sugar-coated love, yeah sugar-coated love
She's a real-gone baby i don't mean maybe, she's mine---Lyrics submitted by Little Silas.
