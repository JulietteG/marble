Lisa, one more time for old time's sake
Come save me, from this crazy world I'm in
My dreams are weak and falling into this hole inside my bed
Where the pieces of this life we put together
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes

Lisa, you're the dancer to the song
Without your music, all the words just seem so wrong
And like a picture you keep fading, your colors running dry
Save the pieces of this life we put together

Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?

Oh, won't you save a place for me tonight
Find a space for me and light this corner of my lonely life

Lisa, my beginning and my end
I need ya
You're my lover and my friend
My future would be brighter if you'd
Only answer yes
And help me put these pieces back
Together
Can't you see it in my eyes
And won't you save a place for me
Tonight
Find a space for me and light
This corner of my lonely life---Lyrics submitted by Eugene Schlick.
