You're the lucky one
So i've been told
As free as the wind,
Blowin' down the road
Loved by many, hated by none
I'd say you're lucky 'cause I know what you've done
Not a care in the world
Not a worry in sight
Everything's gonna be alright
Cause you're the lucky one

You're the lucky one
Always havin' fun
A jack of all trades a master none
You look at the world with a smilin' eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by

Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one.

Well you're blessed i guess
By never knowing which road your choosin.
To you the next best thing
To playin and winning is playin and losing

You're the lucky one i know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how
You look at the world thru your smilin' eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by

Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one

Well you're blessed i guess
By never knowing which road your choosin.
To you the next best thing
To playin and winning is playin and losing

You're the lucky one i know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how
No matter where you're at, it's where you'll be
You can bet your luck won't follow me
Just give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one. ---Lyrics submitted by Lisa.
