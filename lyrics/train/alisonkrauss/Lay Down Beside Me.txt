John Waite:]
I've spent my life lookin for you
And findin' my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

So lay down beside me
And love me and hide me 
And kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
And hold me so close that I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away

[Alison Krauss:]
Mornings and evenings all were the same
I heard no music til I heard your name
I knew when I saw you smile
And now I can rest for a while

[Together:]
So lay down beside me 
Love me and hide me
And kiss all the hurtin' 
Of this world away
Hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away

And hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away

[she hums]
he sings
'Til I feel your heart beat---Lyrics submitted by Jeanni.
