Way back in the mountains
Way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer
They called him Fiddlin' Will
Now he could play most anything
And some say he could sing
But the one thing that he liked to best
Was sawing on the strings

So get out the fiddle and rosin up the bow
Look at ole Will a pattin' his toe
We'll make music 'til the rafters ring
Old man pickin' sawin' on the strings

When the neighbors had a shindig
And they all had vittles to eat
We'd always have to wait on Will
For the frolic to be complete
When comes down from the mountain
All the gals begin to sway
Sometimes he'd pick that old five string
Until the break of day

So tune up the five string, tighten up the hide
Tell all the young folks to get inside
We'll make music 'til the rafers ring
Old man pickin' and sawin' on the strings

So tune up the five string, tighten up the hide
Tell all the young folds to get inside
We'll make music 'til the rafters ring
Old man pickin' and sawin' on the strings---Lyrics submitted by Carla.
