I shook your hand and I wished you well,
I never knew you'd go to heaven through hell,
Did the last days come to you fast or slow,
Were you with somebody or were you alone?

Where are you now, are you lost, are you found,
Did somebody come and put your body in the ground,
Did somebody hurt you, no one will tell,
Is your head in the clouds, are you under a spell?

Did somebody trick your your mind, did you trust in someone,
Only just to find you can trust in no one,
In the end,
Is your mind at ease is your heart in whirl,
Did you give it all up for the love of a girl,
In the end.

Did you lose your head in a hospital bed,
Wake up to find you'd be better off dead,
Are you you lost at sea, are you buried in the sand?
Did you call out for me, did somebody hold your hand?

Were you sickened and saddened by the faces you see,
Frightened and maddened by the places you've been,
did you just drop out, did you split the seam,
Did you think hard enough about what that would mean?

Did somebody trick your your mind, did you trust in someone,
Only just to find you can trust in no one,
In the end,
Is your mind at ease is your heart in whirl,
Did you give it all up for the love of a girl,
In the end.---Lyrics submitted by Grim.
