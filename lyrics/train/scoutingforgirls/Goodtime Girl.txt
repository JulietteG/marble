No one knew your name or cared at school
Everybody knows the kids are cruel
You went from troubled teen and became a beauty queen
I got mixed up somewhere in between

Now Im losing, Im losing, my mind, yeah Im losing
My mind is missing, presumed lost
Now Im losing, Im losing, my mind, yeah Im losing
Dont want you back, no matter what

Woah
Everybody wants to know your name now baby
All I want to do is to forget (to forget)
Everybody wants to know your name now angel
All I want to do is to forget 

You took me in and shook me up inside
You got the stuff, the stuff that drives me wild
But you wanted headlines, you wanted bright lights
I was just your cheap and easy ride

Now Im losing, Im losing, my mind, yeah Im losing
My mind is missing, presumed lost
Now Im losing, Im losing, my mind, yeah Im losing
Dont want you back, no matter what

Woah
Everybody wants to know your name now baby
All I want to do is to forget (to forget)
Everybody wants to know your name now angel
All Ive got are reasons to forget

Shes cool, shes cruel
And thats how you fall under the spell of a goodtime girl (you got a goodtime girl)
Shes keen, shes mean
Who knows where shes been? Is this farewell to the goodtime girl? (you want a goodtime girl)

Im losing, Im losing, my mind, yeah Im losing
My mind is missing, presumed lost

Woah
Shes cool, shes cruel
And thats how you fall under the spell of a goodtime girl (you got a goodtime girl)
Shes keen, shes mean
Who knows where shes been? Is this farewell to the goodtime girl?

All I want
Shes cool, shes cruel
And thats how you fall under the spell of a goodtime girl (you got a goodtime girl)
Shes keen, shes mean
Who knows where shes been? Is this farewell to the goodtime girl? (you want a goodtime girl)
(x2)
Now Im losing, Im losing, my mind, yeah Im losing
Under the spell to the good time girl
(x2)
