Black...Cat
Black...Cat 
Black...Cat
Black...Cat

All the lonely nights
I spend alone,
Never 'round to hug me
You're always gone.

Cause you hangin' out
Breakin' the rules
Oh the man is comin'
Looking for you

(You're a rebel now) Don't give a damn
(Always carryin' on) With the gang
(While tryin' to tell ya boys) It's a mistake
(You won't realize) 'Til it's too late

(CHORUS)
Don't understand
Why you
Insist
Always of living such a dangerous life
Time after time
You stay
Away
And I just know that you are telling me lies

Black Cat
Nines lives
Short days 
Long nights 
Livin' on the edge 
Not afraid to die

Heartbeat
Real strong
But not
For long
Better watch ya step
Or ya gonna die

You're so together boy
But just at a glance
You'll do anything
To give it a chance

Skimmin', plannin' lies
To get what you need
So full of promises
That you neva keep

(Don't you tell yo self) That it's ok
(Sick and tired of) All of yo games
(And you won't even stay) All that will change
(Makes no sense to me) Your crazy ways

Don't understand
Why you
Insist
Always on living such a dangerous life
Time after time
You stay
Away
And I just know that you are telling me lies

Not afraid to die-ie-ie
GUITAR!

Black Cat

Black Cat
I don't even understand your ways
Livin' on the edge

(CHORUS)
Don't understand
Why you
Insist
Always of living such a dangerous life
Time after time
You stay
Away
And I just know that you are telling me lies

Black Cat
Nines lives
Short days 
Long nights 
Livin' on the edge 
Not afraid to die

Heartbeat
Real strong
But not
For long
Better watch ya step
Or ya gonna die

Black Cat
Nine lives
Short days
Long nights
Livin' on the edge 
Not afraid to die

Heartbeat 
Real strong
But not 
For long 
Better watch ya step
Or ya gonna die---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
