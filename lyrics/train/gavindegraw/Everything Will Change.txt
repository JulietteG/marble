Take those boots off the shelf
Wipe that dust of yourself
Even if youve been through hell; youre back
Its time to separate the men from the boys
And the women from the girls
And the tools from the toys
Even if youre freaking out: just relax

Hey, before it gets too late
Before the night is over, before the worlds awake
Everything will change
Hey, I feel it coming on
Starting like a fire, tonight you lit the flame
Now everything will change

Back when it used to hurt
Took you a little while just to find the words
Losing, well, it sometimes burns, but you keep moving on
Youve got to grow strong like youre leading the nation
Got to make the best out of this situation
Get your hands up like its a celebration
And you keep moving on

Singing hey, before it gets too late
Before the night is over, before the worlds awake
Everything will change
Hey, I feel it coming on
Starting like a fire, tonight you lit the flame
Now everything will change

(ooooooh)
Now everything will change
(ooooooh)
Everything will change
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you cant walk the walk-walk)

Take those boots off the shelf
Wipe that dust of yourself
Even if youve been through hell; youre back

Hey, before it gets too late
Before the night is over, before the worlds awake
Everything will change
Hey, I feel it coming on
Starting like a fire, tonight you lit the flame
Now everything will change

Itll change
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you cant walk the walk-walk)
If you dont try
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you cant walk the walk-walk)
Itll change
(you can talk the talk-talk, but you cant walk the walk-walk) ---
