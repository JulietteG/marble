I know you got a wild side that I dont wanna hold back
And everyone I ever had, was just from being stupid and
I was standing on the edge, We've never been here before
So are gonna give in? What happens if we fall

Who's gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight
whos gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight
And were too cool with this
But its just shun to fight
So tell me who's gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight

Pop takes a president, its a building a wall
I got me own line of defense, somehow you broke through it all
At the bottom of an empty bottle, its where the truth starts to spill
Don't wanna wake up with regret
From this feeling that we can count

Who's gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight
whos gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight
And were too cool with this
But its just shun to fight
So tell me who's gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight

See, and believe, youre making me breath
Deeper than the ocean
Personas, who can we call
But risking what we have, it;s something more
Dont wanna lose it all

Who's gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight
whos gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight

We've been way too cool with this
But these words too hard to find
Should we stop, should we wait
If it was too late, to be stopped, to be wait
Before its too late

Tell me who's gonna save, who's gonna save us tonight, tonight---
