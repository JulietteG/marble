How many roads did I travel
Before I walked down one that led me to You?
How many dream did unravel
Before I believed in a hope that was true?
How long? How far?
What was meant to fulfill only emptied me still
And all You ever wanted

[chorus]
Only me on my knees
Singing holy, holy
And somehow
All that matters now is
You are holy, holy

How many deaths did I die
Before I was awakened to new life again?
How many half truths did I bear witness toTil the proof was disproved in the end?  How long? How far?
What was meant to illuminate shadowed me still

And all You ever wanted
[chorus]
And all I have is gratitude to offer You

somehow all that matters now 
is you are holy

you are holy, holy
somehow all that matters 
now is you are holy,holy

Only me on my knees
Singing holy, holy
And somehow
All that matters now is
You are holy, holy
