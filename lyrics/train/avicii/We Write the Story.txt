Justice and peace 
And liberty 
We write the story 
We can fulfill 
The legacy 
We write the song 

Welcome a new 
Enlightenment 
We write the story 
We can recast 
And reinvent 
We write the song 

We are humans 
Born free and equal 
On this mother 
Lies our future 
Reason and conscience 
May they rule the 
World one day 

Justice and peace 
And liberty 
We write the story 
We can fulfill 
The legacy 
We write the song 

True to the ones 
Who lit the light 
We write the story 
We have a torch 

To reignite 
We write the song 

Welcome a new 
Enlightenment 
Welcome the glory 
We can recast 
And reinvent 
We can be strong 

We have a choice 
In everything 
We write the story 
We have a voice 
And words to sing 
We write the song 

We are humans 
Born free and equal 

On this mother 
Lies our future 
We are keepers 
Reason and conscience 
May they rule the 
World one day 

Justice and peace 
And liberty 
We write the story 
We can fulfill 
The legacy 
We write the song 

True to the ones 
Who lit the light 
We write the story 
We have a torch 
To reignite 
We write the song 

Welcome a new 
Enlightenment 
Welcome the glory 
We can recast 
And reinvent 
We can be strong 

We have a choice 
In everything 
We write the story 
We have a voice 
And words to sing 
We write the song 

Free and equal 
Reason and conscience 
We are humans 
We are 
One ......---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
