Yea, story goes
He went down to the cross roads
He sat down, and kept his eyes closed
Well, everyone has a price, child
And what it cost him
Was his soul

You think your getting away
No escaping the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Brought the devil back anyway
So now now who do you blame?
Should have listened to what I say
What I say, what I say, yea

I don't know if I'll be coming
Home again, home again
No, I don't know if I'll be coming home
It's a long road to hell we have no soul

Just when you think your getting away
No escaping the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Brought back the devil back anyway
Oh now now who do you blame?
Should have listened to what I say
What I say, what I say, yea

What's left to tell ya
It's a long road to hell you have no soul---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
