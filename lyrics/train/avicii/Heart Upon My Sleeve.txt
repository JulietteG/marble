With my heart upon my sleve
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Down upon my knees
With my head down low I and I still feel broken

Where are you? where are you?
I know that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down

Wooohh ohhh ohhh ohhh

I guess I'm just down I'd like some b**ch to get me out of here! (x2)

With my heart upon my sleve
With my head down low and I still feel broken.

Down upon my knees
With my head down low I and I still feel broken.

Where are you? where are you?
I know that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
