Hope there's someone
who'll take care of me.
When I die, will I go?

And hope there's someone,
who'll set my heart free.
Rest alone when I'm tired.

There's a ghost on the horizon,
when I go to bed.
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

And that sin,
I don't want to go,
to the seals of war through shame.

And there's a ghost on the horizon,
when I go to bed.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
