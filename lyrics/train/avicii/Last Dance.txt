If this is our last, last dance
move a bit closer, just let it take over
And if this is our final chance
lets make it worth it and dance until we stop the world

If this is our last, last dance
move a bit closer, just let it take over
And if this is our final chance
lets make it worth it and dance until we stop the world

If this is our last, last dance
move a bit closer, just let it take over
And if this is our final chance
lets make it worth it and dance until we stop the world

If this is our last, last dance
move a bit closer, just let it take over
And if this is our final chance
lets make it worth it and dance until we stop the world

If this is our last, last dance
move a bit closer, just let it take over
And if this is our final chance
lets make it worth it and dance until we stop the world---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
