A moment in history
That's what you mean to me
Into the witching hour
Where only your special power
Can make any blue sky rain
Or keep everything the same
Here's what I want to do
I want to make love to you
Oh...I want to love you all night long
Oh...I want to love you all night long
As long as we have tonight
For this I would sacrifice
Everything that I own
And all that I've ever known
Don't let this moment by
Now that you're deep inside
You'll make all my dreams come true
If I should make love to you
Yo sigo pensando en ti
Y yo morire por ti
Tu nunca encontraras
Alguien que te quiera mas---
