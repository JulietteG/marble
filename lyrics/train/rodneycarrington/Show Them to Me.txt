Well it seems to me that this whole worlds gone crazy
Theres to much hate and killin goin on
But when i see the bare chest of a woman
My worrys and my problems are all gone
No one thinks of fightin, when they see a topless girl
Baby if you would show yours too, we could save the world

Show them to me, show them to me
Unclasp your bras and set those puppies free
They'd look a whole lot better without that sweater baby i'm sure you'll agree
If you got, two fun bags,
Show them to me

I don't care if they don't match or if ones bigger than the other
You could show me one, and i'll imagine the other
Even if your really old, theres nothing wrong
Don't be sad your boobs ain't bad, there just a little long

Show them to me, show them to me
Lift up your shirt and let the whole world see
Just this row, show your globes and a happy man i'll be
If you got, those chi chi's,
Show them to me

I've met a lot of them, but never one i hated
Even if you had thirteen kids and you think they look deflated
Theres no such thing as a bad breast, i belive this much is true
If your a big fat man im a titty fan and i'd love to see yours toooo

Show them to me, show them to me
Just like the girls gone wild on t.v.
Just lean back and show your rack and i'll be in ecstasy
If you got two casabas
Show them to me

All the world will live in harmony
It'll do ya good, it'll give me wood, we'll make history
If you love your country, i'm gonna say it one more time,
I said if you love your country 
Then stand up and show them big old tittie to meeee---Lyrics submitted by Sammie.
