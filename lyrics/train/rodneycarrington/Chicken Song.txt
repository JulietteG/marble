I like my women like I like my chicken 
With a little bit of fat on the ends 
Not too much and not too little 
Just enough to make me grin 

When I see a little woman walkin' down the street 
She ain't my type, I need a little more meat 
She's skinny, and not my cup of tea---Lyrics submitted by Karrie.
