darling when we met
you were a pretty little thing
but your body started changing
when i gave you that ring


you're supersizing, no exercizing
goodbye working out, a doubble meat with cheese,
another helping please, baby thats what you're all about
i'd pick you up in my pick up truck
but you had to ride in the back.
i'd stopped off at the sonnet burger,
you ate everything in my sack.
darling please, wont you please think of me
i'd love to have my baby back
(baby back) my baby back, (baby back)
my baby back, (baby back)


six months have passed and you gain fifty pounds
and i confece you got a real bid rack
but the bad part is when i give you a hug
you got two more on your back


you're supersizing, no exercizing
good bye working out, a doubble meat with cheese,
another helping please, baby thats what you're all about
i'd play football with the boys last night
you were all time quarterback
but none of us can ever tackle you
cause you're built like a lumberjack
darling please, wont you please think of me
i'd love to have my baby back
(baby back), put down them ribs, (baby back),
my baby back, (baby back), my baby come back to meeee, yeah

      BABY WONT YOU COME ON BACK.---Lyrics submitted by jerson.
