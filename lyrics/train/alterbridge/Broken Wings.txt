(Part 1)
Fight the fight alone
When the world is full of victims
Dims a fading light
In our souls

   Leave the peace alone
   How we all are slowly changing
   Dims a fading light
   In our souls

Bridge:
In my opinion seeing is to know
The things we hold
Are always first to go
And who's to say
We won't end up alone

Chorus:
On broken wings I'm falling
And it won't be long
The skin on me is burning
By the fires of the sun
   On skinned knees
   I'm bleeding
   And it won't be long
  I've got to find that meaning
   I'll search for so long

(Part 2)
Cry ourselves to sleep
We will sleep alone forever
Will you lay me down
In the same place with all I love

  Mend the broken homes
  Care for them they are our brothers
  Save the fading light in our souls

Bridge:
In my opinion seeing is to know
What you give
Will always  carry you
And who's to say
We won't survive it too

{To Chorus}

Set a-free all
Relying on their will
To make me all that I am
And all that I'll be
Set a-free all
Will fall be tween the cracks
With memories of all that I am
And all that I'll be

{To Chorus}---Lyrics submitted by Febbie.
