I am not alone
I live with the memories regret is my home
This is my true freedom
Express all the feelings of what I've become
I watch the rising sun
I hope I find some peace today

It seems I've gone away
It seems I've lost myself
It seems I've really lost my way
It seems I've lost myself
It seems I've

Shed my skin
Oh are you ready for me
Or purge my love
Oh Are you ready for me

A bitter sinking feeling
Awake to the fact there's no going back
To the world in which I was living
I'm searching for something but found less than nothing
I watch the rising sun
I hope I find some peace today

It seems I've gone away
It seems I've lost myself
It seems I've really lost my way
It seems I've lost myself
It seems I've

Shed my skin
Oh are you ready for me
Or purge my love
Are you ready for me
Yeah cause I'm dying to feel
What I have lost
Oh and what I was

All my life I've waited
Endless days have taken taken
What made me free
Years have gone
I'm broken
Left the past unspoken
Those years
Oh they haunt me still

Shed my skin
Oh are you ready for me
Or purge my love
Oh are you ready for me 
And shed my skin---Lyrics submitted by Urgen.
