Part 1:
Thanks for all you've done
I've missed you for so long
I can't believe you're gone
   You still live in me
   I feel you in the wind
   You guide me constantly

Bridge:
I've never knew what it was to be alone, no
Cause you were always there for me
You were always there waiting
And ill come home and I miss your face so
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see

Chorus:
And I know, you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight cause it comforts me

Part 2:
I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of
The one that was so true
   Your were as kind as you could be
   And even though you're gone
   You still mean the world to me

Bridge:
I've never knew what it was to be alone, no
Cause you were always there for me
You were always there waiting
But now I come home and it's not the same, no
It feels empty and alone
I can't believe you're gone

{To Chorus}

I'm glad he set you free from sorrow
I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you will be here with me still
   And what you did you did with feeling
   And You always found the meaning
   And you always will
   And you always will
   And you always will
   Ooo's
