And to the ones in which we sing,
we are honored you let us in

I remember the thoughts of many things,
of the glory that you bring

I was never the right one
to dare to dream, Its funny what this life
has done to me, now

You were always the only,
To help me see there was a road I must find,		
A road that was mine.

But Im down to my last,
Im standing here alone
looking back, on it all

But Im down to my last,
Im ready but Im wrong,
and Im blind to it all

And to the world to which we sing,
want to try to do us in,

I remember your name
and I know you face
Cant forgive and cant erase

I was never the right one
To bear the weight of 
something fuelled by words
Id learn to hate

You were always the only 
to help me see that to 
love is to shine
In your world, blind

But Im down to my last,
Im standing here alone
looking back, on it all

But Im down to my last,
Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im right, to it all

Solo.......
Down To My Last

And to the ones in which we sing,
we are honored you let us in

I remember the thoughts of many things,
of the glory that you bring

I was never the right one
to dare to dream, Its funny what this life
has done to me, now

You were always the only,
To help me see there was a road I must find,		
A road that was mine.

But Im down to my last,
Im standing here alone
looking back, on it all

But Im down to my last,
Im ready but Im wrong,
and Im blind to it all

And to the world to which we sing,
want to try to do us in,

I remember your name
and I know you face
Cant forgive and cant erase

I was never the right one
To bear the weight of 
something fuelled by words
Id learn to hate

You were always the only 
to help me see that to 
love is to shine
In your world, blind

But Im down to my last,
Im standing here alone
looking back, on it all

But Im down to my last,
Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im right, to it all

Solo.......

But Im down to my last
Well Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im scared of it all

But Im down to my last
Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im blind, to it all

But Im down to my last
Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im blind to it all.

But Im down to my last
Well Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im scared of it all

But Im down to my last
Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im blind, to it all

But Im down to my last
Im ready but Im wrong,
And Im blind to it all.---Lyrics submitted by Rob.
