the tumble taxis, headlights on
are rumbling down this hill at dusk
as under my tree, 
evening and me
watch my in-law family moving home
from the mosque

my honey's shoulders are coming clear
behind the line of black robes flapping
and i believe ....

shuffle by my door at dawn
wake the face with cold water
we bathe with only flip-flops on
my family and their in-law daughter
and I believe 
     hear
yes, i believe
     hear

their smiling shines behind their veils
as, pale as I, the new moon rises
greeting evening and me
under my tree
"Come and see our surprises!

We'll help you to grow nice and fat
that baby needs your body bigger
and when you go, remember Africa
war or weather, we're here

for the generations are rising
by the guidance of our hands
mother magic ties us together, oh."

here
here
here
here

a tumble taxi waited 
as a mother-in-law said,
"take your time,
take the later bus instead."
she slowly sat before us
and she fixed us with her eyes
and in them shone the sunrises
of twenty-five-thousand skies

and i believe
yes i believe
and i believe
and i believe

she said, "there's no such thing
as a lazy man.
we've all our place in the plan.
no honor more important
than the honor due to love
for the generations are rising
by the guidance of our hands
mother magic ties us together, oh"

for the generations are rising
by the guidance of our hands
mother magic ties us together, oh"---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
