light of the rising sun
fell all around him
what would become?
how would the wood
he was holding, sing a song?

patched up in pieces with glue
a string strung along it
it took a man with a horn
and a stubborn eye
to divine the coming of a melody

now move your mind
to the heat in that room
long after midnight
rhythm and wine
the language of a line
he had never heard before

fire behind that club door
a shimmering vision
it took a man with a horn
and a stubborn eye
to divine the coming of a melody
the sweet and steady coming
of a melody

there, under the light 
of a million stars
like a telegraph, 
the music dancing
through their fingers
from far away

could they be stars?
could the blanket up above them
be the Yaounde sky?
or could they be lights
like an echo of manhattan
in an African night?

butterfly on bass

far and wide 
spread the lights of LA
miles lie behind him
his daughters play
a wish upon a star
comes a singing to his ear

oh to remember those days
horizons expanding
it took a man with a horn 
and a stubborn eye
to divine the coming of a melody
the sweet and steady
coming of a melody---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
