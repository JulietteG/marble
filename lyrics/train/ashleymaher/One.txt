Im dream dancing at twilight
with the moon on dewy breath
my head is wrapped with sundown
between this life 
and the kiss of death

were rising like a campfire flame
and its in the name of the sun
when we are summoned to come
all we hear is, one.

when the big big day begins
the dawn will never need break
and all this talk talk talk 
of grace and sin
will up and fly away

chorus
all I hear is one

Im dream dancing at twilight
no flowers in my hair
my food is only music 
and the open air

good and evil, future / past
night and day or moon and sun
no, when were summoned at last
all we will hear is, one

so many rivers beckoning
so many willing to take you home
dont fear some phantom final reckoning
go on, surrender yourself to the foam

when the big big day begins
the dawn will never need break
and all this talk talk talk 
of grace and sin
will up and fly away

chorus
all I hear is one

Im dancing, lost at twilight
in a dervishistic spin
I feel the sirens flowing out
and the silence flooding in

dont say, it cant be like that.
dont tell me,
No, its not yet begun.
Im being summoned right now
cause all I hear is, one.

we wait in deserts
we thirst in dusty caves
searching for heaven above ground
while deep beneath us
its right here, subterranean
one one one one one one one

chorus
all I hear is one---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
