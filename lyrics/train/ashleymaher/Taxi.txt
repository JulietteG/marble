amin reckons hes lucky
getting 15 passengers a day
amin reckons hes luckier
getting 15 passengers who pay

whatever their destination
play their favorite station
and dont look back
dont talk too tough
dont talk too much
they can hear them in the air
the bells of battered trust

back home, 
when we had a car
wed open the windows wide
see how far shed take us
ride to the rising sun
oh

last week, he came close to losing it
they were using some smoky smoky
windows closed
cruising
backseat heads in heaven
with nowhere to go

back home, 
when we had a car
wed open the windows wide
see how far shed take us
ride to the rising sun

now we comb the city sidewalks 
with our eyes
for passengers for passengers
praying for one to take us
flying over bridges to the other side
oh

amin could try to get his gas cheap
but twice a week, he turns into a Texaco
up to visit from Mexico?
says the same sweet smile
behind the glass

amin could drive in a straight line
but twice a week, he turns into a texaco
up to visit from mexico? say the same sweet smile, 
behind the glass

back home are bigger distances than that---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
