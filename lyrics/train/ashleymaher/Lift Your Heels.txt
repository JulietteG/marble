when I was a little girl
bobsleds down Canadian hills
frightened, I would dig my heels
into the snow

whistling winds around my head
arms around anothers waist
throbbing blood beneath the chill
as down wed go

my brother, hed encourage me
to lift my heels
curl up like a bullet
and lets fly from here

but I wasnt as wild as he
dont want be wrapped round
some wayward tree

free, we seem to be
till looking down from here
looking down from here
looking down from here

well, time has passed 
and I have grown
the stakes seem higher, 
every time I sit here again
with the snow below

I recognize the whistling wind
the urge to bullet bend again
tight, your arms as off we go

I search the mountainside below
to reassure my to-and-fro-ing heart
how the devil did I do this before?

my prior rides lie buried there
beneath the seasons pearly layers
free, free we seem to be
till looking down from here
looking down from here
looking down from here

I see my face
inside a jail of maybes
painted bars of silver steel
the good books say,
just wait for grace to save me

lift your heels
lift your heels

lift your heels
leave your hill behind
lift your heels
abandon yourself
