blackberries
arent in season yet
the tributaries
and the riverbeds
not even wet

just shy,
of something like 200 years
this sky
this England sky sheds no tears
and tildas sleeping on the serpentine

catch that train
hat-catch the rain, oh
catch that train
hat-catch the rain, oh

but over theres got rain tonight
rain  rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
they say we got the lightening 
just right
just right, oh, ho ho ho

yet down in the shelters
those kind of lights dont shine
dont shine, dont shine, dont shine
and tildas sleeping on the serpentine
tildas sleeping on the serpentine

catch that train
hat-catch the rain, oh
c-c-catch that train
hat-catch the rain, oh

were sending rain 
to over there tonight
such muscle and might
they say we got the rain
just right
right?
and tildas in civilian clothes
asleep like snow white---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
