Don't let old dreams get you down
because so much is so much better now
Walk on by as if the world needs us around
when I walk right, you see I walk right on

We never had to try
for the world we would've liked
We never had to run
I guess I was just born at the right time

We never had to fight
for the world we would've liked
The war's already won
I guess I was just born at the right time

Cause I'm young and made of the things that last
I'll let all that you're saying, let all that you're saying pass
and when I wake up showered in the morning light
I'll know that it's gonna be alright

We never had to try
for the world we would've liked
we never had to run
I guess I was just born at the right time

We never had to fight
for the world we would've liked
The war's already won
I guess I was just born at the right time

We never had to run, I was 
born at the right time---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
