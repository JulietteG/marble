It hurts me so to be
Under your spell
Ain't no heaven for me, but a hell
But after all, I can't let you go
'Cos I love you so, Demon Lover
Demon Lover, Demon Lover
I love you

I'm bewitched and I know it so well
What the reason is baby I can't tell
It's that animal good looks you've got
You show more than a lot
Demon Lover, Demon Lover, Demon Lover
I love you

You took me for lovin' kindness sake
You don't give love, you only take
But after all I can't let you go
'Cos I love you so Demon Lover---Lyrics submitted by MARY.
