Come closer to me
Your pulse becomes my beat
Step and move your body
Come closer dance with me
Take a chance let's be brave
I'm sure you'll like the taste
Take a shot at some fun
Tonight won't go to waste

CHORUS
Laste chance
Come on get up
On that dancefloor
Tonight
The party; s started
And it's getting warm
Get up
Ain't nobody sitting down
At this club

Come on closer to me
Your pulse becomes the beat
Tonight's about the music
If that's an issue you can leave
From the girls to the boys
From the back to the front
To the middle let me see you rockin'
From the start to the end
To the break of dawn
And on and on
Let me see you rockin'
Take a chance let's be brave
I'm sure you'll like the taste
Take a shot at some fun
Tonight won't go to waste

CHORUS
Laste chance
Come on get up
On that dancefloor
Tonight
The party; s started
And it's getting warm
Get up
Ain't nobody sitting down
At this club

(MOC)
It's your chance now. feel it. wow
Can you feel the fire burning in the sound?
It is the love we found
Compelling you, to do and move
When it comes around
See me dancin' in this place so vast
Dare to ask how I stay steadfast
Rock it to the masses on world broadcast
Standin' on words that are built to last
There's a spot right here
With your name written on it
Don't refuse, you got nothing to lose
Time to choose Spirit willing
Throw surrendered hands up to the ceiling
So what you thought was a panic
Was just your drive gone manic

CHORUS
Laste chance
Come on get up
On that dancefloor
Tonight
The party; s started
And it's getting warm
Get up
Ain't nobody sitting down
At this club---Lyrics submitted by Ruby.
