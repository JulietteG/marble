Do you remember how you wore that dress?
It slit my sight beneath the eyelids
Do you remember what you said to me?
What cause has given you the right to stray?

And then you slid into my solid shade
The clocks are ticking fast with every breath

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
you will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure either way
But my heart, it asks
just one more time
Are you still a mess?

One day a rain will come and wash away
dead earth that held us was no island
I have become ingrown inside this skin
I'll find a way out through those eyelids

And all the days become a castaway
I seem to think I don't belong here

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
you will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure either way
But my heart, it asks
just one more time
Are you still a mess?

I don't belong here, I shouldn't stay
The whole time it grows empty
The walls between us will never break
Just seal it shut, it grows empty

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure either way
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure either way
But my heart, it asks
just one more time
Are you still a mess?---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
