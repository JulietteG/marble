I just don't know the layman's terms
To call the mess you breed
What thaws beneath this surface
Soils blood to your family tree
The dates they change
With each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises
This switch it won't come on
What do I do to lose it
Beneath this distress call

[x2]
Let the wheels burn
Let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck
With a body inside

Frames of infrared
Keep scrolling into focus
Scarab crank the busy signal
With habits that you notice
The dates they change
With each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises
this switch it wont come on
What do I do to lose it
beneath this distress call

[x2]
Let the wheels burn
Let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck
With a body inside

Taking all the hostages
Into the oval office
Draw the curtains part their hair
And pull the trigger softly
If they have me committed
Then I'll just take you with me

One driver in your motorcade
Is all it takes
Is all it takes
Sandman grains in teflon veins
Is all it takes
Is all it takes

What am I without the bruises
This switch it wont come on
What do I do to lose it
Beneath this distress call

[x2]
Let the wheels burn
Let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck
With a body inside---Lyrics submitted by Shiloh.
