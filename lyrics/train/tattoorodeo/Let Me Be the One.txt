You took the key to your heart and you hid it
Now you don't wanna open that door
We've all been cut by love before

You've done hard time baby
I'll be the first to admit it
But you don't have to let that cold wind blow
No, no...there's something we can do about it

I do my best on the answers to your questions
But I ain't gonna promise that the rain won't come
again
Let it fall like tears baby, and wash him from your
hands

Let me be the one who makes you care
Let me be the one who's always there for you
And when you feel love's burn with no concern
And you want to just turn and walk away
Let me be the one who makes you stay
I wanna be the one
Gotta be the one

You thought you couldn't let go but you did it
And you don't wanna hurt no more
You won the fight, don't lose the war
Take those sad blue eyes and those dark grey skies
And get rid of it
Baby, I ain't him, hear me knockin'...ooh yeah
Open up that heart and let me walk right in

I do my best on the answers to your questions
But I ain't gonna promise that the rain won't come
again
Just let it wash away his sins

Let me be the one who makes you care
Let me be the one who's always there for you
And when you feel love's burn with no concern
And you want to just turn and walk away
Let me be the one
Baby, let me be the one

He stole your heart
He's been tried and convicted
Now you're blindfolded baby
With your last cigarette
You're too hard on yourself
You've just been neglected
Try and give a little love girl and see what you get

I do my best on the answers to your questions
But I ain't gonna promise that the rain won't come
again
But I'll dry your tears if you open up and let me in

(Let me be the one)...ahhh
Won't you open up your heart to me baby
Ooh yeah, to let me in, to let me in
(Let me be the one)...ahhh
Don't you turn and walk away, yeah
Just let me be the one who makes you stay
Let me be the one who makes you stay---Lyrics submitted by William Teves.
