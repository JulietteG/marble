You got me down on the floor
So what'd you bring me down here for?

If I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was a judge I'd break the law
And if I was from Paris
If I was from Paris
I would say
Oooh la la la la lala

You got me up on your swing
So when you gonna shake that thing?

If I was from Paris

Oooh la la la la la la

If I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was a judge I'd break the law
And if I was from Paris

Oooh la la la la la la ---
