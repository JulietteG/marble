Build your own television receiver
Stayin' home can't be that bad for me
'Cause I'm not scared
But I'd like some extra spare time
Easily earn me big money

I'm a modern girl
But I fold in half so easily
When I put myself 
In the picture of success
I could learn world trade
Or try to map the ocean

When you dead
in hospitals and freeways 
when your dead
in resting homes and clinics
when your dead
it must be nice to finish
when your dead 

I've had it with you
and mexico can fucking wait
and all of those french films about trains
cause I'm not scared 
But I'd like some extra spare time
I'm not scared, 
but the bills keep changing colors

when your dead
in hospitals and freeways
when your dead 
in dress shirts & neckties 
when your dead
in apartments & on beaches
when your dead

They say California is a recipe for a black-hole
I'd say I've got my best shoes on

Ready to go (x11)
I'm ready to go
Ready to go (x3)
I'm ready to go
Ready to go (x3)
I'm ready to go
Ready to go (x3)
I'm ready to go

These are times that can't be weathered 
& we have never been back there since then

These are times that can't be weathered
& we haven't been back there since then 

These are times that can't be weathered 
& we have never been back there since then (X3)---Lyrics submitted by Kalan.
