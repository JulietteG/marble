Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just dont belong
And no one understands you

Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming

No you dont know what its like
When nothing feels alright
You dont know what its like to be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When youre down
To feel like youve been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no ones there to save you
No you dont know what its like

Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?

Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside youre bleeding

No you dont know what its like
When nothing feels alright
You dont know what its like to be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When youre down
To feel like youve been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no ones there to save you
No you dont know what its like

Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabs you in the back
You might think Im happy 
But Im not gonna be okay!

Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work it was always there
You dont know what its like
What its like!

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When youre down
To feel like youve been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no ones there to save you
No you dont know what its like (what it's like)

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When youre down
To feel like youve been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no ones there to save you
No you dont know what its like

Welcome to my life
