BBB-Boom!
In a world full of heartache
Seems like everyone's burning out
You and me we did it our way
And this love ain't running out
We got that fire, that glow
And I just need you to know

You're my favourite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

BBB-Boom!
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

Don't worry about tomorrow
'Cause these walls will never fall
I just want to let the world know
What we got's unbreakable
We got it under control
We're good, we're solid, we're gold

You're my favourite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

BBB-Boom!
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

You make my crazy little heart go
And now I never want to let go

You make my crazy little heart go
And now I never want to let go

BBB-Boom!
You're my favourite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

You're my favourite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

BBB-Boom!
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!---
