Some people dream about money and fame
And taking rides on private planes
But they don't know you like I know you

Some people dream about looking good
Like movie stars in Hollywood
But they don't know you like I know you

They don't understand
They think I'm a fool
If only they could see

I dream about you
Heaven only knows I do
I dream about you
Every single night it's true
I dream about you

People want to drive fancy cars
Maybe one day reach the stars
But they don't know you like I know you

I would rather spend all my days
Reminiscing about yesterday
When I was standing right beside you

You don't understand
You think I'm a fool
If only you could see

I never, I never want to wake up
No I never want to wake up
I dream about you---
