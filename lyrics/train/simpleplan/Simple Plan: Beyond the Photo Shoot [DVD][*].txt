what time is it where you are?
(i miss you more than anything)
back at home you feel so far
(watin' for the phone to ring)
its gettin' lonely livin' upside down
i dont wanna be in this town
tryin to figure out the time zones
makin' me crazy.

chorus:
you say good morning
when its midnight
going out of my head alone in this bed
i wake up to your sunset
its drvin me mad i miss you so bad
and my heart, heart, heart is so jetlagged
heart, heart, heart is so jetlagged
is so jetlagged.

what time is it where you are?
(5 more days and i'll be home)
i keep your picture in my car
(i hate the thought of you alone)
i been keeping busy all the time
just try to keep you off my mind
tryin' to to figure out the time zones
makin' me crazy.
