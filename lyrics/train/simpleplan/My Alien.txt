i'm sick of being alone 
when are you coming home? 
just a glimpse of your face 
i can remember smelling 
your hair 
i'll meet you anywhere 
somewhere that no one 
can retrace 
somewhere where nobody 
will kno our faces 
[chorus]
she has two arms to hold me 
and four legs to wrap 
around me 
she's not your typical girlfriend 
she's my alien 
[end of chorus]
she knos when 
something is wrong 
when something 
doesnt belong 
she can read in my mind 
and she can be assured 
that with me 
there is no conspiracy 
she's not wasting her time 

she can take me to the place 
that she calls home 
in a spaceship that will 
someday be my own 
please take me to your leader 
tell her i will surrender 

[chorus] 

i bought the astronaut kit 
now all i need is a rocket 
my love intergalactic friend 
my alien---Lyrics submitted by ben.
