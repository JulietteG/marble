I gotta tell you the truth
Im full of broken pieces
And all my nights are sleepless
And I dont mean to intrude
This secret can you keep it?
Wont give up even if it...

Takes me all night,
Takes my whole life,
Just wont feel right, (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do

I dont want to go to bed
I dont want to go to bed (No)
I dont want to go to bed
I dont want to go to bed without you.

Lets get this out of the way
Why should we wait forever?
Were meant to be together.
Im not ashamed to say (let me tell you one time)
You dont remember my name
But I still want you the same

Love at first sight,
Left me tongue tied,
Just wont feel right (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do... (tell me what to do)

I dont wanna go to bed without ya,
No you no lie no sleep without ya,
Go crazy in the...
I go crazy without ya,
Ery dream, ery nightmare's about ya.
I cant lie, got love at first sight,
Love the first night, I took my first bite.
Im, insane when I take aim, like,
King James with the mid-range BANG!

Love at first sight,
Left me tongue tied,
Just wont feel right (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do...

I dont wanna go to bed without ya,
No you no lie no sleep without ya,
This is Simple Plan Shorty!

I dont want to go to bed without you!

I said
I dont wanna go to bed without ya,
No you no lie no sleep without ya,
No you no sleep!

I dont want to go to bed without you.---
