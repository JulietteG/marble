I look around me, but all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere, expecting sympathy
It's like we're going through the motions of a scripted destiny
Tell me where's our inspiration, if life won't wait, I guess it's up to me(Whoa)
No we're not gonna waste another moment in this town (Whoa)
And we won't come back, the world is calling out (Whoa)
Leave the past in the past, gonna find the future
And misery loves company,  well so long
You'll miss me when I'm gone
You'll gonna miss me when I'm gone
Procrastination, running circles in my head
While you sit there contemplating, you're wound out left for dead
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses 
Another day, another casualty
But that won't happen to me(whoa)
No we're not gonna waste another moment in this town(whoa)
We won't come back the world is calling out(whoa)
Leave the past in the past, gonna find the future
And misery loves company, well so long
You'll miss me when im gone
You'll gonna miss me when im gone
When I'm gone (Whoo)
I won't look back, when I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave this hole behind me, gonna take what's mine tonight
Cause every wasted day, comes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry, if life won't wait I guess it's up to you(Whoa)
No we're not gonna waste another moment in this town(Whoa)
We won't come back the world is calling out(whoa)
Leave the past in the past, gonna find the future
And misery loves company, well so long
You'll miss me when I'm gone
You'll gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'll gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'll gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'll gonna miss me when I'm GONE---Lyrics submitted by benny.
