As I rise, strength of God
Go before, lift me up
As I wake, eyes of God
Look upon, be my sight

As I wait, heart of God
Satisfy and sustain
As I hear, voice of God
Lead me on, be my guide
Be my guide

Above and below me
Before and behind me
In every eye that sees me
Christ be all around me

As I go, hand of god
My defense by my side
As I rest, breath of god
Fall upon me, bring me peace
Bring me peace

Oh, Christ be all around me

Your life, your death,
Your blood was shed
For every moment, every moment

Oh, Christ be all around me---
