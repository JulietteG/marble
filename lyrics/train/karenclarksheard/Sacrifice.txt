[Kierra: Daughter] 
I will never forget this man name Jesus 
He died for you and me on Calvary 
He paid the price so I am free for life 
And which we called a sacrifice 
After this story 
He sent more blessings 
There were miracles that people never had 
There was love beyond compare 
Thats how he showed he cared

He proved it with his eyes, he cried for me 
He proved it with his knees, he prayed for me 
So, I present my body a living sacrifice 
So I give you my heart and I give you y mind 
I owe you me 
Thank you for setting me free 

[Karen: Mother]
I shall never forget this man name Jesus 
Cause he died for you and me at Calvary 
He paid the price and made a sacrifice 
Thats why I owe him me 
So I take this time to show a-ppre-cia-tion 
To our lord for saving me wretch undone 
So I offer up a sac-cri-fi-cial praise 
Oh because the lost he thought enough to save 

He proved it with his eyes, he cried for me 
He proved it with his 
(Kierra comes in) 
knees,he prayed for me 
So, I present my body a living sacrifice 
So I give him [repeat] my heart [repeat]
So I give him my sole [repeat]
I give you my heart my mind [repeat]
I give you [repeat]
I give you my sole [repeat]
[together]
I owe you me 
Thank you for setting me free
