Well have you seen us?
We summon awesome forces
We are the ones that myths and legends talk about
We're so far beyond your definitions
We cannot die, we will not be broken

We have been chosen, the lone protectors
To rescue those who can't survive
The onslaught of those Trojan horses
We cannot die, we will not be broken
Oh No, no, no
No way
Oh No, no, no
Listen up kids

So many years, so many broken mirrors
And yet the truth remains so clear
If you do not like us, you might have to fight us
We cannot die, no way

We are your average ordinary superhuman
Punishers of evil, rock and roll band
And we've been designated to save this crazy world
We cannot die, for this is our destiny
Come on now

Here we are now, five lone men 
Standing on the edge of disaster
Holding the sword of justice
And watch the hammer fall on all those who oppose us
For we are they, and they are we, the Aquabats
We cannot die, no way

We are your average ordinary superhuman
Punishers of evil, rock and roll band
And we've been designated to save this crazy world
And we must win, for this is our destiny
This is our destiny
This is our destiny---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
