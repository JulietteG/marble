I've been pushed around like a jailbird
I've been left in a ditch
I never made the cut so to speak
I never even got to warm the bench
But little girl, I know when that whistle blows
You keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby!
When I'm out on the job site I'm thinkin' that we're gonna be alright
Be alright...

Four radios blastin' classic rock
And they're pointing at you
With your fist raised high
and a hitch and your step
You've got it all
I've got no reason to lie

Look at me, look at me, look at me I'm a winner (You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree, don't you agree, don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that!

Someone once told me
You can't lose em' all
And that someone was you
But when I nail gunned my hand to the wall
I started to wonder if that could be true
But babe it's me you chose
And when the whistle blows
You keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
When I'm out on the job site
I'm thinkin' that we're gonna be alright
Be alright...

Four radios blastin' classic rock
And they're pointing at you
With your fist raised high
and a hitch and your step
You've got it all
I've got no reason to lie

Look at me, look at me, look at me I'm a winner (You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree, don't you agree, don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that!

Look at me, look at me, look at me I'm a winner (You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree, don't you agree, don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that!

Be alright...

Four radios blastin' classic rock
And they're pointing at you
With your fist raised high
and a hitch and your step
You've got it all
I've got no reason to lie.

Look at me, look at me, look at me I'm a winner (You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree, don't you agree, don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that!

Look at me, look at me, look at me I'm a winner (You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree, don't you agree, don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that!
