Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away

Im a dragon, Youre a dragon
Were flyoneers in a covered wagon
Friday night, Ill fly in late
Just in time for our dragon date
Picnic time - shout hooray!
Shish-ka-bobs with my dragon spray
Luck dragon is with you (oh!)
Im here to stay
And on a quest a luck dragon
Is the only way
Ill fly with you to the end
Wind blowing through our dragon skin
Show no fear! Show no tears!
Dragons live for a billion years!
So

Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away

The dragon breath with the fangs out
Get so hot when the fire come out
Ill bring you luck, Ill never give up
Dont know the way but well share the cup
No make believe we dont have wings
This dragon has magic dreams
Luck dragon is with you (Oh!)
Im here to stay
And on a quest a luck dragon
Is the only way
Ill settle down with you my love
Well drift on down in a mist from above
Dont worry girl, Hang on tight
All we got is luck, aight?

Theres something in your eyes
Says now lets fly
Leave this place and
Punch a hole through the sky
These castles and kings
Send them away
As you wish, luck dragon lady

Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away with me
We dont have wings
But together we can fly
Fly away---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
