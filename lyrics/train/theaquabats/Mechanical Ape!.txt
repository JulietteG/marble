Well here I am underground 
Waiting in my metal fortress of sound 
Lets get it on 
But its all ready now 
robot gorilla's how 
A million pounds of steel 
Fuzzy dice and steering wheel 

Woah, I know a way to make an escape 
And get away 
Woah, there can be no mistake 
About the greatest ape of all 

One man stands as the lone magician 
Sending in plays to the ape transmission now 
who can face 
Who can face 
Who can face the unbelievable Mechanical Ape? 
Who can face 
Who can face 
Who can face the unbelievable Mechanical Ape? 

And I say, woah 
oh-oh-oh(Mechanical Ape!) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Mechanical Ape!) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Mechanical Ape!) 
You cannot deface the 
Mechanical Ape 
Woah-oh-oh 

So flip a switch, turn it on 
Make it run through all the fire and guns 
And make it punch some- wha!! 
We will fight our way out 
Monkey bite our way out 
Point the mouse, render 
And never surrender! 

Woah, I know a way to make an escape 
And get away 
Woah, there can be no mistake 
About the greatest ape of all 

One man stands as the lone magician 
Sending in plays to the ape transmission now 
who can face 
Who can face 
Who can face the unbelievable Mechanical Ape? 
Who can face 
Who can face 
Who can face the unbelievable Mechanical Ape? 

And I say, woah oh-oh-oh(Mechanical Ape!) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Mechanical Ape!) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Mechanical Ape!) 
You cannot deface the 
Mechanical Ape 


W-w-w-w-w-w-way to go! 
N-n-n-n-n-n-Not too slow! 
Get up get up get up
Lets go!---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
