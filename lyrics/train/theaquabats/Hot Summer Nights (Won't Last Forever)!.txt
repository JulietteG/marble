I saw you there
With your pretty blondish hair
Eating a breakfast burrito
You seemed so neato
So we took the bus down to the pier
Down on the sand
By the metal detector man
We looked across the bay
As the dolphins swam away
We held hands
And just imagined
With tears in my eyes
You had to say goodbye
You had to go
You couldn't tell me why
You said something about you moving to Alaska

I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever

I know you're gone and you can't come home
I'm so alone, but I'll never forget about you

Dear Elizabeth,
I hope you're doing well
I think it's so awesome that you're out monitoring glacier patterns 
in some remote part of Alaska where no one can get a hold of you.
I thought I'd try anyway

I understand
So I bought a krugerrand
I'll wear you near my heart
We'll never be apart
Now the heavens will smile upon us
With tears in my eyes
You had to say goodbye
You had to go
You couldn't tell me why
You said something about you living on an iceberg

I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever

I know you're gone and you can't come home
I'm so alone, but I'll never forget about you

Dear Elizabeth,
Again, I hope you're doing really good.
I haven't heard from you yet but...
Anyway, the weirdest thing - I met your identical twin sister Liz the other night at a party? 
Wow she looks just like you! 
It was so trippy. 
Anyway she said you miss me but not to try to get a hold of you because you're real busy. 
And the weirdest thing is I guess she's joining you on the expedition? 
Wow that's totally cool!

I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you so much
Those hot summer nights
Won't last forever

Dear Elizabeth and Liz,
I hope you're doing well.
Anyway, I was at the mall and I met your identical cousin Beth.
I didn't even know they had identical cousins and it made me miss you even more.

Hello?

Er, hello is this Elizabeth?

Yes it is.

Elizabeth, it's me Roger - from the beach!

Oh...oh did I say Elizabeth? I meant, um, it's Francine...hah

Oh...Francine?

Yeah, I'm watching their house while they're gone over in Europe.

Europe? I thought they were in Alaska?

Oh did I say Ala...I said, meant Alaska. Yeah they're in Alaska. 
Whatever, Europe, Alaska it's the same. Well, anyway they're going to be changing 
this phone number so you probably shouldn't call here any more ok? Ok bye

Oh man...---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
