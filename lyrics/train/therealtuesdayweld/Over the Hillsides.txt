I kiss you and creep 
across the floor through the door 
and I'm gone

Through the trees where the myrtle 
we planted in spring has grown long

Sat on a steed left tethered for me and I'm gone
You're sleeping and dreaming
You're reaping the seam you have sewn

With kids, a house
and bringing the harvest back home
And you'll never guess 
when you wake I'll never have left you alone.

I'll go back into the stories you heard as a child
back over the boundaries 
where you found me running wild

And you'll grow old 
and wonder if I was 
a dream that you 
had once upon a time

And you'll grow old
and wonder if I was
a dream that you 
had once upon a time---Lyrics submitted by Jackie.
