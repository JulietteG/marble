Golden Touch
Happens everytime your lips touch mine
There's a feeling that's so divine
There's a magic in you

Golden touch
I wasn't very strong til you came along
You made me realize that by your side is where I belong

Golden Touch
There's a kind of magic in the air
Whenever you are near
I get butterflies everytime your eyes meet mine
You opened up so many doors
And I was so very, very inscecure
You made me see the light
You made my life sunny and bright
And you, you
I worship and adore you

Golden touch
Tell me do you ever wonder
How the stars got in my eyes
Well, you put them there (ooh yes)

Golden touch
Do you know the power you posess?
You're the key to my happiness
I must confess
You're simply magic, magic
You opened up so many doors
And I was so very, very insecure
You made me see the light
You made my life sunny and bright 
And you, you
I worship and adore you

Golden touch
Tell me do you ever wonder
How the stars got in my eyes?
Well, you put them there...---Lyrics submitted by Tanisha.
