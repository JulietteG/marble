I'm holding on your rope got me ten feet off the ground..and I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make your sound. you tell me that you need me then you go and cut me down.  Wait, you tell me that your sorry didn't think I'd turn around , said hey it's too late to apologize...it's too late, I said it's too late to apologize,it's too late...I take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you..I need you like a heart needs a beat but it's nothing new (yeah yeah) I loved you with a fire red now it's turning blue. And you say sorry like an angel, heaven let me think was you. But I'm afraid it's too late to apologize it's too late I said it's too late to pologize it's too late. Whoawhoo.  It's too late to apologize, it's too late. I said it's too late to apologize it's too late-I said it's to late to apologize (yeah) I said it's too late to apologize  (yeah)---Lyrics submitted by camilla.
