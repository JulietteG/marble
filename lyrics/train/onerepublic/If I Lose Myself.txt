Im standing up at the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things Ive loved
I stand up just to see
Of all the faces,
you are the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
watching what you know out to see
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
Itll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
woooh, woooh, woooh!

If I lose myself tonight
Itll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
whooooooo

[Instrumental]

Im standing up at the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things Ive loved
I woke up just to see
Of all the faces
you are the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
watching what you know out to see
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
Itll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
woooh, woooh, woooh!

If I lose myself tonight
Itll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
whooooooo

[Instrumental]

Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying

Lose myself
If I lose myself tonight..
Whoooooooooo
whoooooo,whoooo,
whooooooo---
