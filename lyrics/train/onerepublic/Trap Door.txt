You say you're a minute from the deep end
You cut cold the courtesy of sink or swim, yeah
Your body's aching for a breath, I'll give it to you
With a trap door to take care of all of them

Come away, come away now
You're one step from a fall
Hear me saying
Come away, come away now
'Cause you're too close for me to call

I've seen the foolish shame the wise
He just kept crying with his own surprises
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all
And you're not a foolish one at all

Come away, come away now
You're one step from a fall
You hear me saying
Come away, come away now
'Cause you're too close for me to call
(it's too close)

Lost to found do you know
You're the victim of
Kick slide your pose, let it go
You don't need them
Only flesh, blood and bones
You're the same, you and I
Far too young to die

Come away, come away now
You're one step from a fall
You hear me saying
Come away, come away now
'Cause you're too close

Come away, oh---Lyrics submitted by Rachael.
