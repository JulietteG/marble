ohhhhh. baby 

wasn't like me to fall in love 
that's just the way that i was
but now that i fell you holding me 
something inside just tells me you
got into this heart of mine 
and i know it's true cause darling i
darling im starting to fight

im getting used to you
ohhh when im loving every
single thing about you im
getting used to you and i could
never get used to living with out you

Didn't think that our love could mean 
that much, but you sure changed my mine
with your touch never knew that my heart 
could need you so now i know that these
arms can't let you go, now i wouldn't even try
cause im sure that your the one that i, ohhh
one man i need in my life

chorus

ohhhhh
mmmm. ohhhh 

you got into this heart of mine and i 
know it's true cause darling i ohhh darling im started to fight
your the one i need in my life

Im getting used to you ohh when
loving every single thing about you
im getting used to you and i could
never get used to living with out 
im not living with loving you ohhhhhhhhhhh
getting used to you
