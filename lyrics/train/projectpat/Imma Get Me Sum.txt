Only thing I know is get money,

Quick to put that chopper in your life
Bitch where that bread at
I dont want to rob
But I promise you that I will though
Imma do whatever I got to to pay these bills ho
These niggas say Im rapping
But I could be trapping
Around ? the way these nines get to clapping
A lot of yall broads pillow talking with these bros
And telling all your business
Pussy nigga naw
I never tell my business to a rachet ho
Oh nut gobbling slutty bitch
All she want is blow
And moneys everything
Got my ride sitting clean
Boy if you aint seen a half a million
You aint seen shit

Baking soda my trick
Making noise on my strip
Fuck her while she snorts salt
My dick hard as a brick
I'm the man moving that boy
Camero my new toy
Exclusive clientele
So hard Dan Aykroyd
I rubber band my check
Susan Summers all on my neck
Chevy running like a Corvette
Still war ready on deck
And money bag on your head
They coming straight for your neck
Niggas stepping over your kids
And running up in your nest
Louis shoes are all checkered
Dollar bills are my chess
Bare ? on my neck, smooth ?

Who walk in the bank
Who open the safe
Who I dont have a count
Who my shit in the safe
Passcode bomb proof Ebola proof
New York Times want a photo shoot
Double XL want to write reviews?
60 minutes with Barbra Walters
Fuck would I do? I did it
I had to get it
You wont see my goons, got 1000 midgets
With tex on em
I send a text to em
To hide in your crib and send a text back
They put rattle snakes in your babys crib
Bushwick Bill
The ugliest niggas that kill
Im laughing, Im counting my money with ?
?, you niggas is heard, bitch made
C section with a switch blade
Stupid, I go buy rav, you talking sideways
Im parking that bitch in your baby driveway
How do I do it
Thats how I stunt on a hater
Fuck would I do else?
Fuck what I knew
Fuck what I do
If I aint doing Juicy J to the fullest
That Juicy J ? metric tons since I was 13
Watching Pat in the coke game
Till I grew up shouting 3 6
50 billion dollars in the basement
I buy your connect on an iMessage
Bitch dont flood my emails
Juicy J, I never fly alone
My weed got frequent fly mileage

Money!---
