Swan dive down eleven stories high
 Hold your breath until you see the light
 You can sink to the bottom of the sea
 Just don't go without me

 Go get lost where no one can be found
 Drink so long and deep until you drown
 Say your goodbyes but darlin' if you please, 
 Don't go without me.

 C'est la vie, C'est la mort.
 You and me, 
 Forevermore.

 Lets walk on the road that has no end
 Steal away where only angels tread
 Heaven or hell or somewhere in between
 Cross your heart to take me when you leave
 Don't go 
 Please don't go
 Don't go without me---Lyrics submitted by Dara Joiner.
