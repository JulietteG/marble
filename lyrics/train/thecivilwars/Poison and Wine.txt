You only know what I want you to.
I know everything you don't want me to.
Your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine.
You think your dreams are the same as mine.

Chorus:
Oh I don't love you, but I always will.
Oh I don't love you but I always will.
I don't love you but I always will,
I always will.

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back.
The less I give the more I get back.
Oh your hands can heal, your hands can bruise.
I don't have a choice, but I still choose you.

Chorus: 
Oh I don't love you, but I always will.
Oh I don't love you, but I always will.
I don't love you, but I always will.
Oh I don't love you, but I always will.
I don't love you, but I always will.
I don't love you, but I always will.
I don't love you, but I always will.
I always will.
I always will.
I always will.
I always will.
I always will.---Lyrics submitted by Catherine.
