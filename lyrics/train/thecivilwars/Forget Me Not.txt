I've been a-waiting for you 
And you've been a-waiting for me 
Tell me that you'll always be true 
And you'll be the only one for me 

Forget me not, my dear, my darling 
Forget me not, my love 

I just want to hold your hand 
Hang on every word you say 
Let's write a song for us 
And sing it till we're old and gray 


Forget me not, my dear, my darling 
Forget me not, my love 

I'm coming home real soon 
Please leave a light on for me 
Tell me that you'll always be true 
And you'll be the only one for me 
Yes, you'll be the only one for me---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
