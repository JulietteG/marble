[Verse 1:]
I never meant to get us in this deep
I never meant for this to mean a thing
Oh, I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away
I got caught up by the chase
And you got high on every little bit
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

[Chorus:]
Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

[Verse 2:]
I miss the way you wanted me
When I was staying just out of your reach
Begging for the slightest touch
Ooh, you couldnt get enough, mmm

[Chorus:]
Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

[Middle 8:]
Got away from me (x2)
For anybody has to breathe

[Chorus:]
Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one (x2)
Oh, I wish you were the one
I wish you were the one that got away---
