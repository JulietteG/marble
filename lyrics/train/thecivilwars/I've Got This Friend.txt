I've got this friend, I don't think you know him.
He's not much for words, he's hidden his heart away.
Oh I got this friend, a loveless romantic, 
All that he really wants is someone to want him back.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, oh,oh, oh, oh, if the right one came... along.

Oh I've got this friend, I don't think you know her.
She's sings a simple song, it sounds a lot like his.
Oh I got this friend, holding onto her heart
Like it's a little secret, like it's all she's got to give

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, if the right one came,
the right one came along,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, if the right one came... along

It'd be such a shame, if they never meet.
She sounds lovely, he sounds right out of a dream.
If only, if only, if only...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, if the right one came,
if the right one came along.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I got this friend.
If the right one came,
if the right one came along.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I've got this friend
if the right one came... along---Lyrics submitted by Catherine.
