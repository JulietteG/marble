Somewhere tonight a woman cries alone
Broken vows from the love that has gone wrong
Her dreams and plans lay shattered on the floor
Forever ain't that long anymore
Just down the street he tries to wave goodbye
His world has been destroyed because her love has died
He watched as she just walked out the door
Forever ain't that long anymore

Chorus:
With the best of intentions
Their hearts beleived
That it would last for all eternity
Oh the dispair when love turns to war
Forever ain't that long anymore

When the fighting stops and the healing is through
Forgetting's not that easy when they start anew
They'll try love again just like they did before
Forever ain't that long anymore

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
