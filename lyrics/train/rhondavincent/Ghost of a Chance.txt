He lies all alone in his bed
He thinks of the weekend they met
His old heart will never forget the whirlwind romance
He answers if someone should ask
That somehow she slipped through his grasp
His future is linked to the past by the ghost of a chance

(chorus)
He hears her voice as she enters the room
She offers her soft hand to him in the light of the moon
He holds her close they sway to the tune
For a while he's lost in the dance with a ghost of a chance

He's moved by the gown that she wears and the single red rose in her hair
In his mind he places it there all over again
These moments in time hold him fast
There memories out of his past

(chorus)
Won't die as long as he has a ghost of a chance---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
