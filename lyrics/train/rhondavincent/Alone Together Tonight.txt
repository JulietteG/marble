Pull up a chair and talk to me
 I could use some company
 Funny I should see you here
 Could I buy you a beer?

 No, I'm not with him anymore
 He walked out, I slammed the door
 What's that you say, she left you blue
 I guess that means you're lonely too

 But lonely is a state of mind
 You're not alone if you can find
 Someone to tell your troubles to
 I'd like to share a few with you

 Now look at us, ain't we a sight
 They did us wrong and that ain't right
 Now don't think any less of me
 But maybe we could be alone together tonight

 I guess that we could take a chance
 After all it's just one dance
 We've got nothing else to do
 We're just a pair of lonely fools

 Lonely's just a state of mind
 You're not alone if you can find
 Someone to tell your troubles to
 I'd like to share a few with you

 Now look at us, ain't we a sight
 They did us wrong and that ain't right
 Now don't think any less of me
 But maybe we could be alone together tonight

 Now don't think any less of me
 But maybe we could be alone together tonight---Lyrics submitted by Chartay The Man.
