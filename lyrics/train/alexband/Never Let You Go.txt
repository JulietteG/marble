I can hear you call my name
Sitting beside me like a burning flame
My eyes are closed but
I can feel you breathe 
Whispering softly 
Listen to me
I will never ever ever ever let you go
You know 
I will never ever ever ever let you go 
You know

So take my hand 
Through these streets
The city's dark
It's just you and me
I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
on my own two feet again

Something about you
caught my eye
a romance that I cannot describe
And i remember
The way you taste
The smell of your skin
The touch of your face
I will never ever ever let you go
You know
I will never ever ever let you go
You know

So take my hand 
Through these streets
The city's dark
It's just you and me
I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
on my own two feet again

And when you can't go on
and you fear you won't survive
You can turn to me
I'll be here right by your side
You know 
You know
I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever

So take my hand 
Through these streets
The city's dark
It's just you and me
I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand
On my own two feet again

Every night
Every dream
Every song 
You hear me sing
I'll hold you close
You'll help me stand 
On my own two feet again

You know 
I will never ever ever let you go
