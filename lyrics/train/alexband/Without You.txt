Well I'm a bird without a sky
i'm a mountain trying to fly
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you
Well I'm a ship in the desert sea 
Well I'm the only one there for me
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you 
Oh 
Where'd you go
Oh 
You need to know

Those were the best days of my life
Those were the memories that will never die
If i could only turn back time
I would find you and make you mine
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you

Well take these eyes 
And learn to see
That we were always meant to be
I'm doing the best that i can do
Without you
Oh 
Where'd you go
Oh you need to know

Those were the best days of my life
Those were the memories that will never die
If i could only turn back time
I would find you and make you mine
I'm doing the best that I can do
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

Oh
Where'd you go 
Oh
You need to know
Those were the best days of my life
Those were the memories that will never die
If i could only turn back time
I would find you and make you mine
I'm doing the best that I can do
Yeah
I'm doing the best that i can do
Without you
Without you
Without you---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
