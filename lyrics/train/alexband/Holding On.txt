I am awake
No longer sleeping
I made my mistakes
It's what I was needing
And now I'm breaking away from the crowd
I wanna just scream aloud
Hey no one can stand in my way

I believe I'm holding on to a dream
And staying strong
Can't you see
I'm holding on
Holding on
Holding on to a dream

I've made up my mind
This fire is burning
I'll follow the signs
These pages are turning
And now I'm dancing alone in the moonlight
Closing my eyes
It just feels right
Letting my heart lead the way

I believe I'm holding on to a dream
And staying strong
Can't you see
I'm holding on
Holding on
Holding on to a dream

You know I can't do this alone
A house could never make a home
And now I'm breaking away from the crowd
I wanna just scream
Hey no one can stand in my way

I believe I'm holding on to a dream
And staying strong
Can't you see
I'm holding on
Holding on
Holding on to a dream
Holding on to a dream
Holding on to a dream
Holding on to a dream
Hold on---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
