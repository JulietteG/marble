He saw the best in me
When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me

Can I tell yall one more time, one more time?

I said he saw the best in me
When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me
I wish I had a witness tonigth
All I need is one
Heyy

He saw the best in me
(When everyone else around me)
When everyone else around (oohh)
(Could only see))
Could only see the worst in me

Does anybody have that testimony?
When folk write you off
Said you would never make it, what did he see?

He saw the best in me
(When everyone else around you yeaa)
When everyone else around
(Ooohh, could only)
Could only see the worst in me

Can I tell yall one more thing?
I just need to tell you one more thing

(Listen to this)

See hes mine, and I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me, for who I am
Does anybody know that today?
Oh Ohh

See hes mine, and I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me, for who I am
Does anybody know that today?
(Help me sing it)

Said that he is mine
See hes mine
Im his
And I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
It doesnt matter what I did
Cause he only sees me for who I am, yea.. yea..
He only sees me for who I am
Im so glad

That he is mine
Hes mine
Yeahh..
And Im his
It doesnt matter what I did
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me
He only sees me for who I am

He saw the best in me
When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me

I wish I had a witness tonight
Can I ask yall one question?
The question is simply this
What did he see?

He saw the best in me
(When everyone else around me)
When everyone else around (oohh)
(Could only see))
Could only see the worst in me

I cant get no help up in here
Because there are some folk in here
People have walked you off
Said you would never amount to anything
Said that you would never end up being anywhere
But tell them one more time

He saw the best in me
(When everyone else around me)
When everyone else around (oohh)
(Could only see))
Could only see the worst in me

When mama said you would never be nothing
When aunties and uncles said you would never amount to anything
When daddy didnt come home anymore
he didnt look at you and said that
You wasnt going to make it
God looked at you
And what did he see
What did he see?

He saw the best
The best
The best
The best
The best
The best
The best
The best
I said what did he see
I said what did he see
I said what did he see
I said what did he see
I said what did he see
I said what did he see

He saw the best in me
(Oh lord, oh, lord)

Can I sing the verse one more time, listen to this yall
I love this, I love this

See hes mine, and I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
But he only sees me for who I am

Ohhhhhh, Lord, Yeahh.

Hes mine
And Im his
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me, for who I am

Sing it one time

(He is mine, ooohh)

Hes mine
And I am his
(Oooohh)
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me for who I am
He only sees me for who I am

And the reason he sees me for who I am
Because he created me in his image and his likeness

Hes mine
Hes mine
And I am his
And Im his
It doesnt matter what I did
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me
He only sees me for who I am

He saw the best
