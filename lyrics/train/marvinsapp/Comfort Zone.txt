Im, coming out
Of my comfort zone
Some of the places in my life,
Thats comfortable
GOD is challenging me, trust and believe
For to go, where Ive not gone
I must do what Ive not done

Soo, Im, 
Coming out, of my comfort zone
Tho it may cost me some friends
Ill walk alone
GOD is challenging me
To trust and believe
For to go, where Ive not gone
I must do what Ive not done
(oooh, oooh, oh)

God is calling me
(to walk into my destiny)
God is challenging me
(to go where I've not been)
God is proving me
(and for the rest of my life, I'll say yes)
Yes (3xs)

I'm coming out of my comfort zone
(oh) I'm being stretched to a place where I've never known
GOD is challenging me
To trust and believe
For to go where I've not gone
I must do what I've not done

GOD is calling me
(to walk into my destiny)
GOD is challenging me
(to go where I've not been)
GOD is proving me
(and for the rest of my life, I'll say yes)
Yes (3xs)

I'm coming out
Into my destiny
I'm coming out(2xs)
And for the rest of my life my answer will be yes
Yes(3xs)

I'm coming out
Into my destiny
I'm coming out
And for the rest of my life it will be yes
Yes (3xs)

Yes to your will
I'm coming out
Yes to your way
I'm coming out
Yes Lord
I'm coming out
Each and every day
Yes

I'm coming out [x2]

I'm coming out of my comfort zone
I'm being stretched to a place I've never known
God is challenging me
Trust and believe---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
