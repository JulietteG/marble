I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses and the voice I hear falling on my ear the sound of God discloses he speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet that the birds they house their singing and the melody that he sings to me with him my heart is still ringing and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me that I am his own and the joy we share as we dance as we dance
None other has ever, ever known---Lyrics submitted by latosha.
