Never would have made it, never could have made it, without you 
I would have lost it all, but now I see how you were there for me 

And I can say 
Never would have made it, 
Never could have made it, 
Without you 

I would have lost it all, 
But I now I see how you were there for me and I can say 
I'm stronger, I'm wiser, I'm better, 
much better, 

When I look back over all you brought me thru. 
I can see that you were the one that I held on to 
And I never 
Chorus Never would have made it 

Oh I never could have made it 
Chorus Never could have made it without you 

Oh I would have lost it all, oh but now I see how you were there for me 

I never 
Chorus - Never would have made it 

No, I never 
Chorus - Never could have made it without you 

I would have lost my mind a long time ago, if it had not been for you. 
I am stronger 
Chorus -- I am stronger 

I am wiser 
Chorus -- I am wiser 

Now I am better 
Chorus -- I am better 

So much better 
Chorus -- I am better 

I made it thru my storm and my test because you were there to carry me thru my mess 

I am stronger 
Chorus -- I am stronger 

I am wiser 
Chorus -- I am wiser 

I am better 
Chorus -- I am better

Chorus -- I am better 


I can stand here and tell you, I made it. Anybody out there that you made it 

I am stronger 
Chorus -- I am stronger

Much better 
Chorus -- I am better 

I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it 


And I never would have made it 
Chorus Never would have made it 

Never could have made it 
Chorus Never could have made it without you 

I would have lost my mind, I would have gave up, but you were right there, you were right there 

I never 
Chorus Never would have made it 

Oh I never 
Chorus - I never could have made it without you. 


Someone need to testify next to them and tell them I am stronger, I am wiser, I am better, much better. When I look back over what he brought me thru. I realize that I made it because I had you to hold on to, now I am stronger, now I am wiser, I am better, so much better. I made it. Is there anybody in this house other than me that can declare that you made it. Tell your neighbor, never would have made it. Never would have made it. Never could have made it. Never could have made it without you. Never would have made it. Never would have made it. Never could have made it. Never could have made it without you.---Lyrics submitted by aasha.
