I feel the presence of the Lord moving in the atmosphere
Like on the day of Pentecost, they were all with one accord,
And a sound came from Heaven like a 
Rushing Mighty Force, 
Rushing Mighty Force
(Repeat first verse)

I believe in the Promise say, Oh Yeah
That the Lord will surely come, Oh Yeah
the Miracles Signs and wonders, Oh Yeah
And the Power from above, Oh Yeah

Like on the Day of Pentecost, they were all with one accord
And a sound came from Heaven like a Rushing Mighty Force, Rushing Mighty Force

Right before you sent it, Oh Yeah
The apostles were standing right there, Oh Yeah
The Bible was a witness, Oh Yeah
And I feel Him in the air, Oh Yeah
See I believe in the Promise, Oh Yeah
I believe His word is True, Oh Yeah
I believe theres a miracle in here, Oh Yeah
and its all for me and you

Fresh Wind, Ooh Oh (Repeat)
Fill the House (Repeat)
Fill the house with Your Presence (Repeat)
Fresh Wind, Ooh Oh (Repeat)
Fill the house with your Presence
Fresh Wind, Ooh Oh (Repeat)
Fill the House (Repeat)
Fill the House with Your Presence---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
