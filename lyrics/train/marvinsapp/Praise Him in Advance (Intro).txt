I've had my share of ups and downs, times when there was no one around, God came and spoke these words to me, praise will confuse the enemy. [x2]

I started singing, I started clapping, I started dancing, people were laughing, they knew my problems, they knew my pain, but I knew God would take them away.

I have my share of ups and downs, times when there was no one around, God came and spoke these words to me, praise will confuse the enemy. [x2]

I started singing, I started clapping, I started dancing, people were laughing, they knew my problems, they knew my pain, but I knew God would take them away.

That's why I praise him with my hands, that's why I praise him with a dance, He's given me a second chance, come on let's praise him in advance.

That's why I praise him with a song, when things are right and when they're wrong, He's given me a second chance, come on let's praise Him in advance
