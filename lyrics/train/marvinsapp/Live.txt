I see you smiling 
Life is tearing you apart 
Looking good on the outside 
I can feel your heart 
You feel helpless and hopeless 
Isolated and confused 
You feel like that there lays no purpose 
So let this word encourage you 

You shall live, and not die 
Though you've been hurting 
For sometime 
By faith 
You shall live 
And not die 
Though you have been hurting 
For sometime 
By faith 
You shall live 

I see you standing there 
With a towel in your hands 
Getting ready to go in 
Like no one really understands 
They don't, don't understand 
Here is what you must remember 
That you are in this for a reason 
Don't give up just keep the faith 
Soon you will be walking in your season 

You shall live, and not die 
Though you've been hurting 
For sometime 
By faith 
You shall live 
And not die 
Though you have been hurting 
For sometime 
By faith 

Just remember, just remember 

He will never put more on you than you than you can bear 
It may be hard right now 
Just know that he cares 
You shall... 
Live, live, live 

By faith you shall... 
Live, live, live 
[repeat] 
By faith you shall... 

You shall live and not die 
Though you've been hurting 
For sometime 
By faith 
You shall live and not die---
