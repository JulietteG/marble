Verse 1
People of God, the kingdom is nigh
And there is a cause, to stand up and fight
Hes given the charge, theres no way wed lose
If you didnt know it, weve got some good news

Is he gonna do it (Yes)
Whos he gonna use (Me)
Am I gonna win (Yes)
And hows he gonna do it (Hell use my hands, oh)
Is he gonna do it (Yes)
Whos he gonna use (Me)
Am I gonna win (Yes)
And hows he gonna do it (Hell use my hands)

Teach my hands to war
Cuz praise is a weapon, praise is a weapon
Ill clap, Ill wave, In everything Ill praise
Teach my hands to war
Cuz praise is my weapon, praise is my weapon
He promised victory, when we praise
So clap yo hands, clap yo hands, clap em
Clap yo hands, clap yo hands, clap em.

Verse 2
Its been determined
We overcome by the blood of the one
Hes the lamb that was slain
And he never fought back
Cuz he knew that in 3 days
It was gonna turn around in our favor
So were giving praise to our savior
He gave us the key to victory
And its in our praise

Chorus

Special
The weapons of our warfare are mighty, mighty through God
We dont fight against flesh and blood
But principalities, powers mighty through God
Were not ignorant of his devices
Spiritual wickedness in high places
Come down, come down with our praise
(Repeat)
