Who said love should be this hard
Who said hearts should break apart? 
I know, maybe I should mend this
Pull out the glue, maybe I can fix this

I'd approve of this change
If the change hadn't meant you changed how you felt about me
It's a treacherous thing, when the one that you love is finding a new love

You're running away from things that matter more than you know
You're chasing a love that could never love you as much as I do 

My eyes have seen these streets, I've walked this road
Every time I look back all I see is your face, my darling
My eyes have seen these streets, I've walked this road
Every time I speak my words just say, "don't go" my darling

There's some things that I'm left with 
That make me believe this is hard
Like the bed that we slept in
It's filled with the scent of our love

I can still hear your laughter bounce off the walls of our home
Late at night when you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?

You're running away from things that matter more than you know
You're chasing a love that could never love you as much as I do 

My eyes have seen these streets, I've walked this road
Every time I look back all I see is your face, my darling
My eyes have seen these streets, I've walked this road
Every time I speak my words just say, "don't go" my darling---Lyrics submitted by Chantelle W.
