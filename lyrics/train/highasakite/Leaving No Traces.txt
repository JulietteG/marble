The Earth is the universe's eyes
The Earth is the universe's eyes

And you set out for peace but got nuclear war
and bashed in the eyes of them all
The Earth is the universe's eyes (x2)
And it hasn't been viewed since before the attack
And none has been watching us by

Oh, I used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
Oh, I used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs

And leaving no traces the eye can see

The night has a thousand eyes
The night has a thousand eyes
and you squeezed my heart and punctured my lung
and that weapon would soon replace your tongue

The night has a thousand eyes
the night has a thousand eyes
And you've wandered a lot through the southern ..... ports
And that weapon would soon replace your tongue

Oh, I used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
Oh, I used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs

Oh, I used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
Oh, I used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs

And leaving no traces the eye can see
And leaving no traces the eye can see

Oh, I used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
Oh, I used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs

Oh, I used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
Oh, I used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs

And leaving no traces the eye can see
And leaving no traces the eye can see

The Earth is the universe's eyes
The Earth is the universe's eyes---
