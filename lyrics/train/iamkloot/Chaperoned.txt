You've got it all
And life has been good to you
You've got it all
It's in everything that you do
You heard the call
And got back on the bus
You've got it all
So says each and everyone of us

Ah but you, you go out every night
Oh but you, never leave on the landing light
You, you got a chaperone every night

You've got it all
And life has been good to you
You've got it all
And still I don't have a clue
You heard the call
So we got back on the bus
We've got it all
So says each and everyone of us

Me and you, we go out every night
Oh but you, never leave on the landing light
With you, you got a chaperone every night

And you, what'll you do
And you, what'll you do

?????

Not you, so what'll I do
Not you, so what'll I do

Not you, what'll I do
Not you, what'll I do

You've got it all
And life has been good to you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
