Anna,you come ask me girl
to set you free, girl
you say he loves you more than me 
so i well set you free 
go with him
(Anna)
go with him 
(Anna)

Anna, girl, before you go now 
i want you to know now
that i still love you so
but if he loves you more
go with him

All of my life
ive been searching for a girl 
to love me like i love you 
But let me tell you now

But every girl ive ever had
breaks my heart and leaves sad
what am i ,what am i, supposed to do?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Anna, just one thing girl
you give back your ring to me
and i will set you free
go with him 
(Anna)
go with him
(Anna)
you can go with him girl
(Anna)
go with him---Lyrics submitted by frida.
