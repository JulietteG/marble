Figure 8
(no, no)
(no, no)
Figure 8

Caught the train on the later side
Looking for a place with a little bit of life
Been a tought week can't deny, 
That I thought about stoppin' more than once or twice

Oh No, some more advice
Keep your head up while you're pushed to the side and
Maybe with a bit, bit, bit more luck
You can get picked up from wherever you like

(I Know, I Know)
It's not enough
(You Know, You Know)
It's hard enough to get a chance around these parts,
(Around these parts)

(I Know, I Know)
It's not enough
(You Know, You Know)
It's far enough that you can't get there on your own anymore

(Oh)
Lately I've been trying my best
But maybe it aint good enough
(Good Enough)

Running in circles I guess
(I Guess)
Round and Round It never stops
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops Just Like A Figure 8

It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops Just Like A Figure 8

Hailed a cab on the early side
Looking for a train that will get uptown, UH
Think I wanna see home
Don't pick up the phone can't hear a sound

Search your whole lives up and down
For what can't be found
Instead of appreciating what we have around
What we have now gets tossed to the ground

(I Know, I Know)
It's not enough
(You Know, You Know)
It's hard enough to get a chance around these parts,
(Around these parts)

(I Know, I Know)
It's not enough
(You Know, You Know)
It's far enough that you can't get there on your own anymore

(Oh)
Lately I've been trying my best
But maybe it aint good enough
(Good Enough)

Running in circles I guess
(I Guess)
Round and Round It never stops
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops Just Like A Figure 8

It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops Just Like A Figure 8

(No)
Noooooo
(No)
Noooooo
(No)
Noooooo

Just Like a Figure 8!

(Oh)
Lately I've been trying my best
But maybe it aint good enough
(Good Enough)

Running in circles I guess
(I Guess)
Round and Round It never stops
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops Just Like A Figure 8

It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops
(No)
It Never Stops Just Like A Figure 8

It never stops
It never stops
It never stops
Just Like A Figure 8

It never stops
It never stops
It never stops
Just Like A Figure 8---Lyrics submitted by Justin Jenkins.
