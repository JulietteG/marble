a gentle breeze
from hushabye mountain
softly blows o'er lullabye bay
it fills the sails of boast that are waiting
waiting to sail
your worries away
it isnt far
to hushabye mountain
and your boat 
waits down by the key
the winds of night
so softly are sighing
soon they will fly
your troubles to sea
so close your eyes on hushabye mountain
wave goodbye to cares of the day
and watch your boat from hushabye mountain 
sail far away from lullabye bay---Lyrics submitted by liz.
