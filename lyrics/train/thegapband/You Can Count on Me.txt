Face of stone, and lips so cold
A mask for all the world to see
It's so hard to know what is real
But baby, you can always count on me

A prickly thorn, can bear a rose
A sight for all of us to see
It seems that life is oh so strange
But baby, you can always count on me

Life's solutions, and illusions
Things are seldom what they seem
Were surrounded by our confusions
But baby, you can always count on me

There will be trials and tribulations
And heartaches yeah And miseries
But when it's all over,
You can always count on me.---Lyrics submitted by Elton.
