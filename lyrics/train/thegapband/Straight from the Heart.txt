(Chorus)
Im coming, straight from the heart
Im coming from the heart.
Im coming, straight from the heart
Im coming from the heart.

You that, I love you, always thinking of you
Theres no better lover in the world, aww like you girl.
So happy I am flying, at night my, bodys crying.
Longing for your sensuous touch.
Think Im coming for you.

(Chorus)

Some men think, that I should not
 Forget tha things that I was taught.
Never let a woman know how you feel, the macho seal
But I just wont, start faking, lying cheating, and a shaking.
Now that I found ya let me close the deal 
Cause baby Im for real.

(Bridge)
Girl let me tell ya, just how I really feel
Ive got a tailor made life
Do you really want to go, do you want it, do you want it my lovin.

(Chorus)
