You were the girl,
that turned my world.
You were the girl for me!
You lit the fuse,  
I stand accused.
You were the first for me,

but you turn me on.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me,

but you turned me on, babe!

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

You were my thrills,
you are my pills. 
You dropped a bomb on me!
You turned me out, 
you turn me on.
You turned me loose, 
then you turned me wrong. Mmm

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me,

but you turn me on, babe.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

Just like Adam and Eve,
said you set me free. 
You took me to the sky, 
I never been so high.
You were my pills, 
you are my thrills. 
You were my hope, 
baby you are my smoke.
You dropped a bomb!

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me,

but you turn me out, babe.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me,

but you turned me on, babe.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

You dropped a bomb on me! 

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

You were in motion, 
felt like lotion.
You were the girl for me.
You were my first explosion,
came out to be closer.
You were the first for me, 

but you turned me out, babe!

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

I won't forget what you had done to me babe.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

You dropped a bomb on me, baby!
You dropped a bomb on me.

I, I, I, I, I, I won't forget it! 
I, I, I, I, I, I won't forget it!

You turn me off then you turn me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turn me off then you turn me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turn me off then you turn me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turn me off then you turn me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turn me off then you turn me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turn me off then you turn me on---Lyrics submitted by Lishaw Lincoln.
