I believe it's time for me to be famous
and out of place
I belive it's time for me to move forward

When i break through, 
when i break through, 
when i break through, 
when i break through.

This time I'll make you proud
To see me over
Come on daylight

Proud of who you raised
Your shelter, your peacefulness

So this time I'll make you proud

Proud of who you raised up
You know that I will
Always be here 'til the end.

Come back so I can say thank you for this;
Home cooked meals and a place to rest

My troubled head when you're away
I've passed the test
I've earned an A
Not just in school, but in life
You'll always be right by my side.

To help me show hope to all
That are lost and sick in this dying world
I'll use the love you left behind

I'll change your mind,
I'll change their minds, 

I hope, I hope you smile
When you look down on me, 
I hope you smile.

This can't, we won't know.
I hope that I make you proud.

This is not what it is, only baby scars
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side 

This is not what it is, only baby scars
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side

This is not what it is, only baby scars
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by tyffani.
