All night, I dream of water, 
that can wash the weight of the world, from my shoulders.
All night, I dream of water, 
that can wash the weight of the world, from my shoulders.

Hands of the new one, we need you so, 
to make way for the new born, to be king again.

All night, an endless fire, 
wanting to only fly away, and grow older.

No escape, no escape, 
please pray this is just a dream. Just a dream.
Fight fire with fire, 
this is coming clean, coming clean. These are the words

These are the words of my holiday, craving the sea, that honest place.
Soothe my mind, with everything honest, yeah give me my solace.
Soothe my mind, with everything honest, yeah give me my

All night, I dream of forever, 
hiding myself from the world, thats grown colder.

I wanna be stronger than oceans.
I wanna lift mountains high.
Bring back glory to your name, 
I wannna move faster than time.

I wanna be stronger than oceans.
I wanna lift mountains high.
Bring back glory to your name, 
I wanna move faster than time.

Mountains, oceans, I wanna see waves.

These are the words of my holiday, 
craving the sea, that honest place.
Soothe my mind, with everything honest, 
yeah give me my solace.
Soothe my mind, with everything honest, 
yeah give me my

All night, all night, 
I dream of water, to fight the fire.
Am I awake? Cause I wanna see waves.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
