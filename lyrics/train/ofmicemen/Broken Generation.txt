He sits & he waits
Feeling broken & hollow
Hands held close to his face
Screaming why do I bother?

They'll just tear me down,
Rip me apart, cast aside like a sinner
With no words from the wise

Will you ever learn?
Learn to listen

Can you hear them calling?
You'll testify to justify, you have to find a way!
Can you hear them calling?
With arcane eyes you're staring back at someone with no face!
Can you hear them calling?

She lies there in wait
& feeling so hollow
Can't find love in this place
Left alone with her sorrow

All the promises you made
When you stood by her side were so broken
When you threw it away

We'll mobilize, not pacify to save another day
Can you pick up all the pieces of this broken generation?
Can you hear them calling?

The road to hell is paved in good intentions & apathy
What did you expect when common sense is your enemy?
I'd rather burn alive than drown inside your reality

Can you hear me?
Are you listening?

We'll climb the walls to scratch the sky to save another day
Can you pick up all the pieces of this broken generation?
Can you hear them calling?---
