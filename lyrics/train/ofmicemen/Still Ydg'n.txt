You play these games, baby, honestly?
It's such a shame, you think you control me.
Control my life, and everything around.
I've got my feet on solid ground.

I'm gonna push you away,
with every word that you say.
I'm gonna push you away,
away...

I've let you win too many times.
If I gave you my life,
it'd be my demise.
I'll keep my pride.

This is what I have become in my life.
I won't be deterred by your guilt or your strife.
These are the words back and forth in my mind,
I won't be brought down by your games and your pride.

Sinking apologies, knowing you're leaving me on my own.
Sinking apologies, knowing you're leaving me, all alone.

You won't bring me down.
I've got my feet on solid ground.
You won't bring me down.
I've got my feet on solid ground.

You said you'd stay, then left me alone.
I can't believe you're fine with what you've done.
Never again, I've watched you change with time.
Your heart is filled with cold, your mouth is full of lies.

If I have you my life, it'd be my demise.
I'll keep my pride, I've let you win too many times.

Sinking apologies, knowing you're leaving me on my own.
Sinking apologies, knowing you're leaving me, all alone.
All alone.---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
