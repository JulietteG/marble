why did she stay with him
is there something I missed 
was it cause she was scared
or was it how he kissed
so why did she run to me 
when he made her cry
what was I supposed to say
to change her mind
when every time shed go back again
oh why did she stay with him

why did she stay with him
what didnt I see
was I so wrong to think
she could ever leave him for me
is that the way love is
is it cruel and unfair
did it make my two eyes see something
that isnt there
and could it make her just give in
oh why did she stay with him

why did she stay
did I do something wrong
did I come off too weak
or did I come on too strong
well I guess I lose
I guess he wins
oh why did she stay with him


why did she stay
how long until I forget
when I held her in my arms
and all the things that she said
will she think of me when she feels his skin
oh why did she stay with him
oh why did she stay with him
oh why did she stay with him---Lyrics submitted by Zeek Azoid.
