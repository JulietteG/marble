Cut cut cut cutting myself down to pieces
Too hard on myself, it would seem
That everything could see my self-worth but me
I'll take a stand, devise plans, figure it out
I'll take my cuts & stitch them up with sutures of pure cement
& I've realized

There's no right way to go
So what if I'm a sinner?
I've got black spots on my liver &
Cancer growing on both my lungs
We take everything we know about ourselves
& put them in a diary in a fire ring of scrutiny
But oh, not me now
I think I'm ready to go.

Back back back back to the crooner in question
I sure hope you all like my songs
Maybe I put too much stock in my rhymes
& melodies to stun the brainwashed minds
From day one I took pride in my pure & honest intention
& I've realized

There's no right way to go
So what if I'm a sinner?
I've got black spots on my liver &
Cancer growing on both my lungs
We take everything we know about ourselves
& put them in a diary in a fire ring of scrutiny
But oh, not me now
I think I'm ready to go.

I've realized that I don't want to be judged no more...
& I've realized

There's no right way to go
So what if I'm a sinner?
I've got black spots on my liver &
Cancer growing on both my lungs
We take everything we know about ourselves
& put them in a diary in a fire ring of scrutiny
But oh, not me now
I think I'm ready to go.---Lyrics submitted by Kaylee Chapman.
