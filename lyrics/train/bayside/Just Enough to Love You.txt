Push me out from the darkness, to a sky the color blue
Somewhere someones finding happiness while i'm still here
So hung up on you...
...
Nothing is real...
I want you to know
That i'm not alright
When you tear open my chest
I'll try not to flinch
Or make promises
You taught me that...

I'm still losing whats left of my self esteem
And I'm still watching the slow fading of all my...
Day dreams...

The hardest things to say are the words that mean the most
So I'll bite my tounge till it bleeds, and I doubt you'll even know
The easiest things to fake are feeling, to fool someone else
And i've been tricked for so long by you that
I spent the last few months
In my own hell
A failed apology, a day to late and now I see
All you really want to see me is dangle neck first from a tree
What would you need me for
You've got friends galore
And all you'll ever be to me
Stupid, lying excuse for a person (i've also heard this line as "a waste of time and nothing more")

I could call, but I know that
You wont be there to pick up the phone
You dont have time for me
...
I could call, but I know...
Look at the phone
Have time for me...

(time to shred)

I hate myself
For loving you like this.
I hate myself for hating myself
Just enough to love you.
Just enough to love you.---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
