So let's close our eyes and we'll talk in the morning
When we're able to feel
The true weight of our words and why we're both here.
Then we can say we tried 
and take comfort in knowing
that if we both die alone tomorrow,
it's just the way that the stars aligned.

Hope we both learned our lesson (Hope we both learned our lesson)
Hope we both learned our lesson
We'll be ok.
We both got what we wanted.
I got sex, you got fame.
Who used who now that you've got all new friends?
But they don't know your name.

Here you are, how's the big time darling?
hope I helped make your dreams come true.
And in a way I'm ashamed for not being your first or your last,
just the first cool enough to admit to.
I can hide by my reputation, while sadly you're making your own.
But a notch on your belt's not a notch worn so well,
it's expected of me and the lies that I tell.

Hope we both learned our lesson (Hope we both learned our lesson)
Hope we both learned our lesson
We'll be ok.
We both got what we wanted.
I got sex, you got fame.
Who used who now that you've got all new friends?
But they don't know your name.
They don't know your name.

We'll be ok.
We both got what we wanted.
I got sex, you got fame.
Who used who now that you've got all new friends?
But they don't know your name.

We'll be ok.
We both got what we wanted.
I got sex, tasted fame.
Who used who now that you've got all new friends?
But they don't know your name.

We'll be ok, we'll be ok.---Lyrics submitted by Maile.
