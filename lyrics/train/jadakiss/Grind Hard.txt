[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Now we Shinin hard 
just like we want to do 
grindin day and night 
so we can kick off our shoes 
and live a glamorous life 
look what we made it too 
we some real life hustlas 
got em lookin at you 

We grind hard ohhhh 
to play harder ohhhh 
we touch the stars ohhh 
thats what they call us ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to buy the mall up ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to play harder harder 

[Verse 1: Jadakiss] 
24/7 365 
if we aint breaking them down 
then we letting them fly 
nah never I, always we 
I came in the game dividing the pies by three 
then we got famish 
so we set standards 
very similar to the ten crack commandments 
some couldn't take it 
others got lost and couldn't make it 
he wanted to floss but couldn't fake it 
the hood embraced it 
the rest is basics 
no need to rush be extra patient 
the new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious 
same entourage no extra faces 
hands down the best no explanations 
and to the top is the next destination 
there aint no time outs 
death is the only time we gon sign out 
so we gon grind out 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Now we Shinin hard 
just like we want to do 
grindin day and night 
so we can kick off our shoes 
and live a glamorous life 
look what we made it too 
we some real life hustlas 
got em lookin at you 

We grind hard ohhhh 
to play harder ohhhh 
we touch the stars ohhh 
thats what they call us ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to buy the mall up ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to play harder harder 

[Verse 2: Jadakiss] 
Top 5 dead or alive what they consider them 
soon as them things come in we get rid of em 
mo money mo problems gota live with em 
only thing they care about is what you givin them 
not the energy that you wasted in the game 
or the tears that tripled down your face from the pain 
the time the jaw cracked you wasted the cane 
had to do two shifts to make it the same 
that all changed soon as you tasted the fame 
and it was all worth it after you made you a name 
thanks to our heavily father 
we fly on the jet now instead of the charter 
leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener 
do all of listening so we stay smarter 
everybody's a hero when they get scarred up 
its my ball check it up y'all better guard up 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Now we Shinin hard 
just like we want to do 
grindin day and night 
so we can kick off our shoes 
and live a glamorous life 
look what we made it too 
we some real life hustlas 
got em lookin at you 

We grind hard ohhhh 
to play harder ohhhh 
we touch the stars ohhh 
thats what they call us ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to buy the mall up ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to play harder harder 

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige] 
We step up out of our car 
the whole damn world is lookin at us 
cause they knew what's wrong before 
now we aint hurt no more 
you can bring me the bill 
ill sign my name 
now were flying private planes and such 
lookin like a million bucks 
you cant tell me nothing 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Now we Shinin hard 
just like we want to do 
grindin day and night 
so we can kick off our shoes 
and live a glamorous life 
look what we made it too 
we some real life hustlas 
got em lookin at you 

We grind hard ohhhh 
to play harder ohhhh 
we touch the stars ohhh 
thats what they call us ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to buy the mall up ohhh 
we grind hard ohhh 
to play harder harder---Lyrics submitted by gerald.
