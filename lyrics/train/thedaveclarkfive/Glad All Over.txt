You say that you love me (say you love me)
All of the time (all of the time)
You say that you need me (say you need me)
Youll always be mine (always be mine)

Im feeling glad all over 
Yes Im-a glad all over
Baby Im ..glad all over
So glad youre mine

Ill make you happy (make you happy)
Youll never be blue (never be blue)
Youll have no trouble (have no trouble)
Ill always be true (always be true)

Im-a feeling glad all over
Yes Im-a glad all over
Baby Im glad all over
So glad youre mine

Other girls may try to take me away (take me away)
But you know its by your side I will stayI will stay
Our love will last now (our love will last)
Till the end of time (end of time)
Because this love now (because this love)
Is only yours and mine (Yours and mine)

And Im feeling glad all over
Yes Im glad all over
Baby Im glad all over
So glad youre mine

Other girls may try to take me away (take me away)
But you know its by your side I will stay  Ill stay
Our love will last now (our love will last)
Till the end of time (end of time)
Because this love now (because this love)
Is only yours and mine (yours and mine)

And Im feeling.. glad all over
Yes Im glad all over
Baby Im-a glad all over
So glad youre mine

So glad youre mine now 
So glad youre mine now
