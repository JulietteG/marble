Ooh ah lalala (5x)

Can't get you out of my head
Thinking 'bout you while lying in bed (bed)
Your fingertips are clean
And got me must be hearing
I know I wanna do, scream your name out

I want your desire (4x)
(I want your desire)

Ooh ah lalala (3x)

The way you touch my body (body)
Make me lose control
I feel your wet lips running down the back of my neck
And all I wanna do, scream your name out

I want your desire (4x)
(I want your desire)

Touch my body
Make me feel lax
From your love
Got it burning inside
I can't deny it
When no one's there
That's a crazy love
As .............

I want your desire (4x)
(I want your desire)

Ooh ah lalala (3x)
I want your desire
Ooh ah lalala (3x)
I want your desire---Lyrics submitted by robert.
