Now were back.
with revenge!
and were gonna wait
till after the day.

we took there ships,
sunk them fast,
but the word.
is in the past.

and now!

the time has come.
so this is exacly,
what we've become.
because we are the ones,
who are always on the run

lets forge our names.
we do this every day,
we make are own way.
and take what you can get.

we've done this before
its in the past,
this is what we become,
so go now.

im facing to the west,
and my heart is beating,
we take what we need,
and we do what we want
whats yours is mine,
and mine are yours.
you better hide your cards,
cause were on are way home,
so now were gaining,
with nothing to lose,
the prize is our,
but we take yours to.

no one but the world,
take us far from here.
were coming home,
and no one can stop us.
no one but the world,
will take me home.

OH!

im facing to the west,
and my heart is beating,
we take what we need,
and we do what we want
whats yours is mine,
and mine are yours.
you better hide your cards,
cause were on are way home,
so now were gaining,
with nothing to lose,
the prize is our,
but we take yours to.

pirates life for me!!!
