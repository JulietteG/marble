oh my god somethings gone terribly wrong and i cant find my way cant someone my heart is racing faster save us form we've tried so hard and lost control of everything we've loved and owned

so this beautiful dream has become a never ending nightmare

a stranger haunts us in out sleep

were terrified were terrified 
you're the only one who knows this
your the only one and i hope you die with this on you lips on your lips 


oh my god somethings gone terribly wrong and i cant find my way cant someone my heart is racing faster save us form we've tried so hard and lost control of everything we've loved and owned

this is a disaster and i cant get past her 
im breathing and i cant feel a thing
i need a cure for this disease
and holding back wont change a thing
your words aren't enough i need to see more
lay down the sword and shed the armor

you're the only one who knows this and i hope you die with this on your lips
you're the only one who knows this and i hope you die with this on your lips you're the only one who knows this your the only one
and i hope you die with this on your lips 
your lips, die with this on your lips---Lyrics submitted by adam.
