Gonna sell my car and go to Vegas
Somebody told me
That's where dreams will be
I'm gonna sell my car and go to Vegas
Finally see my name upon the Palace Marqui

I'm gonna quit my job and move to New York
Somebody told me
That's where dreamers should go
I'm gonna quit my job and move to New york
Tattoo my body with every broad way show

CHORUS
Listen up now honey you're gonna be sorry
You can't get out form under a sky that is falling
And you say
No fame, no money I'm nobody
The way I'm running this show
Got me down on my knees
Next stop Vegas please
I gotta get to Vegas
Can you take me to Vegas?
I gotta get to Vegas

Gonna sell my house and cross the boarder
Somebody told me
Dreams live in Mexico
Gonna sell house, got to lose ten pounds
And cross the boarder
Make sweet love on the white sandy shore

CHORUS
But listen up now honey you're gonna be sorry
You can't get out from under a sky that is falling
And you say
No fame, no money I'm nobody
The way I'm running this show
Got me down on my knees
Next stop Vegas please

It's always just around the corner
Oh you're on your way to some where
That is bigger and better
If you could only get there

It's never your fault
You can't start your own winning streek
But I'll hate to lose you
To the fortune you seek

I wanna lose my mind and sail the ocean
Somebody told me
There were cherry blue skies
I want to fix my mind with a final destination
And have a deep sleep upon a sweet dream I'll never realize

CHORUS
Listen up now honey you're gonna be sorry
You can't get out from under a sky that is falling 
And you say
No fame, no money I'm nobody
The way I'm running this show
Got me down on knees
Next stop Oh Vegas please
Can you take me to Vegas?
I need to see Vegas---Lyrics submitted by Kimberly.
