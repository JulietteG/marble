Sweet young man
Goes walkin down the street wipin blood off his hands
And he doesnt look good 
But he does what he can
To erase the signs
Of the nightmare he faced at the scene of the crime
She snuck up behind him
As he knelt by her victim
Whispered, I knew youd come
But theres nothing be done
And if I was you Id run.

Cause no one cares
About what you felt
When they see any signs of guilt
You kissed its face
You held its hand
You always were a sweet young man.

Hes still a mess
So he hires a car
To take him to the fountain at Balboa park
Where he used to play
When he was young
Hes gonna wash up in front of god & everyone, everyone---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
