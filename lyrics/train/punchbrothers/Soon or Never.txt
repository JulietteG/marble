If ever I have seen the sun rise
And known it's time for bed
If ever I have breathed in deeply
And felt like I was dead
and felt like I was dead

I have not been...
I have not been in love

If ever I have seen your lips move
And known you couldn't say
The words I think could make me love you 
Then heard them anyway
And heard them anyway

I have not been...
I have not been in love

I rise as the sun goes down and pray my true
Love and I find a way to each other soon
Or never
I rise as the sun goes down and pray for my true
Love and I find a way to each other soon
Or never---Lyrics submitted by Joseph Wheaton.
