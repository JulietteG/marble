Look at us we're glowing
Tripping the dark fantastic
Singing the phosphorescent
pinks and blues
To beloved tunes
In beloved rooms
I can love it all to distraction
With this...
Look at us hold each other spellbound
Every moment a polished silver
link in a chain forever
rattling through
Our beloved tunes
In our beloved rooms
God I've loved you all to distraction
With this

This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Shine little lights of ours
Like Orion's belt of stars
Connected only from afar
Shine little lights of ours
Like Orion's belt of stars
Guide us back to where we are
From where we wanna be---
