For every calm there is a storm
But it is often out of view
It changes paths, it changes form
Just like souls, like they often do

I broke the calm, strain in the back
I was born, driven by fear
And I dont think Ill ever understand
But I know Ill be runnin for years
And I, I hope theres a higher ground, cuz Im going steadily down
And I, I know Ill be alright if I, I just get through the night

And, I love your way, 
Oh, I love you baby, dont mean maybe
I love your way,
And oh, your brighten and enlighten

Well, I been walking, I been walking sideways
Walking down the street
I wont look back for another minute
Theres nothing left to see
And I, well, I took the long way
And I, well, I took the long way---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
