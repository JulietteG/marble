All these places, part of me, it fills me up and swallows me
My emotions wrapped in vines, reaching for the sun that shines
Oh, I must say I adore you, but sometimes I seem to ignore you
That's because I don't deserve to have your love for me ever

All this time, I wanted you to know that if you're ever, ever feeling low
You can always count on, on me to be there whenever you need

Since you took my breath again, would you share your oxygen
So I can breathe one breath of air intoxicated by your stare?
Standing in the middle of the street, oh, please don't run over me
I've been trying, trying to finally reach for the sun that shines

All this time, I wanted you to know that if you're ever, ever, ever feeling low
You can always count on, on me to be there whenever you need

Oh, I love you so much, baby
You are my, you are my rising sun
Oh, I love you so much, baby
You are my, you are my setting sun

You are my rising sun
You are my setting sun
You are my rising sun
You are my setting sun---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
