You, you, cannot take anything away from me
My spirit won't break, 'cuz there's nothing left, you see
You want to take your poison arrow and pierce it through my heart
But my sad song's for the sparrow, I was dead right from the start
I was dead right from the start

I got strength in my mind, I got strength in my soul
I will never fit, fit into a mold
"Cuz, oh, I know me better than you will ever know
So why don't you just leave me, please leave me alone

Time, time, time it takes its toll but at least I've still got my soul
And there's nothing you can do to change that, 'cuz that's just the way it is
This well's gone dry, 'cuz I bled right from the start
'Cuz I bled right from the start

I got strength in my mind, I got strength in my soul
And I will never fit, fit into a mold
'Cuz, oh, I know me better than you will ever know
So why don't you just leave me, please leave me alone
Please leave me alone---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
