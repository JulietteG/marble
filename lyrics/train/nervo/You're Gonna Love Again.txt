Right to the end, right to the end,
Hearts, run, right to the end, right to the end,
People come on you don't need to be scared,
Cause you're gonna love, you're gonna love again,

Hearts, run, right to the end,
People come on you don't need to be scared,
Cause youre gonna love, you're gonna love again

You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again
You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again

Love again

Take a chance of a broken heart, cause you're starting again,
We gotta try even if it's hard, try baby, understand,
to find a rainbow in every storm, you gotta believe,
don't ever doubt that you do belong now, cause it's starting with you it's starting with me,

Hearts run right to the end,
And you're gonna love, you're gonna love again,

And you're gonna love, you're gonna love again,
Hearts run, right to the end,
People come on, you don't need to be scared,
Cause you;re gonna love, you're gonna love again,

You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again,
You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again,

Love again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
