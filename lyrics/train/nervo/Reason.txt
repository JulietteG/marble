When the puzzle connects
It's like you never forget
The way it's got to be
It's nobody's concern
Cause they don't know how it burns
When you're not here with me, whoa
So wrap my wrong in the sky
Guess I can never deny, this feeling
How can I ever stop
When I don't wanna give up, love

This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason

Cause I gave you, I gave you
And you gave me, you gave you
Is that simple, is that simple
Don't matter where you are
The feeling never stops

When the puzzle connects
It's like you never forget
The way it's got to be
It's nobody's concern
Cause they don't know how it burns
When you're not here with me, whoa
So wrap my wrong in the sky
Guess I can never deny, this feeling
How can I ever stop
When I don't wanna give up, love

This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason
This is my reason, reason, reason.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
