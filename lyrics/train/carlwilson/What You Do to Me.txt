Baby, Maybe I look like a fool;
Standing before you trying to figure out
What you do to me.
Just to see you, just to hear you speak my name;
Makes me feel so weak that I can hardly stand,
What you do to me.

What you do to me feels like poetry;
If I only knew what you do to me.

Baby! Im used to being in command;
Knowing where I stand but that was long ago,
You got through to me.
Now baby Im begging,
Dont let me do down in flames;
Dont be playing games go back & figure out
What you do to me.

What you do to me feels like poetry;
If I only knew what you do to me.
What you do to me is so heavenly,
Wish I could do to you what you do to me.

I want you keep on holding me, keep on kissing me, keep on driving me wild;
Keep on touching me and my mercury keeps on climbing way up to the sky.
What you do to me feels like poetry;
If I only knew what you do to me.
What you do to me is so heavenly,
Wish I could do to you what you do to me.

What you do to me feels like poetry;
If I only knew what you do to me.
What you do to me is so heavenly,
Wish I could do to you what you do to me. Repeat & Fade---Lyrics submitted by BILL.
