the second half right?

We started a fire;
that was never supposed to burn out.
You started a band;
that was cool for awhile but it turned pretty bland.

I started to fight; 
with the neighbor next door 
and his pesky wife.
you started a job;
that you hate when your sober 
and hate even more when you're not

I know you hate me too,
always say you do

And you moved to Japan;
thought a clean bill of health and a camera
could show you the plan.
I bought a bird that repeats what i say,
but I'm lonely is all that he's heard. 

You found a guy, 
that is clearly the opposite me 
with the black motor bike
I digged around,
but its just like a movie that's picture
is off with the sound

I know you hate me too
You always say you do

You started to write 
it was subtle at first
but the danger was clearly in sight

I don't reply
due to lack of an ego
and laziness cuts like a knife

You say that you're good
had a baby with biker 
and named him Forest Whitaker
I'm laying low
on a probable chance
you convince me to give him a home

I know you hate me too
You always say you do
I know that you hate me too
always say you do.---Lyrics submitted by Ian Robertson.
