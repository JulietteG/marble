Change this wrong 
The time is now to sing along 
Words ring out 
Truth be told 
Alarming story to be hold 
Both lopsidedly to respond to fact 
These children want their freedom back 
This land has conquered many plights 
Where does failure wrong to right 

I always thought we're better than this---
