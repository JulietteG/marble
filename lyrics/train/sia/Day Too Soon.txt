pick me up in your arms 
and carry me away from harm
you're never gonna put me down
ohhh ohhh ohhh
i know you're just one good man
we'll tire before we see land
you're never gonna put me down


(chorus)
ohhh and i been running all my life 
i run away i run away from good
yea i've been waiting all my life
your not a day your not a day to soon
ohhh ohhh ohhh
darlin i will fit you
honey i will sit you in my heart
darlin i will meet you 
darlin i will keep you in my heart


your lips are desperate just to kiss
i promise i will not resist
& promise you won't hold me down
ohhh ohhh ohhh
and when we reach a good place
let's be sure to leave no trace
i promise they won't track us down
(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by renonda.
