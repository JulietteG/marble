You're dark grey like a storm cloud
Swelling up with rain that is desperate to be let out
And I know its a heavy load carrying those tears around
Carrying those fears around
Worry makes the world go round
You're twisted up like a slipknot
Tied by a juice head, who just took his T-shirt
And I know there's a hungry dog
Tugging at your frayed ends
But hes just playing with you, he just wants to be your friend
So dont worry dont worry
Im here by your side
By your side, by your side
Were letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burning pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burning pages let them cook

Eyes stinging from the black smoke
New hope, loose rope
Risen from the undertow
All is well we welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully, follow my heart back inside
So dont worry dont worry
Im here by your side
By your side, by your side
Were letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your place into a book
Burn the pages let them cook

Dont worry dont worry
Im here by your side
By your side, by your side
Were letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook ---
