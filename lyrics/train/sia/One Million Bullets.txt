Under the moonlight
Weathering with your warm embrace
I feel so safe here
Baby we're worth the wait
Yeah I picked the wrong kind
Time after time
I drank from the poisoned wine
Yeah I picked the wrong kind
But baby you're alright
Yeah baby I seen the light

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming,
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe

How many would you take?
How many would you take?
Cause I'd take one million bullets babe

If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have
Cause I'd give my life for one your belly laughs

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming,
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe---
