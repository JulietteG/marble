You bring me to life 
Then you shut me out 
You keep me silent 
When I should shout 
You make me cry and you make me come 
You are the cop and I'm on the run 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Dont lock me up 
Dont you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love 

Then you let me out 
And I catch the sun 
You give me a taste of you and no one 
But you always leave 
And again I'm alone 
This secret burns but I'm imprisoned 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Dont lock me up 
Dont you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love 

The secret life 
Of lovers who have others 
Under the covers 
And while 
You break my heart 
Im a criminal in these parts 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Dont lock me up 
Dont you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Dont lock me up 
Dont you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love---
