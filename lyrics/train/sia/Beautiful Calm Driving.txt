Beautiful calm driving
Deep sea of pearl diving
Constantly unwinding
Beautiful calm driving

You turned into another
You turned into another
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me

Beautiful calm driving
Emotional hiding
Effortlessly shining
Beautiful calm driving

You turned into another
You turned into another
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me

Beautiful calm driving---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
