you got me pushin imaginary buttons 
step away from me lover, away from me lover
you got me counting imaginary school children
get away from me lover, away from me lover 
yes i can see that my carpet is animated 
walk away from me lover, away from me lover 
yes i see open wounds in everyone ive dated 
away from me lover, get away from me lover 

i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything i do
i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything i do 
i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything i do 
Oh oh oh oh
i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything i do 
Oh oh oh oh 

you got me turnin all the lights on and off 
walk away from me lover, away from me lover 
when will you see that i am carrying this stuff 
walk away from me lover, away from me lover 
cant you see that im losing my marbles 
its marvellous losing another, losing another 

i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything 
i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything 
i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything i do 
Oh oh oh oh 
i am no good for you 
im seeing ghosts in everything i do 
Oh oh oh oh 

Oh oh oh walk away from me lover. away from me lover 
Oh oh oh get away from me lover, away from me lover 
Oh oh oh step away from me lover, away from me lover 
Oh oh oh walk away from me lover, away from me lover---Lyrics submitted by shelbi.
