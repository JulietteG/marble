You have her pictures
you have her pictures 
you have her pictures every were
your covered in stitches, your covered in stitches
you think I can't see them but I know their there.

~chorus
Take her down from the world
and hurt your self for her
you can't keep her frozen doorman at your core
you can try to move on, triped by stitches come undone

you lost your big heart, you lost your big heart
you lost your big heart being bare
she gave yuou a new start, she gave you a new start
But you know you lost her to dispare

(oh, oh, oh)
(chorus)

Your skin burns and prickles, your skin burns and prickles
Your skin burns and prickles when shes near...
You try to play it cool, you try to play it cool
You try to play it cool but your filled with fear

(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh , oh,oh,oh)
(chorus)

Take her down from the world
Let her go make her yours
You can't keep her frozen, doorman at your core
you can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone
you can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone
you can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone
you can try to move on, Or maybe she is the one...---Lyrics submitted by Adrienne.
