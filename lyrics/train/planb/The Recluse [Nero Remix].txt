Oh yeah, they call me the recluse
'Cause I don't go outside for nothing, no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothing, no way
You say I'm being a fool
Yes so I don't care about being cool
What's it to you?
If I just stay here in this hole that I boarded into
[x3]

Oh yeah, they call me the recluse [x2]
You say I'm being a fool
What's it to you?
Oh yeah, they call me the recluse [x2]

I ain't trying to impress anyone in this cesspit jail
I just don't care
I ain't gotta smell fresh for a woman
So I'm blessed not washing my skin or my hair
They can call me a recluse
They ain't gonna remove or cut me loose from this place
I'm locked in hiding
Like a rocker wall moves
'Cause you know I've gotten used to the space that I'm occupying
There really ain't anything out there on the win they'd enjoy more than see me crying
So I do it in my room where none of these goons can see me
Though I know they've been trying
I ain't cut out for this shit, I'm a coward I admit
I've never been no big thing
The thought of killing makes me sick
But I don't wanna be no victim no way not Strickland
So I just stay in my cell like I'm bricked in and hope that stops me from getting kicked in
Even if it earns me this nickname in prison
Yeah, they call me the recluse ---Lyrics submitted by taz graham.
