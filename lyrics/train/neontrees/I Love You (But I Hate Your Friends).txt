I drew my name in lipstick on a mirror at your sister's house
She told me I was strange, I told her thanks, and kissed her on the mouth
But you dont go that way
I thought you had a thing for fancy boys
Looks can be deceiving

I love you
But I hate your friends
They are desperate
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
This emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?

They never lock on music
They bitch about it and call it used to be
So now I cant refuse it
I dig your playing sexuality
Oh you say Im not that easy
Im not sure what the hell you take me for
Honey, Looks can be deceiving

I love you
But I hate your friends
They are desperate
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
This emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?

Theyre always on to the next big thing
They wanna buy but they cant barely stand
I never wanted you for just a friend
I hated when you lied to me
But I just let you lie to me

I love you
But I hate your friends
They are desperate
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
This emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?

I love you

I love you
But I hate your friends

I love you

I love you

But I hate your friends ---
