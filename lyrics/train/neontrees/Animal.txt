here we go again
i kinda wanna be more then friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied

Here we go again,
We're sick like animals we play pretend
You're just a cannibal 
and I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for, 
what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Here we are again, 
I feel the chemicals kicking in
Its getting heavy and I want run and hide,
 I want to run and hide

I do it every time
You're killing me now, 
And I won't be denied by you,
The animal inside of you

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for,
 what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Hush hush the world is quiet
Hush hush we both can't fight it
Its us that made this mess
Why can't you understand

Oh I won't sleep tonight, 
I wont sleep tonight

Here we go again
 (here we go again)

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for, 
what are you waiting for, 
what are you waiting

Here we go again, 
oh oh here we go again, 
oh oh here we go again,
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Say goodbye to my heart tonight---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
