All my friends
They're different people
Anxious like the Ocean in the storm
When we go out
Yeah, we're electric
Coursin' through our bodies til we're warm

And why mess up a good thing baby?
It's a risk to even fall in love
So when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
Cuz this is trouble
Yeah, this is trouble

I said, ooh ooh
You got me in the mood mood
I'm scared but if my heart's gonna break before the night will end
I said, ooh ooh
We're in danger
Sleeping with a friend

All my friends
Stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don't go out
Much like I used to
Something about the strangers and the noise

And why leave when I got you baby
It's a risk but babe, I need the thrill
I never said you'd be easy
But if it was all up to me
I'd be no trouble
Yeah, we're in trouble

I said, ooh ooh
You got me in the mood mood
I'm scared but if my heart's gonna break before the night will end
I said, ooh ooh
We're in danger
Sleeping with a friend

We are both young
Hot blooded people
We don't wanna die alone
To become one
It could be lethal
Sleeping with a friend

All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends

Oh I said, ooh ooh
You got me in the mood mood
I'm scared but if my heart's gonna break before the night will end
I said, ooh ooh
We're in danger
Sleeping with a friend

(All my friends)
Sleeping with a friend
(All my friends)

If my heart's gonna break before the night will end
I said, ooh ooh
We're in danger
Sleeping with a friend---
