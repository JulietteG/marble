Nothing you could do
could ever stop my baby
Nothing you could say
could tear us two apart
We've got all the spark
to set this place on fire
We got making love
right down to a fine art

Nothing you could do
could ever stop this feeling
Nothing in the world
could ever shake us up
We've got all the stuff to
break all of the rules, yeah
We've got all the stuff
to mess all of you up

We got a mad, mad love
We got a mad, mad love
We got a really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
mad love

Nothing you could do
could ever stop this burning
Nothing you could say
could ever stop this fire
Tell me I'm a fool
for everything that we do
Tell me we're a mess
and I'll tell you you're a liar

Nothing you could do
could ever stop this feeling
Nothing in the world
could ever shake us up
We've got all the stuff to
break all of the rules, yeah
We've got all the stuff
to mess all of you up

We got a mad, mad love
We got a mad, mad love
We got a really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
mad love

When you're sad you can
put your head on my shoulder, oh yeah
And maybe together we can
grow a little bit older

We got a mad, mad love
We got a mad, mad love
We got a really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
mad love

We got a mad, mad love
(When you're sad you can
put your head on my shoulder)
We got a mad, mad love
(And maybe together we can
grow a little bit older)
We got a really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
mad love

We got a mad, mad love
(When you're sad you can
put your head on my shoulder)
We got a mad, mad love
(And maybe together we can
grow a little bit older)
We got a really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
really, really, really,
really, really, really, really,
mad love

Nothing you could do
could ever stop my baby
Nothing you could say
could tear us two apart ---Lyrics submitted by cristina reyes.
