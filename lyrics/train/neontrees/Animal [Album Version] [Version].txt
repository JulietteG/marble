Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than  friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals 
We play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight...

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you wain' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin' heavy and I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you.

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.

Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Oh, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again (Here we go again, here we go again..,)

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin?

Here we go again, oh, oh
Here we go again, oh, oh
Here we go again, oh, oh
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Oh, oh, I want some more
Oh, oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight...---Lyrics submitted by Blank.
