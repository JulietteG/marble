I treat it like a high school dance
Waiting in the wings for my big chance
But I would only stare at my shoes
You belong to me I belong to you

I could tell an antique lie
Full of all the things I want to hide
But that would only lead to the truth
You belong to me I belong to you

But I'm lazy and I'll pull you down
Where you won't want to be
And I'm tasting what's pouring out of you
What am I supposed to do?

I could play a trick so strange
Cover up my ears and pray for rain
But that would only give you the blues
You belong to me I belong to you---Lyrics submitted by Luis Iriarte.
