Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
 I can always see 'em coming from the left and from the right
 I don't want to be a priss, I just try to be polite
 But it always seems to bite me in the 

Ask me for my number, yeah you put me on the spot
 You think that we should hook-up, but I think that we should not
 You had me at hello, then you opened up your mouth
 And that is when it started going south
 Oh! 

Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
 Stop your staring at my Hey! 
Take a hint, take a hint
 No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
 I think you could use a mint
 Take a hint, take a hint
 La, La, La... 
T-take a hint, take a hint
 La, La, La... 
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/victoria_justice/take_a_hint.html ]
 I guess you still don't get it, so let's take it from the top
 You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was Stop
 And if I only had a dime for every name that you just dropped
 You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht
 Oh! 

Get your hands off my hips, or I'll punch you in the lips

Stop your staring at my Hey! 
Take a hint, take a hint
 No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
 I think you could use a mint
 Take a hint, take a hint
 La, La, La... 
T-take a hint, take a hint
 La, La, La... 

What about "no" don't you get
 So go and tell your friends
 I'm not really interested
 It's about time that you're leavin'
 I'm gonna count to three and
 Open my eyes and
 You'll be gonna

One.
 Get your hands off my
 Two.
 Or I'll punch you in the
 Three.
 Stop your staring at my
 Hey! 
Take a hint, take a hint
 I am not your missing link
 Let me tell you what I think
 I think you could use a mint
