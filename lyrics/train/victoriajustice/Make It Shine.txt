Here I am
 Once again
 Feeling lost but now and then
 I breathe it in
 To let it go
 And you don't know
 Where you are now
 What it would come to
 If only somebody could hear
 When you figure out how
 You're lost in the moment
 You disappear

 You don't have to be afraid
 To put your dreams in action
 You're never gonna fade
 You'll be the main attraction
 Not a fantasy
 Just remember me
 When it turns out right
 Cause you know that if your live in
 Your imagination
 Tomorrow you'll
 Be everybody's fascination
 In my victory
 Just remember me
 When I make it shine
 [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/victoria_justice/make_it_shine.html ]
 Reaching high feeling low
 I'm holding on and letting go
 I like to shine I'll shine for you
 And it's time to
 Show the world how
 It's a little bit closer
 As long as I'm ready to go
 All we have is right now
 As long as you feel it inside you know

 You don't have to be afraid
 To put your dream in action
 Your never gonna fade
 You'll be the main attraction
 Not a fantasy
 Just remember me
 When it turns out right

Cause you know that if you live in
 Your imagination
 Tomorrow you'll
 Be everybody's fascination
 In my victory
 Just remember me
 When I make it shine

Everyone can tell you how
 It's all been said and done (woah)
 That harder times can change your mind
 And make you wanna run
 But you want it
 And you need it
 Like you need to breathe the air
 If they doubt you 
Just believe it
 That's enough to get you there

 You don't have to be afraid
 To put your dream in action
 Your never gonna fade
 You'll be the main attraction
 Not a fantasy
 Just remember me
 When it turns out right
 Cause you know that if you live in
 Your imagination
 Tomorrow you'll
 Be everybody's fascination
 In my victory
 Just remember me
 When I make it SHINE!---Lyrics submitted by Holleigh Baker 15.
