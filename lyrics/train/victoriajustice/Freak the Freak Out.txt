Are you listenin'?
Hear me talk, hear me sing
Open up the door
Is it less, Is it more
When you tell me to beware
Are you here are you there?
Is there something I should know?
Easy come, easy go
Nodding your head
Don't hear a word I said.
I can't communicate,
When you wait,
Don't relate,

I try to talk to you,
But you never even knew,
So what's it gonna be? 
Tell me, can you hear me? (hear me? hear me?)
I'm so sick of it.
Your attention deficit,
Never listen,
You never listen,
I'm so sick of it,
So I'll throw another fit,
Never listen, You never listen,

I scream your name!
It always stays the same,
I scream and shout!
So what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out!
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

Patience running thin, 
Running thin, come again,
Tell me what i get opposite, opposite
Show me what is real,
If it breaks does it heal,
Open up your ear
Why you think that I'm here
Keep me in the dark
Are you even thinking of me?
Is someone else above me?
Gotta know, Gotta know
What am i gonna do
cause i can't get through to you
So what's it gonna be?
Tell me can you hear me?

I'm so sick of it.
Your attention deficit.
Never listen
You never listen
I'm so sick of it
So I'll throw another fit
never listen, You never listen.

I scream your name!
It always stays the same.
I scream and shout!
So what I'm gonna do
Now is freak the freak out.
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. (x2)

Easy come, easy go(x2)
Can you hear me?

I scream your name!
It always stays the same.
I scream and shout!
So what I'm gonna do
Now is freak the freak out.
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (x2)

Now is freak the freak out. [x15]
Ohhhhhhhh...
I scream your name!
But you never listen!
Ohhhhhhhh...
No You never listen!
But You never listen.---Lyrics submitted by Brynja.
