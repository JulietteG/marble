Ive tried to let it go
But these butterflies I cant ignore
Cause every time that I look at you
Know were in a catch 22
Weve been friends for so long but I
Need to tell you whats on my mind
Im sick and tired of playing games
Cause I know that you feel the same

I Know you inside out, so Im asking now
Take a chance on me
How much clearer can I be?

Hey, boy, watcha gonna do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
Im Gold, Gold
You, me, good as can be, want to be more than your company
So bet your money on me
Im Gold, Gold

Do I really need to spell it out?
My heart skips when you're around
I got everything that you need
So come on baby get close to me
So confused that I'm not surprised
From greater bells, and rolled the dice
Know all your moves, don't know why I fall
Should put me out, but I want it all

I Know you inside out, so Im asking now
Take a chance on me
How much clearer can I be?

Hey, boy, watcha gonna do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
Im Gold, Gold
You, me, good as can be, want to be more than your company
So bet your money on me
Im Gold, Gold

Na ra ta la la
Im Gold, Gold
Na ra ta la la
Im Gold, Gold

Been to cool just to tell you straight out but by now I wish you figured it out I wish you figured it I wish you figured it I wish ya
Youre not a fool you see what Im about, so by now I think you figured it out I think you figured it out I think you figured it out I think ya!

Hey, boy, watcha gonna do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
Im Gold, Gold
You, me, good as can be, want to be more than your company
So bet your money on me
Im Gold, Gold

Na ra ta la la
Im Gold, Gold
Na ra ta la la
Im Gold, Gold---
