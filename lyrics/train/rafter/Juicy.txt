Peaceful feelings from beyond the grave
curtins drawn to avoid the shade
oh we've heard - good - things from the lovers.

Everyones got to go to sleep, everyone some day
will die, but the lovers have told us that they're
livin' forever. Ahhh

But don't you count all your blessings be-fore they
happen or, they won't happen at all.

You've gotta live for your blessings or, they wont
happen no, they won't happen at all.

Peaceful feelings from the beyond the grave.
My faith is swimmin' but I have not changed
it just wilted and fell off the moment that I...died~

Peaceful feelings from the beyond the grave; Well
the lovers are lucky that they've got it made oh but
our lives will be cut short... by accident

woah

Don't you count all your blessings be-fore they
happen or, they won't happen at all.

You've gotta live for your blessings to, make them 

happen or, they won't happen at all.

Oh don't you count all your blessings before they 

happen or, they wont happen at all.

You've gotta live for your blessings or, they won't 

happen, no, they won't happen at all.

Talk to her, Talk to her; you little lovers---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
