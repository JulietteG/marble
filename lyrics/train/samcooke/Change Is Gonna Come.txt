I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oooooh and just like the river
I've been runnin ever since

It's been a long
Long time comin' 
But I know a change gone come
Oh yes it will

It's been too hard to live it
But I'm afraid to die
Cuz I dont know what's up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long 
Long time comin'
But I know a change gone come
Oh yes it will

I go to the movie
And I go downtown
But somebody keep tellin' me
Don't hang around

It's been a long 
Long time comin'
But I know a change gone come
Oh yes it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say brother help me please
But he winds up 
Knockin' me
Back down on my knees

Ohhhhhhh
There have been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But I know I think 
I'm able to carry on

It's been a long 
A long time comin'
But I know a change gone come
Oh yes it will---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
