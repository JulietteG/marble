[Intro:]

Im glad you came back, Man.
I talk slick baby, Pay attention, I love you. 
Hey..

[Chorus:]

You get down, I get down too.
Ma how you, I said how you, hu.
I love your grace, nice style too. 
I said how you, I said how you, hu
You got some bad bitches around you.
Ma how you, I said how you, hu.
They get around, I get around too.
I said how you, ma how you, hu.

[Verse 1:]

Baby, tell me what is this, dont get it twisted.
I aint really trying to be all in your business.
But listen, Im what your missing.
Misses, its just you seem so different from all of these bitches.
How you? Mama I can wow you, 
You dont know how, I can show you how to.
Yea, I love your face, your grace, I love your style too.
So we can do whatever if youre down too.
I aint trying to crowd you, or be all around you.
Ma I do my thing, Im the king that they bow to.
Theres something about you, 
Make me wana see you cookin breakfast
With nothing on but a t-shirt and house shoes.
Damn.. good girls love bad guys.
Even though we tell them mad lies.
But when you pass by, lookin nerves like your mad shy.
Man I, never seen a women look that fly.

[Chorus:]

You get down, I get down too.
Ma how you, I said how you, hu.
I love your grace, nice style too. 
I said how you, I said how you, hu
You got some bad bitches around you.
Ma how you, I said how you, hu.
They get around, I get around too.
I said how you, ma how you, hu.

[Verse 2:]

I know you heard of me, 
Flow gives burns to the third degree.
Treat beef like burger meat.. Eat,
Boyfriend is sherbet sweet. haha
Youve been living life blind, 
With me.. You gana learn to see. 
Every week in new landscape, 
We make time freeze, we make them slam breaks
I make your toes curl, I make your hands shake.
Ill give it to you till you cant stand straight,
Had you on lockdown, had your hands taped.
Leave them boys alone, recognize a mans face.
You damn straight, I put the suckers on standby.
Like stand by watch while the man fly
I cant lie, I cant let this chance by.
I wana see you laugh, I wana see you make cry.
I wana show the whole world, man I.. 
Never seen a woman look that fly, you heard.

[Chorus 2x:]

You get down, I get down too.
Ma how you, I said how you, hu.
I love your grace, nice style too. 
i said how you, i said how you, hu
You got some bad bitches around you.
Ma how you, I said how you, hu.
They get around, I get around too.
I said how you, ma how you, hu.---Lyrics submitted by Ranoosh.
