Im jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
Its closer than my hands have been
Im jealous of the rain
Im jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
Its closer than your shadow
Oh, Im jealous of the wind

'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
Theres nothing to forgive
But I always thought youd come back
Tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
Its hard for me to say
Im jealous of the way
Youre happy without me

Im jealous of the nights
That I dont spend with you
Im wondering who you lay next to
Oh, Im jealous of the nights
Im jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, Im jealous of the love

'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
Theres nothing to forgive
But I always thought youd come back
Tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
Its hard for me to say
Im jealous of the way
Youre happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind this smile

I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
Theres nothing to forgive
But I always thought youd come back
Tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
Its hard for me to say
Im jealous of the way
Youre happy without me

Its hard for me to say
Im jealous of the way
Youre happy without me---
