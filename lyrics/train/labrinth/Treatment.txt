(hoh-oh baby, oh baby)
(hoh-oh baby, oh baby)

Cowgirl, cowgirl why did you leave me high and dry?
You had a heart but then you put a hole in mine

Listen - I wanna break down
You don't understand the damage you've done now
Let me remind you that
I had a heart and you came inside
Turned the whole place upside down

Now I'm out of my mind
Like it's a mental asylum
Everyone dressed in white
I really think I've lost it this time

Yeah, I wanna break down
You don't understand the damage you've done now
Let me remind you that boys don't cry
Isn't it clear that I need treatment?

(hoh-oh baby, oh baby)
(hoh-oh baby, oh baby)

All day, all night see I could go from dusk til dawn (whoah)
Thinking about how you left me crushed and torn (whoah)

I wanna break down (come on)
You don't understand the damage you've done now (come on)
Let me remind you that (uh huh)
I had a heart and you came inside
Turned the whole place upside down

Now I'm out of my mind
Like it's a mental asylum
Everyone dressed in white
I really think I've lost it this time

Yeah, yeah, I wanna break down (uh huh)
You don't understand the damage you've done now (uh huh)
Let me remind you that boys don't cry
Isn't it clear that I need treatment?

Cause I'm insane in the membrane, so crazy, you make me, yeah
Insane in the membrane, look what you've created

Look what you did
Look what you did
My baby, oh, no, no
Isn't it clear that I need treatment?
Treatment

Waoh oh oh oh

Now I'm out of my mind
Like it's a mental asylum
Everyone dressed in white
I really think I've lost it this time

Yeah, yeah, I wanna break down
You don't understand the damage you've done now
Let me remind you that boys don't cry
Isn't it clear that I need treatment?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
