I think I might have said too much
About a bag of gold
That I have hiding in the line of my coat
I think they probably know too much
About the things I've done
Cause there all breathing just a little too close

Vultures are waiting
There waiting to take me
But not this time

(Chorus)
Had a taste of the dream
Come to find it's not as sweet as I thought it would be
See these shadows over me
In the desert of my mind
Friends like water, hard to find
Is there no one left to trust
Vultures circle up above
Ohhhhhh
There flying, flying, flying
Ohhhhhh
But I won't be dying, dying, dying vulture
Vulture

I see them all sniff around, damn I'm stuck
Cause I'm too tired to get up right now
They all think I'm dead, so serve me up
But over my dead body you better try your luck

Vultures are waiting
There waiting to take me
But not this time

(chorus)
Had a taste of the dream
Come to find it's not as sweet as I thought it would be
See these shadows over me
In the desert of my mind
Friends like water, hard to find
Is there no one left to trust
Vultures circle up above

Ohhhhhh
There flying, flying, flying
Ohhhhhh
But I won't be dying, dying, dying
Ohhhhhh
There flying, flying, flying
Ohhhhhh
But I won't be dying, dying, dying vulture
Ohhh yeah

Why don't you let me be
Leave me with what I deserve
Saying ohhh yeah, yeah
I'll go on living now
There's nothing left ohh scavengers
Give up, give up, 
ohhh
Ohhhhh
Yeahhhh
I'm not
I'm not
Vultures circle up above
Ohhhh, yeahhh (x2)
Ohhhh, no no
Come on, come on, come on yeah
I wont be dying
Ohhhh no---Lyrics submitted by chloe shaw.
