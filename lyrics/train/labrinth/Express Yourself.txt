I say the same thing twice I'm awkward when I speak
Ain't got the perfect smile don't turn heads on my street
Trying to be a superstar like everybody else
But being myself is something I do well
Whatever you do, do it good
Whatever you do, do, do, do, lord, lord, lord
Do it good, alright

Express yourself, express yourself, whoa do it
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, whoa do it

I don't make the papers and fall from dos
Ain't got the x factor I'm not what they expect
But it won't be long before my turn is next, to express
Now without you expect
See whatever I do, I do it good
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
So whatever you do, do, do, do, lord, lord, lord
Do it good,

Express yourself, express yourself, whoa do it
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, whoa do it

Tear them up in too high
Show them what you got, whoa
It's nothing wrong with perfect and perfect
Now it's your time to shine
Express yourself, click your fingers now
Express yourself, come on,

See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, whoa do it
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Come on now, yeah, come on, now.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
