[Kanye] 
I wanna see whats under there there now put it in the air 
Yeah load it on my macbook air 
Its a new form of macking don't be old fashioned update your passion 
Only reason I be eye chattin its when its time for some action 
I wanna hit it way way out like john paxton 
But for now I just gotta watch her practice 
Send her a picture so she see it she said 
I-i-i cant believe it 
Uh-uh-uh-uh she all on me on me 
Uh-uh-uh-uh I think she want me want me 
I think she showed her homies 
Why? cause all the homies on me 
Ayo all the digital gunna have to do for now 
But imma break it down when I get by your town 

[Jamie] 
I love it girl 
The way you bring your light into this room 
I love it girl 
The way you lace that up when you in them shoes 
I love it girl 
The way your lip looks after you apply the gloss 
I love you girl girl 
You look right in the screen and take it off off 

See I cant wait till I get a little taste of you 
And I just upgraded to 10-80-i hi def just for you 

My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl 
Shes my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
Shes my digital girl 

[Jamie] 
My homies never seen 
But I always got you right here for me 
Tucked in my louis computer bag 
Wherever you are I could be 
I type you messages for the next send off 
You shoot me a video and then I load 
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent 
One day ill have your ass up in this kitchen 

My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
Shes my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
Shes my digital girl 

Not a day goes by shawty 
Without you on my mind shawty 
??
I wanna see whats under there 

[Kanye] 
When you see the picture cut off the face 
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist 
Let the MC search till I reach third base 
And when I get home imma hit home plate 
Wait would this be considered our first date 
Yay this picture just looks so trash 
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash 
Plus every good girl wanna go bad 
And poles in the mag like Stacy dash 
Or Kim Cardash and be a lady addict 
You know whats a crazy thing 
A girl would make you wait longer than ac green 
Passion of the Christ 33 year old virgin 
Thats disrespectful baby don't encourage him 
I like them brown yellow Puerto Rican or Persian 
Dashiki kimona or turban 
They say I dress white but my swag so urban 
Tryin' my work 
I hear the way the text say 
Baby you up 
Question mark 
And she was my yes-s-s-i-r 

[Outro - The-Dream & Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl 
Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl---Lyrics submitted by kyshawndre.
