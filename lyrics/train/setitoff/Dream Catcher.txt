Oh, I've been sitting here for hours
As I wish for this to start
I set my standards high
In hopes they will not fall apart

It's almost like I fell asleep
My doubts have seemed to fade
Because I've opened up my eyes to see
I'm right where I planned to be
Today!
Today!

Cast your nets, cast it out
And I hope to god you'll scream and shout
It's everything you wanted, maybe more

Anyone can dream through the night
But only some can dream with eyes wide
There lies the fight inside
It resides in everyone
They will proclaim you a fool
And it reminds you to do
Anything and everything to prove them a liar

It's almost like I fell asleep
My doubts have seemed to fade
Because I've opened up my eyes to see
I'm right where I planned to be
Today!
Today!

Cast your nets, cast it out
And I hope to god you'll scream and shout
It's everything you wanted, maybe more

Does it seem out of reach?
Hit the ground, and run with both your feet
Here's a lesson that I hope to teach
Believe you'll be a dream catcher

Cry out loud and take the stage
And don't let skeptics slow your pace
With every forward step you'll take
Their breath away
Their breath away

Believe, believe they'll spit their words
And some will say it seems absurd
But devour the cynics,
Dismiss the critics,
And mark my words
They'll regret it when you...

...cast your nets, cast it out
And I hope to god you'll scream and shout
It's everything you wanted, maybe more
Today!
Today!

Cast your nets, cast it out
And I hope to god you'll scream and shout
It's everything you wanted, maybe more

Does it seem out of reach?
Hit the ground, and run with both your feet
Here's a lesson that I hope to teach
Believe you'll be a dream catcher
Please believe you'll be a dream catcher
Please believe you'll be a dream catcher ---Lyrics submitted by Jessi Valentine.
