I'm here today, only for a little while
Knowing these moments always end
I seldom have the time to rest or stay
Usually by morning I'm on my way

I hope I didn't cause you any pain
Oh, but when I leave tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again

Sometimes I feel just like a wanderer
With no special place to call my home
I wish that I could spend more time with you
But leaving isn't really what I wanna do

I hope I didn't cause you any pain
Oh, but when I leave tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again

When you're lonely you search for a lover
You search for a friend, mmm
When you're lonely you don't stop to think
Of the way it will end

And so the hours just keep on passing by
With no regard for how we feel inside
Love just comes and goes and never wonders why
But this it's so very hard to say goodbye

I hope I didn't cause you any pain
Oh, but when I leave tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again, yeah

I hope I didn't cause you any pain
Oh, but when I leave tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again

Try and understand me
I hope I didn't cause you any pain
Oh, but when I leave tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again, yeah, yeah

I hope I didn't cause you any pain
Oh, but when I leave tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again ---
