Wheels turning for the yearning 
The burning that I feel inside 
It`s turning me around 
Upside down,can`t control it though I try 

Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From lovin you girl (uh baby) 
Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From lovin you girl, hey 

Imagination,concentration, 
Pure delight all through the night 
A world of ecstacy has taken over me, 
Just dont hurry mornin light, hey 

Cant you feel it? 
Cant you feel it? 
Uh I love it, uh I love it 
I just want you with me 

Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From lovin you girl (uh baby) 
Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From lovin you girl (yeah 5x) 
Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From lovin you girl 

Cant you see 
I need you girl 
Cant you see, cant you see 

Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From lovin you girl (uh baby) 
Just one moment away 
Is too far away 
From kissin you girl (uh sugar) 
Just one moment away 
Is too far away from squeezing you baby---
