(feat. AlunaGeorge and Rae Sremmurd)

I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
I dont ever wanna be complete
I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
And I never wanna be empty

I just bought the Senzu Bean
I said, just bought the Senzu Bean
Mamma, where I leave my memory?
Probably the same place I left my ID, hey
Y-3s gave a young nigga wings
I sneeze, gave a young nigga steez
5 Gs fall like leaves in the spring
Im gonna run it like police when we comin
1800s bubblin in a niggas stomach
3 girls, so that mean Im here jugglin
She might have a man, I might have a girl
But neither one of em at the club, so who give a fuck?
Arrived on the scene with some booty shakin hoes and they not the twerk team
All these hoes got their hands on their knees
I said, all these hoes got their hands on their knees

I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
And I never wanna be empty
I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
And I never wanna be empty

Going clubbing
I beat a pussy up, left a girl on crutches
Im going clubbing (damn)
You know that Im out there, gonna slice up the dutchess
Going clubbing (hes going clubbing)
Tell em when she ready, just hit me on my phone
Going clubbing
If you got some proof friends, bitch dont come along
Let me make a scene
Ooh, if you bad I might just put you in a ring
Ooh, if you bad I might just buy you that machine
Ooh, if you bad I might just dress you so clean
How you wear your hair
Make a nigga wanna buy you this
Take you down to Paris and ice out your wrist
Do you like a nigga, damn when he was a 6?

I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
And I never wanna be empty
I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
And I never wanna be empty

All I really needs one touch
I want you to put it right here on me
All I needs one touch
I want you to put it right here
All I really needs one touch
I want you to put it right here on me
All I needs one touch
I want you to put it right here

Youre gonna make drag your ass over here
I dont mind cuz I have no fear
In your eyes, its written clear, its written clear
Youre gonna make me drop my top to the floor
I dont mind, but I need some more
So be kind and make me sure, make me sure
I will make you a sunset view
I will make it so youre gonna want to
Get your hands involved with me
And I never wanna be empty

All I really needs one touch
I want you to put it right here on me
All I really needs one touch
I want you to put it right here ---
