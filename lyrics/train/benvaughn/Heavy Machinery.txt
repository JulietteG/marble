We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, but when it comes to my love
We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, when it comes to my love

Well the hearts and flowers baby they're alright
(But) they can't compare to when I'm holding you at night

We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, when it comes to my love
I'm talkin' heavy machinery baby, but when it comes to my love

I got to get close, what more can I say
I'm movin' a mountain baby, gets in my way

We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, but when it comes to my love
We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, when it comes to my love
When it comes to my love
When it comes to my love
When it comes to my love

When I first saw you the buttons you pressed
You set me in motion, baby you know the rest

We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, but when it comes to my love
We're talkin' heavy machinery baby, when it comes to my love
When it comes to my love
When it comes to my love
When it comes to my love... Etc...---Lyrics submitted by Philippe.
