(Feat. Aprille Goodman)

Verse I
Awoken by the weight of self-comparison
Walking by direction, less ambition
Distracted by the pace of life as time moves on
Forgot about my heart and lost my vision

Truth rings louder than my fears
So I sing along
Hope cracked all my prison walls
They came falling

Chorus
This is who I am
I cannot except 
What I want is just for someone else
I cannot pretend to care less than I do
I will spend the rest of my life true

Verse II
Wallowing in pain over rejection
Treading in the doubt of my decision
Carrying heavy loads of bitterness
Hand-cup my heart over my vision

Truth rings louder than my fears
So I sing along
Hope cracked all my prison walls
They came falling

Chorus

Bridge
I am only ordinary when Im someone else
I can be extraordinary when Im not myself---Lyrics submitted by Cool Beans.
