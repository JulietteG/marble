(Feat. Tiff Lacey)
Oh, your faith

How did it feel to leave it all behind
How did it feel to live in fear  of your life
And what dare they said came to pause
It was not in your head
You never needed to look
Cause your faith, your faith got you through
You just knew, you just knew

You placed your faith upon a dream
So love finally came in the eyes of a Nazarene---Lyrics submitted by Cool Beans.
