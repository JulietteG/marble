How was she to know as she ran and slammed the door 
That the angry words she spoke were the last words she would breathe 
How was she to see eternity between the red light and the green 
It all ended suddenly 

Cause tomorrow isn't promised 
All we have is one life, is one time 
To live and love and make it right 
Yesterday is written 
All we have is right now, is right now 
To celebrate this one and only life 

He always loved the rain and the sound of a thunderstorm 
He had to look for cover as the wave overtook the shore 
He watched helplessly as everything he owned 
And everyone he'd ever known, in a moment was all gone 

Cause tomorrow isn't promised 
All we have is one life, is one time 
To live and love and make it right 
Yesterday is written 
All we have is right now, is right now 
To celebrate this one and only life 

Sometimes we can't control 
When or where or how life goes 
We live our life for love 
We can dream and pray and hope 

She dropped him off at school as she kissed her son goodbye 
Was no way she would know it would be for the very last time 
Later came the news, the violent tragedy 
The whole town prays how could this be? 
How could this be? 

Cause tomorrow isn't promised 
All we have is one life, is one time 
To live and love and make it right 
Yesterday is written 
All we have is right now, is right now 
To celebrate this one and only 
Life is too short gotta make it right 
Yesterday's gone and all we got is right now, is right now 
To celebrate this one and only 
Life is too short gotta make it right 
Yesterday's gone and all we got is right now, is right now 
To celebrate this one and only life---
