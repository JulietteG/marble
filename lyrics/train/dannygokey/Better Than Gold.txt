She's better than gold

The day that my whole life changed
Was the moment I laid eyes on her
The way she took my breath away
I fell so hard in fact it hurt

She made me feel just like I discovered
Something precious and rare (so rare)
Made me come alive
Took me from my zero to a millionaire

She's like the woman I need
She makes my world complete
She snuck right out of my dreams
I know she's better than gold
She makes my life so sweet
Special delivery from heaven straight to me
I know she's better than gold

She's mine, all mine, she's better than gold
She's fine, so fine, she's better than gold
She's mine, all mine, she's better than gold
She's better than gold

You're my special lady
Forever you my baby

All my friends are saying, "slow down"
There's so much treasure I have left to see
But she's got me sold out
I'm richer than a man deserves to be

She makes me feel just like
I discovered something precious and rare
Perfectly designed, she's a living work of art without compare

She's like the woman I need
She makes my world complete
She snuck right out of my dreams
I know she's better than gold
She makes my life so sweet
Special delivery from heaven straight to me
I know she's better than gold

She's mine, all mine, she's better than gold
She's fine, so fine, she's better than gold
She's mine, all mine, she's better than gold
She's better than gold---
