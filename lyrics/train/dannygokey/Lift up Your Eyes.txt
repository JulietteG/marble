Light of lights eternal hope has come
By and by to lead us back to love
Come behold a manger for a bed
Where the King of Kings has laid his head
Light of lights eternal hope has come

Hear the angel's song break the silent night
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
See the saving One born that none may die
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
Glory to God let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
Glory to God let the earth reply
Lift up your eyes

Come and lay your offering at his feet
Where the sons of earth and heaven meet
Let the joy awaken every heart
Born into the night the morning star
Come and lay your offering at his feet

Hear the angel's song break the silent night
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
See the saving One born that none may die
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
Glory to God let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
Glory to God let the earth reply
Lift up your eyes

And he shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Almighty God
And he shall be called Prince of Peace, Lord of Host, the Hope for all

Can you hear the angel's song break the silent night
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
See the saving One born that none may die
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
Glory to God let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes
Glory to God let the earth reply
Lift up your eyes---
