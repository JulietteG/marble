You were everything I need
You were the only air I'd breathe
You were the method to my madnesses
The fact I chose to let you go
Rapes me from head down to my toes
Especially knowing you're the one for me

I didn't mean the things I said
If I could take them back again I would
But you're not home tonight
I didn't mean to break your heart
If I could fix it even start I would
But you're not home to-, you're not home tonight

You weren't the first to hold my key
But you were the one who set me free
You were the answer to my problems and I solved them
And I'll wake everyday and I'll wonder
In this place where you're no longer there
Is it fate, my mistakes will remain being all I have, don't say that its over

I didn't mean the things I said
If I could take them back again I would
But you're not home tonight
I didn't mean to break your heart
If I could fix it even start I would
But you're not home to-, you're not home tonight

What have I done
What have I done again
What have I done
What have I done again
What have I done
What have I done again
What have I done
What have I done again

I didn't mean the things I said
If I could take them back again I would
And tell you you were right
I didn't mean to break your heart
If I could fix it even start I would
But you're not home tonight
I didn't mean the things I said
I didn't mean the things I said
I didn't mean the things I said---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
