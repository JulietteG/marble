Oh, Mattie, open up the door
That's right, I'm home again
You've got a big surprise in store
Turn around and count to ten

Wait 'til you see what I got you
Well, you'll say it's a magic thing
It's like an old mandolin man
You just wind him up and he'll start to sing

I've been away for quite awhile
And I want to hear all your news
Speak to me, let me see you smile
'Cause I've had those homesick blues

When I go down to the city I
Just don't know wrong from right
When I get back to you, Mattie, well
You make me see the light

Love is a singular thing
It can take you up or bring you down
Yes, love is a song that I sing
So come on now, Mattie, listen to this sound

When you grow up we'll sit and talk
Of how things used to be
I'll be your grand old man of rock
With all these memories---Lyrics submitted by Susan Williams.
