See the dark night has come down on us
The world is living in its dream
But now we know that we can wake up from this sleep
And set out on the journey 
To find the ship to take us on the way

The time has come to trust that guiding light
And leaving all the rest behind
Well take the road that leads down to the waterside
And set out on the journey
To find the ship to take us on the way

And well sail out on the water
Yes, well feel the seas roll
Yes, well meet out on the water
Where all strangers are known

If you travel blindly if you fall
The truth is there to set you free
And when your heart can see just one thing in this life
Well set out on the journey 
To find the ship to take us on the way

And well sail out on the water
Yes, well feel the seas roll
Yes well meet out on the water
Where all strangers are known

See the dark night has come down on us
The world is living in its dream
But now we know that we can wake up from this sleep
And set out on the journey
To find the ship to take us on the way

And well sail out on the water
Yes, well feel the seas roll
Yes, well meet out on the water
Where all strangers are known---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
