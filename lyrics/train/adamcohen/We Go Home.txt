Yeah the radio is on
But the signal is weak
We both know this song
Way down deep
Doesn't matter if we talk
'Cause talk is cheap
There's so much the eyes say
That we don't speak

I know I know I'm not supposed to think about you
I know I know
Act natural around you
I know I'm not supposed to think about your thirsty rose
Yeah I know I know
I know I know

We both know it's wrong
But we're just dancers
We know this song
We know the answers
So we both sing
What we both know
And when the song is over
We go home

I know I know I'm not supposed to think about you
I know I know
Act natural around you
I know I'm not supposed to think about your thirsty rose
Yeah I know I know
I know I know

I know I'm not supposed to think about your thirsty rose
I know I'm not supposed to see you when my eyes are closed
Or run my hands across your skin real slow
Or think of how we come together and explode

I know that when the song is over we go home
I know that when the song is over we go home
I know that when the song is over we go home
I know that when the song is over we go home---
