All this pressure is eating me up inside,
And I feel like i'm being buried alive again,

All this pressure is tearing me up inside,
And the fear of failing is on my mind again.

The anxiety is building up inside,
And the thought of losing is running strong again.

I pace and smoke and tell you

If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.
It's not all my fault.
You fucked with my heart.
If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.

All these questions are building in my mind,
And i'm wondering how this came around again.

The intensity that surrounds my life,
Has me asking if i'm doing right again.

All the memories of me failing life,
Just increase the drive to do it all again.

I pace and smoke and tell you

If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.
It's not all my fault.
You fucked with my heart.
If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.
It's not all my fault.
You fucked with my heart.
If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.

All the words that we say,
push us farther and farther away.

All the secrets we made,
Put the pressures of life in our way.

All the time that we spend,
Making choices that stand in our way.

If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.
It's not all my fault.
You fucked with my heart.
If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.
It's not all my fault.
You fucked with my heart.
If it's over it's over,
And that's not my problem.
You fucked with my heart.---Lyrics submitted by Blake Maynard.
