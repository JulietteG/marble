Sometimes I lye awake/ And think about the day
I watch you all walk around with/  Your eyes half open
I smoke one more cigarette and /  Start it all over.
You're all so scared to face your own lives
You let it pass you by-
Why don't you try and open up your eyes
See the door is closing.

You always wait
Five minutes for it to come.
Five minutes and its over. Over.
You seem to think your live has just begun
Five minutes and its over. Over.

There is a man in the kitchen with a shovel
A million dollars on the dinning room table.
Now everyday he puts a little in the oven,
"You can spend as much or little as you're able".
You're all so scared to face your own lives
You let it pass you by-
Why don't you try and open up your eyes
And see what the man is burning.

You always wait
Five minutes for it to come.
Five minutes and its over. Over.
You seem to think your live has just begun
Five minutes and its over. Over.
Five minutes for it to come.
Five minutes and its over. Over.
You seem to think your live has just begun
Five minutes and its over. Over.

Its your life.
Its your life.
Why don't you spend it the best you can.
Its your life.
Its your life.

You always wait
Five minutes for it to come.
Five minutes and its over. Over.
You seem to think your live has just begun
Five minutes and its over. Over.
Five minutes for it to come.
Five minutes and its over. Over.
You seem to think your live has just begun
Five minutes and its over. Over.---Lyrics submitted by Adrienne.
