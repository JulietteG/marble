Remember when I looked at you with a frown
and then you showed me your crown and made me smile

I insane for all the courage and tears and how
forgotton how fierce it felt to fly

and now the road that gently bends at our feet
has given love to the street
we are making it right

you know I've been waiting way too long
so long
I've been waiting alone
for this I've been waiting much too long
so long
and now the waiting is up

remember when I took your hand full of hope
you showed how to provoke more in this world
I can't explain you answered more than a prayer
you put a smile in my ear
a simple thought to attain
now we go off into running the start
and you have given me heart
we are doing it right

you know I've been waiting way too long
so long
I've been waiting alone
for this I've been waiting much too long
so long
now the waiting is up

so you are bringing back something that I have lacked
what I've been missing all along
and baby you know you've got and I will
give you what I have been holding for so long
so long

and now we go off into running the start
and you have given me heart
cause we are doing it right

you know I've been waiting way too long
so long
way too long
for this I've been waiting much too long
too long
now the waiting is up---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
