Met a girl at seventeen
Thought she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
She turned out to be a cheat
Said she'd been thinking for a long time
And she found somebody new
I've been thinking that this whole time

Girl, I never thought you'd stay, that's okay
I hope he takes your filthy heart
And then he throws you away someday

Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door

I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
You turned into a pretty big waste of my time

I don't wanna take up all your time
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
Well you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

You're the lowest type, you're the lowest.

I met a girl stuck in her ways
She found a boy she knew she'd change
I'd change my clothes, my hair, my face
To watch us go our separate ways

Said we'd grown apart for sometime
But then she found somebody new
I hope Mr. Right puts up with all the bullshit that you do

Stay the hell away
While I sit here by myself
Figure out how I got this way

Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door, baby

If you can't hang then there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then there's the door

I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
You turned into a pretty big waste of my time

I don't wanna take up all your time
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
Well you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

I don't wanna get this confused
She said she'd never settle for some boy she couldn't use

Now I gotta call the doctor
So he can prescribe me medication
So I can deal with all the memories
Of being here this way

Met a girl at twenty-three
Knew she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
And she did the same for me

(Imagine that!)

'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face
No, you're such a pretty, pretty face

Whoa...
Yeah...

'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face
No, you're such a pretty, pretty face

I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
Well you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
Well you turned into a pretty big waste of my time

Would you please stay and come inside, baby?
Would you please stay and please be mine, baby?
Would you please stay and come inside, baby?
Would you please stay and please be mine?---Lyrics submitted by Anna Horan.
