[intro:]   
Stay for tonight
If you want to 
I can show you
What my dreams are made of, 
as I'm dreaming of your face
I've been away for a long time
Such a long time
And I miss you there
I can't imagine being anywhere else 
I can't imagine being anywhere else but here
How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, I could sing you a song
But I don't think words can express your beauty 
It's singing to me
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me
I fell in love from the moment we kissed 
Since then we've been history

[Chorus:]
They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with me

[Verse 2:]
It goes to show, I hope that you know that you are
What my dreams are made of
Can't fall asleep, can't fall asleep 
I lay in my bed awake, in my bed awake at night
As I dream of you
I'll fall in love, you'll fall in love
It could mean everything, everything to me
I can't imagine being anywhere else

[Chorus:]
They say that love is forever 
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with me

[Bridge:]
The way that we are
It's the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me
I know we'll be Ok
The way that we are 
It's the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me
I know I'll be Ok

[Chorus:]
They say that love is forever 
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with me

(I couldn't love just anyone, I was created to love just one baby)
They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need 
(I couldn't love just anyone, I was created to love just one girl)
Please stay as long as you need 

(I couldn't love just anyone, I was created to love just one baby)
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave
(I couldn't love just anyone, I was created to love just one girl)
Please stay forever with me---Lyrics submitted by Dina.
