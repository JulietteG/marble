Lets hang the jury
You sick judgmental fools
Ill bury you six feet deep
'Cause Im tired of your rules

Fuck you and your opinion
How could you be so blind?
What goes around
Comes back around in time

You dont know shit
You dont know shit
About me
You dont know shit, shit, shit
Dont know a god damn thing about me

Keep looking down on me,
I am more than youll ever be
Cut me deep but I wont bleed
Gonna kick, kick
Kick me when Im down

By all means
Put me through hell
And Ill make you see
Ill be your worst enemy
Try to kick, kick, kick me when Im down
Kick me when Im down

Of all the sinners
Youre first in line
So go to hell and tell the devil
Im not that far behind

Fuck you and your decision
'Cause it's not mine
What goes around
Comes back around in time

You dont know shit
You dont know shit
About me
You dont know shit, shit, shit
Dont know a god damn thing about me

Keep looking down on me,
I am more than youll ever be
Cut me deep but I wont bleed
Gonna kick, kick
Kick me when Im down

By all means
Put me through hell
And Ill make you see
Ill be your worst enemy
Try to kick, kick, kick me when Im down

Youre gonna kick me when Im down
Kick, kick, kick me when Im down

Kick me when Im down
Kick me when Im down, down
Down
Down
Kick me when Im down
Down
Down
Kick me when Im down---
