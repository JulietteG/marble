Woo!
Can we fly, can we fly away

I'm sitting on the edge
A thousand stars burning in the sky up overhead
How could it get more beautiful than this?
And it made me think of when, when in my life have I ever felt more infinite?
And could I ever get back there again?
That's the way it goes you fall so short, sometimes you feel so cool
But when you find the thing that matters most may you never let it go
(That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes)

I wanna fly
I'm ready to burn down all the walls that I've been building up inside (Whoa)
I wanna fly and put back all the pieces of this broken heart tonight (Whoa, whoa)
Can we fly, can we fly away?
Can we fly, can we fly?
Can we fly, can we fly away?

As the sun falls down I can feel the end
As I watch the breeze kissing your skin
Breathe it in
I never want this night to end
Right now I feel complete
The way the light flashes in your eyes when you're up with me (you're up with me)
I feel I'm who I'm meant to be
And it's the way it goes you brought up love and never got that close
But when you find the thing that matters most may you never let it go
(That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes)

I wanna fly
I'm ready to burn down all the walls that I've been building up inside (Whoa)
I wanna fly and put back all the pieces of this broken heart tonight (Whoa, whoa)

It's just the way
It's just the way it goes (whoa, whoa)
It's just the way
It's just the way it goes (whoa, whoa)
It's just the way
It's just the way it goes (whoa, whoa)
It's just the way it goes

I wanna fly
I'm ready to burn down all the walls that I've been building up inside (Whoa)
I wanna fly and put back all the pieces of this broken heart tonight (Whoa)
I wanna fly
I'm ready to burn down all the walls that I've been building up inside (Whoa)
I wanna fly and put back all the pieces of this broken heart tonight (Whoa, whoa)
Can we fly, can we fly away? (Can we fly)
Can we fly, can we fly? (Can we fly)
Can we fly, can we fly away? (Whoa, whoa)
Can we fly, can we fly away? (Can we fly)
Can we fly, can we fly? (Can we fly)
Can we fly, can we fly away? (Whoa, whoa)---
