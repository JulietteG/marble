I wrote this song for my father..
sometimes I feel he never gave a damn about me,
though he raised me like he should, did he understand me?
no,I don't think so.

I wrote this son for my mother..
she had leave me, when I was younger
she says, seek this life, and keep an open mind.
but in my mind I,
I am free now
free to live right out of my fears. 
I believe now, there's a reason why I'm here.
It's to try and do good, its to try and do better (ohh-oh)
Who will I be for my daughter?
This little baby, she means the world to me.
will I relive their mistakes? or do thins the right way.. for her sake.
I am free now.. free to live right out of my fears.
I believe now, there's a reason why I'm here

Can I be a man, one that understands.
How to love more patiently....
Ill be free now..
Ill be free now..

And we dream of the day, when are kids can play in the streets with no fear of them being taken away. Fathers raise theirs sons with respect and love, handle anger and pain with no need for no guns. If we hope to be free it takes you and me to start over again here and now, 'cause this world is the way it is, its how we raise our kids.

I wrote this song for my mother, I wrote this song for my father, so hopefully we can come together. 
and hopefully make things a little better.
I am free now, free t live right out of my fears. 
I believe now theres  reason why im here.
Can I be a man, one that understands.
How to love more patiently....
I am free now..
I am free now..
I am free now..
I am free now..---Lyrics submitted by Nicole Fuentes.
