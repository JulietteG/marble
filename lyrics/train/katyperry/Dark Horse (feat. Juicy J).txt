I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But dont make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what youre fallin for
Baby, do you dare to do this
Cause Im coming atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once youre mine, once youre mine
Theres no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Dont walk away

Its in the palm of your hand now, baby
Its a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

Shes a beast
I call her Karma
Shell eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
Shes sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
Shell turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
Im gon put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I dont care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted---
