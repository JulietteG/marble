How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute
How will I know
The right way to love you

Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you

Oh oh oh
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping theres a real boy inside

(Chorus)
Cause youre not a man
Youre just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But youre not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string
For you to say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I cant seem to find your heart

Oh
Im such a fool
Im such a fool
Im such a fool
This ones outta my hands
I cant put you back together again

(Chorus)
Cause youre not a man
Youre just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But youre not a man

Youre just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand
But youre not a man
If the past is the problem
Our future could solve them baby
I could bring you to life
If you let me inside baby
Itll hurt
But in the end
Youll be a man.---
