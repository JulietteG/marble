(feat. Snoop Dogg)

[Snoop Dogg]
Greetings loved ones
Lets take a journey

[Katy Perry]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Tryna to creep a little sneak peek
(at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
Youll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
Were unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
will melt your Popsicle
Ooh Oh Oh

California girls
Were undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Ooh Oh Ooh

Sex on a beach
We get sand in our stilettos
We freak
In my jeep
Snoop doggy-dog on the stereo

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
Youll be falling in love
Ooh Oh Ooh

California girls
Were unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
will melt your Popsicle
Ooh Oh Oooh

California girls
Were undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Ooh Oh Ooh

[Snoop Dogg]

Wild wild west coast
These are the girls I love the most

Squeeze her buns

And live on the beach
