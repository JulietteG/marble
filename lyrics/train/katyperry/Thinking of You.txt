Comparisons are easily done
Once youve had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on
Where do I go
I guess second best
Is all I will know

(Chorus)
Cause when Im with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

Youre like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once Ive had the best
You said theres
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself

(Chorus)
Youre the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now the lessons learned
I touched it; I was burned
Oh I think you should know

(Chorus)
Your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh wont you walk through
And bust in the door and
Take me away
Oh no more mistakes
Cause in your eyes Id like to stay---
