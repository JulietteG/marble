I look into the window of my mind
Reflections of the fears I know Ive left behind
I step out of the ordinary
I can feel my soul ascending
Im on my way
Cant stop me now
And you can do the same...yeah

What have you done today to make you feel proud?
Its never too late to try
What have you done today to make you feel proud?
You could be so many people
If you make that (run) for freedom
What have you done today to make you feel proud?

Still so many answers I dont know
Well, Ive got to question: Is how Ill grow?
So, Ill step out of the ordinary
I can feel my soul ascending
Im on my way
Cans stop me now
And you can do the same....yeah

What have you done today to make you feel proud?
Its never too late to try.
What have you done today to make you feel proud?
You could be so many people
If you make that run for freedom
What have you done today to make you feel proud?
