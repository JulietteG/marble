It was all just a dream, Oh no 
Yet I wish it was real 
All my pets they were there and they smiled 
Take a shit, it was fine 

Everybody's so inviting 
They've got it in for me I know 
It's not that I don't really love you 
It's just that I don't really know 
The hateful things you think you want to say 
Time will turn them into jokes 
(Yup.)

Yes, it was all just a dream, Oh no 
Was it real? I don't know 
(I hope so...) 

Here we go. Can I play? Can I watch? 
He would like one more night in your life 
I saw worlds, they don't stop. They're like us.
They go fast, like a sun that's been shot.

Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what they wear
Cause today they'll talk about us 
And tomorrow they won't care 

This whole life, 
Is it a dream? I can't tell 
I got up, then I waved, then I fell 
I recall you were all there with me 
Overjoyed and at peace

First time around 
Second took so long 
Third time's a charm 
Circle of fourths 
Five days to rehearse 
Six to make it work
Seven notes in a scale 
Eight in some countries 
Nine in fancy keys
Ten years we've been friends 
Eleven seconds to hell 
And of course,
Twelve major chords.---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
