Animals on TV singing
About some pain that they once felt
There's no one that I disapprove of
More or root for more than myself

I wanted to pretend that I was better
Better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous
Jealous, jealous and alone

So we talk about ourselves and how
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth, while the moon reflects

Don't try to stop us, don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us, get out of the way

Got to get to climb your tree
In the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in the old man's eyes
While she quickly stares at her thighs

Animals on TV singing about
Something they felt at some point
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous
Jealous, jealous, what's the point?

As I watched the velvet dreams appear
And the door was closed for forty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide between the inner ear

He is coming from a part of hell
Where light and blue eyes don't go down well
He can tell that we're oblivious
It's addiction and routine as well

Making fools out of the best of us
Making robots of the rest of us
Innocence itself in America today
Is a crime just like Cornel West insists

Don't try to stop us, don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us, get out of the way---Lyrics submitted by aldakin.
