Last night, she said:
"Oh, baby, I feel so down.
See, it turns me off,
When I feel left out"

So I, I turned 'round:
"Oh baby, don't care no more,
I know this for sure,
I'm walkin' out that door"

Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen oh minutes now
And Baby, I feel so down
See I don't know why!
I was walkin' for miles

And people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they won't understand
Your Grandsons, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand...

Last night, she said:
"Oh, baby, I feel so down.
See, it turns me off,
When I feel left out"

So I, I turned 'round:
"Oh, baby, gonna be just fine"
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night

And, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they won't understand
In spaceships they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand...

Last night, she said:
"Oh, baby, dont feel so down.
See, it turns me off,
When I feel left out"

So I, I turned 'round:
"Oh little girl I don't care no more.
I know this for sure,
I'm walking out that door," yeah...---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
