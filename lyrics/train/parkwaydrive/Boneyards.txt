Take all the sentiments
Let it go when I sing it
So re-name me when I say
I would love nothing more
Then for everything
To end in misery
concrete selves every time ... i couldn't survive
Don't say I didn't warn you
I would rather see your face in hell
than speak another word of this perfect world
I would rather see your face in hell
than speak another word of this perfect world
oh
of this perfect world
oh to be buried
Beneath the waves
i said i'd scream before i cried
bury me, bury me
5000 fathams deep
I break my bones for the depths
The sharpest teeth await the skin
the sharpest teeth await but once more ...
Go
The devils teeth,the devils teeth beneath your skin
wish away your silent vengeance
or just remain a pain
Now every breathe of life has been betrayed
every light down has blasted through
nothing we love inside us
feed us to the sharks
so love nothing with me
feed us to the sea
To be buried
Beneath the waves
i said id scream before i cried 
bury me, bury me
5000 fathams deep
I break my bones for the depths
There's blood in the water
Sinking, always sinking
There's blood in the water
I would rather see your face in hell
Then speak another word of this perfect fucking world---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
