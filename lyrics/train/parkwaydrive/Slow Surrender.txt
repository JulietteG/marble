Oh 
You've gotta fight for your life 
There is nothing to fear but fear itself 
Oh! 

The devil dances in idle minds 
Yeah! 
Fight for your life [x3] 

I won't turn back now 
This will be no slow surrender 
I won't turn back now 
Carpe Diem, straight for the throat 

Conflict, the all-consuming pain 
Time lost will never be regained 
Don't waste your breath 
You can't save your strength 
The battle rages in the here and now 
See every second that you waste 
Is time you'll never live again 

Fight for your life [x3] 
Fight for your fucking life 

There is a price to pay 
Death is a heartbeat away [x2] 
A heart beat away 

The devil dances in idle minds [Scratching] 
The, the devil, the devil dances in idle, idle, idle 
The devil dances in idle minds 

(Fight, fight, fight) 
For your life 
(Fight, fight, fight) 
For your life 
(Fight, fight, fight) 
For your life 
(Fight, fight, fight) 

I won't turn back now 
This will be no slow surrender 
I won't turn back now 
Carpe Diem, I gotta go straight for the throat 

The devil dances idle our minds 
The devil dances idle our minds 
The devil dances 
The devil dances idle our minds 
The devil dances 
The devil dances idle our minds---Lyrics submitted by Tanya.
