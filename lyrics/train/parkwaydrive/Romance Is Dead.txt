The inscisions in your wrists
were all for show just like you.
The epitome of your self destruction. 
It's just a farce, a charade 
with another set of crocodile tears.

So serenade her last pathetic suicide love songs
Broken hearts never mend. 
But fools never move on. 
And now she's gone, because of you. And once again,
'cause the epitome of your self destruction.

Cupid never found his mark. 
As we await the inscersion of blades on flesh.
You part the skin and tell of blades on blood. 
So part the fucking skin. So part the fucking skin. 

To tell of blades on blood.
To tell of blades on blood, of blades on blood.
She said i love you. She said, she said good bye. 

SO CRY ME A FUCKIN' RIVER, BITCH

You wouldn't know love,
if it crossed your fucking chest.
Let go. 
You wouldn't know love,
if it crossed your fucking chest.
Razors roses and a black tomorrow.
You wouldn't know love.

Rip across your fucking chest.
Razors roses and a black tomorrow.
Yea. I never showed any affection to anything but your ego. 
A tragedy of ours at the best of times.

You were everything that's wrong wiht me. 
You are everything that I dispise. 
You are everything I dreamed would die. 
You are everything that fades away and slowly dies.

Will you bleed for me when suicide seems so yesterday? 
Will you, will you bleed for me? 
Will you fucking bleed for me when suicide is so yesterday?
It's all so fucking yesterday.
So yesterday.---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
