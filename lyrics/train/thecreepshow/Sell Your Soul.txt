selll!!!

your!!!

soul!!!

everyone except yourself is to blame
you say your not satisfied   well ok
well you can linger on
like a lifeless little pawwn
or you can have it all
everything you crave

money ,pleasure wrapped in leather
fortune and fame

sell        your          soul

everything inside yourself is rotting away
you allmost hit rock bottom
and youve withered again
so you can linger on
as a lifeless little pawwn
or you can have it alll
everything you crave 

money .pleasure wrapped in leather
fortune and fame

sell     your       soul

*so you made a deal with the devil 
and now your soul is mine you
sold it for eternity you signed
that dotted line you will taste the
bullet of another gun  when it comes 
down to the end
so long fair well
ill see you in hell my friend*

everything except yourself is to blame
again you say your not satisfird
what will it take?
well you can have it all
everyything you crave

money pleasure wrapped in leather
fortune and fame

so catch a ride apon the devils 
hellbound train
eternity in hell will be the price you pay

sell or save or sell your 
sououououououououououououououolllll

sell

your

soul---Lyrics submitted by bryanna.
