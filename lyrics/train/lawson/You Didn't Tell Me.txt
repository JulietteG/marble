There you stood, next to me, 
and you waited, patiently. 
I approached, held you near 
then you whispered, in my ear 

You didnt tell me, 
you didnt need me,  
You went and left it all behind 
you didnt tell me,  
you didnt warn me,  
didnt  it ever cross your mind? 

Friday night, cancel plans,  
then i see you, holding hands. 
With a guy, now its clear,  
when you whispered, in his ear 

You didnt tell me, 
you didnt need me,  
You went and left it all behind 
you didnt tell me,  
you didnt warn me,  
didnt  it ever cross your mind? 

Didnt you tell me, that I, 
Was spending way too long wasting my time 
oh and I, should have known,  
that i am better of on my own. 

You didnt tell me, 
you didnt need me,  
you went and left it all behind 
You didnt tell me,  
you didnt warn me,  
didnt  it ever cross your mind? 

You didnt tell me,  
you didnt need me,  
didnt  it ever cross your mind 
You didnt tell me,  
you didnt warn me, 
didnt you ever say goodbye? 

Oh 
Oh yeah 
There you stood---
