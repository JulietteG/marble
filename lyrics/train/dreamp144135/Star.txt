Funny how I've been the loser all the while, 
I've been afraid and like the child,
I forgot how much I needed you.
It's strange but true -
I love me more than I loved you,
I lost my chance of life with you, when I took my time to say it.

Now it's nothing to do with Heaven, nothing to do with fame,
only the beat in my heart when I call your name,

Star, yeah yeah yeah, higher than reality
Star, yeah yeah yeah, you were alway light years ahead of me,
Stay, yeah yeay yeah, we burned twice as bright - and half as long, but
Star, yeah yeah yeah, just shine on, just shine on and on and on.

I love you till the end of time, 
I really want to make you mine.
I love you till the end of time,
I really want to make you mine.

No I'm living with another - in a crowded room
crowded room becomes a vision - 
of lost days spent with you
I got a state of mind and realised - 
what I did to you then
I got my chance now with another - I'm gonna prove it to them

Now it's nothing to do with Heaven, nothing to do with fame,
only the beat in my heart when I call your name,

Star, yeah yeah yeah, higher than reality
Star, yeah yeah yeah, you were alway light years ahead of me,
Stay, yeah yeay yeah, we burned twice as bright - and half as long, but
Star, yeah yeah yeah, just shine on, just shine on and on and on.

I love you till the end of time, 
I really want to make you mine.
I love you till the end of time,
I really want to make you mine.---Lyrics submitted by Nick.
