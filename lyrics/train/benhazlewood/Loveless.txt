I can see
That you have taken every part of me
Stand at my door
There's nothing left for you here anymore

I set my soul free
But you keep coming back
Keep coming back haunting me

My heart's in such a mess
Now I've got nothing left
You left me so loveless

I fight to carry on
These scars won't make me strong
You left me so loveless

Please don't stay
I hold my breath and watch you walk away
It's so, so clear
The smoke remains when the fire disappears

My heart's in such a mess
Now I've got nothing left
You left me so loveless

I had to wait for rain
To wash away this pain
You left me so loveless

Oh...

Take the fight out of me
Show me everything that you believe
When it snows let it go
Where we live is no longer our home

We were lovers broken dreamers
When the world decides to leave us
don't leave me loveless
Don't leave me loveless

My heart's in such a mess
Now I've got nothing left
You left me so loveless

I fight to carry on
These scars won't make me strong
You left me so loveless

So loveless
You left me so loveless

I can see that you have
Taken every part of me---
