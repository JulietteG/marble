i kno wat you like convict
i just got off of work its one thirty, im kinda hungry
cuz i kno my girl lonely. goin back to my crib
its kinda early. surprise my girl because i kno she waitin.
i open the front door, i hear moanin. for real somebody, im finna kill somebody
then i get closer, i hear groanin. bust in the door and see my girl wit a chick 
thats when i kno that

[chorus]
my girl gotta girlfriend
i just found out but its alright, as long as i can be wit her too
my girl gotta girlfriend, it really is not a problem cuz im'a make it do wat it do
cuz havin two chick is better than no chicks i'd rather just join in and keep my girl
and keep the other one too
my girl gotta girlfriend it really is not a problem cuz im'a make it do wat it do

ooh you kno your wrong shawty
could have told me, that you were sleepin wit a chick
how the hell you gon be leavin me out? i thought we was better shawty
you so stingy, while you was kissin on her i come behind up on her gettin her out
im so cool wit, both of y'all in my bed and watch wat i do wit it
girl im'a foo wit it, im'a foo wit it
so slide over for me shawty let me show ya how a player get down
cuz girl im bout to give you both the bidness

then i free the other one, got it bustin like a gun so i dnt really care that
