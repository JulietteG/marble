My best friend had a little situation At the end of our senior year
And like a shot, she and Mitchell got married that summer
Carolann getting bigger every minute Thinking, "What am I doing here?"
While Mitchell's out every night Being a heavy-metal drummer

They got a little cute house on a little cute street With a crucifix on the door
Mitchell got a job at the record store in the mall
Just the typical facts of a typical life in a town on the Eastern Shore
I thought about what I wanted It wasn't like that at all
Made Carolann a cute baby sweater Thinking "I can do better than that"

In a year or so, I moved to the city Thinking "What have I got to lose?"
Got a room, got a cat, and got twenty pounds thinner
Met a guy in a class I was taking he wears very well place tattoo
He wouldn't leave me alone 'less I went with him to dinner

And I guess he was cute And I guess he was sweet And I guess he was good in bed
I gave up my life for a better part of a year
And so I'm starting to think that this maybe might work And the second it entered my head
He needed to take some time off Focus on his "career"
He blew me off with a heartfelt letter I thought "I can do better than that"

You don't have to get a haircut You don't have to change your shoes
You don't have to like Duran Duran Just love me
You don't have to put the seat down You don't have to watch the news
You don't' have to learn to tango You don't have to eat prosciutto
You don't have to change a thing Just stay with me

I want you and you and nothing but you Miles and piles of you
Finally I'll have something worthwhile To think about each morning
You and you and nothing but you No substitution will do
Nothing but fresh, undiluted and pure Top of the line 
and totally mine!

I don't need any lifetime commitments I don't need to get hitched tonight
I don't want to throw up your walls and defenses
I don't mean to put on any pressure But I know what a thing is right
And I spend every day re-configuring my senses

When we get to my house, take a look at that town Take a look at how far I've gone
I will never go back Never look back anymore
And it feels like my life led right to your side And will keep me there from now on
Think about what you wanted Think about what could be
Think about how I love you Say you'll move in with me
Think of what's great about me and you Think of the bullsh*t we've both been through
Think of what's past because we can do better! We can do better!
We can do better than that!
We can do better than that!---
