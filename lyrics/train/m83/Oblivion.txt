Since I was young, I knew Id find you
But our love was a song, sung by a dying swan

And in the night, you hear me calling, You hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling

Breathe in the light, Ill stay here in the shadows
Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows
Higher, and higher, and higher

And when the nights so long,
All the stars recall your goodbye, your goodbye

And in the night, youll hear me calling, youll hear me calling
And in your dreams, youll see us falling, falling

And in the night, youll hear me calling, youll hear me calling
And in your dreams, youll see us falling, falling

Breathe in the light and say goodbye
Breathe in the light and say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
