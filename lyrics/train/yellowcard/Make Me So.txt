Turn around before you go
The look in your eyes is letting me know
I hear you breathing out
My house of cards is coming down
I thought we were alive
Thought it was like when planets align
You dreamt of some better place
Some better love with some better name

Why, why do you make me so?
Why, why do you let me go?

Close calls, hang by a thread
I never could forget what you said
Too late, don't want to be saved
These are the choices that we've gotta make
Truth is the world's gonna spin
With or without you, again and again
If I ever escape, I'm gonna love and give it a name

Why, why do you make me so?
Why, why do you let me go?
Why do I lose my head? You make me so
Why do I lose myself? You let me go

You dreamt of some better place
Some better love, or some better name
If I ever escape, I'm gonna love and give it a name

Why, why do you make me so?
Why, why do you let me go?
Why do I lose my head? You make me so
Why do I lose myself? You let me go

Why do you make me so?
Why do you make me so?
Why do you let me go?
Why do you let me go?---
