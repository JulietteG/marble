(Let's burn a hole, so we can climb out.
Of these paper walls, and this empty house.
Don't listen too close, they're words are like guns.
With bullets that fly and kill what you've won...)

Let's burn a hole, so we can climb out.
Of these paper walls, and this empty house.

We're the only thing that's real.

These visions we have of ten years ago,
Of stars in the sky and us down below.
In streets and east coast lines,
We kept this scene alive.

Here I am, still hold on to this,
Dream we had, won't let go of it,
Hear me now, you will never be alone...

Don't listen too close, they're words are like guns.
With bullets that fly and kill what you've won.
Some love to hate, and some tell you lies.
So lets make a toast, and kiss them goodbye...

We'll kiss them all goodbye...

Here I am, still hold on to this,
Dream we had, won't let go of it,
Hear me now, you will never be alone...

Here I stand, won't turn back again.
Won't leave you, know how hard it's been
Hear me now, you will never be alone...

Let's take what hurts, and write it all down.
On these paper walls, and this empty house.
And when our ink runs out, we'll burn it to the ground...

Here I am, still hold on to this
Dream we had, won't let go of it,
Hear me now, you will never be alone...

Here I stand, won't turn back again.
Won't leave you, know how hard it's been
Hear me now, you will never be alone...---Lyrics submitted by David.
