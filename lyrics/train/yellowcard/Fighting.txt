I said I'd move on and I'd leave it alone
But before I walk out
There is something that I need you to know
I got lost in the blink of an eye
And I could never get back
No, I never got back

You were not there when I wanted to say
That you were everything right
And it wasn't you but me that changed
Now I got to go it alone
But I will never give up
No, I'll never give up

What am I fighting for?
There must be something more
For all these words I sing
Do you feel anything?

I said I'm okay but I know how to lie
You were all that I had
You were delicate and hard to find
Got lost in the back of my mind
And I can never get back
No, I never got back

You were not there when I needed to say
I hit the bottom so fast
That my head was spinning round the days
Now I got to go it alone
But I will never give up
No, I'll never give up

What am I fighting for?
There must be something more
For all these words I sing
Do you feel anything?
What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?

Never give up on this
Never give up on this
Never give up on this
Never give up on this

I said I'm okay but I know how to lie
I will never give up
No, I'll never give up

What am I fighting for?
There must be something more
For all these words I sing
Do you feel anything?
What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?

Said that I'd fight for the one that I've found
I'm gonna stay here while I wait for you to come around
I fight 
You're a part of me now
And I will never give up
No, I'll never give up---Lyrics submitted by joe.
