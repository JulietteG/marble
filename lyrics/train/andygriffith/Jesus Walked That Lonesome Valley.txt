You've got to walk that lonesome valley
you've got to go by yourself
ain't nobody here can walk there for you
You gotta go there by yourself

well Mary walked that lonesome valley
she had to go there by herself
Then later on her baby Jesus 
he had to go there by himself 

Yes Jesus walked that lonesome valley
he had to go there by himself 
nobody else could walk it for him
he had to go there by himself

If you can't preach like Simon Peter
if you can't pray like Apostle Paul
you can tell the love of Jesus 
you can say he died for all.

well You've got to walk that lonesome valley
you gotta go there by yourself
ain't nobody here can walk there for you
Yes you gotta go there by yourself

Yeah you  gotta to walk that lonesome valley
Well you gotta go there by yourself
ain't nobody here can walk there for you
you gotta go there by yourself---Lyrics submitted by Seth Rainsberger.
