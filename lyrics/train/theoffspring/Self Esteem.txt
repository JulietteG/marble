I wrote her off for the tenth time today
and practiced all the things i would say
but she came over
i lost my nerve
i took her back and made her dessert
now i know i'm being used
thats okay man 'cause i like the abuse
i know she's playing with me
thats okay 'cause i got no self esteem

Oh wayo yeah, yeah...
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah..
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah...
Ohhhh yeah, yeah..

we make plans to go out at night
i wait til two then i turn out the light
all this rejection's got me so low
if she keeps it up, i just might tell her so

Oh wayo yeah, yeah...
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah..
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah...
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah..

when she's saying oh that she wants only me
then i wonder why she sleeps with my friends
when she's saying that i'm like a disease
then i wonder how much more i can spend
well i guess i should stick up for myself
but i really think its better this way
the more you suffer
the more it shows you really care
right? yeah!

Now i'll relate this little bit
that happens more than i'd like to admit
late at night she knocks on my door
she's drunk again and looking to score
now i know i should say no
but thats kinda hard when she's ready to go
i may be dumb
but i'm not a dweeb
i'm just a sucker with no self esteem

Oh wayo yeah, yeah...
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah..
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah...
Ohhhhh yeah, yeah..


when she's saying oh that she wants only me
then i wonder why she sleeps with my friends
when she's saying that i'm like a disease
then i wonder how much more i can spend
well i guess i should stick up for myself
but i really think its better this way
the more you suffer
the more it shows you really care
right? yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
