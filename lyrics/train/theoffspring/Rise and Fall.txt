This time youre really dead
Once followed, but always led
You thought youd rise above it all

Its all inside your head
All ripping it up in shreds
I know someday youre gonna fall

And I dont wanna say I told you so
But I told you so
Now youve lost control

And I dont wanna be the rise and fall
So gimme more or nothing at all

Youre in an awful way
Sucked in by what you crave
They just cant wait to see you crawl

And you can only laugh
Give in to the other half
Theyre only tearing down your walls

Theyve come to see you rise and fall
Theyre only tearing down your walls
Theyve come to see you rise and fall
And I dont wanna say youve lost control

Rise and fall is
Good and evil,
Appearance and reality,
Judgment and reflection.
It is to judge and to be judged,
To dream and to accept.
It is Triumph and despair,
Wish and realization,

And we are both.---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
