Hey man you know I'm really okay
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car
Don't give me no crap
Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving I stay in my lane
But getting cut off makes me insane
I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away
Yeah I got a bad habit
And it ain't goin' away yeah

Well they say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off I'll get in your face
You drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last

I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away
Yeah I got a bad habit
And it ain't goin' away       yeah

Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease
Something's odd
I feel like I'm god 
You stupid dumbshit goddam motherfucker

I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away
Yeah I got a bad habit
And it ain't goin' away       yeah---Lyrics submitted by Kenny.
