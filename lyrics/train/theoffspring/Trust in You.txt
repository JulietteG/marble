I am the one, your help Ive refused
Your offering hand just set off the fuse
I am the rock that pushes away
I gave up tomorrow to spite today

Too proud to beg
Too stubborn to try
Id look in your face
And spit in your eye

But Im willing to find whats really inside
And show I am strong enough to

Trust in you.
Trust in you.
Trust in you.
Pull me up
Quo modo shadow to light
Quo modo shadow to light
Quo modo pull me up
Pull me up
Cause I am ready

I am the one who blames only you
The flame in my eyes now blackens my view
I am the one who wanders alone
Darkness inside blocks how youve shone

Who tied the other
End of my rope?
I want to move on
I want to have hope

So Im willing to change
Im going to try
To show I am strong enough to---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
