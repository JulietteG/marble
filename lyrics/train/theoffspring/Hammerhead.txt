I am the one,
Camouflage and guns,
Risk my life
To keep my people from harm

Authority,
Vested in me
I sacrifice
With my brothers in arms

Through this doorway,
What's on the other side?
Never knowing
Exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded
Voices screaming
Let's go!
Come on do it!
Here we go

I'll take a life
That others may live
Oh it's just the way it goes
I'll shut my eyes
It hammers in my head
Where it'll end
Nobody knows

I'll take a life
Ten others may live
Oh it's just the way it goes
It's playing over and over, over in my head
Where it'll end
Nobody knows

Stay the course
Reasonable force
I believe I serve a greater good

Smoke and dust
Enemies are crushed
Nothing left
Where a man once stood

Through this doorway,
What's on the other side?
Never knowing
Exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded,
Voices screaming
Let's go
I'm just doing what I'm told

I'll take a life
That others may live
Oh it's just the way it goes
Shut my eyes
It hammers in my head
Where it'll end
Nobody knows

I'll take this life
Ten others may live
Oh it's just the way it goes
It's playing over and over, over in my head
Where it begins
And where it'll end
Nobody knows

Hey, go!

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Bang, bang, It hammers in my head!
Bang, bang, It hammers in my head!
Bang, bang, It hammers in my head!
In my head
In my head

Ya know I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I fear no evil:
for Thou art with me

Locked and loaded
Gonna find my truth now
I'm busting through
All hell breaks loose

And you can all hide behind your desks now
And you can cry 'teacher come help me! '
Through you all
My aim is true!

My aim is true!
My aim is true!---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
