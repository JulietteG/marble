I see the way the salesman stare into the sun
I stood and watched them as they fell off one
By one
And everyone's so blind
They're not to help mankind
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull
Another one
You don't want to change the world
Like you say
Your in it for yourself
No one else
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
Now when the day is set they'll line up all
The same
And those that need the most will never get
Or gain
The ones you call your friends
Are failing you again
Reach into your bag of tricks and make it
Go away
You don't want to change the world
Like you say
Your in it for yourself
No one else
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
And since you ain't what you say
Then just go away
Cause some don't lie
Some don't lie
Go on now they won't tell
Go on now and save yourself---Lyrics submitted by Chance.
