You gotta keep'm separated

They're like the latest fashion
They're like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out campus locale
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up
Bash it up x3

Hey, man you talkin' back to me
Take him out

You gotta keep'em separated
Hey, man you disrespecting me
take him out

You gotta keep'em separated
Hey, they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey, come out and play

By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate 
Is gonna tie your own rope
Tie your own rope
Tie your own 

Hey, man you disrespecting me
take him out

You gotta keeep'em separated
Hey, man you talkin' back to me
take him out

You gotta keep'em separated
Hey, don't pay no mind
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey, come out and play

It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate 
Is gonna tie your own rope
Tie your own rope
Tie your own

Hey, man you talkin' back to me
take him out

You gotta keep'em separated
Hey, man you disrespecting me
take him out

You gotta keeep'em separated
Hey, don't pay no mind
If your under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey, come out and play---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
