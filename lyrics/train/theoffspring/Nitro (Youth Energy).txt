Our generation sees
the world Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all
And live like there's no tomorrow
(Oh oh oh oh)
there's no tomorrow
(Oh oh oh oh)
there's no tomorrow Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh)

We are the ones
Who are living under the gun every day
You might be gone before you know
So live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
there's no tomorrow
(you ain't gonna live it for me)
there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
there's no tomorrow
(you ain't gonna live it for me)

Hey !
Believe it
The official view of the world has changed
In a whole new way
Live fast cause if you don't take it
You'll never make it

Yeeeeeeah !
Yeah !
yeeeeaaaaaaaeeaaah !
yeah...!
Oh oh oh Oh!
Oh oh oh Oh!

So if you understand me
And if you feel the same
Then you will know what nitro means
You'll live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
there's no tomorrow
(you ain't gonna live it for me)
there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
there's no tomorrow
(you ain't gonna live it for me)
there's no tomorrooooooow

Oh oh oh Oh!
Oh oh oh Oh!---Lyrics submitted by cathy.
