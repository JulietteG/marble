NOW I DONT KNOW, 
AND IT HARD TO EXPLAIN
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THINGS ARE JUST KIND OF INSANE

BECAUSE THE WORLD IS CRYING
BUT NOBODYS LISTENING SO
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE ON MY CELL PHONE

I SEE BULLETS GETTING BETTER
BIBLICAL WEATHER
AND THAT GUY ON TV IS LIKE A TOTAL ASSHOLE

WHO ARE YOU WEARING TONIGHT?
CELEBRITY FUNDRAISER, TIGHT!
BLACK TIES MAKING WRONGS RIGHT!
HOWS YOUR SOCIAL BAND AID?

I DONT KNOW MUCH I DONT KNOW TOO MUCH
BUT I KNOW THIS 
SHIT IS FUCKED UP!

I GUESS ITS ALL ABOUT THE DREAM
THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS

IM TELLING YOU SHIT IS FUCKED UP!

YOU KNOW ITS ALL ABOUT THE DREAM
THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS

NOW THANK GOD FOR THE MEDIA,
FOR SAVING THE DAY
PUTTING IT ALL IN TO PERSPECTIVE
IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY

WITH MORE CELEBRITY NEWS
TYPICAL BULLSHIT VIEWS
I THINK WERE LOSING THIS FIGHT
SPONSORED BY BUD LIGHT

NAND NOW WERE ROCKING THE CASBAH
AND TAKING THE FLAK
THE GENIES OUT OF THE BOTTLE
AND WE CANT PUT IT BACK

ALL THIS STUFF, ITS OVERWHELMING MY BRAIN!
CAN YOU SEE THE STORM COMIN?
ITS COMING THIS WAY

I DONT KNOW MUCH 
I DONT KNOW TOO MUCH
BUT I KNOW THIS
SHIT IS FUCKED UP!

I GUESS ITS ALL ABOUT THE DREAM
THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS

IM TELLING YOU SHIT IS FUCKED UP!

YOU KNOW ITS ALL ABOUT THE DREAM
THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS!
JUSTIFY THE MEEEEEEEEEEE...
