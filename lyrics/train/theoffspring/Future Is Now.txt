This citys made of diamonds
And tomorrow glass will grow
On the freedoms that divide us
Theyre coming after me
Flashback 1984
Now whos knock-knocking at your door?
A thought that starts a riot
Theyre coming after me now

Life is not the same
I am one but
Sparks turn into flames

Will you take whats in my head?
And erase me when Im dead?
Cause the future is now
And now Im disappearing

The day has turned to night
Can you save me from the light?
Cause the future is here
And this is how I disappear

Running down a spiral
With the light of better men
Shouting progress is survival
Take one last look and see me
Now you see me, now you dont
No vow to break
No string of hope
My hero, your pariah
Theyre coming after me now

Life is just gods game
I am one but
Sparks turn into flames

And you get what you deserve
When revenge is what you serve
Cause the future is now
And now Im disappearing

Ill sink into the night
And Im turning off the lights
Cause the future is here
And this is how I disappear

So the ends what you make it
And thats what youre looking for
This is the future
The future is now

Disappear
I disappear

Now turn off the lights
The skies are blue inside you
Turn off the lights
Theyll get inside of you ---
