How does it feel?
When you have it all?
How can you live?
With nothing at all?

Where do you run?
Where do you go?
When the holes in your truth
Are starting to show?

And the rain comes
And the world is on my head
Crave the sun
But I cant get out of bed

How can you take?
Without giving back?
How does it work?
When its really cracked?

How does it feel

And no wonder
Hearts and minds have been won
How does it feel
And I wonder
How its all come undone And the rain comes
And the world is on my head
Crave the sun
But I cant get out of bed

Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Youre sliding
Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Cant hide it
Tell me who do you see
Cause you look a lot like me

How can you take?
Without giving back?
Who do you see?
Cause you look a lot like me

Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Youre sliding
Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Cant hide it
Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Youre sliding
Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Cant hide it 

And the rain comes
And the world is on my head
Crave the sun
But I cant get out of bed

Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Youre sliding
Want it You got it Youre sorry You bought it Cant hide it
Tell me who do you see
Cause you look a lot like me

You look alot like me
you look alot
you look alot like me wahoo---Lyrics submitted by Patrick.
