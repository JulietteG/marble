There was a time, looking through myself
Wanting to pretend
If I escaped, I could fill myself
I don't think you can
Been far and wide
But that hole inside
Never really leaves
When I went away, what I really left
Left behind was me

It's telling me
To be on my way home
Million miles away
I can't stay

Each passing day, every passing face
Seems like such a blur
I long to be
Home, silently
Lying next to her
Just to get back, by her side is all
All I need to be
Cause I went away
But what I really left
Left behind was me

I need to be
Getting on my way home
A million miles away
Million miles away
I can't take ---Lyrics submitted by Somorjai dm.
