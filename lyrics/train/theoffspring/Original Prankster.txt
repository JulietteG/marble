Until the break of dawn
Life life
Cannot go by the letter
Time time
Prozac can make it better
Noise noise
Any kind will do
Can you feel it slip away
When it's all on you

Crime crime
Rockin' like Janet Reno
Time time
Eighteen and life in Chino
Freud Freud
All along it's true
Well you'll see there comes a day
Catches up to you

Knock down the walls, it's alive in you
Knock down the place, you're alone it's true
Knock down the world, it's alive in you
You gotta keep your head up through it all
You're gonna
Bust out on it - original prankster
Break out yeah - original yeah
Bust out on it - original prankster
You never stop now, stop now
That's what the main man say

You know it smells like shit
Goddamn
Tag team the double header
Son of Sam
Fire always makes it better
Navigate
With style and aplomb
Cause wherever you're at
That's the tip you's on

Lies, lies
Says he's down in the Bahamas
Tries tries
Bangin' little hoochie mamas
No way
None of this is true
Well he'll see there comes a day
When the joke's on you yeah

Dime dime
So good to see ya
Nine nine
Don't want to be ya
Crime crime
Fine sensimilla---
