You came from Heaven to Earth to show the way
From the Earth to the Cross, my debt to pay
From the Cross to the Grave, from the grave to the Sky
Lord i lift you name on high(x3)

Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I love to sing your praises
I'm so glad your in my life
I'm so glad you came to save us

Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I love to sing your praises
I'm so glad your in my life
I'm so glad you came to save us

You came from Heaven to Earth to show the way
From the Earth to the Cross, my debt to pay
From the Cross to the Grave, from the grave to the Sky
Lord i lift you name on high

(all the ladies)
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I love to sing your praises
I'm so glad your in my life
I'm so glad you came to save us

(all the men)
Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I love to sing your praises
I'm so glad your in my life
I'm so glad you came to save us

You came from Heaven to Earth to show the way
From the Earth to the Cross, my debt to pay
From the Cross to the Grave, from the grave to the Sky
Lord i lift you name on high

You came from Heaven to Earth to show the way
From the Earth to the Cross, my debt to pay
From the Cross to the Grave, from the grave to the Sky
Lord i lift you name on high (x3)---Lyrics submitted by FinNix.
