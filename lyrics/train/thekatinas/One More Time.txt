Lord, I saw your face last night
When I looked in the sky
You were smiling
You told me it would be okay
You would make a way
In my dark times
Every time I hear Your voice
Every time I feel Your touch
It makes me know that I can face tomorrow
One more time
When all my friends go away
Ill be glad to say
Youre still near me
Even when the wind blows by
I feel warm inside
Youre so lovely
Repeat chorus
I need you, dont leave me
Without you I cant survive
Repeat chorus
I know that I can face tomorrow
Cause you will walk me through my
pain and sorrow
I know that I can face tomorrow
One more time
I can face tomorrow
You can face tomorrow
We can face tomorrow
One more time---Lyrics submitted by jesrah.
