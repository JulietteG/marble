hmmmmmm

its monday morning ckecked 
my cell phone
but nobodys calling me
no
i tried to ignore it but its 
sinking in and im all alone with me
whoa so i stare at your picture for the
last time to ease my mine
this time i wont even brake down 
and cry i had good reason for leaving
you i was never enough for you
you had me down and myself 
couldnt be down


cause i keep smiling
and ima keep it moving
cause i dont need you,dont need you,dont need you,
dont need you,
ima keep smiling and ima keep it moving
cause i dont need you,dont need you,dont need you
dont need you no more,no more,no more,no more
no more,no more,no more
and baby i stayed with you so long that
i lost my cell
now who what of thought that someone so independent
but come so damn suminsive
and sometimes in the back of my mind i be missing you
missing you
but i can get though this
cause i can do better so much better


so i stare at your picture for the last time
to ease my mined this time i  wont even brake down and cry
i had a good reason for leaving you
i was never enough of you
you had me down and myself couldnt be down

[repeat 2x's]
cause ima keep smiling
and ima keep it moving
cause i dont need you,dont need you,dont need you
 dont need you,no more


cuz i been down and out to long
its time to pick my head up baby
im tired of beening fed up baby
this heart braking today
i'll be moving on and i wont give up on love

[repeat 4x's]
cause ima keep on smiling
and ima keep it moving
cause i dont need you,dont need you,dont need you
dont need you,no more,no more,no more,no more 
no more,no hahaha---Lyrics submitted by tremayne.
