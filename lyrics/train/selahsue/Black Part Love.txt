Youre freezed and I try to make, youre freezed and I try to make you warm
Cause you, always got what it takes, to act like youre some kind of hard ass clown
But I, I know better than that I know you way too long
See I know about your background, it wasnt easy, I know for sure
But thats no reason to crack, its in the past, so learn to let it go
Be who you are now, and who you're supposed to be

Now listen girl, learn how to love yourself again
And then just fly out girl, cause you're worth it, oh
You fell and I try to get, you fell and I try to get you up
Cause when things dont work out, oh no, you shut yourself up, let it all just drop
But that is not the way it works, thats not the way it works

And I know that its easy,
Its easy to hate yourself but then you must realize
The black parts need to be loved as well,
Oh yeah, the black parts need to be loved as well

Now listen girl, yeah, do you understand what I'm saying
I know that one day you will get there, one day yeah yeah yeah

Listen girl
Listen girl, oh oh oh yeah oh
Listen girl
Listen girl, oh oh oh yeah

You better find your love, you better go insane
Find your love and find your way
I know you're on the run
I know you forced it, you gotta front it
This is all I got to say yeah
This is all I got to say
Say say say

I know one day
I know one day
I know one day
I know that one day you'll get there
Yeah yeah yeah
But I know that one day you will get there
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Listen girl, learn how to love yourself again
And then just fly out girl, cause you're worth it, cause you're worth it---Lyrics submitted by Amy Canderla.
