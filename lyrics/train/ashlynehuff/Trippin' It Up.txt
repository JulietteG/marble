We need a revoloution
Not just this happen stance
More than another holiday
Somehow she stole his freedom
Somehow he broke her heart
When did we lose it anyway
Does it have to be the same
Can anything change

Everybody's trippin' it up with somebody
Hopin' somebody's leaving somebody
Everybody's needs to get lost with somebody
Give to somebody, keep your somebody
Everybody's falling in love with somebody
Love you somebody
Oh, but, not-y not-y
Everybody's trippin' it up

I never heard it's easy
But don't let it take you down
Stuck on a highway of mistakes
We need some conversation
Less of the "got to leave"
There's so much more that we could
Say to me, you're gonna stay
Baby, stay with me right now

Everybody's trippin' it up with somebody
Hopin' somebody's leaving somebody
Everybody's needs to get lost with somebody
Give to somebody, keep your somebody
Everybody's falling in love with somebody
Love you somebody
Oh, but, not-y not-y
Everybody's trippin' it up

Put down your silver platter
Pick up your plastic spoons
Tell me what really matters
Anything you choose

Everybody's trippin' it up with somebody
Hopin' somebody's leaving somebody
Everybody's needs to get lost with somebody
Give to somebody, keep your somebody
Everybody's falling in love with somebody
Love you somebody
Oh, but, not-y not-y
Everybody's trippin' it up with somebody
Love you somebody
Oh, but, not-y not-y
Everybody's trippin' it up with somebody
Love you somebody
Oh, but, not-y not-y
Everybody's trippin' it up---Lyrics submitted by Makayla.
