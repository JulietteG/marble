I paint up my face like woman name Trixie
I'm takin' my sorrow to town
I gave up the paint
For my first Mr. Fixit
I sure could use some getting' around

The boys in the back room
The boys in the back room
There's someone waitin' for me
In the back room

Some old truckdriver's pickin' up a hitchhiker
And showin' off his latest tattoo
Say we're all thumbin' a ride
When It's cold outside
And I won't come home until I'm through

The boys in the back room
The boys in the back room
There's someone waitin' for me
In the back room

If they be swappin' lies or swattin' files
Or thinkin' about a night that's so long
Someone will give me a sign
See ya around next time
So think of me when I am gone

The boys in the back room
The boys in the back room
There's someone waitin' for me
In the back room---Lyrics submitted by .
