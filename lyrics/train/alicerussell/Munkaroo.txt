Raw right down to the apple core
Real like the only thing that you can feel
Fame like a purpose close to heart
And tasty like the finest (?)
Soft like the tail of Munkaroo
Distant far away in my mind like Timbuktu
Tender like a beaten piece of (?)
Feeling like usual

These are my feelings today
I think they might stay
Soaking it down to the bone
Cause your soul is the soul, soul

Raw right down to the apple core
Real like only things that you can feel
Fame like grandpas happy coarse and weary eyes
And tasty like the finest, finest treat
Soft like the tail of Munkaroo
Tender hmmmm, beaten black and black and blue
Distant, as far as far as far as far as sure
Mama

Cause Im feeling soul
Cause Im feeling soul
Cause Im feeling soul

Raw right down to the apple core
Real like only things that you can feel
Fame like grandpas happy coarse and weary eyes
And tasty like the finest, finest treat
Soft like the tail of Munkaroo
Tender hmmmm, beaten black and black and blue
Distant, as far as far as far as far as sure
Mama

Cause Im feeling soul
Feeling soul
Im feeling so soul

Raw

Fame
Tasty
Soft
Tender
