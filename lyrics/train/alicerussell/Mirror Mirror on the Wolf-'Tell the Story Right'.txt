Something to find
Something that I hoped it seemed
Do you understand?
Its something far away from we

Feel it, feel it, feel it, dont you feel it?
Tell the story right.
The story right.

As cold brings in the night
Hush the winds are listening
Something dont be right
In something the secrets missing

Chorus

My soul is riding free
Bring all that you wish to bring
Cause each breath this is mine
And never can you take from me

Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Richard Trinkner.
