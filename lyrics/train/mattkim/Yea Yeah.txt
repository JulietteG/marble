Forget your court date
lock me away, the world waits
cuffs cut deep to the bones
we're trying to sleep, we're trying to sleep
i hope these hands, WOAHH-OHH-OHH
can turn back time
i want time to be a game and we're losing this one,
but still i'm sane

yea yeah
yea yeah
yea yeah

you stole tapes and a flashlight
on a summer night from my car
I found something in a lightening storm
with heavy rain and thunder like melted storm, yeah
when everything seems to wash away
I walk here with just two feet on the ground
ground, ground, ground, ground, ground!

yea yeah
yea yeah
yea yeah

lock me up, officer
what a mistake i made
yea yeah, take me away
i say this to myself
close the door on myself
yea yeah, take me away
I found something in a lightening storm
with heavy rain and thunder like melted storm, yeah
when everything seems to wash away
I walk here with just two feet on the ground
ground, no, no, no, no!

yea yeah
yea yeah
yea yeah---Lyrics submitted by Olivia.
