Sun's going down let's get together,
on the bridge we'll meet up tonight.
Black pants, red sweatshirt, and brown bags.
Above the East River's northern lights.

You see what I see I thought it make believe,
watched the sun rise on my street.
Old cement makes for a solid place to lay.
Bed of light grey,
my bed of light grey.

While I know it's letters that can spell,
I hear now it's words that can say.
I decided to start writing less,
and I'm talking more everyday.

Sixteen of our friends, a five seat bright red van.
Curbside view, turn off of grand.
Pound my stearing wheel, we yell to the windshield.
I'm finally home.
I'm finally home.

[Chorus:] No time for cameras, we'll use our eyes instead.
No time for cameras, we'll be gone when we're dead.
No time for cameras, we'll use our eyes instead.
I see flashes of gold.

Every single car alarm we hear,
we'll steal and throw through their window.
My water comes straight from the tap,
and those bottles are all just for show.

I see that we're made of more then blood and bones.
See we're made of sticks and stones.
Don't forget to breathe need locks your keys.
Don't forget to breathe now.
 forget to breathe now.

[Chorus:] No time for cameras, we'll use our eyes instead.
No time for cameras, we'll be gone when we're dead.
No time for cameras, we'll use our eyes instead.
I see flashes of gold.---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa Banfield.
