You're necessary, 
you're very necessary, 
I need you like the air I breathe,
I need you near me,
 just got to have you near me, 
want to feel like a heartbeat,
You keep me going, 
don't want to keep me going, 
you put me in overtime,
Try not to show it, 
try my best not to show it, 
but boy you stay on my mind

Can't ignore, 
the body's reaction, 
when I'm close to you (to you)
This ain't just your basic attraction, 
I know you feel it too,

Take my hand, 
take a chance, 
feel the rhythm of love, love,
Close your eyes, 
let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love,
Rhythm of love, love, love, 
rhythm of love, love, love
Close you eyes, 
let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love

Think I'm in heaven, 
if this isn't heaven, 
it's the closest that I'll ever be,
I'm trynna tell ya, 
the moment we're together, 
it's messing with my sanity,
It's overrated, 
it's really overrated, 
but really we should do it now,
You're hesitating, 
quit hesitating, 
don't be afraid 
I show you how, babe, 
I'll show you how how...

Can't ignore the body's, 
reaction, when I'm close to you (to you)
This ain't just your basic attraction, 
I know you feel it too,

Take my hand, take a chance, 
feel the rhythm of love, love,
Close your eyes, 
let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love,
Rhythm of love, love, love, 
rhythm of love, love, love
Close you eyes, 
let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love

Lost in the, lost in the, lost in,
Lost in the, lost in the
Lost in the, lost in the

Can't ignore the body's, 
reaction, when I'm close to you (to you)
This ain't just your basic attraction, 
I know you feel it too,
(Lost in the, lost in the, lost in,
Lost in the, lost in the)
(Lost in the, lost in the, lost in,
Lost in the, lost in the)

Take my hand, take a chance, 
feel the rhythm of love, love,
Close your eyes, 
let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love,
Rhythm of love, love, love, 
rhythm of love, love, love
Close you eyes, 
let's get lost in the rhythm of love, love ---
