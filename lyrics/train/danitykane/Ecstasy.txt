It started with a Monte Carlo
Then went and got a beamer
Her mom call me a D-Boy
She said,"Yes, He is a dreamer."

Two tickets to the matine'e
Me and shorty way back in the day
Now she's into films
Our thing just starts to dim

You know when you dealing with a bad boy, baby
I got to keep it trilla
Even if it hurt, you know

I won't sing to you Chris and Neyo
But I'm fresher than a stick of deo
Take you to a place where the chef is Creole
Black beach right next to Rio

Running out the house just to flip 
Dice in my pocket I'm with the C-Lo
Pull up to da crib and I hit hit Dawn
Beep, Beep, Rick Dinero 
And quick the lotto

Thats right, let me flip the car door
In the wind, might hit Chicago
She might pick the cargo

Let's skip Apollo, Carlos Brados
My Picasso
We ride or die
She my little vato, Ross

Can't hold it back, you know I'm so addicted to ya
Cravings attack whenever I get closer to ya
I'm in withdrawl whenever you're away
I just want you here with me, boy

Let's take a ride, I'll show you all the avenues
Hop in my coupe, I only got room for two
Let's just explore, my only destination is you
I'll tell you what I want to do, baby

Can I take you to a place 
Where we can go far away?
Let's take a trip tonight
Follow me to 

Ecstasy, (boy) you and me
Boy u know I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
Boy u know I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

Ecstasy, you and me, boy, you know
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

The mood is set, my temperature is rising
I'm getting hot and there ain't no denying 
I know a spot where we could just go get lost together
Right now I'll do whatever

You take me high but I really wanna go (low)
Hearts beating fast, yeah, but still we're moving (slow)
My fantasy and boy, just take control
Come on, won't you let me know?

If I, Can I take you to a place
Where we can go far away?
Let's take a chance tonight
Follow me to

Ecstasy,  boy you and me,boy u know
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

Ecstasy, boy you and me, boy you know
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

Boy, you got me twisted
I must admit it, I just can't resist 
I can't get you off my senses
U make me feel brand new
The things you do, oh, you know that I'm fienin for you

I just gotta have it, it's getting drastic
I can't break the habit , I'm just an addict
For you love is just like a drug
Baby, let me take you to 

Ecstasy,  boy you and me, boy u know
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

Ecstasy,  boy you and me, boy you know
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you, I'm feeling you

I wanna take you there, there, there, there
I wanna take you there, there, there, there
I wanna take you there
I wanna take you there

I wanna take you there
I wanna take you there
I wanna take you there
I wanna take you there---Lyrics submitted by Chana.
