Tell me, tell me tell me

I don't pay attention to my review,
Thought I've hear the rumors that I have you
Steady thinking that they really know you
But they don't, they don't
If I fix my camera on you
I'd just see you from a different angle
You've probably written with the nice you,
You won't, you won't

'Cause when I'm not giving you all my heart, my soul
You tell me it's not enough
When I'm looking for something soft and sweet
You're giving it to me wrong
One minute you built me up,
Next minute you let me fall
So baby don't leave me on,
Baby just turn me on

Tell me, tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight
Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight

You want me half naked in stilettos
Heading from the shower right in the bathroom
But shouldn't have do that just to have you
So I won't, I won't
I just wanna really know what gets you
Often wonder why you wanna go so high
When I'm not the one you're into,
But you know you are

'Cause when I'm not giving you all my heart, my soul
You tell me it's not enough
When I'm looking for something soft and sweet
You're giving it to me wrong
One minute you built me up,
Next minute you let me fall
So baby don't leave me on,
Baby just turn me on

Tell me, tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight

'Cause you don't know,
You don't even know the whole
Just take your time
Get to know who I am
'Cause you can have it your way
But I need to know you deserve it
When I look in your face
Just tell me the way you want it

Tell me, tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight
(I need you to tell me)
(I need you to tell me how you want me)
Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight

Tell me, tell me tell me
Tell me, tell me tell me---
