Verse 1:
Goodbye humans, goodbye earth
I've left this place and all its worth
I am transcending space and time
I'm traveling at the speed of light

Affection, reflection 
This is the new direction
Conspiracy is idiocracy 
I radiate light's transparency

Pre Chorus 1:
Generation
Radiation
We are the chosen nation

Chorus:
Hey you, you're blowing my mind again
Out of my skull, I feel the levitation
I feel my skin crawling off of my soul
I feel your radiation

Tag:
I'll be a radiator just like you
Radiate it on me, burn it on through

I feel the radiation
Radiate it on me

Verse 2:
Hello future, hello birth
This is your newborn universe
There is no longer wrong or right
We have become a source of light

Pre Chorus 2:
Conceptual
Celestial
We are extraterrestrial

Creator
Vindicator
We are the radiators---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
