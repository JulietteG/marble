*HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE! PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN IT!*

(yeah!) doctor, oh doctor; i've got an e-mer-gen-cy!
it seems i'm head over heels;
a case of L-O-V-E-.
it's like i'm glowing inside, yeah
a light i can't hide
and if this feeling's this bad,
then i don't wanna be right-
what i've got in my soul
gives me the highest delight
oh yeah its better than drugs;
in fact its sent from above (wup wup!)

   *HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE! PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN IT!* (hey!)

                    ~chorus:~
can't kick the habit (yeah!)
i've got to have it (yeah!)
i'm what they call a LOVE ADDICT; LOVE ADDICT. (hey!)
(what!) can't live without it (yeah!)
won't shout about it (hey!)
i'm a symp-to-ma-tic LOVE ADDICT,
LOVE ADDICT.

need a re-fill, cuz i just
cant get enough.
i've got a fe-ver oh yay-uh!
and a
pre-scrip-tion drug.
so make the truth on me
cuz that is all that i need (wup wup!)

   *HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE! PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN IT!* (hey!)

                       ~chorus~

i'm blessed; i must confess
my heart is pounding in my chest
cuz this love's the best.
(i'm just a love addict)

comin' down with some-thing outrageous;
look out now
cuz it's so con-ta-gious!
this feeling's got me wheelin'
so whammed up that i hit the ceiling!
gotta clear my throat (woop woop!)
now i gotta have some mo' !

   *HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE! PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN IT!* (hey!)

                ~chorus~

can't kick the habit (yeah!)
i've got to have it! (yeah!)
i'm what they call a LOVE ADDICT; LOVE ADDICT. (hey!)
can't live with-out it (yeah!)
won't shout a-bout it (hey!)
i'm a symp-to-ma-tic LOVE ADDICT-
LOVE ADDICT.---Lyrics submitted by Bailey.
