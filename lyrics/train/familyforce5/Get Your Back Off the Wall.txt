Verse 1:
This revolution 
Starts when youre movin
Dont wanna step to me 
Unless you plan on losin 

Not here to brag
Not here for thrills
I'm here to battle, baby
I dance to kill 

B Verse 1:
Fall in
Shakin' like a leaf 
Bucklin' at the knees
Stop draggin your feet 

Time to go all in 

Time for standing tall 
Move to kill 'em all 
No win lose or draw
Get your back off the wall

Chorus:
Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
Get your get your get your back, get your back off the wall

Verse 2:
We dig them trenches
So they be trippin'
Im on the front lines
Yeah I see them flinchin'

Annihilation 
Of the enemy
Wrath pours down
When I move my feet

B Verse 2:
Fall in
All my new recruits
Now youre in my troop
Shake 'em in their boots

Time to go all in

They can scratch and claw
We aint backin off
Time to lay down the law
Get your back off the wall---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
