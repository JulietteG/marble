Elevate, elevate, elevate, elevate
Elevate, elevate, next level

Next level baby

Ay, you know I'm the bomb
That's why you're soundin' the alarm, right?
Ay, you know I'm the bomb
That's why you're soundin' the alarm, right?
I take it, next level
Let the games begin, I want the medal
The gold one, not the silver or third place
I only go up...elevate!

JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! ELEVATE!
JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! NEXT LEVEL!
JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! BASS! TREBLE!
ELEVATE! ELEVATE! ELEVATE! NEXT LEVEL!

LZ7, LZ7
FF5, F-FF5
LZ7, LZ7
FF5, F-FF5

See, I'mma elevate, elevate, system licks
Bounce, bounce like a fresh new pair of kicks
See, I'm a new kid, I'm relentless
I'm from the UK, bring the London twist to this
Now I'mma elevate, take it up to higher heights
The beats so tight they gonna grip me like an iron vise
Yes, I illuminate, can you feel the flames
Lightin' up the night sky...elevate!

JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! ELEVATE!
JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! NEXT LEVEL!
JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! BASS! TREBLE!
ELEVATE! ELEVATE! ELEVATE! NEXT LEVEL!

Elevate, elevate, elevate, elevate
Elevate, elevate, next level
Next level
(Synthesizer solo)

JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! ELEVATE!
JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! NEXT LEVEL!
JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! BASS! TREBLE!
ELEVATE! ELEVATE! ELEVATE! NEXT LEVEL!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
