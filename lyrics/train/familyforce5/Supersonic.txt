Have you heard the new sensation?
Can I give you some good news?
Well, let me tell you what it's all about
Cause it's sure to make you move
You never really see it coming
Cause it hits you so so fast
And when ur getting Supersonic, baby, then you know it's gonna last

Let go of urself
It'll be good for ur health
Don't care who watches
You g'on take it up a few notches

Put ur hands in the air
Act like a fool cause you just don't care
Ur feeling so platonic
Now ur getting SUPERSONIC

(Chorus) x 2

Do you wanna get SUPERSONIC?
You gotsta get SUPERSONIC!
Get, get, get SUPERSONIC!
It's SUPER DUPER SONIC BABY!

Now you got that feeling
And it makes you want to fly
So have the faith to not play it safe
Cause you never know when you die

Just lift Him up
Cause you can't get enough

Ur life is so symphonic
Cause you chose to get SUPERSONIC
Do you wanna get SUPERSONIC?
Get, get, get SUPERSONIC
You got to get SUPERSONIC
Super, Supersonic-sonic

(Chorus) x 2

(Crouton Breakdown)

I know you like to party
I know you like to dance
When you getting Supersonic baby then you know you gonna get the chance
You cannot stop the body rock
You cannot stop the funk
When you getting Supersonic baby then you know you go'n keep it crunk

SUPERSONIC gang vocals

(Chorus) x 2
(Gong)---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
