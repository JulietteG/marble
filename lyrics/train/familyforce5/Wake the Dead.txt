Verse 1:
I got opposition every single day
You always want the same thing done the same old way
Funny how you always think you're always right
Who died and made you God, and did it happen overnight?

B Verse 1:
Don't dance like that anymore
Don't wear those clothes anymore
Don't take that stance anymore
Turn it down, do what you're told
If it's too loud, well then you must be too old

Chorus:
Wake up the dead now
Make 'em roll in their graves now
Shake up the dead now
Rising up from the ground
Wake 'em up, shake 'em down

Verse 2:
You like to watch and judge my life up on the screen
You figured out what goes on behind the scenes
Got a rumor that you want to show and tell
Nobody's gonna buy the lie you're trying to sell

B Verse 2:
Don't talk like that anymore
Don't speak your mind anymore
Don't think those thoughts anymore
Turn it down, do what you're told
If it's too loud, well then you must be too old

Bridge:
Wake up you sleepy heads get out of bed
If we make some noise we'll wake the dead

Make 'em roll in their graves when they hear this sound
Raise 'em up from the ground, turn 'em upside down---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
