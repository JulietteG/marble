Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh...ooh...ooh...)
It's real love (Boy)
Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh...ooh...ooh...)
It's real love (Ooh...)

I know it's not the first time
That you ever felt this way before
Ooh, but those memories are still lasting
Of the pain you got for your trusting
So when love calls you walk out the door, ooh, but this time, boy

Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Don't be afraid)
Open your heart and you'll see it's real (Ooh...it's real love)
It's real love
Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh, don't be afraid now, baby)
It's real love (Oh...oh...oh...oh...)

I'm not the one who hurt you, boy
And with love there's no real guarantee
If you believe in what you're feelin'
And you wanna make love to me, oh, baby

Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Yeah, baby)
Open your heart and you'll see it's real (Ooh...)
It's real love (It's time to do it right)
Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh, I need you tonight, I need you right now)
It's real love (Oh...now what you got to say, baby)

Darlin', you know it's hard for me sometimes to put my feelings into words
And I know because of all the hurt in my past
I tend to shy away from emotional commitments
But what I feel for you is so real and so strong
I couldn't walk away even if I wanted to
So baby, I'm yours

Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh, yeah, yeah, baby)
Open your heart and you'll see it's real (Ooh, it's real love)
It's real love
Don't be afraid of the way you feel (I'm not the one who hurt you)
It's real love (Give your love to me)

Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Baby)
Open your heart and you'll see it's real (Yeah, baby)
It's real love (Real, real love)
Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh, I need you tonight, I need you right now)
It's real love (Come on, baby, come on, baby, give your love to me, baby)

I need you by my side, boy
Uh, let's make it last forever
It's real love (Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid, no, baby)

Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Ooh...ooh...)
Open your heart and you'll see it's real (I'm not the one who hurt you, boy)
It's real love (Ooh...ooh...yeah)
Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Don't, baby, open your heart)
It's real love (Come on, baby, come on, baby, let's make it last forever)

Don't be afraid of the way you feel (Time s right tonight)
Open your heart and your heart and you'll see it's real (I need to, I need to, I need to hold you tight)
It's real love
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
It's real love---Lyrics submitted by Payton.
