I promised you the world again
Everything within my hands
All the riches one could dream
They will come from me

I hoped that you could understand
That this is not what I had planned
Please dont worry now
It will turn around

Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and well be fine
So say whats on your mind
Cause I cant figure out just whats inside

I hoped that you could understand
That this is not what I had planned
Please dont worry now
It will turn around

Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and well be fine
So say whats on your mind
Cause I cant figure out just whats inside
So say alright
Cause I know we can make it if we try
Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and well be fine

Were off to new lands
So hold on to my hands
Its gonna be alright
Its a whole lot brighter
So stand by the fire
Its gonna be alright
Yeah, the road gets harder
But its not much farther
Its gonna be alright
You know that it aint easy
Please believe me
Its gonna be alright

Please dont worry now
It will turn around

Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and well be fine
So say whats on your mind
Cause I cant figure out just whats inside
So say alright
Cause I know we can make it if we try
Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and well be fine---Lyrics submitted by Elise.
