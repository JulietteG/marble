I know how it started the walls that we build to separate us
Make it wider, stronger, til its too tall for us to touch
Heaviness is on me I dont see how we might be whole again
We might be better off in the wake of a bitter end

Oh I know Im gonna rise again
Set my sights on where Im going
And my goodbyes to where I've been
Oh I know Im gonna rise again
Singing farewell king of the broken
So long my friend

We could always count on the same things
The ups and the downs like time
We crawl through the abyss then we came through the other side
Heaviness is only temporary the daylight will soon break in
The sunlight can change a heart in the wake of a bitter end.

Oh I know Im gonna rise again
Set my sights on where Im going
And my goodbyes to where I've been
Oh I know Im gonna rise again
Singing farewell king of the broken
So long my friend

I could see us moving on I can feel that coming on strong
Well never start all over like this and I still cant believe it

Oh I know Im gonna rise again
Set my sights on where Im going
And my goodbyes to where I've been
Oh I know Im gonna rise again
Singing farewell king of the broken
So long my friend---
