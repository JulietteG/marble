Lonely like the sailor
Whos left his girl at home
No storm could overtake the love he holds

Tell me why I should run for cover
At the sound of the coming thunder
All I hear is the cry of my lover
So take your shot
I wont turn back
No, I wont turn back

Faithful like the solider
Whos answered to the call
Even when his backs against the wall

Tell why I should run for cover
At the sound of the coming thunder
All I hear is the cry of my lover
Yeah, take your shot
I wont turn back
No, I wont turn back

Tell me why I should run for cover
After the sound of the calming thunder
All I hear is the cry of my lover
Yeah, take your shot
I wont turn back
No, I wont turn back (x6)---Lyrics submitted by Jon.
