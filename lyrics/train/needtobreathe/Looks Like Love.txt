Take another step
Dont give up on me just yet
We could take a chance
We could find a childs romance 
At least wed love until we cant

I wont run when it looks like love
I wont hide beneath the fear
Of how my past has come undone

I wont run when it looks like love
I cant spend another night alone 
Regretting what Ive done
So, I wont run

The breeze can only be
When she overcomes the heat
Our hearts can only shake
When theres risk that they could break
Yeah its a chance that I will take

Raise your head
Its time to say 
Those words that I have left unsaid
Ive slept through the sunrise
And I turned
Away every time it got bright---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
