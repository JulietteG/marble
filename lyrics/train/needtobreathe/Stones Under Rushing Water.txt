Why don't we dance anymore?
I'm not ok with that.
Why don't we laugh anymore?
I'm not ok with that.

As the years roll by like stones under rushing water,
We only know ,we only know when it's gone.
Yeah the years go by like stones under rushing water.
We only know, we only know when it's gone.

Why don't we smile anymore?
I'm not ok with that.
Why don't we dance slowly?
I'm not ok with that.

As the years go by like stones under rushing water,
We only know we only know when it's gone.
Yeah the years go by like stones under rushing water.
We only know, we only know when it's gone.
Oh when it's gone.

As the years roll by like stones under rushing water,
We only know, we only know when it's gone.
Yeah the years roll by like stones under rushing water
We only know, we only know when it's gone.
