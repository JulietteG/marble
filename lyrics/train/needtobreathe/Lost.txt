Look up it's up to you,
Remember all the reasons to give grace,
And mercy for all the time you're here.
I know,
I know it's true early on we've made to choose,
We all make diversions for the way we are,
When my eyes have to lead the way.

I get lost,
I'm just a fool,
I can't get it back,
Get it back to you.
My hands are washed,
My heart is new,
When I get it back,
Get it back,
to you.

Don't wait cuz you might miss the way that you'd get out of this.
And it's easy when you're living to forget,
I know you can't be lost,
But finding is the greatest cost.
We all know that getting back is only half the way,

When my eyes have to lead the way.

I get lost,
I'm just a fool,
I can't get it back,
Get it back to you.
My hands are washed,
My heart is new,
When I get it back,
Get it back.

Get up, Get up,
The world is with you now,
Get up, Get up,
Your love will show you how,
Get up, Get up,
When there's nothing left to do,
Get up, Get up,
Ohhhhhhh ohhh.

I get lost,
I'm just a fool,
I can't get it back,
Get it back to you.
My hands are washed,
My heart is new,
When I get it back,
Get it back,
to you.---Lyrics submitted by Blake.
