Tell me do you feel it 
feel it when your heart starts letting go? 
I'm unsure now if I could ever tell you no. 
Now I been seeing traces of everything I used to know was right
I cant leave now 
I need you to remember 
It's not like all my love was understood. 
Don't just tell me that it's over 
I want to know how we can make it
I know I'm lost 
I know I'm lost but not forsaken 

Tell me do you want it 
Want to make your heart stop goin' down? 
I'm unsure now if we could ever make it out 
I been seeing traces 
Of why I wanted to be in this light
I can't leave now. 
I need you to remember 
It's not like all my love was understood 
Don't just tell me that it's over 
I wanna know that I can make it
I know I'm lost
I know Im lost
but not forsaken 

I'm not giving up, 
I'm not laying down, 
i'm not leaving without you. 
Cause we're all the same, 
we all need to stay
when they tell us that were through.

Don't just tell me that it's over 
I wanna know that we can make it
I know I'm lost
I know Im lost
but not forsaken. 

Don't just tell me that it's over 
I wanna know that I can make it
I know I'm lost
I know Im lost
but not forsaken. 

Don't just tell me that you quit now
Don't just tell me that it's over
I know I'm lost
I know Im lost
but not forsaken.---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
