Lift up your eyes girl, I know youre broken
Just like the same war that you never knew
Your way is to fall just like before you
But the way isnt long and your almost there
Theres a feeling that you wont make 
All you have in store 
This time is just a season, you deserve much more

Lift up your head, look out the window
Cause its almost over now
Take back the time that your fear has stolen
Cause its almost over now

Dont let it it get you caught in the tunnel
The end is only a few steps away
Theres a feeling of resistance
You cant seem to fight
This time is just a season
You can make it right

Lift up your head, look out the window
Cause its almost over now
Take back the time that your fear has stolen
Cause its almost over now

Your eyes open, your heart clean, but are you lookin
To be free 

Lift up your head, look out the window
Cause its almost over now
Take back the time that your fear has stolen
Cause its almost over now
It's almost over now---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
