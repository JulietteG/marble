Its hard enough to know
That somethings made us not the same
Did I give all I could give
Or spend all I could spend in vain

We were holding on the line
Waiting for the sun to rise
But we could not believe
The sunlight never crossed our eyes

Im giving you my heart to break again
Oh Im leaving you a way to get back in

Return to me 

We were holding on the line
Waiting for the sun to rise
But we could not believe
The sunlight never crossed our eyes

Im giving you my heart to break again
Oh Im leaving you a way to get back in

Return to me

Every heart goes down and every fire goes out
When we dont hurt anymore
I know its all my fault that youre behind this wall
But Ill be here when you break it. 
When you let it down.

Return to me

Im giving you my heart to break again---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
