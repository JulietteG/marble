Im finally broken, falling too far
Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars
With twilight approaching all that Ive seen
I could never get over what youve done to me

She was the picture of a Midwest sweetheart
Wrapped in a grace to make a good man come apart
She wrote my sirens song a tune with one dance
Then gave it words with just a glance

Im finally broken, falling too far
Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars
With twilight approaching all that Ive seen
I could never get over what youve done to me
What you've done to me

I thought that love was just a song we made up
Some kind of chant to make us strong
But when she left me with a word
I knew that I had never been so wrong

Finally broken, falling too far
Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars
With twilight approaching all that Ive seen
I could never get over what youve done to me
I could never get over what youve done to me

Im finally broken, falling too far
Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars
With twilight approaching all that Ive seen
I could never get over what youve done to me 
What you've done to me---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
