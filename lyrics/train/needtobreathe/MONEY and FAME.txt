I was sleeping with a loaded gun
I was scared of all things I'd done
Yeah, I know I'm not the only one
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
I was chasing down a high again
Tryna take whatever I could get
But you know I had to pay for it
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now

I know that you know
That everybody goes where the lights glow

What do you kids wanna know about now?
I made enough to make a young gun proud
Money and fame bring a man to shame
Ain't no doubt about it
What do you kids wanna know about now?
I found the bottom from the top somehow
Money and fame bring a man to shame
Ain't no doubt about it

Yeah, I've done some things that I regret
I was thinking I was fortunate
Now I'm working just to pay the debt
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
You never know until you're offered it
But everybody's got a price, I guess
It's even lower than you think it is
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now

I know that you know
That everybody goes where the lights glow

What do you kids wanna know about now?
I made enough to make a young gun proud
Money and fame bring a man to shame
Ain't no doubt about it
What do you kids wanna know about now?
I found the bottom from the top somehow
Money and fame bring a man to shame
Ain't no doubt about it

What do you kids wanna know about now?
I seen the devil and the bright lights now
Money and fame bring a man to shame
Ain't no doubt about it
What do you kids wanna know about now?
I found the bottom from the top somehow
Money and fame bring a man to shame
Ain't no doubt about it---
