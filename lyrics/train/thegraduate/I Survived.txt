This is goodbye
After months of situating
I can finally leave this sorry town behind
And I'm alright
When they ask for me
My friends can smile and tell the world
That I survived
As I'm about to leave
I've filled a million empty pages
Passed my word and do my best to sing
So what do I need
Something could become of those
Who think and talk and live like me

I don't want to die today
I want to live and love and write it down
I can live a life of dreams
And be greatful I'm around

This is goodbye
After months of careful planning
I can finally leave this dried up town behind
And I'm alright
Yeah, this used to be our city
This used to be our only light

I just want to walk away
I want to write but there's a consequence
That all my friends read everything I do and I say
I don't need a razorblade
All I need are sounds of ecstasy

And I won't die today
Yeah, I'll be living, loving, writing down
And I'll live a life of dreams
And be greatful I'm around---Lyrics submitted by Beatrice.
