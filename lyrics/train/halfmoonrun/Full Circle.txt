Cap off kneeling at the back of the church 
Feel the water on your brow 
With its' heal and it hurts
At first a sharpish pain that returns as a thought
That the needle in your skin won't bring you closer to god

And I watch as your head turns full circle

All hopeless with old coffee and a medical text
Its too easy knowing nothing blowing off the rest 
And the riddles in the pages leaving too much to guess 
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest 

As I watch as your head turns full circle 

You got lost in your travels and a spiritual book
Mistook the beaches from nirvana and the way that they look
And the crooks that run the island are killing to keep earning
they're burning seven tons of plastic and it seems to be working

Is that the best that I can do? 
As I watch as your head turns full circle 

You appear even tempered though your looks will deceive
And the sparks are always flying cause you drink for relief
With the heard of a child and the wit of a fool 
Its a wonder why I dont try to build a wall around you 

As I watch as your head turns full circle 
And I watch as your head turns full circle 
Yeah I watch as your head turns full circle---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
