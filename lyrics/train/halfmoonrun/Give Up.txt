I just wanted
To absolve it
To make peace with
All those weekends
We all just give up
Yeah we all stand down
With a lesson learned,
With our eyes half shut
No confusion
Its been obvious
Hallelujah
Ive been saved by no one again
And again
But we all just give up
Yeah we all stand down
With a lesson learned
With our eyes half shut---Lyrics submitted by Florence Weber.
