Ive been entertaining thoughts
Of what I wanna say to you
Ive been entertaining thoughts
Of what Im gonna do
Ive been saving what I got
And wondering who to give it to
Ive been entertaining thoughts all over you

The way this works is so mysterious
If it gets much worse its called delirious
If I were mad I would be furious
But this could be so much more than
Just another euphemism for...

Ive been entertaining thoughts
Of what I wanna say to you
Ive been entertaining thoughts
Of what Im gonna do
Ive been saving what I got
And wondering who to give it to
Ive been entertaining thoughts all over you

You smoke your cigarette
And wonder if its happened yet
The heavens slowly part and you ascend
I wish that I could say that Ill have no regrets
But I may have one of two
Or three or four more than you...

You will never even know
Till it hits you fool
Ooh, but Im entertaining thoughts
All over you---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
