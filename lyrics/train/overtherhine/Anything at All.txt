I follow you from town to town
I need it
Im better off when youre around
I mean it

Sooner or later
Things will all come around again
Sooner or later
I wont need anything
Anything at all

I walk these streets alone at night
When it hurts me
A perfect lifes an oversight
You curse me

Shouldve known better
Than this esoteric love
Down to the letter
It dont mean anything
Anything at all

You and I

I wrestle with these guilty thoughts
And Im losing
Youre all I am Im what youre not
Confusing

Sooner or later
Things will all come around for good
Sooner or later
I wont need anything
Anything at all---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
