I dont wanna waste your time
With music you dont need
Why should I autograph the book
That you wont even read
Ive got a different scar for every song
And blood left still to bleed
But I dont wanna waste your time
With music you dont need

I dont wanna waste good wine
If you wont stick around
I love to laugh, but Im more than just
Your alcoholic clown
I wont pray this prayer with you
Unless we both kneel down
I dont wanna waste good wine
If you wont stick around

Come on, lighten up
Let me fill your cup
Im just trying to imagine a situation
Where we might have a real conversation

But I dont wanna waste the words
That you dont seem to need
When it comes to wanting whats real
Theres no such thing as greed
I hope this night puts down deep roots
I hope we plant a seed
Cause I dont wanna waste your time
With music you dont need---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
