Fool
Fool me
Im just a sentimental fool
It happened again
When
I remembered you
And all that weve been through
Love
Truly
I know this world it can be so cruel
I wont let you go

Fool
Use me
This is the part that I cant refuse
Just do what you do
My hearts becoming true
It aches to make room for you
Fool pursue me
To heaven above or to hell below
Just dont let go

Fool me
Im just a sentimental fool
I cant let you go---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
