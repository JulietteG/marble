Whatcha doin with a suitcase
Tryin to hit the ground with both feet runnin
Arent you trippin on your shoelace

Youre stealin away on a sunny day
Well arent you ashamed at all
Funny but I feel like Im fallin
I wanna beg you to stay
Youre stealin away on a sunny day

Whyd you love me in the first place
You were always closer than a brother
I can barely look at your face

Ive said my Ive said my
Ive said my piece
Im on my
Im on my
Down on my knees

Whatcha doin with a suitcase
Whatcha doin with a suitcase---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
