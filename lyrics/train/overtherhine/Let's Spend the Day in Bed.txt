Lets spend the day in bed
Yeah, thats what I said
Lets lie down draw the shades
Ditch the plans we made
Rest your lovely bones
And just stay home

Turn off the telephone
Picnic on the sheets
Toss the dogs some treats
Rub each others feet
Were not ashamed
Of a little lazy love
'Til were through
Im gonna spend the day in bed with you

Lets spend the day in bed
On our very own bed spread
A pajama holiday
Catch a black and white matinee
Spoon-feed these new daydreams
And just stay home

Well read Shel Silverstein
Where The Sidewalk Ends
Smile about old friends
Try to comprehend
One single day
No work and only play
Kick off your shoes
Im gonna spend the day in bed with you

When lifes a drag, well get stoned on love
Stoned on love
Just stay home
We need a groove thats all our own
And well get stoned
Just stay home
Well get stoned on love
Stoned on love

Lets spend the day in bed
Forget all that I said
Well eat your favorite pie
Ice cream on the side
Lie here a la mode
And just stay home---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
