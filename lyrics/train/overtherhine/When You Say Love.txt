Im thinking of a word that has been
Knocked up and overused
You could say its lost all meaning
From so much abuse

But when you say love, OH

Most everything I ever wanted
Doesnt really have a name
But baby youre as close as Ive come and
I know that it sounds strange

But when you say love, OH

So open up my heart-shaped box
Its full of combination locks
Ive swallowed all my love-sick pills
To keep from getting chills
Look at all the books Ive read
In my lonely single bed

But when you say love, OH---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
