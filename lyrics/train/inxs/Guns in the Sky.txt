See the sound
It crashes in, all around
It get's in
Now take your hands and raise them up
Into the air that's all around ya
Now bring 'em down
Like a clock at two
Shake your head
You know what to do

They wanna put guns in the sky
Someone out there aint gonna like it
But it could be good
Make us love each other
Have to realise I own the future

Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky

Child grows up to see guns in the sky
Used to be on T.V
Wanna change, forgot the joke
It's great to see you
I'm running late, da da da
Love your hair, da da da
Lend me a ten, da da da
Love your big house, da da da

Could you spare a dime
Well I'm sick of it, it's a load of shit
We could stop the world and let of all the fools
And let them go live with their guns in the sky

Guns in the sky, guns in the sky, guns in the sky
Guns in the sky, guns in the sky, guns in the sky---
