I know all your flaws and most of your fears
I havent been home a lot in the last 2 years
The constant absence from all my peers
The vibration still steady inside my ears
And I know you hate it, I always restate it
But Im still so frustrated cause Im the one you cheated

It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I dont wanna sleep here

I hope you feel that heavy gloom
When youre all done up in a crowded room
And your life trips up over those shoes
That you paid too much for but not in dues
And Ill be watching from a distance
Wouldnt wanna miss this
Was it fake the whole time? Was it just instance?
Man its so personal yet its business
I want it to hit so close to home

It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I dont wanna sleep here
And I know you dont care
Youve made it so clear
Swore I had no fear
Not until you came near

And how much does it cost
to get you back here inside those clubs
that you love so fucking much?
Was I too harsh in my lament to you
that I fell so out of touch?
Back and forth because I cant understand how you
Control all my lust and form the words on my tongue

It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I dont wanna sleep here
And I know you dont care
Youve made it so clear
Swore I had no fear
Not until you came near

It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I dont wanna sleep here
And I know you dont care---
