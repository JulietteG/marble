Every second you hold me
you are safe with me
and every secret that you told me
will stay with me
look into my eyes love you can not deny

baby this is simple not complicated
simple things are underated
it is hated by those who fair it
only real people can go near it
girl you are more than just a lover
you are my friend
i will be loving you untill the very end
don't even bother to pretend listen what i am saying

Every second you hold me
you are safe with me
and every secret that you told me
will stay with me
look into my eyes love you can not deny

being alive is great 
you make it greater
when the sky is grey you make it cleaner
i will hold you so close it can't get no nearer
when we make love you make the whole world hear us
girl you are more than just a lover you are my friend
i will be loving you untill the very end
don't make sense to even bother to pretend
listen what i am saying

Every second you hold me
you are safe with me
and every secret that you told me
will stay with me
look into my eyes love you can not deny

This is love This is love all the way
This is love This is love all the way
All the way i am in love all the way
All the way i am in love all the way

Every second you hold me
you are safe with me
and every secret that you told me
will stay with me
Look into my eyes
Love you can't deny---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
