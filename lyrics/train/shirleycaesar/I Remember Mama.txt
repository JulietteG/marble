I remember Mama,
and the love that she gave
Kneeling by her bed side
I can still hear Mama say,

"The people are depending on you, Shirley,
don't you let them down"

I remember Mama in a happy way
We went to school with holes in our shoes
We didn't have much but the Lord saw us through
Mama kept the family together
I remember Mama in a happy way
She packed our lunch in an old greasy bag
It might've seemed empty,
but it was more than others had
It had a lot of love way down deep inside and
I remember Mama in a happy way
Now Mama is sleeping in the bosom of Jesus Christ
Somehow I know she's smiling, she's smiling on us right now
One day I'll see her again, how happy I will be
And I remember Mama in a happy way
My brothers and sisters, they're living far apart
Although my Mama's gone, she's right here in our hearts
We're all gonna pull together and stay in the holy place
I remember Mama in a happy way
I remember Mama, I remember Mama in a happy way---Lyrics submitted by Coreen Wilson.
