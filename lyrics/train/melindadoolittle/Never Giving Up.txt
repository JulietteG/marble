I knew that I would have a great love story
That was when I wasn't scared to dream
I won't let a fear like that destroy me - I'm gonna believe. 

I turn the page to write my own love story 
Take my pen and write a brand new dream
I'm beautiful no matter what they tell me - I'm gonna believe 

Even if it means my heart keeps breakin'
Even if I lose, my love's not changin'
I'm never, I'm never giving up.
Even if the fall leaves me broken
Even if you tell me it's hopeless
I'm never, I'm never giving up 
I'm never giving up  

I will find the one who leaves me breathless
I will find the one who lets me dream
Finding love will be a risk worth takin' - I'm gonna believe

Even if it means my heart keeps breakin'
Even if I lose, my love's not changin'
I'm never, I'm never giving up.
Even if the fall leaves me broken
Even if you tell me it's hopeless
I'm never, I'm never giving up 

I'm stronger than you see
I'm fighting 'cause I believe
I'm never giving up
My whole life in front of me
I won't stop until I see
I'm never, I'm never giving up

Even if it means my heart keeps breakin'
Even if I lose, my love's not changin'
I'm never, I'm never giving up
Even if the fall leaves me broken
Even if you tell me it's hopeless
I'm never, I'm never giving up 
I'm never giving up---Lyrics submitted by TEAMMD.
