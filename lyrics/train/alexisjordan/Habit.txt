Your love is a habit
Take my body you can have it
Reach for me, baby grab me
Take my body you can have it
Your love is a habit
Take my body you can have it
Reach for me, baby grab me
Take my body you can have it

[Verse 1:]
Love me like I'm gon out of style
Touch me like the jewel of the Nile
Run for me like a blue flame
Take me higher and higher, and higher and higher baby

[Chorus:]
I got the world inside of my palm
But it's nothing without your love
Which is, the pain that the reach of it all
But it's nothing without your love
Money, but it's nothing without your love
Cars, but it's nothing without your love
Diamonds, but it's nothing without your love
Clothes, but it's nothing without your love

Your love is a habit
Take my body you can have it
Reach for me, baby grab me
Take my body you can have it
Your love is a habit
Take my body you can have it
Reach for me, baby grab me
Take my body you can have it

[Verse 2:]
Hold my hand like a glove
Kiss me like we're falling in love
Take me in like a demon
Take me higher and higher, and higher and higher baby

[Chorus:]
I got the world inside of my palm
But it's nothing without your love
Which is, the pain that the reach of it all
But it's nothing without your love
Money, but it's nothing without your love
Cars, but it's nothing without your love
Diamonds, but it's nothing without your love
Clothes, but it's nothing without your love

It's nothing without you baby
The money, the clothes, the fame yeah
It's nothing without you baby, baby, baby, ohh
It's nothing without you baby
The money, the clothes, the fame yeah
It's nothing without you baby, baby, baby, ohh

[Chorus:]
I got the world inside of my palm
But it's nothing without your love
Which is, the pain that the reach of it all
But it's nothing without your love
Money, but it's nothing without your love
Cars, but it's nothing without your love
Diamonds, but it's nothing without your love
Clothes, but it's nothing without your love

Your love is a habit
Take my body you can have it
Reach for me, baby grab me
Take my body you can have it
Your love is a habit
Take my body you can have it
Reach for me, baby grab me
Take my body you can have it---Lyrics submitted by Milleyon.
