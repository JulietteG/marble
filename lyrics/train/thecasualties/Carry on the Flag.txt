We carry on the flag
(we're still going strong)
We carry on the flag
(while others are gone)
We carry on the flag
(we're here to unite)
That is the reason we're here tonight

We carry on the flag
(we're still going strong)
We carry on the flag
(while others are gone)
We carry on the flag
(we're here to unite)
That is the reason we're here tonight

We carry on the flag
(we're still going strong)
We carry on the flag
(while others are gone)
We carry on the flag
(we're here to unite)
What's in my heart must come out tonight

We carry on the flag
(we're still going strong)
We carry on the flag
(while others are gone)
We carry on the flag
(we're here to unite)
That is the reason we're here tonight---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
