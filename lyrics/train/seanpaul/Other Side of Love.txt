Baby.you dont have to keep looking through my phone
If somethings going on
Girl youd already know
We dont even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here.Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

Hey baby girl

I told you girl when you first met me
Its a crazy world

Baby, you dont have to keep looking through my phone
If somethings going on, girl youd already know
We dont even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

Cause I remember when you first give it up
As we began to first live it up
Ill steer it up, Ill gear it up
Well get to love so dont tear it up
But now you aint seeing clear enough
Girl, you look in my phone and staring up
You tell me you want to share it up
I tell you that we shared enough
I told you girl, when we first met, its a crazy world

Baby, you dont have to keep looking through my phone
If somethings going on, girl youd already know
We dont even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

Baby, you dont have to keep looking through my phone
If somethings going on, girl youd already know---
