So we do it like this
Upon di girl Imma throw dem tips

She got the body of a goddess, sexiness to impress
Ties on di chest and di dance
So if I bless, she gimme warm clitoris
Give her love in excess, all night she a flex
Full court ples, give her di best
Fill her with plentiness oh yes
Girl Ill be your happiness
Say no other man contest
Ill take away your loneliness
Only ting we be bomb you a mess around
Bust buckle then blaze then take her on
Up I take it the gigs and turn around
Let light, she feels her danger zone
She said mikuda never get it like that
She not a girl like that
Same time you fuck me and 'pon di love me
I tell her, I said baby do it like that

Cause she said this is dangerous ground
That youre walkin' on (danger danger danger)
Dangerous ground walkin' on (danger danger danger)
My heart, my heart, my my heart, my heart on dangerous ground (danger danger danger)
She said my heart, my heart, my my heart
On dangerous ground (dangerous ground, yea) (danger danger danger)
That youre walkin' on

Steadily up in her body yea
And I stop, look 'pon it call me ready yea
Walk 'pon tin ice bumpin shawty yea
She a tell me some these I might just want yea
Tell her forgive me and run away
Nobody gotta know that she into me
Girl show me a sign that youre feelin' me
Let me know that there is a possibility

The way you shake and thret and turn it up
Wind them bubble, cant get enough
Make me feel like Im high, like Im burning up
Dont know if dem a wind come hurry it up
Long time in my world, come stir it up
Girl its like you never really earned enough
When you gon' be my dirty love?
Wind, make you fly like burnin' up

Cause she said this is dangerous ground
That youre walkin' on (danger danger danger)
Dangerous ground walkin' on (danger danger danger)
My heart, my heart, my my heart, my heart on dangerous ground (danger danger danger)
She said my heart, my heart, my my heart
On dangerous ground (dangerous ground, yea) (danger danger danger)
That youre walkin' on
