The grass seems always greener 
And the flowers all in bloom.
Your garbage is even cleaner
Then your parents attitudes.

Your sister, shes a victim of depression
When she was the homecoming queen
But you don't even notice she's there,
Cause your hooked on pornography.

Welcome to Suburbia
On shiny avenue
Welcome to Suburbia 
Where they always welcome me and you.

Your parents gather on the weekends
In backyard barbecues.
Your sick and tired of their pretense
Cause their focus is always on their booze.

Well while the mothers are feeding on prozac
The men just cant wait to cheat.
Aol is your only escape 
Can you say dysfunctional family.

Welcome to suburbia
On shiny avenue
Welcome to suburbia
Where they always welcome me and you

You thought you were moving to a better life
Now your finding out things just aint right
Just another zoo

He's wasting in a cage cause he beat his wife
I guess it's pretty clear it's not a perfect life.
Out here after all.

Welcome to Suburbia
On shiny avenue
Welcome to Suburbia
Where they always welcome me and you.

Where they always welcome me and you.
Where they always welcome me and you.

Thought you were moving to a better life
Now your finding out things just aint right
Wasting in a cage cause he beat his wife
I guess its pretty clear it aint a perfect life
After all.---Lyrics submitted by Becky.
