Storm clouds won't bother to gather
She cashed in cut the tether
She's gone
It's no mistake
The angels 
Have come too late
They've come too late

In my hands I hold the proof
That something's sure to hit you
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Don't let 'em tie you to the stake
Whatever it takes
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I'll meet you now wherever you are
I'm here until the frontline breaks
Whatever it takes

Then she turned off the headlights
Cranked the radio
Ran the red lights
Never found
The missing bride
Windows dark
But they're all inside
They're all inside

In my hands I hold the proof
That something's sure to hit you
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Don't let 'em tie you to the stake
Whatever it takes
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I'll meet you know wherever you are
I'm here until the frontline breaks
Whatever it takes

A general without an army
I stopped lookin' then they found me
On the hill
A horn is blowin'
It's over man 
You just don't know it

That something's sure to hit you
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Don't let 'em tie you to the stake
Whatever it takes
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I'll meet you know wherever you are
I'm here until the frontline breaks 
Whatever it takes

Climb backwards through the red room
A jungle of thieves to get through
Time's up how long you gonna wait
Whatever it takes
So, Jack, grab paper and pen
I'll say it once won't say it again
Loosen the core until it shakes
Whatever it takes---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
