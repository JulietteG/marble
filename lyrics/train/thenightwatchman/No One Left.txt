Each one had a father
There's no one left
A name and a mother 
No one left
Each one had a dream
A prayer on their breath 
The world's gone black
No one left
On the streets of Manhattan
A dusty wind blows 
Letters and wishes
A girl with a rose
Each one had a father 
There's no one left 
A name and a mother 
No one left
Each one had a dream 
A prayer on their breath
The world's gone black
No one left
Fire and vengeance 
In the New York sky above
Stole my angel 
Stole my true love
Fire and vengeance
In the Baghdad sky above 
Stole his angel 
Stole his true love
I stand on my front porch
I look up at the sky
Will my world go black 
In the blink of an eye
He stands out in the desert
He looks up at the sky
Will his world go black
In the blink of an eye
Each one had a father 
There's no one left
A name and a mother
No one left
Each one had a dream
A prayer on their breath
The world's gone black
No one left
Each one had a wish
Each one had a home
Each one had a name
A name and a rose---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
