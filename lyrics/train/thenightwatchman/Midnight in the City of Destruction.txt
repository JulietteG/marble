There's an old green she at the end of
an overgrown driveway
And years ago that shed collapsed and fell
Years before that there was a withered dog
chained up there
I saved im, maybe he saved me as well
Now he's gone and I think I've come undone
And it's midnight in the city of destruction
There's music in the air and sweet abandon
They're singin' cross the farm in the evening
breeze
But there's someone in the rows who's unwanted 
And now they've cut the faithful from the trees
And the bulldozers move in one by one
It's midnight in the city of destruction
I lost my guitar, my home, my hope and my 
good fortune
I lost my grandfather, two neighbors and
my friend
I pray that God himself will come and drown
the president
If the levees break again
Now we're standing at the crossroads waitin' 
for instruction
And it's midnight in the city of destruction
There's a secret prisoner somewhere south of 60
And in that secret prison there's a secret cell
And the prisoner's bound and burned, blinded
and beaten
Still that secret prisoner keeps his secret well
Turn out the light 'cause for one night that's
enough, son
It's midnight in the city of destruction---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
