Where the hell are you runnin' to? 
Try and find yourself a life 
Look at yourself, you're standing still 
Night can cut you like a knife 

There's no doubt left in this world 
So think you and you still fly 
Take the time to look in front of you 
It's a matter of your mind 

Waiting for the night to come (Night to come) 
Tell me how you feel inside (Night to come) 
Don't you know which way to run (Which way to run) 
It's a matter of your pride 
Matter of your pride 

Tired of people talking what they're gonna do 
What they said or should have done 
I'm not waiting around for axe to fall 
I'll take my chances on the run 

There's no hope now left in this world 
So think you and you still fly 
Take the time to look in front of you 
It's a matter of your mind 

Waiting for the night to come (Night to come) 
Tell me how you feel inside (Night to come) 
Don't you know which way to run (Which way to run) 
It's a matter of your pride 
Matter of your pride 

Take your time, think it over 
Take the time to look in front of you---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
