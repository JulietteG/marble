i'm an axe grinder, pile driver
mama says that i never, never mind her
them old reins, i'm insane
the teacher says that i one big pain

i'm like a razor, six string razor
i got a mouth like an alligator
i want it loader, more power
i'm gonna to rock it, till it strikes the hour

(chorus)
bang your head
metal health will drive you mad
X2

i,m frustrated and out dated
i really won't to be overrated
i'm a finder and i'm a keeper
i'm not a loser and i aint no weeper

i got the boys to make the noise
won't ever let up, hope it annoys you
join the pack, fill the crack
well now your here,theres no way back

(chorus)

metal health will cure you crazy
metal health will cure you mad
metal health is what we all need
its what were all about

bang your head wake the dead
we're all mental mad, its all you have
so bang you head, and raise the dead..(oh yeah)
metal health,it drives you mad mad mad

(chorus)
(over chorus)
ah get your straight jackets on tonight ohh
the bad boys are gonna set you right
oh rock you rock rock you---Lyrics submitted by john.
