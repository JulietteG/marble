[Danny:]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be
How can I sleep at night, theres a roar inside my head?
I found a lion hiding right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
Cause I am a lion and you are dead

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
Heres a story of everything well ever be
You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I dont need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words, all I can say?
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You were born a lion and a lion you will stay

[Chorus (Danny):]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
Remember an army, of all those little kids
Living life like they only get a little bit
Its hard to fight when youre born in the middle and
Id rather die, wont watch you giving in
Im sorry daughter but your fathers not the same
I can look into your eyes and Ill swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain
After all, only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning, once you walk away
Promise that youll love me, watch me as I fade
Ill give you all those things that these lions ever gave
Put your hands on the clock, and the things we cannot change
Tear out all the pieces, and take back what I made
If theres one thing Id keep, its you that I would say
Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay

[Chorus (Danny):]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
Hey!
I never meant to let go
All I want and youre all I ever wanna know
Cant hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Why?
I never meant to let go
All I want and youre all I ever wanna know
Cant hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Why?

[Chorus (Danny):]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be ---
