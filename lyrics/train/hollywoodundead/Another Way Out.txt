[Charlie Scene & Danny:]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, I wish there was another way out

[Charlie Scene:]
Voices wont go away
They stay for days and days
They say some awful things, ways to make you fade away
I dont think no ones home
And were just here alone
I better find you first, before you find the phone

[Charlie Scene & Danny:]
You better run, better run, better run, yeah Im coming after you
When youre sleeping at night, yeah theres nothing you can do
Theres no place you can hide cause Im coming after you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you

[Chorus (Danny):]
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out

[Funny Man:]
You go up check and see
No one cares less than me
Dead wrong I guess youll be
These voices wont let you leave
Got you down on bending knee
What should my next weapon be?
Its over you cant breathe
Just sit down, rest with me

[Charlie Scene & Danny:]
You better run, better run, better run, yeah Im coming after you
When youre sleeping at night, yeah theres nothing you can do
Theres no place you can hide cause Im coming after you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you
I wish there was another way ou-ou-ou-ou-oooouuuut for you

[Chorus (Danny):]
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out

[Danny:]
Break you down, now put it back together again
Ill break you down, now put it back together again
Break you down, now put it back together again
Ill break you down, now put it back together again

[Chorus (Danny):]
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I wish there was another way out ---
