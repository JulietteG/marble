This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)

Wake up in the middle of ascending in the night.
With some tears on my pillow and this blood on my knife.
And my soul has stained the sheets but they're pulled off to the side.
Who's blood could this be, is it yours or is it mine.
Take the knife and twist it. Where's my heart you missed it.
You know I don't wanna die but baby you insist it.
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have.
My heart just keeps on beating and it's more than you can stand.
Baby, please just tell me how we ever went so wrong.
We use to sing together when we used to sing a song.
We can never sing forever, cause now my voice is gone.
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along.

[Danny:]
I can see blood all over my hands.
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran.
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran.

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)

[Charlie Scene:]
I'm only evil when I need to be, but you did this so easily.
I try to treat you equally and listen to your reasoning.
But you waited so eagerly while plotting and deceiving me.
You came behind me secretly and shattered every piece of me.
I have nothing to give, so I gave you my life!
Didn't want to see me live, so you gave me your knife.
Didn't hear you as you tiptoed coming from behind.
You took away my kids, so I guess you killed me twice.
Drag me into the night, cause it's the one thing you keep.
You knew that I had to die, so you could finally sleep.
This blood all over your knife, you know you earned yourself.
And it's a matter of time until you burn in hell.

[Danny:]
I can see blood all over my hands.
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran.
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran.

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
This blood on my hands!

[Danny:]
No remorse holds no recourse
Now I'm leaving slowly
Oh won't you hold me

I can see blood all over my hands.
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran.
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran.

I can see blood all over my hands.
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran.
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran.

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)
This blood on my hands! (hands)
