[Danny:]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts.
We are, we are, we are broken from the start.
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts.

[J3T:]
If you can lose it all then welcome to Broadway.
Silicone dreams and your name on the marque.
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly.
It's hotter here in hell but it's getting real dark, see.

So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely.
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends.
And every step, another step you're walking on my dreams.
Every breath, another breath, you're breathing when I breathe.

I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go.
I'm married to the devil, in the city of angels.
So come all you wicked, to the world of the empty.
I know I need it all, so baby don't tempt me.

I'm knockin' on your door, nope, nobody sent me.
Just checkin' all you bitches, like I'm checkin' this check sheet.
So put your hats on, Lohner don't get soft.
You can see God when I take my mask off.

[Danny:]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts.
We are, we are, we are broken from the start.
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we're, we are built from broken parts.

[JDog:]
The fame's your best friend, you love it, no questions.
Beating down the door is the face of rejection.
And once again it's a tragedy anthem.
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing.

But who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen.
With the gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky.
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die.

So grab a pick and an axe, 'cause we try, we cry.
Into the bottle of Jack we die, inside.
So when you look in his eyes, whatcha see now.
Murder the monster you've made, and watch him bleed out.

We're in a life, where it's kill or lose.
Just lie motherfucker, 'til you hear the truth.
From under the street, through the gutters of youth.
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you.

[Danny:]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts.
We are, we are, we are broken from the start.
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts.

[JDog:]
From the city of angels!
An empty vessel of devils!
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that you gave us!

From the city of angels!
And every vessel of devils!
Is there no way to save us?
Look through my eyes, see the world that you gave us!

[Danny:]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts.
We are, we are, we are broken from the start.
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we're, we are built from broken parts.---Lyrics submitted by Grace Sommers.
