I wanna tear it up
Before we tear it down
I wanna light it up
Before we burn it down
We gonna get fucked up
Drink til we all black out
So fucking start it up
cuz u know it's goin down

Drink, got swag
Yeah we keep it the same
Mad dogged all up
It the back of the rain
Aint no balled up
Baby, got bills to pay
Yeah I'm getting fucked up
As I'm changing lanes
Oh my god
I'm one of a kind
Imma smash it up
Its about that time
I'll be back to the party
By the end of the night
Got nichole got needs
And I needs mine
cuz Funny Man
Is just so damn sexual
Gotta ass on my mind
Its just so damn edible
Feast your eyes girl
I'm so delectible
Dick Like Hulk
Yeah they call me incredible!

U got your dress pulled up
I see you all around
I know u aint no slut
But I know your so down

Smash it up, smash it up
That bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash I'm gone

Girl u so hot
You could spark a match
Me and funny wanna flip u
Like an acrobat
And u could go back home
In a cadilac
Put my name in your phone
It's the man in black
Yuh Got a big ol' mouth
And an ass to match
You got my back
And u straddling
And Imma fan of that
We could go home
And open up a can of that
I'll put my prize in your box
Like cracker jacks
But wait that's
Just me getting shit faced
Let me pull out my blue tooth
And brief case
And replace
Everything I said wrong
But then it wont be
A Hollywood Undead song

U got your dress pulled up
I see all around
I know u aint no slut
But I know your so down

Smash it up, smash it up
That bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash I'm gone

I wanna tear it up
Before we tear it down
I wanna light it up
Before we burn it down
We gonna get fucked up
Drink til we all black out
So fucking start it up

Smash it crash it
What's only crackin
Its me and u girl
Now that's what's happenin
Lets take a little trip
To my stabbing cabinet
Grab the cam
It's lights camera action
Let me take care
Of the satisfaction
Grab a six pack
When I get off the wagon
Pour a little out
For Michael Jackson
I'll smash it now
cuz I know she's down

Smash it up, smash it up
That bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash I'm gone
Smash it up, smash it up
This bitch is off the hook
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I get that look
Smash it up, smash it up
I'll hit it all night long
Smash it up, smash it up
And once I smash I'm gone
Smash it up, smash it up
Smash it up, smash it up---Lyrics submitted by Skylar.
