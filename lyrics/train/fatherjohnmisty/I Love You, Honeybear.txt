Oh honeybear, honeybear, honeybear 
Mascara, blood, ash, and cum 
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love 

Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear 
Fuck the world 
Damn straight malaise 
It may be just us who feel this way 

But don't ever doubt this 
My steadfast conviction 
My love you're the one I want to watch the ship go down with 
The future can't be real 
I barely know how long a moment is 
Unless we're naked getting high on the mattress 
While the global market crashes 
And debt fills the streets with garden variety oblivious 
You grab my hand and say in I-told-you-so voice 
It's just how we expected 

Everything is doomed 
And nothing will be spared 
Oh I love you honeybear 
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear 

You're bent over the altar 
And the neighbors are complaining 
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Daemon 
Don't they see the darkness rising 
Good luck fingering oblivion 
We're getting out now while we can 
You're welcome boys 
Have the last of the smokes and chicken 
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going 
I brought my mother's depression 
You've got your father's scorn 
And a wayward and schizophrenia 

But everything is fine 
Don't give into despair 
Cause I love you honeybear---
