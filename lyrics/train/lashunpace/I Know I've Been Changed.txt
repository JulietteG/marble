Chorus: 2x
I know I've been changed
I know I've been changed
I know I've been changed
angels in Heaven done signed my name

Well if you don't believe that I've been redeemer
you know the (angels in Heaven done signed my name)

oh follow me down to that old Jordan stream
angels in Heaven done signed my name

I stepped in the water and the water was cold
you know the angels in Heaven done signed my name

oh it chilled my body but not my soul
angels in Heaven done signed my name

Chorus: 2x

Spoken:
Somebody said how can a brown cow 
eat green grass and give you white milk
well if you think that's something
God's chemical laboratory of redemption
took my black soul and dipped in red blood
and I came out white as snow

Angels in Heaven done signed my name
angels in Heaven done signed my name ---Lyrics submitted by India Miller.
