This place I'm in
is a terrible place
I feel so alone
it looks like there's no God, anywhere
or no one to turn to
so i wonder, what is the purpose of going on
so i asked myself these questions many a times

I'm in this world
but where is my hope for tomorrow
I'm in this world
but where is my peace of mind
I'm in this world
but where is joy unspeakable
I'm in this world
but where is the love that conquers all
oh oh, love that conquers all

But in the midst of all of my questions
a voice from heaven I heard say yeah

You're in this world
and I'm your hope, I am your hope
You're in this world
and I am your peace, I am your peace of mind
You're in this world
and I am your joy, your joy unspeakable
You're in this world
and I am here to show You love, to show You love
All I want to do is

(Trust me in this place) BG repeats til end
Umm
only trust me right here in this place
it may not feel good where you are, but trust me right here in this place
don't try to go no where else, but stay right there
and watch me move on your behalf
I know what I'm doing in your life
I have a perfect plan for you yeah
I have you here for a reason yes I do
you're gonna be my witness yes you are
I know all of the ingredients I'm putting on the inside of you yeah
I know what you're gonna be when I bring you out alright
and when I heard the voice from heaven yeah
my attitude has changed yeah
whatever You wanna do Lord
I trust You whole heartedly yes I do
I know that all things are working out for my good

Fade with:
oh I'm gonna trust You, I got to trust You um
Hallelujah I got to trust You um um
thank You Lord
Thank You in this place, trust me in this place
Trust me in this place---Lyrics submitted by Dominque.
