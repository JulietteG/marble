Chorus:
Oh the blood of Jesus washes white as snow
Oh the blood of Jesus will cleanse and make you whole
Oh the blood of Jesus it will never lose its power
Never lose, never lose
Never lose its power
(repeat)

Lead:
Oh the blood of Jesus it will never, never lose its power
The blood that was shed at Calvary
It will never, never lose its power (Never, ever lose its power)
Never ever lose its power
The blood it will never lose its power
(repeat)

Vamp:
Never lose, never lose
(repeat)

Never, never
(repeat)

Never lose, never lose its power.---Lyrics submitted by KJ Horton.
