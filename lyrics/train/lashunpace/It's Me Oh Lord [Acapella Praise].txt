(refrain:)
It's me, it's me, o lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's me, it's me, o lord
Standing in the need of prayer

It's not my father or my mother
But it's me, o lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's not my father or my mother
But it's me, o lord
Standing in the need of prayer

(repeat refrain)

It's not my sister or my brother
But it's me o, lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's not my sister or my brother
But it's me o, lord
Standing in the need of prayer

(repeat refrain)

It's not my deacon or my leader
But it's me o, lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's not my deacon or my leader
But it's me o, lord
Standing in the need of prayer
