You see I got this American Love
A brand new planet in my solar system
I kiss her neck but I just can't look her in the eye
You leave for college at the turn of autumn
I spent the winter diving to the bottom
I'll kiss your neck but I just can't look you in the eye
yeaaahh

Big hearts big hearts
Big hearts are for breaking
(big hearts are for breaking)
Big hearts big hearts
Big hearts are for breaking, yeah

You see I got this critical conscience
A brand new black hole in the solar system
I dig my grave but I just cant stand to step inside

And when they find out they'll sound every siren
Break the door down to find the baby crying
You thought I knew Its just not right to tell a lie

Big hearts big hearts
Big hearts are for breaking
(big hearts are for breaking)
Whoaa oh
Big hearts big hearts
Big hearts are for breaking, yeah, yeah

And now there's no turning back
In the face of the sweat we share
There's nowhere to run
We're so unprepared
It's a new heart attack
Brand new bricks on my back to bear
But don't say a word they might find us there

You see I got this American love
A hidden planet in the solar system
Keep your eyes shut I just cant stand to say goodbye

Big hearts big hearts
Big hearts are for breaking
(big hearts are for breaking)
Whoaa oh
Big hearts big hearts
Big hearts are for breaking, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by michael.
