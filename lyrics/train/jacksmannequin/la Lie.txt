Guess what I'm done
Wrting your songs
You give up your job at the bank proving moneys not fun
When you're gone
So this is the first verse
It's not very long, but I'm ready to move on

Guess what I'm done
Writing your book
The ending got twisted around but for all of the hell that it took,
The electrical wires,
The hum in the walls in the room that i rent now

Well listen I've got friends too
La la la lie
They'll help me pull through
La la la la la la lie
The spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl by July

So guess what I'm done
Drawing your pictures
I'm dulling the day with a drink in a parking garage by the theatre
We met for a movie
Every scene was a sign we made out through their meanings

Well I've got friends too
La la la lie
They'll help me pull through
La la la la la la lie
The spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl by July

Yea yea yea
Yea

Guess what I'm done 
Writing your song
Far too unstable to settle, I doubt that the doctors are wrong
So I'll wait by a palm trre
A palm tree
A palm tree

Well I've got friends
La la la lie
To help me pull through
La la la la la la lie
The spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl to my girl by July
La la la lie
Well she'll help me pull through
La la la la la la lie
The song for a long goodbye
I'm coming back
I'm coming back to my girl
La la la lie
Back to my girl
La la la la la la lie
The song for a long goodbye
I'm coming back to my girl by July---Lyrics submitted by Courtenay.
