From an empty room on the first floor
As the cars pass by the liqour store
I deconstruct my thoughts at this piano
And it's all that I can do to stay with
All the things I didn't say to you
Before you moved across the country
And from the burning building where I lay
As I watch the stars become the day
The L.A. girls were lacing up their sneakers
They run the boardwalks and the beach
This fishbowl life is all they need
It's everything I needed, too
Until I heard the news

I'll send this message through the speakers
They told me that you moved
I'll cross this country on a frequency

I'm slipping through, I'm slipping through
I'm slipping into the airwaves
And this is nothing new, you are slipping through
My fingers and into the airwaves
The static's where you'll find me

From the corner by the studio
The gold-soaked afternoon comes slow
I deconstruct my thoughts and I am walking by
On Third Street, the freak show thrives
Santa Monica's alive, but
Something's not so right inside
Living with the news

I'll send this message through the speakers
They told me that you moved
I'll cross this country on a frequency

I am slipping through, I am slipping through
I am slipping into the airwaves
(The static's where you'll find me)
And this is nothing new, you are slipping through
My fingers and into the airwaves
Into the airwaves

So hold on, it's gonna be hard day
So hang on, now. Don't panic
Don't panic, there simply is no need

It's gonna be a hard day
It's gonna be a hard day
Don't panic, don't panic
We are hanging here
We are hanging here

I am slipping through, I am slipping through
I am slipping into the airwaves
(The static's where you'll find me)
And this is nothing new, you are slipping through
My fingers and into the airwaves
Into the airwaves

It's gonna be a hard day
(It's gonna be a hard day)
So hang on, now
Don't panic, don't panic
There simply is no need

It's gonna be a hard day
(It's gonna be a hard day)
It's gonna be a hard day
Don't panic, don't panic
We are hanging here

(It's gonna be a hard day)
We are hanging here
(It's gonna be a hard day)
We are hanging here
We are hanging here---Lyrics submitted by michael.
