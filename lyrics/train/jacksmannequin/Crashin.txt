I wanna hear some music
Now that they're driving us all underground
Not the radio music
Or their sattelite singing this
In this town
In this town

I wanna hear some music
And while the rockstars all flicker and fade
Power radio music on the Ghost overground
I'm, I'm coming

Even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no-one listening
And even if I find the strength to stand
It doesn't mean I won't go missing
And the world will come crashing

I wanna hear some music
I have been waiting down here for so long
Trying to write this big music
With your breath in my face
But now,
But now you're gone

Even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no-one listening
And even if I find the strength to stand
It doesn't mean I won't go missing
And the world will come crashing

And the whole world comes
Down down down
The words and all the water on this broken town
The freeway's just like veins without a heart

The world just comes crashing
And the whole world comes crashing
And the whole world comes

Even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no-one listening
And even if I find the strength to stand
It doesn't mean I won't go on
Even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no-one listening
And even if you find the strength to stand
It doesn't mean you won't go missing

And the world will come crashing
And the words will come crashing
And the music comes crashing
Down on me
Down on me
And the words will come crashing
The words will come crashing
Down on me
So down on me
Down on you---Lyrics submitted by Courtenay.
