im comming home from my hardest year
im making plans not to make plans while im here
and this life has been no holiday
complicates situation
im fine with all my melories
its like a used vacation its

Christmas in California and its hard to ignore that,
it feels like summer all the time
but i'll take a west coast winter to remove my splinters
its good to be alive
its good to be alive

im comming home to the lights and buzz
streets look the same but still nothings as it was
and this place is paradise im sure 
heres my reservation
ive gotten lost here once before
inside a good vibration its

Christmas in California and its hard to ignore that,
it feels like summer all the time
but i'll take a west coast winter to remove my splinters
its good to be alive
its good to be alive
its good to be alive

in time it said it starts for no one the seasons come and go thats just talent, yeahh
said it starts for no one the seasons keep on going
weather or not were blind

Christmas in California and its hard to ignore that,
it feels like summer all the time
but i'll take a west coast winter to remove my splinters 
its good to be alive
its good to be alive 
its good to be alive
its good to be alive!---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
