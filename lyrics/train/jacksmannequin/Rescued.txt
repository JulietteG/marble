Two to one
Static to the the sound of you and I
I'm done for the last time
And there this was hiding at the bottom of you 
Swimming pool some September

And don't you think that I wish that I could stay
Your lips give you away
I can hear it, the jet engine
Through the center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd prefer not to be rescued

Two to none
Roads that lead away from this
I'm following myself just this once
And I've got spun
It appears your spun as well
It happens when you pay attention
this could take all year, but,

When it's quiet 
Does she hear me?
Jet us in to the center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd prefer not to be rescued

And oh I can feel her
She's dying just to keep me cool
I'm finally numb so please don't get me rescued
Rescued

And it's unclear
But this may be my last song
Oh, I, I can tell
She's raising hell to give to me
But she got me once
So please don't get me rescued

Oh, say you'll miss me one last time
I'll be strong
But whatever you do
Please don't get me rescued
Cause I'm feeling like I might need to be near you
And I feel alright
So please don't get me rescued---Lyrics submitted by Courtenay.
