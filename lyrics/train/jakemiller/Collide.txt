We falling out of the sky
I feel so alive
My heart ignites
When our eyes collide
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, collide (2x)

Don't hold back crash into me
We catching fire like a 3rd degree
Need someone to hold sick of being alone
So I'm rounding third and I'm coming home
I need your touch and I need it now
We can go to lunch and then mess around
Baby if you're in it you can come and get it
We can build an empire in a new york minute
Me, him we stopping time all up stars in line
This is what it feels like when we collide...
When we collide (3x)

I'm falling out of the sky
I feel so alive
My heart ignites
When our eyes collide
Oh, oh, oh yeah collide (2x)

I'm gone hungover I'm love drunk and not sober
This is do or die baby you and I we should get a little bit closer
So baby come and hop up in my range, swerve!
These other girls I kick em to the side, curb
Your love rain down like a meteor shower
I'm crashing down on earth
Me and you stopping time
All of the stars aligned
This is what it feels like
When we collide (3x)
Oh, oh, oh (5x)
When we collide (3x)---
