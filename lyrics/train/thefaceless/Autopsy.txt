Exhume this wretched corpse
Its lifelessness to be with held
His pale face tells the story of an unjust life
(A) Sickening story of uncomfortable familiarity
The saddened shadow of a man that once was
Casts me into disgust
The dissecting begins in the chest
Bone saws gnaw through lifeless flesh
A heartless cavity reveals a painless end
Preceeded by a pain unknown
His bold voice was forever silenced
The saddened shadow of a man that once was
Casts me into disgust
Sever the skull
His mind lies in peace
Free from the torment of existance---
