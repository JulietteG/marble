It's, not, how you start, it's how you finish, 
And it's, not, where you're from, it's where you're at, 

Everybody gets knocked down, 
Everybody gets knocked down, 
How quick are you gonna' get up? 
How quick are you gonna' get up? 
Everybody gets knocked down, 
Everybody gets knocked down, 
How quick are you gonna' get up? 
Just how are you gonna' get up? 

Like Ali in the jungle, 
Like Nelson in jail, 
Like Simpson on the mountain, 
With odds like that, they were bound to fail 
Like Hannah in the darkness, 
Like Adam's in the dark, 
Like Ludwig Van, how I loved that man, well the guy went deaf and didn't give a fuck, no... 

No, no, no 

It's, not, where you are, It's where you're going, 
Where are you going? 
And it's, not, about the things you've done, it's what you're doing, now, 
What are you doing, now? 

Everybody gets knocked down, 
Everybody gets knocked down, 
How quick are you gonna' get up? 
How quick are you gonna' get up, now? 
Everybody gets knocked down, 
Everybody gets knocked down, 
How quick are you gonna' get up? 
Just how are you gonna' get up? 

Like Ali in the jungle, 
Like Nelson in jail, 
Like Simpson on the mountain, 
Well with odds like that, they were bound to fail 
Like Hannah in the darkness, 
Like Adam's in the dark, 
Like Ludwig Van, how I loved that man, well the guy went deaf and didn't give a fuck, no... 

Oooh, ooh, ooh 
No, no, no 
Oooh, ooh, ooh 
No, no, no 
Oooh, ooh, ooh 

It's the greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
The greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
It's the greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
The greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
It's the greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
The greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
The greatest comeback since Lazarus, 
The greatest comeback... 
It's the greatest comeback... 

(Radio Commentator) This, is the most joyous scene, ever seen in the history of boxing, this is an incredible scene, the place is going wild, Muhammed Ali has won, Muhammed Ali has won, by a knockdown! By a knockdown! The thing they said was impossible, he's done!---Lyrics submitted by hanna.
