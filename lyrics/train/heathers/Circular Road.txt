Out in the crowd
When you're feeling all alone 
When you're always there 
When you fall and float
And it seems very clear
That there's nowhere else to go
And they knock you down
And you pick you up

Out of your mind
Feeling all alone
And it's never said
And it's never known
Not to give
Or to live
All you'll ever do is run
But you'll never know
No you'll never know

You've got nowhere else to go
You back down that narrow road
And everyone can see your face
Whoa
You've got nowhere else to go
Back down that narrow road
And everything's gonna be okay

It's time
I will leave all my worries behind
I won't lie
And i know
That your worries become

So we run
Far
Afield
And we can see that there is more than life than what you've got

Chorus

Oh and there's nowhere else to go
When there's nowhere else to go
Na na na na na---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra Caterson.
