Don't you understand, that things, 
are not the same, they're not the same,
but things have changed, 
we understand that things do change,
can you see, the difference between you and me?
We used to be, like family,
but then you went and changed on me.

And the pictures tell it only from the subsidels inside these walls,
and I'll play the tape again, in hope,
that one day someone won't be scared to talk.

I can see, the difference between you and me,
in what we are and who we'll be.
and then in time we'll work you see.

I don't know, but time is running out, for us
we need to find a way for us,
we have to find a way for us.

And we will go.

Find a way (x10)

Don't you know, the feeling when you're all alone,
you're all alone, 
the world's moved on,
you're feelings show,
and now you know,
where else to go.
I'm always here, when you're in pain,
call out to me,
no matter how much time has been.
I won't forget,
what I have seen.

And we will go.

Find a way (x10)

And we will go.
