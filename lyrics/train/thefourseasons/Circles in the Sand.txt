Circles in the sand, whirling and swirling that's what I am.
 Echos in a cave, that's what I leave behind.
 I'm just a common man, drinking and thinking, never a plan.
 Circles in the sand, traces within my mind.

Oh the masters, they're all ashes and flames.
 Glorious gains and pleasures that lead to pain.
 Seasons alter, but my life is the same.
 Naked I came and naked I shall remain.---Lyrics submitted by frank minnella.
