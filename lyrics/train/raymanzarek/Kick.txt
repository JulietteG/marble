Lyrics: Michael McClure/ Rare Angel Publishing
Music: Ray Manzarek / International Aten Music (ASCAP)

There's a demon on the razor - sucking on the blade
I meet him on the freeway and I hug him in the shade
His white forktail is caught inside my nose
And my black and blue eyes twitch spastic toes
As I slither up the tap-dance hill
And feel the crushing of imaginations glow
Into the crudest things a man can know

There's a ring struck through my nose!
A cord is laying on the mirror's shine!
Put it through the ring and lead me round and down
While I believe I'm high, I believe I'm high

Snuffle
When I breathe. Writhe me in
These clouds of shame.
Again! Again! Again!
And then I stop
I am the animal I know I am

I flush away this powder with the shit.
And I rise - an eagle-winged assassin,
The murderer of custom and of habit
I flush away this funny powder with the shit.
I'm a breathing rose!
An eagle-winged assassin
(I'm a breathing rose!)
The murderer of custom and of habit
I stand free.
I step free!
This me!---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
