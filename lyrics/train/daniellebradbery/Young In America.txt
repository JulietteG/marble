Let's crank up the truck, kick up some dust
Leave it all behind, just me and you, baby
Don't look back, stomp on the gas
Tear off the rearview, let's go crazy

Maybe Tennessee
LA, NYC
Mississippi

Come on, come on

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, ready set go
Gotta get out of this small town
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, the open road
Air to breathe, the sun is shining down
Oh whoa, it's you and me
In the land of the free
So baby, let's run while we're young in America

We could do the Vegas thing, you could buy me a ring
Make a lot of love and a little bit of money
Go dancing in rain with the guitars playing
Down there in Memphis, how about it, honey?

Fine wine, sand, bare feet
Kiss me on the beach
So much to see

Come on, come on

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, ready set go
Gotta get out of this small town
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, the open road
Air to breathe, the sun is shining down
Oh, whoa, it's you and me
In the land of the free
So baby, let's run while we're young in America

I'll go anywhere, it's true
As long as I'm with you

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, ready set go
Gotta get out of this small town
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, the open road
Air to breathe, the sun is shining down
Oh, whoa, it's you and me,
In the land of the free
So baby, let's run while we're young in
Young in America

Whoa oh
Young in America

Whoa oh, whoa oh
Young in America ---
