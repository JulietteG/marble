She Is Waiting To Kiss My Hand
But She Will Wait For My Command
My Chains And Collar Brought Her To Her Knees
She Now Is Free To Please
Woman Be My Slave
That's Your Reason To Live
Woman Be My Slave
The Greatest Gift I Can Give
Woman Be My Slave
Before Her Surrender She Had No Life
Now She's A Slave Not A Wife
Her Only Sorrow Is For Women Who Live With Lies
She's Taken Off Her Disguise
Woman Be My Slave
Chained Unto My Bed
Woman Be My Slave
Begging To Be Fed
Your Body Belongs To Me
Woman Come Here
Remove Your Garments
Kneel Before Me
Please Me
Woman Be My Slave
Chained Unto My Bed
Woman Be My Slave
Begging To Be Fed
I Want You Now
Woman Be My Slave---Lyrics submitted by anthony.
