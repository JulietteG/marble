Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story---Lyrics submitted by zaenuddin.
