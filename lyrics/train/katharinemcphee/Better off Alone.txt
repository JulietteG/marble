One thing I'm wonderin'
When you run out of friends
Will you be coming back home?

Let's think this through again
Let's take a different spin
Why can't I leave you alone?

Somewhere tonight, you may be found
With some other girl you've been draggin' around
You lie to yourself, you lie to me
It seems like the truth is your worst enemy

'Cause baby I'm tired, tired of the fight
I'm tired of the lonely days and the dark endless nights
I'm taking some time, cause I didn't know
If I could ever let you go
You helped me figure it out
I'm better off alone
I'm better off alone

I may be found, somewhere tonight
Cursing the day you walked into my life
What's done is done, and I can't change time
But I'll be damned it I'm not gonna try
Oh I'm gonna try

But baby I'm tired, tired of the fight
I'm tired of the lonely days and the dark endless nights
It's taken some time, cause I didn't know
If I could ever let you go
You helped me figure it out
I'm better off alone

But every now and then, my heart gives in
To the hope that someday you'll change
Then alone I'll wake, to my own mistakes
That it's just a foolish game

I'm tired, tired of the fight
I'm tired of the lonely, lonely, lonely days and the dark endless nights
You didn't think, cause you didn't know
That I'd find the strength to let, let you go
I finally figured it out
I'm better off alone
Oh, I'm better off alone

One thing before I go
Something I've got to know
Boy, did you ever love me?---Lyrics submitted by courtney.
