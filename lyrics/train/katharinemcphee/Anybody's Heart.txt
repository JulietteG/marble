It's a great big world to a scared little girl
If you'd smile just right, no one knows you might
Have a heart full of pain and a soul that can't reign
And a stomach full of butterflies


All that I wanted was just to feel safe, safe in your arms
Say you didn't mean to, say I wouldn't understand
But it's time you say something, God knows it's the one thing I need
And the heart you broke, no, it wasn't just anybody's heart


So I bit my nails and I held my breath
And I said, I'm fine, yeah, I did my best
But you can't tell me you never knew the truth
Of all the fear I felt, how I worried 'bout you


All that I wanted was just to feel safe, safe in your arms
Say you didn't mean to, say I wouldn't understand
But it's time you say something, God knows it's the one thing I need
And the heart you broke, no, it wasn't just anybody's heart


I was yours, I was yours and the heart that you broke
Was devoted and pure and it wasn't just anybody's heart---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
