They say, get up out of that bed turn the lights on
Gotta try to forget where it went wrong
Don't you beat yourself up asking questions
Love's gonna come your way again, oh


They say, step outside of your door let the light in
You never really escape when you hide in
All I want is to be set free
From this pain that is haunting me


Can you tell me how?
When I am looking down and all hope is over
Can you tell me how?
Ten million pieces of my heart to put back together


If I could I'd take hold of myself
Pull me out of this living hell
Can you tell me how?
Can you tell me how?
How? How? How? How? How? How? How?


They say, if you open your heart to the healing
Time will take all those scars you've been wearing
Please don't tell me how I should be feeling


I'm not sure I even want to try, oh

They say, you just gotta let go and move on
You're only hurting yourself when you hold on


All I want is to lose this pain
Every drop of it washed away, yeah
Can you tell me how?
When I am looking down and all hope is over
Can you tell me how?


Ten million pieces of my heart to put back together
If I could I'd take hold of myself
Pull me out of this living hell
Can you tell me how?
Can you tell me how?
How? How? How? How? How? How? How?


How do I leave this love behind, how?
Can you tell me how?---Lyrics submitted by zulien.
