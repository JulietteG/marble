I can't catch up to you
You're already gone too far
And you don't remember
Who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you
You're way up ahead of me
And you're getting harder see
Everyday as you run away

You're cutting lines out on a bible
Too busy dying to stop and live
You done gave up on survival
You gave all that you can give
And I sure wish you would come back home
Nothing else for you to prove
I know you try real hard to make your mark
But that world don't love you the way I do

I can't catch up to you
You're already gone too far
And you don't remember
Who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you
You're way up ahead of me
And you're getting harder see
Everyday as you run away

There just ain't no coming down
When there ain't no one around
And your head still makes that sound
And I watch it drive you crazy
Your mama's saying prayers
Pleading with the man upstairs
You feel like no one cares
And I watch it drive you crazy
You run run run run hiding from the sun u un
And I know you wanna turn around
But there's nothing I can do

I can't catch up to you
You're already gone too far
And you don't remember
Who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you
You're way up ahead of me
And you're getting harder see
Everyday as you run away

These demons behind their faces
You know the lies they tell are true
You paint yourself into a corner
And you chose the color blue
And you look for inspiration
In the dark where the sickness lives
And you're stumbling over your own two feet
And you're headed for the edge of a cliff

I can't catch up to you
You're already gone too far
And you don't remember
Who you are or who I am
I can't catch up with you
You're way up ahead of me
And you're getting harder see
Everyday as you run away

I watch you stumble watch you fall
And I just can't seem to help at all
And I feel...feel like I'm wasting my time with you
And I know the way you feel been there myself
And I just don't wanna see your plan
And I don't wanna see you go through hell
I know it hurts I know it stabs
And I know it makes you feel real bad
Feel those things that are going on
Inside your head and make your eyes
Bloody red and I sympathize
Cuz I know the way you are
And I know you won't get far ---Lyrics submitted by leilaina.
