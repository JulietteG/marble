"Bartender Song (Sittin' At A Bar)"

Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 A.M.
The door was locked so I kicked it in

She was tripping on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard

And in my drunken stupor I did what I should've never done
And now I'm sitting here
Talking to you
Drunk and on the run

[Chorus:]
I'm sitting at a bar on the inside
Waiting for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fucking car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

Ya know Moe I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers til they get here
Yeah I know the sun is coming up
And y'all are probably getting ready for closing up

But I'm trying to drown my soul
I'm tired of this life on a dirt road
Everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hanging on

[Chorus:]
She got me sitting at a bar on the inside
Waiting for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fucking' car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

Guess it was meant to be
Romance is misery
So much for memories
And now I'm headed to the penitentiary
See me on TV
The next cop series I am a danger
I guess I should've did something about my anger
But I'll never learn
Real things I don't concern
I poured kerosene on everything I loved and watched it burn
I know its my fault
But I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fist
So I crashed that piece of shit over

And now I'm going back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
And when we all pile up that county van
They'll ask me where I've been

[Chorus:]
I been at a bar on the inside
Waiting for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fucking car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away
