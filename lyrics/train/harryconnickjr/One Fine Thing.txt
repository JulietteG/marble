When Im walkin I see you
And Im wonderin what it must be like to be you
Youre a sunrise, youre heaven
Youre the reason that God rested on day seven

Youre one fine fine thing

When Im dreamin I love you
And I know that there is just one version of you
Can I have you? I need you
If you tell me where you wanna go Ill lead you

Youre one fine fine thing

I want you now in a real bad way
So what'll I have to do?
I could somehow have a real good day
It all depends on you

Well Ive flirted Ive dated
And Im thinkin the single life is overrated
So Ill loiter I'll linger
And Ill try to get a ring around your finger

Youre one fine fine thing
Youre one fine fine thing
Youre one fine fine thing---Lyrics submitted by Renee Justice.
