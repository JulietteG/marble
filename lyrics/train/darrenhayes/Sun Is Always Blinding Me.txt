From the top of a church on a hill,
To the tip of a dragonfly wing.
From the shine off the hood of a cab,
To a shimmering diamond within on a ring that was worn through two world wars.
From a smile that soars though its old and worn.
And two blue eyes forever seeming cold.

The sun is always blinding me with her light.
The day is always hiding behind the night.
And one day everybody will be alright.
Go on blinding me with her light.

From the glare of a red traffic light,
To the blur of a bicycle wheel.
From the flare of a camera lens,
To a fluorescent light that ignites and displays someone leaving a goodbye note.
From a pen made of steel and reflection of hope.
And to some words to stir an aching soul.

The sun is always blinding me with her light.
The day is always hiding behind the night.
And one day everybody will be alright.
Go on blinding me with her light from a fire that burns
In the darkest well of a cave, so enslaved, I can hear her yell.
I can tell this bird just wants to be free.

So set her free.

And if this world should ever leave you cold.

The sun is always blinding me with her light.
The day is always hiding behind the night.
And one day everybody will be alright.
Go on blinding me with her light.

Its gonna be alright.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
