When I first escaped the city of York and leapt out of this cage.
No silicon chip could sublimate or tame this temptuous rage.
When my heart was in athe attic like The Picture of Dorian Gray.
I was rescued by the enemy
That dare not speak it's name.

Say hello to your future.
I'm just pleased to meet you.
You were a million miles away.
Say hello to your lion's heart.
Queen Victoria's England
Will never ever be the same.

Giddyup!

When I left the warm surroundings of my selfish difficult stage.
When our eyes first met there was dj vu and feeling I could not shake.
Then when gravity seduced me and drew me to this place.
I could swear we were together in an entirely different age.

Say hello to your future.
I'm just pleased to meet you.
You were a million miles away.
Say hello to your lion's heart.
Queen Victoria's England
Will never ever be the same.

So wonderfully good looking
With fine and delicate lines.
If I place this face in carbon freeze
It will never be affected by time.

She said, "Don't confuse your beauty
tWith the insolence of youth.
You can move through time in one direction.
Sad, but it's the truth".

But it took so long to meet you.
But it took so long to meet you.

It's time to go.
It's time to leave.
You should never have come.

Get back to the craft.
Get back to your age.
Take somebody with you.

Giddyup!

Say hello to your future.
I'm just pleased to meet you.
You were a million miles away.
Say hello to your lion's heart.
Queen Victoria's England
Will never ever be the same.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
