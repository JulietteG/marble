In a world so cynical you came in and changed the bulb from black to white.
And made me right.
This is all atypical.
No one else has had the time to read the signs.

You are the only one.
No one else can keep me from the danger of myself.
You keep me stronger.
You are the only one.
And now I love you even more than I did before.

Ive got such a jealous side.
Reaching out I try to hide my infant stride.
And in my mind this is all so prototype.
I make it wrong to make it feel right, you dont deny it.

Cause you are the only one.
No one else can keep me from the danger I posses.
You keep me stronger .
You are the only one.
And now I love you even more than I did before.

When they make the call for one last drink.
When my self esteem sinks below
And when no one knows it.
When the colours all collide inside and I can barely hide.

You are the only one.
No one else can keep me from the danger of myself.
You keep me stronger.
You are the only one.
And now I love you even more there is no other.
No one else I place above you.
You are the only one.
And now I love you even more than I did before.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
