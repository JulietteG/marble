I dont want someone telling me what to do.
I dont want to find out my temper grew wings and flew to you.
Dont want somebody telling me whats not right.
But I just want you to love me.
Oh I just want you to love me.

I dont want to have to lie about whats inside.
When theres always been a tiny part of me Im trying to hide.
I dont want to see your expression when I let you down.
And I just want you to love me.
Oh I just want you to love me.

Theres a haiku poem inside of my head.
But the words are written in invisible ink.
Now the world is changing I can barely keep up.
What was hot is over .
What was down is not.
Now Adam and Eve are trying to split up.
And I cant take anymore because I just want you to love me.

Love me.
Oh I just want you to love me.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
