I have been angry for so long I let you know.
Should have walked away when I was young I let you go.
I turned away but maybe I was wrong.
Ive been polishing blame for so long now,
My pride and joy.
A bit of tragedy never hurt.
Somehow this man became a boy.
You took the blame but maybe I was wrong

Walk away now and be gone.
You dont have to want to go on.
I can see its killing you.
You dont always have to be so strong for me.
Every angel had dirty hands.
Even Judas planned to just carry on.
Just picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes.
You can walk away.

You had been silent for so long I let the world know.
I turned a bit of my pain into a song.
Then carried on.
You took my shame but maybe that was wrong.

Walk away now and be gone.
You dont have to want to go on,
Even when theyre killing you.
You dont always have to be so strong for me.
Every angel had dirty hands.
Even Judas planned to just carry on.
Just picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes.
You can walk away now and be strong.
Well I know you can carry on.
Walk away now and be gone.
You dont have to want to carry all the pain inside you.
Because the blood in me is your blood every time I fall.

Walk away now and be gone,
Even when its killing you.
You dont always have to be so strong for me.
Walk away now and be gone.
You know even Judas planned to just carry on.
Still picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes.
You can walk away now and be strong.
You dont have to carry on.
Walk away now and be strong.
You dont have to want to go on.

Walk away now and be strong.
You dont have to want to go on.
Walk away.
Walk away now.
Walk away now.
You dont have to go on.
You dont have to be strong.
Walk away now.
You can walk away.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
