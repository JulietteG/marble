I have turned away from you and I am Godless.
A wasteland of poison.
A hidden fortress.
I have blackened out the stars and hidden frequencies.
I have silenced all the waves and forbidden secrecies.

To step into your light.
This dog doesnt bite you know.
I just want to be your friend.
You know Ive never been in love before.
Ive never been in love before.

There is nothing of you now.
No ghost.
No not a trace.
No flower not a seed nor perfume in your place.
I have searched amidst a barren plane of emptiness.
And I am worthless.
It is futile.
Youre invisible.
I am infantile.

Step into the light yall.
This dog doesnt bite yall.
Just wanna be your friend.
You know Ive never been in love before.
Ive never been in love before.
I have murdered the divine in me.
Set the Godness free.
I have squandered it all.
I am less than the sum.
I am parts of a hole.
There is something missing.
There is something I stole.

Whyve you forsaken me?
Where do you hide?
I feel the betrayal.
It simmers it blisters.
It digs down and burrows deeper inside.
The more than I try I cannot deny it.

It feels like.
It feels like.
It feels like Ive never been in love before.
It feels like.
It feels like.
It feels like love.

Step into the light yall.
This dog doesnt bite yall.
Just wanna be your friend.
You know that Ive never been in love before.
So step into the light yall.
You know this dog doesnt bite yall.
Take hold of my hand.
You know that Ive never been in love before.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
