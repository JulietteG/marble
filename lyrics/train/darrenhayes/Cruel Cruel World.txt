I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes,
I might say, a little righteous and too proud.
I just want to find a way to compromise,
'Cause I believe that we can work things out. 
I thought that I had all the answers, never giving in.
But baby I was wrong, I admit that I was wrong.

All I know is I'm lost without you, I'm not gonna lie.
How am I going to be strong without you?
I need you by my side.
And if we ever say we'll never be together, and ended it with goodbye.
I don't know what I'd do, You know I'd be lost without you.

I keep trying to find my way.
But all I know is, I'm lost without you.
I keep trying to face the day
I'm lost without you.

How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues? 
Baby, I'm so lonely all the time.
Everywhere I go, I get so confused.
You know that you're the only thing that's on my mind.

Oh, my bed's so cold at night
I miss you more each day.
Only you can make it right
No, I'm not to proud to say.

All I know is I'm lost without you, I'm not gonna lie.
How am I going to be strong without you?
I need you by my side.
If we ever say we'll never be together, and ended with goodbye.
I don't know what I'd do, You know I'd be lost without you.

I keep trying to find my way
All I know is, I'm lost without you.
I keep trying to face the day,
I'm lost without you.

If I could only hold you know,
Make the pain just go away.
Can't stop the tears from running down my face.
HELP!

All I know is I'm lost without you, I'm not gonna lie.
How am I going to be strong without you?
I need you by my side.
If we ever say we'll never be together, and ended with goodbye.
I don't know what I'd do, You know I'd be lost without you.---Lyrics submitted by Tabitha Sizemor.
