Now everybody's beautiful when they're young.
And I should know. Ive had more than my share of fun.
Theres all this fascination.
With the impossibly thin.
With the surface of things.
Airbrush Photoshop creation.

In all that we are losing aren't we just confusing youth with beauty?
Truth with duty?
Theres something on the telly bout North Korea.
Some war broke out dont trust the media.
Id like to get a suntan.
Some dude was shot in Pakistan.

The tracks got noddage.
Moves my bodagage.
The tracks got noddage.  
The tracks got noddage.

Theyve got those bombs up in the planes.
Theyve got those bombs up in the trains.
Theyve got those bombs up in my face.
Dont want to talk about it.
Theyve got those bombs up in the planes.
Theyve got those bombs up in the trains.
Theyve got those bombs up in my face.
Dont want to talk about it.

I was walking through the city past a phone shop
And a homeless man was lying there looked almost dead and no one seemed to bother.
I ran into rock and roll band, two or three of them, maybe four(?).
This one punk just nineteen years old he gave me his persuasion.
He stared at me with his one black eye.
Looked down at me like I didnt have a life.
And he was right, at least not the kind of life hed been paradin.
Same sex union.
Change the constitution.
You can carry a gun.
But you better not fall in love with someone.
The President who fucked the world for every future boy and girl
Is golding in Aruba.
With a suntan.
And scuba.

The tracks got noddage.
Moves my boddage.
The tracks got noddage.
Moves my boddage.

Theyve got those bombs up in the planes.
Theyve got those bombs up in the trains.
Theyve got those bombs up in my face.
Dont want to talk about it.
Theyve got those bombs up in the planes.
Theyve got those bombs up in the trains.
Theyve got those bombs up in my face.
Dont want to talk about it.

Now everybody dies or fades away.
A permutation white and grey.
A synergy of light and dust and skin cells constantly aging.
You fell in love with the dream to fuck forever endlessly.
But you dont.
And thats o.k.
The rest is better anyway.
Botox bungle CNN.
Infomercial count to ten.
Change the channel VCR.
Somethings on my radar.

The tracks got noddage.
Moves my boddage.
The tracks got noddage.

Theyve got those bombs up in the planes.
Theyve got those bombs up in the trains.
Theyve got those bombs up in my face.
Dont want to talk about it.
Theyve got those bombs up in the planes.
Theyve got those bombs up in the trains.
Theyve got those bombs up in my face.
Dont want to talk about it.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
