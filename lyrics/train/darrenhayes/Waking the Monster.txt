The professor is building something extraordinary.
From the first signs well I knew he would hide it from me.
Clang, clang, rattle and buzz.
Theres a helicopter blade and a bit of a truck hes got.

No more quality time to be
Going on adventures spending mornings on Black Heath.
Using a ouija Board.
Or finding hidden places that had never been sought.
I pray.
Origami full of grace.
The professor is mad and hes working a feverish pace.
Diabolical, delicious things.
Something is bad and its something within me.

Do you know? Do you know?
What is he building in there?
Gotta know. Gotta see.
What is he building in there?
Gotta know. Gotta be.
Something destructively daring.
Disastardly.
Its got the best of me.

The professor is building all kinds of devilish devices.
Wont part with singular bit of enlightenment.
Bang, crash, glitter and bug.
Theres a phonographic needle and stereo heart hes got.

No plans to make an announcement.
No preliminary sketches or advice to impart to me.
One once of jealousy.
57 gallons juvenile delinquency.

Super supremacy.
Got to find the answer.
Got to fashion a skeleton key.
Diabolical, delicious deeds.
Something is bad and its shrouded in secrecy.

Do you know? Do you know?
What is he building in there?
Gotta know. Gotta see.
What is he building in there?
Gotta know. Gotta be.
Something destructively daring.
Disastardly.
Its got the best of me.

(quote from H G Wells The Time Machine)
There are really four dimensions,
Three, which we call the three planes of Space,
and a fourth, Time.

The professor is building something extraordinary.
Behind bars and a door he wont open for me.
Kind words and a barrel of a gun
Will make him come to grips.
Make him face up to what he has done.
Do you know? Do you know?
What is he building in there?
Gotta know. Gotta see.
What is he building in there?
Gotta know. Gotta be
Something destructively daring.
Disastardly.
Its got the best of me.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
