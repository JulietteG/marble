Give me a taste of what's to come.
Give me your medicine.
Teach me a lesson maybe I deserve to know.
Cut me down to size and paralyze me
With the contents of your pretty little head.
And give me somewhere else to go.
Give me one thing.
Tell me something I don't really need to know.
I am so afraid of breaking what we made.
It is delicate and lovely.
But it's a weight above me.

And your words are like weapons.
But you keep them inside and they cut like a knife.
And you keep it together.
All those feelings inside.
There's nowhere to hide
But away from me.
When I just want to listen to your words.

I'd like to step into your world.
Show me a secret.
I promise to keep it safe and sheltered from the storm.
I want to cross the great divide that keeps me swimming
And treading water from your shore.
I want to coax you from your hell.
Into an alley,
A hidden valley where the truth can surely spill.
I want to take the weight that drags you to the ground.
Share this treasure that I've found.

But your words are like weapons.
But you keep them inside and they cut like a knife.
And you keep it together.
All those feelings inside.
There's nowhere to hide
But away from me.
When I just want to listen.

There's a lock someone's stolen the key
And took you away from me.
Somewhere that no one can read you.
I see a Bible.
Yeah I see a Bible in your eyes.
All those codes and hidden meanings.
Full of metaphor and something for the faithless in me.

But your words are like weapons.
But you keep them inside and they cut like a knife.
And you keep it together.
All those feelings inside.
There's nowhere to hide
But away from me.
When I just want to listen to your words.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
