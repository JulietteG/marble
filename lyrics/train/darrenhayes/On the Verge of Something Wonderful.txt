A serpent, a rabbit a walk in a forest.
A tentative looking son.
A feeling, a moment a bursting of bubbles.
A panic to overcome.
A samurai, an angel.
An etiquette table, an A/C that does not work.
A road trip, a car wreck, a paper back novel.
A lover who aint been hurt.

When you let me go.
When Im on my way.
When the world below.
Is cold and grey.

On the verge of,
On the verge of something wonderful.
A resurgence,
On the edge of something wonderful.

For it, against it, said he never meant it.
But Harry still dropped the bomb.
A trip to the dentist.
The Hollywood black list.
A moment that time forgot.

When you let me go.
When Im on my way.
When the world below.
Is cold and grey.

On the verge of,
On the verge of something wonderful.
At the edge of,
On the verge of something wonderful.

Well you can walk in the devils shoes
If you like walking in heels.
And theres a decent living to be made in the selling out of ideals.
You can lose your way in the big city.
Get distracted and lost in being pretty.

I want you.
I need you.
I dont wanna please you.
Or belong to anyone.
But life is for leading.
For not people pleasing.
A race that has never been won.

When you let me go.
When Im on my way.
When the world below.
Is cold and grey.

On the verge of something wonderful.
At the edge of,
On the verge of something wonderful.

Im on the verge of,
On the verge of something wonderful.
A resurgence,
On the edge of something wonderful.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
