There's a darkness that covers the Earth 
In these days that we live 
The oppression at times 
Can make thoughts in your mind 
Neg-a-tive
To survive in this fight
We must walk in the light
He gives

When the light of the day
That has shown the way
Grows dim.....
And the voice of the night
Cries aloud that your chances are slim
Let the Prince of the Air
And the demons beware.....
You're with Him

And there's peace in the eye of the storm
There is peace in the eye of the storm
There is Peace....

There is Peace in the eye of the storm
There is peace in the eye of the storm
There is Peace....---Lyrics submitted by tonty.
