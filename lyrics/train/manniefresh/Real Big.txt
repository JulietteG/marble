[Verse 1]
King of the hood,

Look like a forest N dah truck and I'm'ma put..

Hardwood floors, anythang that connect from the front to the back
Drop top that
Six-15's beatin hard in the deck
Push that button
Microwave oven
I'm just gettin started pimp u aint seen nothin
Is that a fish tank burrowed in the mid of the dash
Yeah Pimp' dont put ur fingers on my glass
Got a two lane bowlin' alley up in the truck
And in the other side of the bed
Yeah she wanna get stuff
Clap off lights when u gettin affection
Clap on lights when u findin protection
Now where in the wide (wiiiide) world of gator
Can u find another truck with a plush elevator

[Chorus]
