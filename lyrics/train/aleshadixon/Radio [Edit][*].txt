Pop rock, rhythm & blues, 
Anything you got, 
I don't have time to choose, 
Big speakers, I'll sing along, 
Last request dj, I need a song, 

He can't break my heart, 
If I can't hear a word, 
I can't hear a word 

Don't say it now 
I'm turnning up the radio 
I'll drown you out 
Cos I don't wanna let you go 
Anything to make you forget 
Cos my heart can't let go yet 
Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio 

Choose, get me, frequency 
If i find signal, maybe you won't leave 
Headphones, cover my ears, 
Keep smiling, fight back the tears, 

He Can't Break My Heart, 
If I Can't Hear A Word, 
I Can't Hear A Word 

Don't say it now 
I'm turnning up the radio 
I'll drown you out 


Cos I don't wanna let you go 
Anything to make you forget 
Cos my heart can't let go yet 
Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio 

I'm turning up the radio 
ah Woah oh oh oh 
Woah oh oh oh 
Ra-a-di-o 

ah Woah oh oh oh 
Woah oh oh oh 
Ra-a-di-o 

I'll drown you out, 
Don't say it now 
Cuz I'm turning up the radio-o 

Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio 
I'll drown you out 
Cos I don't wanna let you go 
Anything to make you forget 
Cos my heart can't let go yet 
Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio---Lyrics submitted by Megs.
