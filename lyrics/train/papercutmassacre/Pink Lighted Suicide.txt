She's completely dead to the world
no one ever really seems to know that her
the pain is real the damage is done 
just another dead in the eyes love song
you feel everything while i remain up
you wave off everything while i remain stoned
its just another day of cold shoulders

This girl doesnt know what she has in store
oblivious to what shes got but has to have some more

She retreats into her room 
aquainted with the silence and the sound of doom
the towns all stood still the battles all gone 
she left us with this dead in the eyes love song
you feel everything while i remain up 
you wave off everything while i remain stoned
its just another day of cold shoulders

This girl doesnt know what she has in store 
oblivious to what shes got but has to have some more

This girl had myself, the world on fire inside
her reflect on this pink lighted suicide


Its just another day, another day of cold shoulders
(its just another day)
its just another day, another day of cold shoulders
(Its just another day)
its just another day, another day of cold shoulders

This girl doesnt know what she has in store
oblivious to what shes got but has to have some more

This girl had once said the world on fire inside perfect darkness
Pink lighted suicide
