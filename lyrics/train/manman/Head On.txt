There's a knock at your door
You don't even recognize the stranger
It's you from before
Tryin' to warn you all about the dangers
There's a hole in your head
At least that's what everybody's guessing
It's why you're always misread
It's why you sleep but you never feel rested
You never get your rest in

Chorus:
Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters, 
Hold on to your heart, 
Never let nobody drag it under.
Hold on to your heart
Even when your body's bitter
Hold on to your heeeaaarrrtt
Never let nobody take it over
ever take it over, ever take it over
Ever take it over from you.

There's a call on the phone 
You don't even recognize the number, 
It's an old episode, 
Of trying to put the lightening on the monster,
Of the life you have led, 
That is always a mess
Are you dreaming of death
Are there ghosts in your chest, 
Are you always so restless, yes you are
Is that hard? 

[Chorus:]

Is it all a game 
But bait and switch up your brains
And follow your leaders to hell
Is it all the same, in vein of insane, 
As drinking from a poisoned well
And I need new skin for this old skeleton of mine
'cause this one that I'm in
Let me down once again
I'm over time, 
And I need new skin for this old skeleton of mine
'cause this one that I'm in
Let me down once again
I'm over time.

Chorus:
Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters, 
Hold on to your heart, 
Never let nobody drag it under.
Hold on to your heart
Even when your body's bitter
Hold on to your heeeaaarrrtt
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over, ever take it over
Ever take it over, ever take it over
Ever take it over, ever take it over
Ever take it over from you.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
