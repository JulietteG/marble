She come bustin' through like a hurricane at midnight
She come bustin' through like she bought the place
She was just a wolf in thrift store clothing
Til that sheepish smile ran over her face
She stood up and said which one you boys
Which one of you boys buying my drink
She started cussing like a backrow Baptist
I started wonderin' what my momma would think
About

Chorus:
About Katherine Belle
Hope you're doin' well
Please don't break my heart
No, please don't break my heart

We started drinking those whiskey and gingers
Drank so much boy we almost drowned
Jukebox was singing like a choir on Sunday
I did the Boss she did a mean James Brown
All of her friends yeah they tried to warn me
Said that horse she's too wild to tame
I took a shot and worked out the courage
To say baby girl let's start with your name

Chorus

She woke up on the wrong side of her bed
I woke up on the wrong side of town
She went to work and I went to Georgia
Wonder if she'll be there the next time around

Chorus

One more time
