Baby, has it really been so long
Is my smile so distant
I can feel there's something wrong
Mmm...all those lonely nights
Was I a fool for you?

Baby, don't you say it isn't so
Was forgetting me so easy
Was there someone else to hold
Mmm...all those lonely nights
Was I a fool for you?

I hold you close
It's not the same
I feel your touch somehow has changed
Did you love just give up on me
Can't you see I need you desperately.

After I'd given you everything I had
It wasn't good enough to keep you
To keep you satisfied
After you broke me down a second time
Was I the fool you said you needed
How could you lie
Mmm...how could you lie

Baby, I guess there's nothing left to say
Was I just so blind
To not see it in this way
Mmm...all those lonely nights
I sure was a fool for you.

Through all those lonely nights
I sure was a fool for you
Yes, I was baby
Through all those lonely nights
I sure was a fool for you
Through all those lonely nights
I sure was a fool for you.---Lyrics submitted by Bryona.
