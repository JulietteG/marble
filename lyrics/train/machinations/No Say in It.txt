Craving for affection, yeah
It's too soon to feel
What the body requires
Keepin it under control
You're  a saint
Speaking ahead of time
Playing waiting
She's keeping it out in the open
She's no angel and she can make her own way

You're got no say in it
She's not in danger she can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct she can make her own way

Stories of some more confusion
You seem to know
What the body requires
Know what they can
Out in the open
Under control
So you can make your own way

You're got no say in it
She's not in danger she can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct she can make her own way

You're got no say in it
She's not in danger she can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct she can make her own way
Home

Seeing her reactions growing
Your senses just lift
Your body's on fire
Now she's pretending
Its under control
You're no saint
When this thing make it's own way

You're got no say in it
She's not in danger she can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct she can make her own way

You're got no say in it
She's not in danger she can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct she can make her own way

You're got no say in it
She's not in danger she can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct she can make her own way---Lyrics submitted by Dale Brook.
