(feat. Keke Palmer)

(Chorus)
I love you so much
I hate you so bad
Said "I don't miss you"
You know that's not true
Boy I want you bad
I hate you so much
But I love you oh so bad
When I say I'm leaving
I don't mean it
I just want you back

(1st Verse)
Got my hopes up
When we broke up
That we would get back always said that
No matter what we would be together
I want you back now more than ever
Feels like we on a roller-coaster
You take me up high then take me down low
There go them games boy you think
You think you're clever
You try to play me it's so whatever

(Pre-Chorus)
Some days we on the same page
Then we go our separate ways
And our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again
Some days we on the same page
Then we go our separate ways
And our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again

(Chorus)
I love you so much
I hate you so bad
Said "I don't miss you"
You know that's not true
Boy I want you bad
I hate you so much
But I love you oh so bad
When I say I'm leaving
I don't mean it
I just want you back
Tell me a way we can make this better
Boy I want you back now forever
We can base it all on this week together
Boy I want you back now forever

(2nd Verse)
When you call me
And I hang up
And I call right back & you pick up
Phone dies cuz we talk for hours
Can't resist you got super powers
Only want me when you're lonely
But when I want you you don't know me
You text me I say "I'll hit you later"
Really I wish you would come and save me

(Pre-Chorus)
Some days we on the same page
Then we go our separate ways
And our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again
Some days we on the same page
Then we go our separate ways
And our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again

(Chorus)
I love you so much
I hate you so bad
Said "I don't miss you"
You know that's not true
Boy I want you bad
I hate you so much
But I love you oh so bad
When I say I'm leaving
I don't mean it
I just want you back
Tell me a way we can make this better
Boy I want you back now forever
We can base it all on this week together
Boy I want you back now forever---
