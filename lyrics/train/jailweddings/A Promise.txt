Once upon a time
In a world of make believe
It fell, right out of the sky
Something no God
Could ever make for me

I saw it with my own eyes
Although I know sometimes I like to pretend
I saw it, I was surprised
But I don't know if it was meant to be broken

When a promise comes to life
It only means it's going to die someday
And your promise climbed to such heights
But it fell out of the sky today

Its endless weight made it so grand
Which only proved to make it fall faster down
And it slipped right out of my hands
Where it belongs
To die on the ground

Then there was some crazy lights
Shortly followed by thunder clouds
And I hope that lightning strikes
This pile of promises that I've found
And I've got one small confession
This wasn't make-believe after all
Reality I can't help but question
Every time I see a promise
Fall---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
