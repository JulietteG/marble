You Will Surrender (Hart)

This tightrope is made from the same string
You tied on me in order to bring
Luxuries I could not afford
And every single thankless reward
But darling, don't look so bored
Cause I know you're still in love with me
And one day you'll surrender to me

Like a child sick of all its toys
You stopped responding to my voice
But I would have gone on forever
A trip down a pit for a feather
But I've always been much better
At defining eternity
And one day you'll surrender to me

I thought love would conquer all
Even when we hit the wall
But as I lifted up my feet to climb
You stared at me, whispering
"This is the last time"

I kissed a stranger just to convince me
We've been severed permanently
But as I tried to pull her close
My hands, they just dropped and froze
Cause I felt like I was cheating
Our love to me is still bleeding
And one day you'll surrender to me

I thought love would conquer all
Even when we hit the wall
But as I lifted up my feet to climb
You stared at me, whispering
"This is the last time"

I remember every single fine line in between
Contrasted against your own denial of everything
My heart is broken while the rest of me is somehow working---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
