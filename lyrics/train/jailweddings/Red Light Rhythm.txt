I hit every red light 
On the way to your house
But it forced me to think finally what this all was about
It's just light night and day 
The way you changed
There's no way to sugarcoat it
You know you were so loaded
Couldn't look me in the eye if you tried

That's why I
Got red light rhythm
I'm not going over to your house anymore
That divine
Old red light rhythm
Gives you more free time with your coma on the floor

What the hell happened to those big beautiful eyes?
Are they the same ones that took me so much by surprise?
It's as if though I've been tricked
Into your loneliness
But you've found another dealer
And you're losing all your feeling
And you've turned into a shell of a woman.

That's why I
Got red light rhythm
I'm not going over to your house anymore
That divine
Old red light rhythm
Gives you more free time with your coma on the floor
