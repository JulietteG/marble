She wants to be a party girl
Everybody loves a party girl
And in my mind she's already fallen in love with the whole world

So she became a party girl
But who's to blame a party girl?
When in my mind she is currently making love to the whole world

I'm trapped in my head
Just trying to claw my way outside
I'll neve know what happened
And my imagination is unkind
Oh, go on party girl
And prove me wrong or right!
I would not be this way
Had it not been for that night

And I'm ashamed I'm this way
But you can't say that I never tried
To be a good party boy
Who'd just let his own party girl fly

And so long, party girl
So you thought was the night
But the walls start to talk
When exposed to the light

All this time, party girl!
I have sent out my spies
There is just no closure
When you share your sacred thighs

One more time, party girl!
Now look me in the eyes
Love don't last forever
What's forever is a lie---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
