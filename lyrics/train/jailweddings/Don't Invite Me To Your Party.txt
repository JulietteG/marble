You see how I treat my own house?
Most of that mess is mine
See, it doesn't take much to see
What I do in my spare time

Have you wondered where I've been
Without bothering to look in
The window I broke just to meet you under the street light?

Well, don't invite me to your party
I already prematurely feel like a clown
It's nice to be kept in the loop
While trying to climb up a root
Wondering how I got buried so far underground

But please, don't invite me to your party
Don't play dumb
You know exactly what would happen
I will get too excited
Everyone will get so frightened
When I turn the celebration into a weapon

Well I won't invite you to my party
The thought actually never even crossed my mind
You go beyond common drama
With your vigilante view of karma
So when you say it's my party
That means that my party is mine

It should be no surprise the way the night always explodes
The stars remind me of the shards of glass
From that window that broke
You can't run and hide in any shadow of a doubt
And just like the stars
We never come down
Till we burn out

So don't invite me to your party
I hope that you have lots of fun

No, I won't invite you to my party
Your personal apocalypse has just begun
Congratulations!---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
