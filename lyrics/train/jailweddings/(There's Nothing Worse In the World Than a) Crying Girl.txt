Venus flytrap eyes
Enemies of sleep
They crystalize
Tremble, shut, then bleed

Followed by a sigh
Of futile retreat
Cannibalized
By her own beauty

One can't care for this hour of cruelty
With a kiss or a kind word alone
One can't stare at this eclipse of purity
Without turning into stone

Inadequate I
Picks up a piece of shattered she
But the sun hits it right
And it just blinds me

You can't philosophize
With something this twisted and deep
There's no way to be wise
When another gutter tear runs down the street

Standing in the shadow of a ragged silhouette
Searching for the end all to say
What makes moments like this make one forget
She's pushing me away
Anyway...

There's nothing worse in the world than a crying girl
Tear off that shattered battered face
Reveal the pearl

(wah wah wah)---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
