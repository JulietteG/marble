What Did You Do With My Gun (Hart)

Well it was here
And now it's gone
Thing come and go
But this seems so wrong
These things don't just get up and walk away unless they're in their owner's possession

I know you hated to look it in the face
But you hated it, even
In its hiding place
And now I fear I should have never introduced you to my mom
Don't you dare tell me it just disappeared to where all our stray socks go
I just want to know

What did you do with my gun?

Oh and what nerve! To blame it on the gardeners again!
How many times have I heard you blame it on all my naughty friends
Well I don't wanna call the cops
And I don't want to change the locks
Cause everyone knows the thief is always the one holding the mop
Pretending they're well meaning when they just got done cleaning
Every last trace of their own slime trail

And didn't I agree when you said it serves no purpose other than to kill?
But one day you will see I am a man of the highest strength of will
If you would so kind to disregard my kaleidoscope of vice
It just would be so nice
If I knew

What you did with my gun

And what did I say to you and the gun shop guy?
