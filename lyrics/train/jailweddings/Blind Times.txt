Blind Times (Hart)

Wide awake in blind times
With our arms outstretched in vain
Howling in blind times
Screaming down the opposite lane
Oh these are blind times
So we're all wearing shades
Bring on the blind times
Before the memory fades
So easy to bear the blind times
When you know
You'll never see again

Blind spots in blind times
Seem to remain like a stain
Proud, lost in blind times
Sight shorted by sideways rain
Alive in blind times
Who needs eyes in their face?
I'm stickin' out my tongue
Parading all my bad taste
And somewhere in all these blind times
There's a secret shortcut to heaven

And against our better judgement
We chose to walk a crooked path
And the second you don't just love it
Is the second you feel its wrath
Just gaze into these blind eyes
And you'll see they're bottomless
Backstroking in these blind times
I Will See You. In the deep end...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
