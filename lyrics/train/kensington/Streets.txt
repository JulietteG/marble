So, whenever they'll say that all we had is bound to fall
Oh, together we'll stay (when you get in our way, when you get in our way)
Strange, how everything seems to float in grey and drown in gold
Stay, and everything's save (when we're pulling our way, when we're pulling our own way down)

I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I (go)

Where do we go when the streets are calling (calling, calling)
How do we know when we each stop falling (falling, falling)

Say, that everything caves in on our way to grander goals
Wait, and everything's save (when we let it all in, let it all in)
How, letting it rain, our own distress, our own mistakes
Wait, till everything breaks (when we're pulling our way, when we're pulling our own way down)

I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I (go)

Where do we go when the streets are calling (calling, calling)
How do we know when we each stop falling (falling, falling)
Where do we go when the streets are calling (calling, calling)
How do we know when we each stop falling (falling, falling)

I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I will
I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I will

Where do we go when the streets are calling (calling, calling)
How do we know when we each stop falling (falling, falling)

Where do we go when the streets are calling (calling, calling)
How do we know when we each stop falling (falling, falling)
Where do we go when the streets are calling (calling, calling)
How do we know when we each stop falling (falling, falling)---
