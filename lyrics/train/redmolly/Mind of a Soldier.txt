I carry heavy prayers
To the post office
To the grocery store
It's so strange to go on
Living here
Home & safe from harm
But in constant fear of losing you

(chorus)
Over oceans
You've traveled.
Through a darkness I'll never understand
I don't claim to know the mind of a soldier
But I once knew the heart of a man

I know
It's my job
To keep on going
Like nothing's changed
But while you're off fighting wars
With demons you can see
Well there ain't nothing I can do
To fight the devil inside me

(chorus)

(instrumental)

If you come back to me
One day
We walk with the living
And dream with the dead

The ghosts sleep between us
And cloud  your eyes like rain
How much can one man stand
And still love again

(chorus)

I once knew the heart
Of a man
I once knew the heart
Of a man.---Lyrics submitted by Rowan.
