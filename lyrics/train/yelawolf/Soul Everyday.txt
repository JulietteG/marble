Chorus:
Soul in the mornin'...
When I wake up I hit my knees and tell the lord, that I'm, 
Happy to be breathin'
Cause I got lungs of steel, an' how you feelin' me today
Soul in the evenin'
Walkin in the streets, I hit my knees and I tell the lord, 
I'm happy to be breathin'
Buddy I'm real, no matter how you feel, thats fine 
I got... Soul in the nighttime...

Verse 1: (Yelawolf)
Sometimes I lay lines about hoe's, because I know hoe's
I've been froze with cold minds and big behinds
But I refrained, that's old Wayne, I been chose
Not to pose or act, or throw my jersey back, 
And rap with baggy hats, like you fags with do-rags
Who-the-fuck is you foolin'?
Am I a hypocrite because I want some jewels 
And two twin-pipes under my Chevy box?
An Element on spokes with the heavy knock, I drop this beat
It took a while to realize who I could be
Chief Yelawolf keep it movin' to the truth
Tell the youth, we got the purifying sound
The whole globe sewed up, Southside throw it up
This aint no trend my friend, fuck your pimp-cup
Spill it out with this eight-o-eight kick, while I chill with my chalice
Hypnotic on your suede and you need another outfit
I got that Wal-Mart brand, I stand soul-breathin', speak full of heaters
Momma said you dirty boys got the go the world grievin'
But we aint responsible for guns, we just bleedin'
Every bullet passin' me by, whether it be words, bats or wise chi
Standin' in the storm n yawnin' cause I got,

Chorus x1

Verse 2: (Ben Hameen)
The right time, the right rhymes, that I find
Embedded in my head again, I give back to the earth
And when I'm gone, this track, and every verse will live on
Eternally been turning, page after page, 
Searchin' for words to convey the message
And keep blessin it every day, wont let it just slip away
I know the mind is a miracle, and I feel I got plenty of shit to say
But I dont live up on no pedestal
My head is still down to earth, 
You aint gotta believe anything I'm tellin' you, 
Let it be known, I'm prone to light up a song
Write up a poem, right or wrong, provide you a tone
To last your life long, at last the mic's on
And a cool calm presence surrounds my life form
And I've sworn in my life, never to sacrifice, what I believe in
I was taught to tackle life, head first and network, collect my efforts
Get ready to sweat, work, harder than ever
See, the art you envisionin', starts with decisions an,
Embark on a mission an
Never lose hope, and if you get hurt, 
Just put your soul on your sweatshirt
Put your best foot first, remember that the worst is behind you
In time, you find you a rhythm and in, life when you hear it,
You can tell its true soul
Chorus

Verse 3: (Yelawolf)
This day this time, I ain't fuckin' up,
I ain't leavin my kid behind,
I ain't tough enough for the devil,
Without the shine from the Son of the one who provide, who
Died, who, cried as a man, understand, 
Just to stand in the eyes of the God who created my hand
So that he can understand how we feel
When the seal of the truth got broke,
All hope was lost but he tossed me a key
A Cherokee, merrily doing my deeds, every day,
Like needles of an Evergreen, I'm stationary
I'll be dead when the drive in my body drops
But I will fly on, from dirt in the pinecones the seed in the mud,
The history of my soul shown
With the almighty Redwood oak, 
Give it ed on my folks on a boat that can float in
