I look at you and I'm ready to pump
 Luminous heartthrob ready to jump
Mama's dancing with Jellybone 
You better watch out, take you to the freak zone
Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track
 Hard kiss, love chain

 Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! Pump it up, pump it up, yeah

Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! I'm a runaway train Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! Pump it up, pump it up

Get serious, get off the phone 
Talk to me and make me moan I said, Baby! Lose that phone! Rock me down to the Jellybone
Motor running double time Machine is humming, your body's mine Dancing in the street and we're having fun Don't drop the beat electric drum

Chartreuse glow is maxing out Electric hell, electric luau I'm busting loose, pumping the music Let's dance, baby, let's dance Jellybone

Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Hard kiss, love chain Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! Pump it up, pump it up, yeah
Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! I'm a runaway train Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! Pump it up, pump it up

Mama's dancing, electric luau Barefooting and cahooting With the wild crowd, with the wild crowd Yeah, yeah, yeah

Electric eel, that's the feeling Lines cross, lips heating Lick my belly, turn to jelly Spread me thin, I'm in!

I'm in it, I'm on it I'm in it, I'm on it I'm out, I'm in I'm out, I'm in
Shake that jelly, rattle them bones Dance to the rhythm that'll make you moan

Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Hard kiss, love chain Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! Pump it up, pump it up, yeah
Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! I'm a runaway train Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track Pump! Pump it up, pump it up, yeah---Lyrics submitted by creed matthews.
