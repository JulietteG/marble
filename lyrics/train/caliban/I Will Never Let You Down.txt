Wake up, Sing up, for everything you want
Lets go, lets live, what do you dream
what do you wish, its up to you, so open up your eyes
and see what could be, the world is for us
FOR US.Forever, We will be together.
To live for life. (And i go, let me leave, to be free.)

Let me be your eyes, forever long
let me be your god through this life

What is real, what is fake, you never know for sure
When in pain draw the line, i cant tear away from you
Its up to you, so open up your eyes
and see what could be, the world is there for us.
THERE FOR US.

Let me be your eyes, forever long
let me be your god through this life
I wont ever, let you down.

Forever, we will be together
To love for life. (And i go, let me leave, to be free.)....---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
