Well you could burn me up with evil eyes and you know I'm gonna to stick by you
and you could cut me down and tell me lies and you know I'll still be true
cause in a cold and lonely world like this there's a lot of things you can't predict
and when you spend your last two dimes and trouble's trailing close behind you'll find
I'm gonna be there too

Yeah well you could turn your back and leave me cold and you know I'm gonna stick by you
and leave me high and dry 'til I'm gray and old and you know I'll still be true
Cause in times like these when the future's bleak tomorrow might find you're out on the street
When you think you've lost the final game when you ain't got nothin' left to your name you still got me
Cause I'm gonna stick by you for better or worse that's what I'm gonna do
In thick or thin we lose or win no matter what tomorrow brings you know I'm gonna stick by you

Yeah well you could tell me that you're through with me and you know I'm gonna stick by you
Say I'm the last guy that you'd ever see and you know I'll still be true
Cause when the last sunset has come and gone and all our lives are said and done
When all the dreams we tried to see have broken out and flown off free you'll see
You'll still be in love with me

Cause I'm gonna stick by you for better or worse that's what I'm gonna do
In thick or thin we lose or win no matter what tomorrow brings you know I'm gonna stick by you
Cause I'm gonna stick by you for better or worse that's what I'm gonna do
In thick or thin we lose or win no matter what tomorrow brings you know I'm gonna stick by you
I'm gonna stick by you
I'm gonna stick by you
You know, you know I'm gonna stick by you---Lyrics submitted by elizabeth.
