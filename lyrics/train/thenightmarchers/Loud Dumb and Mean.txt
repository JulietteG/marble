Hu!
Hyperactive tinnitus, a monument of mix tapes.
Throw the towel in the ring, if you wanna be hip go ape.
Kitsch, camp and novelty is all right!
Burning hair and vaseline, standing in line at Pinks.
Have the boss come smell my nuts then tell me what he thinks.
A sour G, broken high E, a slight shock on my tongue.
An endless rant between the songs because I like it dumb.

Kitsch, camp and novelty.
The only things that speak to me are loud, dumb and mean.
Loud, dumb and mean.

Hu!
I'll rent some space on some old pier away from all this shit.
And feed my head with blunt ideas and overdue it.---Lyrics submitted by sudynym.
