Born in February you were always very shy as a child
It made your family worry because somehow you were very very wild
Water sign....forever changing in your mind
Water sign....will you find the time to settle down

You keep on moving
You keep on moving

Your friends were never sure if they could rely on everything you say
No one found a cure because your fickly life was too much for their head
Water sign....forever changing in your mind
Water sign....will you find the time to settle down

You keep on moving
You keep on You keep on moving

Water sign....forever changing in your mind
Water sign....will you find the time to settle down

You keep on moving
You keep on moving

I passed through your life but I could never hold on to you
You left my head confused because I loved you and knew you'd never stay

Water sign....forever changing in your mind
Water sign....will you find the time to settle down

You keep on moving
You keep on moving
You keep on moving
You keep on You keep You keep on moving ---Lyrics submitted by aji.
