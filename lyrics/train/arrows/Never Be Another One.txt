If I dont say the words you want to hear
That dont mean that I dont care
They might be times were I dont make it clear
Nothings farther from the truth
If I had my choice of anyone
And maybe tempted by thats all
Youve got to know what all said is done
And ill be standing next to you

Theyll Never be another one
For me you are the only one!
Theyll Never be another one
You are the only one!

If you they threathned by someone who
Catches my eye across a crowded room
Now downtown!
Theres no match for you
Youre the one its you

Theyll Never be another one
For me you are the only one!
Theyll Never be another one
You are the only one!

Trumpet solo

I cant imagine were id be
If you decided you should leave
No oo one means more to me
Youre the one, its you!

Theyll Never be another one
For me you are the only one!
Theyll Never be another one
You are the only one!

Never never never
Your are the one for me
Never never never
Thats the way it
Never never never
The way it always will be
Never never never
Your are the one for me
Never never never
Thats the way it
Never never never
No oo
Never never never

Your are the one for me
You for me
You for me
You for me---
