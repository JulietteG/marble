Tonight well run a massive attack
Yeah baby Im a party freak
And theres no going back
But can you handle that?
Watch me work it out on the floor
Yeah Im addicted to the beat
Boy what you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause the party aint over till we party through
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that youve had enough
Well take things to whole other love
I want to love controlmaker
Love controlmaker
Love control
I want to love controlmaker
Love controlmaker
Love control
Love control

Tonight we're pushing it to the max
I'll take away your sanity and you won't get it back
But can you handle that?
Get your body out on the floor
Cause if youre partying with me
Then you gotta keep on
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause the party aint over till we party through
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that youve had enough
Well take things to whole other love

Tonight were gonna party party party
Wanna see everybody move your body body body body
Cause its the only way that we party party party
Yeah everybody grab somebody, make it naughty naughty

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause the party aint over till we party through
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that youve had enough
Well take things to whole other love

I want to love controlmaker
Love controlmaker
Love control
I want to love controlmaker
Love controlmaker
Love control
Love control
