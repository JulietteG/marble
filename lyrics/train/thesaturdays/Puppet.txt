Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeahhhhh

Ill push to see how far ill make you go.
Then pull you back when I am craving more.
You know that im the kinda girl you need,
So prove how much you wanna be with me.
I know you like it, youll be my every thing, if you dont fight it, relax and come with me.
I control your body and mind, look into my eyes, I got you hypnotised.

Like a p-p-p-p-puppet on a string.
Make you dance, make you sing, buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things.
I can make you d-d-do just anything.
What I want, what I dream, I just pull the string, youll come back to me.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..

Youll do anything I want you to. Dont move, unless of course I ask you to. 
So bring me back something nice.
Something that ill like.
You know ill treat you right, treat you right, right.

I know you like it, youll be my every thing, if you dont fight it, relax and come with me.
I control your body and mind, look into my eyes, I got you hypnotised.

Like a p-p-p-p-puppet on a string.
Make you dance, make you sing, buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things.
I can make you d-d-do just anything.
What I want, what I dream, I just pull the string, youll come back to me.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..

If youre gonna talk back, 
if youre gonna talk back, 
pack your bags, pack your bags,
 just like that, just like that.

You cant run away. Youll do exactly what I say.

Like a p-p-p-p-puppet on a string (on a string, yeah).
Make you dance, make you sing, buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things (Buy me fancy things, oh).
I can make you d-d-do just anything. (Ill make you do just anything),
What I want, what I dream, I just pull the string, youll come back to me (ohhh).
Like a p-p-p-p-puppet on a string (on a string, yeah).
Make you dance, make you sing (make you sing), buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things.
I can make you d-d-do just anything.
What I want (what I want, yeah), what I dream, I just pull the string, youll come back to me (ohhh).

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ill make you sing yeah, buy me fancy things, oh)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (what I dream, whooo...)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

(like a puppet on a string)
