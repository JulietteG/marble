Verse
Battered sore and high on hurt
Out of line and out of words
Lost for love and lost for air
That is how you leave me here
But no, no longer (no, no longer)
I am getting stronger (getting stronger)

Chorus
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies

Verse
I would give the sun for you
Everything I had belonged to you
All my tears and all my joy
That's how much I have loved you boy
But no, no longer (no, no longer)
I am getting stronger (getting stronger)

Chorus
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies

So now forget about
All I ever promised you
I am getting out
Spin your lying web alone
Spin the wheel of lies on someone new
Someone new

All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies (lies)
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies

All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies (lies)
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me (all you ever told me)
All you ever told me are lies---Lyrics submitted by Balazs.
