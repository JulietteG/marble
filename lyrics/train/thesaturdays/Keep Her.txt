Verse
You told me I'm so special
And I'm the only one you'll
Ever be with and you tell me you'll
Never hurt me and you won't leave
You bought me bags and flowers
So sure that I don't know what
Everything you got going on
Never think that I might be onto you

Chorus
Boy you got me wrong
Cos you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
Cos boy you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough you can keep her
Just keep her yeah
Cos I don't want you

Verse
I've seen what you've been up to
I must say I'm surprised you
Ever thought you could fool me babes
Clever ladies don't play this game
You think that you out smart me
You think I'm not aware she
Never calls you when I'm at home
Ever call you the next time you're alone

Chorus
Boy you got me wrong
Cos you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
Cos boy you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough you can keep her
Just keep her yeah
Cos I don't want you

Cos I don't want you
See I don't need you
She can have you
Cos I don't want to

You told me I'm so special
And I'm the only one you'll
Ever be with and you tell me you'll
Never hurt me and you won't leave me no

Chorus 2x
Boy you got me wrong
Cos you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
Cos boy you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough you can keep her
Just keep her yeah
Cos I don't want you---Lyrics submitted by Balazs.
