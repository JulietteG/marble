Verse
In my time, that's the way I usually go
And when I feel fine, that's when I'll be letting you know
I try, try keeping it slow, taking it slow
But I can't sustain it
Letting it go, letting it go (so easily)
So I try
As best as I can to break my fall
But you about to send me baby
You about to set me off

Chorus
I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

Be aware, I am not your everyday babe
We'll I'm there, I'm there
Everything all in, they play fair
Keeping it real, keeping it cool
But I gotta tell ya
I am a high heating with you
So I try, as best as I can to stay on my heels but they are breaking I'm so shaky
You about to set me off

Chorus
I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off
Just set me off, just set me off

It's crazy, I am always in control
But baby with you I'm good to go
Take caution, I'm about to blow my top
Come closer baby set me off, just set me off

Yeah

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off
Just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me of---Lyrics submitted by Balazs.
