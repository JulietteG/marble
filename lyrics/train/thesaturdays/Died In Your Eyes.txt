I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes. 
Just died in your eyes, eyes. 
Just died in your eyes. 

There's a silence in the air tonight. 
There's a secret we can't hide behind, no more. 
There's a distance we don't dare to go, 
And a million things that I don't wanna know. 

Your hands are undressing me; 
Your lips won't stop kissing me; 
I hear you say you love me... 

But baby you're lying, lying. 
I see the truth your hiding, hiding. 
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes. 
Before I start crying, crying 
Give a reason for trying, trying. 
The one thing that keeps me alive, I, just died in your eyes, eyes. 
Just died in your eyes, eyes. 

From the window I've been looking through, 
I have seen the end of me and you. 
Oh, oh. 
And it's not about what's right or wrong. 
When you wake up in the morning I'll be gone.---Lyrics submitted by Asal morvaridi.
