V1
I was caught 
In a place
Far away
From the light
What I saw
I couldn't face
So I closed
My eyes

Wish I could turn back the page
Re-write my point of view
Save all the time you waste
Got to get gone gone
Don't let it escalade
Don't fight it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone gone gone

(Chorus)
Forever is over
And my heart's not gonna fight
Forever is over
And I'm no further afraid
Cuz if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your clever is fading away
And I'm getting closer
To the place I belong
Forever is over
Over Over Over Over

V2
I don't want
You to tell me
You found someone
Cuz I got
No distance left
To run

Wish I could turn back the page
Re-write my point of view
Save all the time you waste
Got to get gone gone
Don't let it escalade
Don't fight it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone gone

(Chorus)
Forever is over
And my heart's not gonna fight
Forever is over
And I'm no further afraid
Cuz if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your clever is fading away
And I'm getting closer
To the place I belong
Forever is over
Over Over Over Over

V3
I'm on the other side
And now I realise
I'm in paradise
Cuz you're out my life

(Chorus)
Forever is over
And my heart's not gonna fight
Forever is over
And I'm no further afraid
Cuz if I don't get out now
I may never escape
Your clever is fading away
And I'm getting closer
To the place I belong
Forever is over
Over Over Over Over
Forever is over
