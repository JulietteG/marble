I miss missing you
I miss missing you

Where's the pain when you walk out the door
It doesn't hurt like it used to before
Where's the love that we couldn't ignore
It doesn't kick like a pill anymore
Where's the thrill at the end of our fights
Where's the heat when we turn off the lights

I just miss all the mess that we made
When we still have the passion to hate

I miss missing you, sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears
Begging to get back together
I just want you to be
To be stuck in a second forever
So don't freak out and believe.

Sometimes I'm just missing
Missing You
I miss missing you

Theres a dark cloud pulling me in
Thats the girl I was breathing in sin
Theres a blind force letting it win
And its longing to tear us apart
I get high when youre making me weak
Let me down til I crawl on my knees

I just miss all the mess that we made
When we still have the passion to hate

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears
Begging to get back together
I just want you to be
To be stuck in this second forever
So dont freak out if I leave

Sometimes Im just missing, missing you
I miss missing you

Miss missing, miss missing, miss missing
I wanna crush in your arms at the other side of the world
Miss missing, miss missing, miss missing
I wanna die for you cause love is only true if it hurts

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears (ooh)
Begging to get back together (together)
I just want you to be (want you to be, yeah)
To be stuck in this second forever
So dont freak out if I leave

Sometimes Im just missing (Im missing)
Missing you (no, missing you)
I miss missing you---Lyrics submitted by Mackenzie Hollister.
