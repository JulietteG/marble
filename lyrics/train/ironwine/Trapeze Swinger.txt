Please remember me, happily
by the rosebush laughing
with bruises on my chin,
the time when 
we counted every black car passing your house
beneath the hill and up until
someone caught us in the kitchen
with maps a mountain range, a piggy bank, a vision to remove attention

but please remember me, fondly 
i heard from someone you're still pretty
and then they went on so say
that the pearly gates
has some eloquent graffiti 
like "we'll meet again" 
and "fuck the man"
and "tell my mother not to worry" 
and the angels with their great hand shake 
but always done in such a hurry 
and please remember me,  at halloween 
making fools of all the neighbors 
our faces painted white, by midnight 
we'd forgotten one another 
and when, the morning came, 
i was ashamed
only now it seems so silly
that season left the world 
and and then returned, 
now you're lit up by the city 
so please remember me, mistakenly 
in the window on the tallest tower
the calm, that passes by 
but much too high to
see the empty roaded happy hour 
gleams and resonates 
just like the gate
around the wholly kingdom 
with words like "lost and found" 
and "don't look down"
and "someone save temptation"

and please, remember me
as in the dream 
we had as rug-burned babies 
among the fallen trees, fast asleep
beside the lions and ladies 
that call you what you like 
and even might, give a gift for your behavior
a fleeting chance to see 
a trapeze swing as high as any savior 
but please remember me, my misery 
and how it lost me all i wanted 
the dogs that love the rain 
and chasing trains, 
the colored birds above them running
circles 'round the well 
and where it smells 
on the wall behind St. Peters so bright
disintegrate and spray paint 
who the hell can see forever 

and please remember me seldomly 
in the car behind the carnival
my hand between your knees 
you turn from me 
and say the trapeze act was wonderful 
but never meant to last 
the clowns that past  
saw me just come up with anger
it filled the circus dogs,
the parking lot
had an element of danger 

so please remember me, finally 
and all my up-hill clawing, my dear
but if i make the pearly gates 
i'll do my best to make a drawing 
of god and lucifer
a boy and girl an angel and a sinner 
a monkey and a man 
a marching band 
all around the frightened trapeze swinging---Lyrics submitted by teri.
