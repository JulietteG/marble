Me and my woman
we don't get along 
but one day at a time

Me and my woman
we don't get along
but one day at a time

One day we're fussing and fighting
and the next day we're doing fine

Monday-we're lovey dovey
Tuesday-we don't even sleep
Wednesday-she fixed me a steak now
Thursday night I don't even eat

Talking bout me and that woman
we don't get along
but one day at a time
one day we're fussing and fighting now
and the next day we're doing fine

(Guitar Solo) Oh, mmmm

Friday-everything is beautiful
Saturday- we have no peace
Sunday we go to church
and Sunday night-that woman called the police

Talking bout me and that woman
we don't get along
but one day at a time

One day we're fussing now
and the next day we're doing fine
woah..........yes fine

(Guitar Solo)
