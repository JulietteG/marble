Our last day of summer
Ninety seventy-nine
We gotta live it up for one time before it's over
We will make history tonight

Out at the drive-in
All our closest friends will be sneaking in
You'll be spending the whole night
Trying everything you can to get that girl to notice you

'We are the champions' Playing out of the radio station
Every one sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruising down the pacific coast highway
Put the top down crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight

Down at the roller rink
All the cool kids crowding around the air hockey table
Hey my best friend likes you
I hear you shout at me as you go skating by

'We are the champions' playing out of the radio station
Every one sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruising down the pacific coast highway 
Put the top down crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight

Sneak out of your window darlin
Let's live like outlaws
We'll never look back

Climb out on this rooftop
And stare at the city lights below us
This world belongs to us tonight
The kids will keep raging on
And they ain't never gonna stop

'We are the champions' playing out of the radio station
Every one sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruising down the Pacific highway
Put the top down crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight---Lyrics submitted by charlie.
