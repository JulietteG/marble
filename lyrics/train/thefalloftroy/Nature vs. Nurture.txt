And it begins, I toss and turn,
but things can't be much worse.
Hurry up and wait, its got me movin' in sync,
just by you, and the loaded things we sing.

You're gonna miss, gonna miss,
gonna miss me someday.
You're gonna miss, gonna miss,
gonna miss me someday.

The siren sings, to pull you in,
as things are wearing thin.
The time it takes, before the rain,
let me introduce myself, my name is Fate.

You're gonna miss, gonna miss,
gonna miss me someday.
You're gonna miss, gonna miss,
gonna miss me someday.

You gotta take you're time with things like these,
I'll bet you wanted someone to ask her out on a date.
For things that don't exist,
they just don't make sense,
so much pretense

April 5th, I arise with chapped lips,
and the babbling of nonsense over the TV's dull hiss.
The events of April 4th align just a little more
than the infatuated roar of the kids across the street.
Though they speak not to me,
they go deeper then my worry
for a friend of a friend who at a bar
last night told me that they loved me.
But it must have been the Bacardi
that had her hanging off me,
and saying things she didn't mean.
Why do her words still haunt me?

oh whoa!---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
