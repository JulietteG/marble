Ooh, ready or not
Here we come
Gonna set this town alive
The boys are ready
We're out to rock
Gonna turn it up tonight
Ooh ya, I'm eye to eye with you
We do what we want
Night after night
You make our dreams
Come true
Real people tell it like it is
Don't want bad attitude
Ooh ya, I'm eye to eye with you
Oh I am not a preacher man
Don't run for president
But people judge
The way I look
But I don't do that to them, no!
Eye to eye
Baby let's be open hearted
Eye to eye
What's your point of view
Eye to eye
Maybe we could trust each other
Eye to eye
Don't you see it that way too
I'm eye to eye with you.
Believe it or not
People stop and stare
They got this narrow mind
We're all the same
That's what I think
How can they be so blind
Ooh ya, I'm eye to eye with you
Eye to eye
Baby let's be open hearted
Eye to eye
What's your point of view
Eye to eye
Maybe we could trust each other
Eye to eye
Don't you see it that way too
I'm eye to eye with you.
'Cause I love you more than ever
More than you'll even know
[Chorus:]
Tossing, turning, dreaming of you
Every day of my life
[Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
