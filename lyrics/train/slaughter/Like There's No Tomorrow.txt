People always sayin' that you're livin' in overdrive 
Well my friends I will show all of the reasons why 
Keep lookin' forward don't ever look back 
Your life's in the fast lane it's true 
[Chorus:]
Now you know in your mind 
You're burnin' candles at both ends all 
of the time and you feel fine 
And you're livin' everyday of your life 
Like there's no tomorrow 
Like there's no tomorrow 
Livin' like there's no tomorrow 
Livin' like there's no tomorrow 
Ya know that everybody tells ya 
That you're gonna have to play by the rules 
I've got news for you people I never listen to fools 
Keep lookin' forward don't ever look back 
Your life's in the fast lane it's true 
[Repeat Chorus]
How many times has the world passed you by 
Gotta keep it together or you'll be livin' your life 
With no meaning insight 
That's no lie 
Yeah that's no lie 
[Repeat Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
