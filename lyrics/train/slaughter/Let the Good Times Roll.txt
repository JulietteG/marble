Everyday ya gotta go and 
keep yourself alive 
Yeah ya know you're sick 
and tired of everybody's jive 
So it's Monday Tuesday ya 
know you're hatin' the scene 
so it aint no dream 
So the boss man calls you 
on the phone 
Ya say no, no, no 
You'll be screamin' you'll be shoutin' 
You say let the Good Times Roll 
So you're headed to the show and 
Ya know ya gotta get there fast 
Now is the time gotta go 
ahead and kick some ass 
Party here party there that's 
all you want to do 
This songs for you oh how do ya do 
So the boss man calls you 
on the phone 
Ya say no, no no 
You'll be screamin' you'll be shoutin/ 
You say let the Good Times Roll 
You'll be screamin' you'll be shoutin' 
You say let the Good Times Roll 
All right gonna have some fun tonight 
All right cause there aint no limit and 
We're gonna take ya for a ride 
All right gonna have some fun tonight 
All right cause there aint no limit and 
I wanna hear everybody screamin' 
You'll be shoutin' 
You say let the Good Times Roll 
You'll be screamin' you'll be shoutin' 
You say let the Good Times Roll---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
