Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Is anyone there

You point your finger
And blame the world on me
Do you really care

Alone, so you talk to yourself
Alone, if you listen to your mind it yells

Take us back to where we belong
Where the simple songs
And the days last forever

Where all you have to do is dream
Life's not as bad as it seems
And we all stand together

As long as you don't let it
all pass you by
It'll be alright, it'll be alright

Now tell me mister
What's your point of view
Do you feel that way

I guess your past
It must be catching up on you
Do you feel the pain

Alone, so you talk to yourself
Alone, if you listen to your mind it yells

Take us back to where we belong
Where the simple songs
And the days last forever

Where all you have to do is dream
Life's not as bad as it seems
And we all stand together

As long as you don't let it
all pass you by
It'll be alright, it'll be alright

Echoes of voices
of all the people you once knew
They call your name
You turn to look and find
But there's nobody there

Gazing out your window
Tell me what are you looking for
It'll be alright

Know all your problems are
falling down like winter rain
like winter rain, like winter rain

Don't you know
Every things gonna be all right
Every things gonna be all right, yeah

Take us back to where we belong
Where the simple songs
And the days last forever

Where all you have to do is dream
Life's not as bad as it seems
And we all stand together

As long as you don't let it
all pass you by
It'll be alright, it'll be alright---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
