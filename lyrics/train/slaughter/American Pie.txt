Sugar, sugar, honey baby, rock 'n' roll child
With your lizard leather boots on you're acting real wild
I'm a silver tongued poet and I've got to say
That you're lookin' really groovy and I like it that way
[Chorus:]
Got 3-D vision, live in cyberspace
Oh what a rush, oh what a place, oh yeah
Peace, love, flower power
Say what you will
Everybody wants a piece of american pie
Jesus says he loves you and that's outta sight
Now you say it's rainin' but the sun is so bright
You're so cosmic, got naked on the moon
And you're lost in Lucy's garden
But you're still in the room
[Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
