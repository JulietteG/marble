Father of the universe
What happened to your mother earth today
The value of the common man
Does not live up to your master plan
Tell me am I wasting my time
Show me why are we all so blind
[Chorus:]
I've lived a million years
I've seen the wars I've cried the tears
For you, Heaven it cries
I've seen you falling to your knees
I lift you up why can't you see
For you, Heaven it cries
Mary, Mary full of grace show me your love
And let it reign forever
The miracles that you create were sabotaged
By those who hate. .. Why
Tell me is it all in my mind
Show me what I'm going to find
[Chorus:]
"Fear not, for I have redeemed you
I have summoned you by name, you are mine
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you
And when you pass through the rivers
They will not sweep over you
When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned
The flames will not set you ablaze"
Tell me am I wasting my time
Show me why are we all so blind
[Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
