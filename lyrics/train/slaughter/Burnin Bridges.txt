Prissy prissy
Don't you call me
If you miss me
Gotta leave you
And get on with my life
Shootin' everybody down
Thinkin' you're so profound
Ya never listen
To no one's advice
You're a liar, liar, liar
With your pants on fire
Always going back
On your word
Over here over there
Do ya really care
Playin games
Like I never heard
If I knew then
What I know now
I'd tell you that the stories are true
Cause what ever you do
It comes back to you
Right back to you babe, I'll tell ya
Burnin' bridges fallin' down
Got a nasty reputation
From town to town
Burnin' bridges fallin' down
Burnin' bridges fallin' down on you
Mirror morror on the way
It always tells you
That you are the best of all
Maybe you're too blind to see
That you're heading for a fall---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
