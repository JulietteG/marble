Well I've been given a lot of time
To get my life set straight and my head on right
I assumed that I could do no harm,
Until I started to lose my charm

I've got to go and put it all away
But I can't help but think about it almost everyday
I was anxious right before your eyes
But I was sure to always wear my smile

I know we've only got a lot of pain
Cause it's so hard to be a human in so many ways
Overthinking most of my life
I should be swallowing all of my pride

I've had a lifetime to wait
Such a magnificent drain on my energy
I want another one awake
Until the right words fall into place

Anyways
Anyways

Now I've been moaning an entire month
Over a couple troubled thoughts I've got to rise above
They'd be disappearing with no time
If I could only leave my mind

And I've been falling in and out of things
How can anybody love me if I don't agree
I was running from it most my life
But I now I grew, am bored and out of drive

I've had a lifetime to wait
Such a magnificent drain on my energy
I want another one awake
Until the right words fall into place

Anyways
Anyways
Anyways---
