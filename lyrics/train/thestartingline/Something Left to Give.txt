I've got stars in my great big sky
I shall gaze upon without leaving small ones behind
Because they're harder to find
Some were satellites, others planes
Some were twinkling while others were fading away
But they're all one of a kind

Oh it's not that interesting
But I'd like to keep it a secret
So I'll have something left to give
It's not that difficult when you've got a luck of this kind
We've got to take advantage, we've got such limited time
Oh I wonder, oh I wonder
How long to take me to die
oh it's not that interesting
But I'd like to keep it a secret
So I'll have something left to give

And I'll hear my children and grandchildren sing
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da

It's not that interesting but I'd like to keep it a secret
So I'll have something left to give
In my remaining years
When I am old and plain lazy
I'll have a little something left to give
To all those who loved me so much
I'd like to return the favor
And have something left to give

And I'll hear my children and grandchildren sing
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da
It's not that difficult when you've got a luck of this kind
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da
To all those who loved me so much, I'd like to return the favor
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da
I wonder oh i wonder, how long to take me to die
blah la la la da da da
blah la la la da da da
It's not that interesting but I'd like to keep it a secret
and have something left to give---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
