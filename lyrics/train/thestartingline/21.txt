I've been trying to write it off
But I'm doing all I can
To take the slur out of my words
You do your best to understand
I'm keeping you in mind
But I'm getting out of hand
Pour the medicine that keeps me right
Is settling
I get so easily distracted

t's 7 and I'm already wasted
I'm 21 and I'm already hazy
What am I gonna, what am I gonna do?
It's 7 and I'm already wasted
I'm 21 and I'm already hazy
What am I gonna...

I'm gonna stand up and brush it off
And I'll become a better man
I've been trying to explain myself
But no one understands
I'm getting out of line
But I'm keeping all my plans
My movements and my messages are all I said
But my constant contradictions

It's 7 and I'm already wasted
I'm 21 and I'm already hazy
What am I gonna, what am I gonna do?
It's 7 and I'm already wasted
I'm 21 and I'm already hazy
What am I gonna, what am I gonna say?

What do you do here in the moment?
What do you say?
What do you do?
What do you need?

7 and I'm already wasted
I'm 21 and I'm already hazy
What am I gonna, what am I gonna do?
It's 7 and I'm already wasted
I'm 21 and I'm already hazy
What am I gonna, what am I gonna do? [x3]---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
