Songs Of Happiness
I  I  I  I  I  I  I
I  I  I  I  I  I  I

Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less
Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less

(Play again, play again, with Beres; Sing!)

Now once there was a time when we were young and didnt know
So we fooled around, played around cause nothing really mattered
But time is passing by and Im surprised you dont even realize
youre an angel and its your responsibility, yes, yes

Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less
Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less

(Play again, play again, with Beres; Sing!)

Take a look around my friend look at all the little boys
Yea, theyre dancing to your music and they all wanna be like you
Id really love to know whats going on inside your head
Surprise me: give me the time of my life
Do what youre supposed to do,

Oh
Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less
Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less

(Play again, play again, with Beres; Play!)

I  I  I  I  I  I  I
I  I  I  I  I  I  I
I  I  I  I  I  I  I
I  I  I  I  I  I  I

Now once there was a time when we were young and didnt know
So we fooled around, played around cause nothing really mattered
But time is passing by and Im surprised you dont even realize
youre an angel and its your responsibility, yes, hey,

Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less
Sing songs, sweet songs of happiness, bring joy, your love and nothing less---Lyrics submitted by Baxter.
