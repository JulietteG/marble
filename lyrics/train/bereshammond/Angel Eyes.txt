cho
Your eyes show me everything
All I need to know about you
Those eyes couldnt lie to me
Even if you wanted to

Blessed eyes, angel eyes
Its just now I realize
There is none to compare
No no no not anywhere
You got soul and much more
As my truth starts to enfold
Couldnt do without you
No no no not in my life
Why shouldnt I love you
And give you everything
After all youve been there for me all the way
Why shouldnt I cherish the ground that you walk on
Come again my little sweetness make my day

Angel eyes, special eyes
Gives my heart good exercise
Nonstop company and joy
Since youve entered my world yeah

cho
Your eyes show me everything
All I need to know about you
Your eyes couldnt lie to me
Even if they wanted to


After all a man got nothing else within his plan
than to make a little dough
And let the good life flow
And it gets even better
He feels more comfortable
That someone in his world
Comes in the form of you
Didnt take the time to say I love you
After all these years
Im glad its not too late Im singing now
Why shouldnt I love you and give you everything
After all youve been there for me all the way
Why shouldnt I cherish the very ground that you walk on
Come again my little sweetness
Make my day yeah

Angel eyes, special eyes
Its just now I realize
There is none to compare
No no no not anywhere
You got soul and much more
As my truth starts to enfold
Couldnt do without you
No no no not in my life
