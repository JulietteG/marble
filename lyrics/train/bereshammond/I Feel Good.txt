Whoa, what a night
What a night, what a night
Oh gosh, what a night

I feel good when you're wrapped up in my arms
Dancing to a reggae song, feel good, feel good
I feel good 'cause you're perfume isn't loud
That only I can talk about, feel good, feel good

You feel like velvet rubbing over my skin
And then your hair dances under my chin
Wish we were locked out baby, just the two of us
Yes, every move you make gives me a rush

Whine some more and show me that love unconditionally
Make believe that we are alone, just you and me
Take the problems, leave them behind, don't let it show
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby, go

I feel good when you're wrapped up in my arms
Dancing to a reggae song, feel good, feel good
I feel good 'cause you're perfume isn't loud
That only I can talk about, feel good, feel good

Whoa, what a vibe, what a vibe, what a vibe
What a night, what a night, what a night
Yes, what a night

I'd love to wipe the sweat off your face
But it looks so good I might have to rephrase
This moment is magic so I leave it alone
Until you say I need time to go home

Whine some more and show me that love unconditionally
Make believe that we are alone, just you and me
Take the problems, leave them behind, don't let it show
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby, go

I feel good when I'm wrapped in your arms
Dancing to a reggae song, feel good, feel good
I feel good 'cause you're perfume isn't loud
That only I can talk about, feel good, feel good, yes

Oh, what a night, what a night, yes
What a sweet, sweet night full of vibes
Oh, what a night, what a night, yes
What a night, yeah---
