Just when you think youve seen it all
And know it all
Surprise, surprise, surprise
Here comes another surprise

Last night I learned my lesson well
It couldnt be clearer 
See I thought I was number one 
As a true burden bearer
Its customary we meet in the square
Discussing how hard life is to bear
Another brother couldnt wait for us to leave 
To spread his bed right there

I learn that once you have life
Theres a chance youll be able to overcome
Where theres a will, theres a way
It not over until its done
If you believe, you will achieve
Everything can just turn around
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Last night I learned my lesson well
So I have to tell you
Sometimes the thing we cherish most 
Has no real value
So I give thanks for live (yeah, yeah) 
Even when there seems to be no one way to the problem, yeah
I still give thanks for life
Ever wishing and hoping that the table will turn

Cho
Now I know that once you have life
Theres a chance youll be able to overcome
Where theres a will, theres a way
It not over until its done
If you believe, you will achieve
Everything can just turn around
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Last night I learn my lessons well
I learn from all the people
Just seeing the next mans problem 
Is enough for me to humble
While you were wondering what suit to wear
A family is worrying havent a meal to share
So I know I have company, lots of company  (yes)

Cho
I learn that once you have life
Theres a chance youll be able to overcome
Where theres a will, theres a way
It not over until its done
If you believe you will achieve
Everything can just turn around
Yeah , yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Bridge

So I give thank for life, (yeah, yeah)
Even when there seems to be no one way to the problem oh
Still give thanks for life
Ever wishing and hoping that the table will turn

Cho

Cause I know that once you have life
Theres a chance youll be able to overcome
Where theres a will, theres a way
It not over until its done
If you believe, you will achieve
Everything can just turn around
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah,

Know that once youve go life
Theres a chance youll be able to overcome
Where theres a will theres a way
It not over until its done
If you believe you will achieve
Everything can just turn ar---Lyrics submitted by Haye.
