It's not very often that we feel this way
No, it's not everyday oh
So wherever you are

Tell me what does it take if I call on you now 
Saying, "I need you tonight
This very minute in time?"
Oh, how long does it take you from where you are to rush to my scene?
Even though it's just moments since we last seen babe
It feels like a thousand years between the minutes
Yea, that's exactly how it feels
So take a bus, train, a taxi, anything

Ah but you got to ketch mi inna dis ya love mood aye
Hurry! Hurry! 
Oh yea! Run come see me!
Oh yu got to ketch me inna dis ya love mood 
(Oh ahh Oh child)

I try to tell myself, 
"I'm a Man, I'm strong, I can wait"
Still I find myself standing guard at my gate yea
Looking up lookin down yea
Looking just about everywhere
Hoping that at any minute you will appear yea
And capture this magical moment love don't come across in years
Another page in history yeah

Cho.
And only you can compliment-a dis ya love mood (ah aye child)
Ah yu gotta ketch mi inna dis ya love mood (oh ahh ah child yea)

I beg you ride easy and take your time, 
Watch for the corners and watch for the turns
Ride easy take your time yea, gotta have you safely home 

Tell me what does it take if I call on you now 
Saying, "I need you tonight
This very minute in time?"
Oh oye, how long will it take you from where you are to rush to my scene?
Even though it's just moments since we last seen babe
It feels like a thousand years between the minutes
Yea, that's exactly how it feels
So take a bus, train, bicycle, anything yea
