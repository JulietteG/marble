First of all you should know 
That I'm over you it's ok 
But then again I never thought that ill make it to this day
After everything that we been through 
I finally know the truth 

What goes around comes around and will come back to you 
And how you treat your brother man will pay you back in forth 
And for every seed you will sow I just thought that you should know 

Life ain't always fair I know but I'm over that it's okay 
But all the goodness and all the grace
Could not lead me to this day 
And I wish you love and like my friend 
Because I know in the end 

What goes around comes around and will come back to you 
And how you treat your sister friend will pay you back in forth 
And for every seed you will sow I just thought that you should know 

Call it what you want to 
Put a rose by any other name 
It's still that flower just the same 
Take anything you need to 
But don't make believe that the world is what you see 

What goes around comes around and will come back to you 
And how you treat your fellow man will pay you back in forth 
And for every seed you will sow I just thought that you should know 

What goes around 
Comes around 

And they say what goes up must come down 

Call it what want to 

What goes around---Lyrics submitted by jade williams.
