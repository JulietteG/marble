When I look into your eyes, you dont see me.
I can hear it in your voice, you dont need me.
Guess I was missing all the signs, somehow I didnt realize,
That you were changing down inside, about to walk out of my life

CHORUS
We may not be able to admit that its over, 
(Yeah, Yeah)
I dont want to believe love can be done and over
(Ummmm)
We may try to deny all signs and hide
(But Baby its time) 
Maybe its time that we admit it, thats its over

When I ask whats on your mind, did you hear me?
(Ummmm)
Tell me what happened to the time, when you had to be near me. 
(Hummm)
Once we were 2 halves of one whole, you know you lived inside my soul,
One day you took yourself away, left me here wondering what to say.

We may not be able to admit that its over, 
(Hey, Hey, just admit it)
I dont want to believe, love can be done and over
(Ummmm, Yeah dont want to believe it, Hey)
We may try to deny all signs and hide
(But Baby its time)
Its time that we admit it, thats its over

When I look back on love, and all the things that we were guilty of
All the words I should have said, and how you always walk ahead of me (Yeah)
How could I have been so nave?

Now and then thoughts have crossed my mind, love was missing.
(Ummmm)
Maybe I knew somewhere inside, but I didnt want to listen (No No)
(Whooo)
So whyd you go and put me thru, the kind of silly shit men do, its a mystery to me 
But at least now I know the truth.
