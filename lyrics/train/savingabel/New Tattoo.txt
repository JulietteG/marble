Sometime in the summer of '96
I was off on a road trip
A couple hundred bucks and a case of beer
Outside Panama City limits is where it all begins

2 am. I saw hazard lights
Appeared to be a dame distressed in the night
She was 5 foot 6 and damn she was built
I slammed on the brakes and got sideways and told her to get in

She said, where you headed to the city?
I said yeah! I'm gonna have some fun
She tossed back her hair in confidence
And said mind if I come?

2 days later we ain't left the room
Did all in there that we could think to do
I could see she was restless so we hit the town
Ended up at a place where the windows read
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here

Into the back she went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear
I thought hell I need to try and get back there
When she unzipped her pants and said looky here:

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red if for the color we're 'bout to paint this town
Oooh, I gotta new tattoo

One week passed, woke up a day late for work
I found my goodtime gone and she took my shirt
Drove by all the places that we had been
There was one where the windows read
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here

Into the back I went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red if for the color we're 'bout to paint this town
Oooh, I gotta new tattoo

New tattoo!

And I, cannot forget
That smile, when she said

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red if for the color we're 'bout to paint this town
Oooh, I gotta new tattoo

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you

Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
