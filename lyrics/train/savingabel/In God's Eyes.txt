Heaven knows, the devils told
Everything on you is getting out of control
I see your fist raised up and clinched
I know you better than this

Dont hold your breath
Just get as far away as you can possibly get
I know you, better than you
Im taking my time cause I got nothing to do

Wait a minute somethings wrong
But I know it wont take long
Lets burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into Gods eyes

I know it dont seem right
But it wont take all night
Im not trying to save the planet
I just dont like this noose Im hanging from

Red faced, short breath
Yeah Im taking it all until theres nothing left
For you to prove
Yeah Im taking my time cause I got nothing to do

Wait a minute somethings wrong
But I know it wont take long
Lets burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into Gods eyes

I know it dont seem right
But it wont take all night
Im not trying to save the planet
I just dont like this noose Im hanging from
Hanging from

Why dont you make up your mind
Why dont you make up your mind
Why dont you make up your mind

Why dont you make up your mind
Why dont you make up your mind
Why dont you make up your mind

Wait a minute somethings wrong
But I know it wont take long
Lets burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into Gods eyes

I know it dont seem right
But it wont take all night
Im not trying to save the planet
I just dont like this noose Im hanging from---Lyrics submitted by Krystal.
