Hello mother its been long,
I'm still here fighting, be proud of your son,
My friends are dying, and I just wanna come home.

The stars are under a different sky,
Your prayers must be working cuz I'm still alive,
This place is so cold and I just wanna come home.

I'm fighting, I'm bleeding,
I know whats coming but I'm still breathing,
Not giving up, not losing love,

Not running away, I'm not afraid,
I'm miss America, my miss America,
When does the fighting end, wheres does the freedom begin.

Hey there love how have the kids been,
Wish I could be there to tuck them in,
But freedom is calling while your tears are falling.

Ive seen lines broke in two,
Through these eyes red white and blue,
I know why I'm here still I just wanna go home.

I'm fighting, I'm bleeding,
I know whats coming but I'm still breathing,
Not giving up, not losing love,

Not running away, I'm not afraid,
I'm miss America, my miss America,
When does the fighting end, wheres does the freedom begin.

My hair stands on its end,
Chilling thoughts as I defend,
Running for cover take cover my brother,
To die another day as that man I yet waste.

Hey there son its your time to go,
I'm so proud more than you'll know,
But freedom ain't free and now your just like me.

I'm fighting, I'm bleeding,
I know whats coming but I'm still breathing,
Not giving up, not losing love,

Not running away, I'm not afraid,
I'm miss America, my miss America,
When does the fighting end, wheres does the freedom begin.

Where does the freedom begin.
Im miss America, my miss America,
When does the fighting end, wheres does the freedom begin.---Lyrics submitted by Cory Buckpitt.
