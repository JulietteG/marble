I say goodbye to the rearview mirror as a silhouette fades of you 
But I hope you think that Ill be back someday,
Someday Ill only be back just to leave you again
Ooo Ive only come back just to leave you again and again 
I guess Ill never leave 

Im running from you can I get any further away?
It feels like the first time Ive been in love
If Im running from you  will you follow me down to the end?
If I fall again will you say goodbye?
Will you say goodbye? Yeah

I pulled into this town and Im knocking on your door
Before the morning sun sets
On my face as Im staring at your face today,
Today Ive only come back just to leave you again
Ooo Ive only come back just to leave you again and again 
I guess Ill never leave 

Im running from you can I get any further away?
It feels like the first time Ive been in love
If Im running from you  will you follow me down to the end?
If I fall again will you say goodbye?
Will you say goodbye? Yeah

If I stay youve got to understand 
Its my authority I can leave if I want
Im my own man

Im running from you can I get any further away?
It feels like the first time Ive been in love
If Im running from you  will you follow me down to the end?
If I fall again will you say goodbye?
Will you say goodbye? Yeah

If Im running from you---Lyrics submitted by Krystal.
