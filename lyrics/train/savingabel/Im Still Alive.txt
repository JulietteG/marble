It's morning, and i feel it
All the sins that i was in last night.
Dear Jesus, please save me
'Cause i think i'm falling down into the depths this time.
Am i dreaming or still sleeping?
I wonder if i'm ever gonna make it out.
Now your gone and i'm here
And i feel so bitter waking up alive, another day
It never seems easy, when you're fighting
Another day, when i look at what i'm facing 
Don't know if i can take it
I could scream out loud but i'm wasting my time
This pain only reminds me, i'm still alive

Now these feelings, they're creeping
Like a chill crawling up my spine
It's slowly, It's not easy coming home alone each and every night
And as time goes by, i feel so bitter waking up alive.

Another day, it never seems easy
When you're fighting another day
When i look at what i'm facing don't know if i could take it
I could scream out loud but it's wasting my time
This pain only reminds me, I'm still alive

And don't wake me up, if theres gonna be hell to pay
By the weight of the world, keeps pushing  me down, 
pushing me down..
So just let me sleep, even if i'm in too deep
keep me locked in my dreams so i can't get out,
can't get out..

It's been so hard but i'm doing much better waking up alive,
Another day, it never seems easy when you're fighting another day
When i look at what i'm facing, don't know if i could take it
I could scream out loud but it's wasting my time,
This pain only reminds me, i'm still alive. 

This pain only reminds me, I'm still alive.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Dobson.
