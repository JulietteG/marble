I started out today
Thinking 'bout something else
As you lay beside me
It was a rude awakening
As I wiped the sleep from my eyes

But it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful sunrise
I don't want to see you cry

You started whispering
This can't be happening
Cause I don't want to lose my cool
But was it something I said
Or something I did
Ooh, to spark a flame
But it hurts to see your face
It hurts to hear you cry
It hurts to see the look in your eyes

Cause it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful sunrise
Well I don't want to see you cry
But I can take away your pain
The feelings just the same
But I can't stand to see you cry

The list goes on and on
There's never enough
But who is when and when is where
We've been there it's tough
But if I've come to far
It's not far enough
We'll get there just take your time realize
Believe in me

Cause it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful sunrise
And I can't stand to see you cry
But I can take away your pain
The feelings just the same yea
Well I can't stand to see you cry

But it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful sunrise
Oh I just want to see you smile
Cause I can take away your pain
The feelings just the same
Yea, I just want to see you smile

The list goes on and on---Lyrics submitted by Tal.
