Sucked into another black hole
Drag me further down the road
I can't keep from feeling
Time drags me down the line
Gets me closer every time
Cause it's you I'm missing

You're my angel without wings
Don't need them we're high enough
Youre flying above me
Ill keep looking up
You are my angel, my angel
Ill keep looking up

Lying hand in hand
We're face to face to skin
I cant keep from feeling
Theres no place id rather be
Than you tucked away with me
All in this moment

You're my angel without wings
Don't need them we're high enough
Youre flying above me
Ill keep looking up
You are my angel, my angel
Ill keep looking up
Ill keep looking up

Falling back down
From the sun to the ground
Well I cant turn back now
Ill keep looking up

You're my angel without wings
Don't need them we're high enough
Youre flying above me
Ill keep looking up
You are my angel
You are my angel
You are my angel, my angel
Ill keep looking up---Lyrics submitted by Gabrielle.
