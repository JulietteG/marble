A little heartache goes a long way
Guess this is what love is all about
I missed on monday, a terrible tuesday
Maybe someday I can work it out
But here we go again, it's finally sinking in

Thats just my kind of luck
But I'm not given up
I don't know what I'm thinkin
She got over me
Thats no way to look
When you start addin up
I guess I must be dreamin
She got over me
Whoa I'm over this feelin

Yes I'll admit it hard to handle it
I stood my ground, anything goes now
You don't ever let it get me down
Maybe someday I can work it out
Well I lost myself again,
But here we go again
Whoa it's finally sinkin in

Thats just my kind of luck
But I'm not given up
I don't know what I'm thinkin
She got over me
Thats no way to look
When you start addin up
I guess I must be dreamin
She got over me
Whoa I'm over this feelin

Are you starin at the ceilin?
Are you counting all the stars?
Knowing I'm there in your heart
All is fair in love and war, you'll find your way
Thanks for the battle scars

Thats just my kind of luck
But I'm not given up
I don't know what I'm thinkin
She got over me
Thats no way to look
When you start addin up
I guess I must be dreamin
She got over me
She got over me
Whoa I'm over this feelin
She got over me---Lyrics submitted by MR..
