It's official, Full Judicial.
Ends in physical, this I know.
Best keep quiet,
You don't listen to me anyway.
Your gonna lose and it's gonna show. Its far to late to avoid it so.
Oh what's that sum, it added up to nothing cause your much too dumb.

Two-timing touch and broken bones [x4]

Bad decision, Repetition,
Should you listen, or let it go.

Best say something,
When your thinking that you'll get it back.
But, it's too late to avoid it so.
It's far too late and I gotta know
Oh whats that sum, it added up to nothing because you're much too dumb.

Two-timing touch and broken bones [x8]---Lyrics submitted by Shenecca.
