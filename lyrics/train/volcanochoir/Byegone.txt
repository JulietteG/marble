Day dead bye-gone 
Laying near the lights 
Of the knights of the northern lodges 
Theres a border road 
No one slip slides or is stoppin 
And the neighborly, sleeping in a coffin 

With enough keif 
You could really bore someone 
Took a rat trap out to the Ache Inn 
We were drinking all the ways to down 
Door as wide open 
You know what were saying bout us now 
Hes a legend 
Im a legend 
And we both go tripping through the door 

You know that we are northern now 
I heard you promise me 
At the north end of monogamy 
Cut there from filament lead 

Somewhere I heard you scream: 
For others hearts 
And in the limiest of lights 
Hold the keys to a Cuban flight that you wont ever ride 
Its time to up and die 

Set sail! 
Set sail! 
Set sail! 
Set sail! 

Hon, you plenty competent 
So why arent you confident 
Its softening to be softening 
Then why are you so constant then? 
Are we going on a coat ride? 
Well, were off and definitely stumbling 
Tossin off your compliments, wow 
Sexing all your Parliaments---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
