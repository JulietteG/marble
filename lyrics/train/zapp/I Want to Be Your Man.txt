Hey lady, let me tell you why
I can't live my life without you
(Baby)

Every time I see you walking by I get a thrill
You don't notice me but in time you will
I must make you understand

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Yes, I do, yeah, yeah)

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Wanna be your man)

You better not pass me by
'Cause if you do, you'll loose a good thing
(Baby)

'Cause what I've got to say
Is sealed with a kiss and a wedding ring
(Wedding ring)

My mind is blind, at times I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Yes, I do, yeah, yeah)

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Wanna be your man)

Words can never say what I feel, it's too intense
I've tried and tried and tried and tried to tell you how I feel
But I get mixed up
(So mixed up)

My mind is blind, at times I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Yes, I do, yeah, yeah)

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Wanna be your man)

I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Yes, I do)

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man
(Wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(Yes, I do, yeah, yeah)

I wanna be your man
(Wanna be your man)---
