They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday is as just as bad 
Yeah, they call it stormy Monday but Tuesday, Tuesday is as just as bad 
You know Wednesday is worst, and Thursday, oh so sad 

The eagle flies on Friday and Saturday I'll go out to play 
Oh, the eagle flies on Friday and Saturday I'll go out to play 
The seventh day I'll rest and I'll kneel down to pray 

I'll call, "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me" 
Well, I'll call, "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me" 
Well, you know I'm trying to find my baby 
Won't you please send her back to me 

The eagle flies on Friday and Saturday I'll go out to play 
Woah, the eagle flies on Friday and Saturday I'll go out to play 
Sunday I'll go to church and I'll kneel down to pray 

I'll call, "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me" 
Well, I'll call, "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me" 
Yeah, you know I'm trying to find my baby 
Won't you please send her back to me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
