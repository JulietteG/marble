You've got me sleeping on the Porch
Laying in my arms, where you ought to be
There's a big cockroach
Looking up at me

Sleeping on this concrete porch
Ain't no fun at all
But I'm gonna stay right here
Until I hear you call
With this big cockroach
Looking up at me

Well a big cockroach
he's just laying there
looking up at me

(Spoken) I'm glad it's in the summer cause I couldn't make it through a winter storm without your loving arms to keep me warm

Hey a big cockroach
He's just laying there
lookiing up at me

He's a big brown fella
I tell you he's just laying there
Looking up at me

(Spoken) Get away! 
Sure is tiring these cockroaches crawling all up and down my arms and on my legs 
Open the door baby
Let me in! 

Well a big cockroach...
