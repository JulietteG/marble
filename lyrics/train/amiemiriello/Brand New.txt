Yeah yeah
you look like the kind of a person who can have a conversation without makin' a sound
you look like the kind of a person instigating everyone that we're hangin' around
yeah you look like the kind of a person who 
would take me to a party on the wrong side of town
yeah you look like the kind of a person thats down yeah,

(chorus)
and when i see you walkin' down the street kinda guy i like to meet
won't you give it to me
when i see you drivin' in your car
lookin' like a star won't you give it to me
rock those blue jeans baby 
rock those bluuueee
make me feel like i'm brand new
brand new

you speak it's like everyone listens and it's not because they want to
but because you're insane
i'll take on the rode observation by the way yeah
ohh ohh 

(chorus)
and when i see you walkin' down the street kinda guy i like to meet
won't you give it to me
when i see you drivin' in your car
lookin' like a star won't you give it to me
rock those blue jeans baby 
rock those bluuueee
make me feel like i'm brand new (heyyyy)
oh brand new

maybe this could be right
maybe this could be wrong
but it surely is no for meds
boy i feel like my flower opened up to the sun 
and the sky up above (hey) ( I, I, I)
(Hey yeah yeah yeah!)

(chorus) 
and when i see you walkin' down the street kinda guy i like to meet
won't you give it to me
when i see you drivin' in your car
lookin' like a star won't you give it to me
rock those blue jeans baby 
rock those bluuueee
make me feel like i'm brand new
brand new

And when i see you walkin' down the street kinda guy i like to meet
won't you give it to me
when i see you drivin' in your car lookin' like a star
won't you give it to me
rock those blue jeans baby 
rock those bluuueeeee
make me feel like i'm brand new
brand new
