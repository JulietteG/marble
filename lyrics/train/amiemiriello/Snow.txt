Too cold for me when the leaves are brown and crunchin under my feet
And the neighbor's dog just won't come out
And I'm feelin like I've had about just enough of today's misery
But I'll be fine...I'm a little bored and lonely, but that's life
It just seems to go 100 zero it never does pan out for me
Though I'm hopeful that it will in good time

I'm dreamin' of the sound illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the window filled with snow and look out at the open road

We talk all night 
Though I'm not sure he can hear me with closed eyes
But he tells me what I need hear then he drifts away and disappears
And I'm older than my skin is in this life

I'm dreamin' of the sound illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the windows filled with snow and look out at the open road

yeah...mmmmm...hey hey...ahdadadada...mmmmmmm

I'm dreamin' of the sound illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the windows filled with snow and look out at the open road

I sleep all day
When I wake I run in circles in my brain
There are far too many hours to kill so I slip into the tempting stillness
I think about him...and I look out at the open road...---Lyrics submitted by Gene.
