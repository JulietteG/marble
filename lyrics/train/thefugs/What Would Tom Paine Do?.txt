What would Tom Paine do,
to spread a little common sense?

What would Tom Paine do,
the problem's so immense?

That a shout passed mouth to mouth around the world:
Protest and survive
Protest and survive

I want to be a pamphleteer
in the name of Tom Paine's Rights of Man,
But what is the name of the pamphlet
in the age of laser discs
and satellite time?

What is the name of the pamphlet
that shall soar aloft
and beam from mind to mind
a million miles?

And the men of war
Need the fresh young minds
In the labs of doom.

We've got to interdict the flow
We've got to interdict
The labs of doom
Labs of doom
Labs of doom

We vow to go wherever
the malinformed
are dragged aboard
the ships of death
on a dirty sea
That a shout passed mouth to mouth around the world:
Protest and survive
Protest and survive
Protest and survive
Protest and survive

There'll be times when the struggle shall falter
in a whirl of ink and stupid strife
There'll be times when we're eaten by chaos
and everything's a crazy maze
of razor-blade roads

There'll be times when we'll have to let it go
and walk away to heal,
pull on the headphones
listen to Bach by the garden wall

And you don't wanna sew
A quilt of guilt,
but a lace of grace
Lace of grace
Lace of grace

O, the archetypal macho man
with his nuclear spears
pushes his aggression
on the high frontier
as if the Milky Way were just a swirl of knives
We have to overcome
the labs of megadoom,
We have to overcome
the labs of megadoom,

It's such an enormous equation
to dance while others moan in pain
But we're never gonna find any answers
Until we make that simple word:

It's such a simple word
It comes in simple parts
I'm talkin' about pea-, pea-, pea-, -eeeeace

Let it roll let it roll like a rumbling wheel
for a thousand years
pea-, pea-, pea-, pea- -eeeeace

Let the feather of justice
float down and rest
on the shining scales
pea-, pea-, pea-, pea- -eeeeace

What would Tom Paine do,
to spread a little common sense?

What would Tom Paine do,
the problem's so immense?

That a shout passed mouth to mouth around the world:
Protest and survive
Protest and survive (sing along)
Protest and survive (everybody)
Protest and survive (around the world)
Protest and survive (east and west)
Protest and survive 
Protest and survive 
Protest and survive---Lyrics submitted by Ed Cardoni.
