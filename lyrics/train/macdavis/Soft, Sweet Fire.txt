She got soft sweet fire burning in her eyes
She got soft sweet fire burning in her eyes
She got the soul of a woman the beauty of a child
Gypsy eyes that fill me with desire
I'm only human lord shes driving me wild
Drawing me deep into her soft sweet fire
She got soft sweet fire burning in her eyes
A look that only wise men understand
She got soft sweet fire 
blue velvet eyes red hot suprises for her man
She got warm tender magic In her fingertips
Every touch i feel flames go higher
The softness of her body the sweetness in her lips
That fill my hungry soul with soft sweet fire
She got soft sweet fire burning in her eyes
She got soft sweet fire burning in her eyes
She got soft sweet fire burning in her eyes
A look that only wise men understand
blue velvet eyes red hot suprises for her man
(fades) She got soft sweet fire blue velvet eyes---Lyrics submitted by Lynette.
