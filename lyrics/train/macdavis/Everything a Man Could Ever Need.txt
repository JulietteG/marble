Looking back on the days when I was scuffling for a buck,
Not overly concerned with life and love,
I was always feeling sorry for myself and my bad luck;
I never stopped to think what life was made of.
With my nose to the grindstone and my shoulder to the wheel
I fought for my daily dollar like a man,
And then you came into my life, and nothing else seemed real.
I found the answer right here in my hand.

Now I've got everything a man could ever need:
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing in the morn,
I've got hands to hold my baby child, eyes to watch my woman smile,
I've got everything a man could ever need.

Now my working day seems shorter than it ever did before,
The evening breeze gets cooler day by day,
The morning sun is always shining down on my back door,
Your laughter washes all my cares away,
And not a day goes by that I don't look up to the sky
And humbly thank the good Lord up above
For bringing you to me in time to make me realize
That all a poor boy really needs is love.

Now I've got everything a man could ever need:
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing in the morn,
I've got hands to hold my baby child, eyes to watch my woman smile,
Ah, that's everything a man could ever need.
I've got everything a man could ever need.---Lyrics submitted by Leslie Turriff.
