There were times we could never say no
There were times the cold wind will blow
And I wonder where you are tonigth
Do you ever really think about the times I believed in you

We were friends but how we soon forget
And I was wondering how you are
And the words we never said
Were locked inside your head for the rest of your life

Did you know that nothing stays the same
Have you heard the bird has flown
And I'll dream the dream for you
The way you asked me to
For the rest of my days

Can you hear the last songs over
Just another day thats gone
And I'll watch the sun go down
You broke your precuios crown with your own bare hands

Now the endless trial is over
We had before the trial was done
I heard the cries of false devotion and you were gone

We were friends but how we soon forget
And I was wondering how you are , my friend
And I'll dream the dream for you
The way you asked me to
Before I die , before I die
That was then a long time ago

We were friends but how we soon forget
And I was wondering how you are , my friend
And I'll dream the dream for you
The way you asked me to
Before I die

We were friends , we were friends
we were friends , we were friends---Lyrics submitted by Graham Broadhea.
