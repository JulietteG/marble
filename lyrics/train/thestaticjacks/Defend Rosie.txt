Everybody away
I've been waiting all day
And if they strike the left
Then offer them the right
I'll grab this bat just in case

Tell me, what did you say?
Sounds like nothing to me
We haven't been polite
We've had a bit too much tonight
So pack your costume up and leave

Turn out the light
I'm seeing shades of gray
Why can't we behave ourselves
We had so much time
To get this shit together
We didn't even try
If this is how you want it, that can be arragned

I'm not shocked by what this became
In a lot of ways, we're the same
Breaking bottles in the hall
Screaming out, "everybody fuck off"
On another night, that'd be me

But you're still a dick,
You're back and you're forth 
And it's making me sea sick

Turn out the light
I'm seeing shades of gray
Why can't we behave ourselves
We had so much time
To get this shit together
We didn't even try
If this is how you want it, that can be arranged

(You) I never know whats coming next
you'll never know whats coming next
I've seen the future, you'll never guess
what the fuck is coming next---Lyrics submitted by Astro Li.
