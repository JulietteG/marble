In your eyes
All is good
We can be
Just for you
Every night
It's ok
We believe
We can save

I don't think I'm coming along
Everyone's a shopping mall
Someday we'll leave and never come back
We were born to be discarded
I don't, I don't mind

When ya gonna be a star?
Tell me what you're doing now?
Some might say you're being a fool
Everyone's gonna laugh at you

I don't think you know where you're from
All the days have come undone
Just because they don't have the clue
Too afraid to be you
I don't, I don't mind

I can't tell you anything
You believe in something else
I can't give you anything you don't already have
I can't tell you anything you didn't already know
I can't give you anything you don't already have...---
