In the time, I got to know her
She revealed she was weird
Broken nails, I would never
Try to leave something real

And I told ya conversations
Never went anywhere
And I know it'll last forever
She can't quit it, she don't care

She got left on the side of the road
No one's gonna take her home again, my baby
Got left where no one knows
I never thought id see your face again

There was light
Big explosions
We believed it was real
Then she'd ice never talk to
Anyone that she knew

And I felt her devastation
We were lost in the fight
And I knew I couldn't leave her
I would love her thru the night, oh

Got left on the side of the road
No ones gonna ever take you home again, my baby
Got left where no one knows I thought you were a better friend to me
My friend

Got left on the side of the road
No ones gonna take you home again my baby
Got left where no one one knows
I thought you were a better friend to me, my friend oh

I'm looking for you
See ya tonight
I'm looking for you
Maybe tonight
I'm looking for you

Got left on the side of the road
No ones gonna ever take you home again, baby
Got left and no one knows and no one's gonna tell you where to go
My friend
Got left on the side of the road
No one's gonna ever take you home again, baby
Got left where no one knows, I thought you were a better friend to me
My friend... ---
