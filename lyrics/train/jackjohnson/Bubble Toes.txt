Its as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls, and scars

It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Of the hill in the back of a house in the wood
She love me forever I know, she could

I remember when you and me
Mmmm how we used to be
Just good friends, wouldn't give me none
But all I wanted was some

She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one that could justify me
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
And he got too much time to waste

His dreams are like commercials
But her dreams are picture perfect 
And our dreams are so related
But they're often underestimated---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
