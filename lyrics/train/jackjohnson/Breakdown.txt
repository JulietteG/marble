I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see, time is just a melody
With all the people in the street walk as fast as their feet could take em
I just rome through town
And though my windows got a view with the frame Im looking through seems to have no concern for now
So for now I,

I need this old train to break down
Oh please just, let me please break down

Well this it just screams out loud, then the bee gonna crawl west bound
So I don't even make a sound
Its gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street, they will never get to meet
These tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get to where I don't need to be, so I

I need this old train to break down
Oh please just, let me please break down
I need this old train to break down
Oh please just, let me please break down
I want to break on down, but I cant stop now
Let me break on down

But you cant stop nothing if you got no control of the thoughts in you mind that you kept in you know
You don't know nothing but you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees not the glass windows
You cant stop wishing if you don't let go
The things that you find and you lose and you know
You keep on rolling put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright so put the blinds down low

I need this old train to break down
Oh please just, let me please break down
I need this old train to break down
Oh please just, let me please break down
I want to break on down
But I cant stop now---Lyrics submitted by joedy.
