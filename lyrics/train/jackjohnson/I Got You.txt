Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

I got you
I got everything
Ive got you
I dont need nothing
More than you
I got everything
Ive got you

We went walking through the hills
Tryin to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up
We can build a little home
But then the hell storm came and yelled,
You need to let go, youve got no control. No.

I got you
I got everything
Ive got you
I dont need nothing
More than you
I got everything
Ive got you

This weights too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrows too much
Ill carry it all
Ive got you

And when tomorrows too much
Ill carry it all
I got you

I got you
I got everything
Ive got you
I dont need nothing
More than you
I got everything
Ive got you---
