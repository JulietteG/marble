Three, it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number

Because 2 times 3 is 6
And 3 times 6 is 18
And the 18th letter in the alphabet is R.

We got 3 R's we're going to talk about today
We gotta learn to 
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

If your going to the market 
to buy some juice,
you gotta bring your own bags
and you learn to reduce your waste.
We've gotta learn to REDUCE.

And if your brother or your sister's
got some cool clothes,
you could try them on
before you buy some more of those.
REUSE,
We've gotta learn to REUSE.

And if the first 2 R's
don't work out,
And if you've gotta make some trash, well
don't throw it out.
RECYCLE,
we've gotta learn to RECYCLE.

We gotta learn to 
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Because, 3
it's a magic number
Yes it is
It's a magic............
number.
