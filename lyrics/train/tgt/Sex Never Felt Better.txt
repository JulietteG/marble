Whats happenin, baby? Whats good tonight?
Id rather show you than tell you
Whats on my mind
Just clear out your schedule
Cause I need some time
I know you got shit to do but baby tonight
Dont be selfish with your body baby
This what Ive been wanting baby
So lets get together, you set the time
Just know when you get the embodieds on my mind
Just bring it over here, trink your phone off
Leave them heels on, take your clothes off
Dont wanna see no one else, girl Im all yours tonight, tonight

[Chorus:]
Sex aint never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I want my hands tattooed on your body baby
Sex aint never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
Ill be your sex slave
Sex aint never felt better, babe

Lets make a movie, you steal the show
You can be my leading lady baby anything goes
But the bed be the set, cause I know you on some freak shit
Girl I really like what you be doing
So cancel all your plans
Cause tonight anything goes baby
Make your way over here
Dont you keep me waiting too long for that body
Bring it over here, turn your phone off
Leave them heels on, take your clothes off
Dont wanna see no one else, girl Im all yours tonight, tonight

[Chorus:]
Sex aint never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I want my hands tattooed on your body baby
Sex aint never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
Ill be your sex slave
Sex aint never felt better, babe

I know what youre looking for, oh
You aint gotta search no more, oh
Baby let me run the show
Hold on, its a bumpy ride so dont let go
All for me to lean, once you start to ride on
That was made for me, let me kick the lights on
Just so I can see, the body begging me for more
And its better on the floor

[Chorus:]
Sex aint never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I want my hands tattooed on your body baby
Sex aint never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
Ill be your sex slave
Sex aint never felt better, babe---Lyrics submitted by teanderson.
