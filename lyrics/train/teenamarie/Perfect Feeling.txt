Two spirits passing through time
 How did yours connect with mine?
 Just like the sunburn sings so sweet in your heart

 Your love is lifting me
 That's why I believe your hint of healing
 For this is the perfect feeling

 Follow your rainbow to the east and start
 Saying gentle run wild
 Music river flow the ganjas

 You, as un-driven snow
 I pray that our hearts will meet
 Believing that this is the perfect feeling

 Come, join me now in harmony
 By the light of heaven's ecstasy

 I know you and I feel you floating inside of me
 Loving is sweet, so sweet, so sweet
 So sweet

 Time waits for no one, I am sure
 That I've been you love long before
 Light me a candle and I'll do the same
 And I'll love you wild and unrestrained

 Hoping that our hearts revealing
 In light of the perfect feeling

 Come inside me
 I've been waiting for you all my life
 Don't you know?
 Here in my dreams
 I've been you
 And you have been me
 Hit me, hit me now

 Come inside me
 I've been waiting for you all my life
 Hit me, hit me now
 This is the perfect feeling
 My love cannot hide---Lyrics submitted by Ali Lama.
