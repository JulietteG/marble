Its getting late,
Darkness falls and I've lost my time to hesitate,
Your waiting too long,

Dont hold back,
Dont shy away from the limelight that we share,
Fade to black,

(Where did it all go wrong)
You fade to black,

This broken bridge is neither built nor burnt,
I'm glad that its all I have learned,
And now youll see just what you did to me,
And I'm glad,

The colours run,
Not to far from the place they fell from,
I am done,
All that's untold,

Dont hold back,
Dont shy away from the limelight that we share,
Fade to black,

(Where did it all go wrong)
You fade to black,

This broken bridge is neither built nor burnt,
I'm glad that its all I have learned,
And now youll see just what you did to me,
And I'm glad,

And when you talk I'm in your thoughts,
And when you talk I'm in your thoughts,

This broken bridge is neither built nor burnt,
I'm glad that its all I have learned,
And now youll see just what you did to me,
And I'm glad.---
