So its begun,
There's no excuses your already under the thumb,
Can you break away from the lines that have been drawn,

So clap your hands lets play,
Your moving my way,
Whats in store no one can say,

So clap your hands lets play,
Your moving my way,
Last night I heard you say,

We drink and we dance and I finally take off your clothes,
Your stood on the edge and I watch you falling,

Now days are gone,
Aimlessly searching for light that once shone,
Think again who is this all for,

So clap your hands lets play,
Your moving my way,
Whats in store no one can say,

So clap your hands lets play,
Your moving my way,
Last night I heard you say,

We drink and we dance and I finally take off your clothes,
Your stood on the edge and I watch you falling,

WE DRINK AND WE DANCE AND WE DANCE AND WE PLAY,

We drink and we dance and I finally take off your clothes,
Your stood on the edge and I watch you falling.---
