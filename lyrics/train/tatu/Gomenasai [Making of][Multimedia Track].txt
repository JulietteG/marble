What I thought wasn't mine
In the light wasn't one of a kind-a precious pearl
When I wanted to cry I couldn't cause I wasn't allowed

Gomenasai-for everything
Gomenasai-I know I let you down
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend like I do now

What I thought wasn't all so innocent
Was a delicate doll-of porcelain
When I wanted to call you
And ask you for help
I stopped myself

Gomenasai-for everything
Gomenasai-I know I let you down
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now

What I thought was a dream-a mirage
Was as real as it seemed-a privilege
When I wanted to tell you I made a mistake,I walked away

Gomenasai-for everything
Gomenasai(Gomenasai)
Gomenasai-I never needed a friend like I do now
Gomenasai-I let you down
Gomenasai(Gomenasai)
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend-like I do now---Lyrics submitted by crystal.
