Day-o, day-o. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-o. Day light come and me wan' go home. Work all night on a drink o' rum. Day-light come and me wan' go home.
Stack ba-na-na 'til the morn-in' come. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Come, mist-er tal-ly man, tal-ly me ban-na-na. 
Day-light come and me wan' go home. he say Come, mist-er tal-ly man, tal-ly me ban-na-na. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Lift six hand, sev-en hand, eight hand bunch. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Me say six hand, sev-en hand, eight hand bunch. Day-light come and me wan' go home.  Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-o. Day light come and me wan' go home. a beautiful bunch a ripe banana Day-light come and me wan' go home. 
Day-light come and me wan' go home. Hide the dead-ly black ta-ran-t'la. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Lift six hand, sev-en hand, eight hand bunch. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Day, me say day-o. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Day, me say day, me say day. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Come, mist-er tal-ly man, tal-ly me ban-na-na. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Day-o, day-o. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-o. Day-light come and me wan' go home. Day-o. Day-light come and me wan' go home.
