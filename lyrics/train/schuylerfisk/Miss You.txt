One more minute is,
One too long and I,
Won't forget it,
The way you did me wrong

Hurt like a boxer, you,
Bite like a snake,
And if you want her,
I'm not standing in your way

The way I feel is the way I feel is the way I feel and

I need you like,
Another broken heart and a hole in my head
I need you like,
A six-foot grave and a high-speed train wreck
I bet you find it hard to believe,
But I miss you like a bad disease,
And maybe baby now you know how much you really mean to me

Watch the docks, oh,
Don't know how I sink so low but,
I get happy,
I feel better when you go

Learned my lesson, I,
Learned the hard way, I'm,
Better for it,
I'll never make the same mistake

The way I feel is the way I feel is the way I feel and

I need you like,
Another broken heart and a hole in my head
I need you like,
A six-foot grave and a high-speed train wreck
I bet you find it hard to believe,
But I miss you like a bad disease,
And maybe baby now you know how much you really mean to me

Hey hey hey, sail away,
Hey hey hey, sail away,
Hey hey hey, sail away,
Hey

I need you like,
Another broken heart and a hole in my head
I need you like,
A six-foot grave and a high-speed train wreck
I bet you find it hard to believe,
But I miss you like a bad disease,
And maybe baby now you know that I

I need you like,
Another broken heart and a hole in my head
I need you like,
A six-foot grave and a high-speed train wreck
I bet you find it hard to believe,
But I miss you like a bad disease,
And maybe baby now you know how much you really mean,
To me

Hey hey hey, sail away,
Hey hey hey, sail away---Lyrics submitted by teryn.
