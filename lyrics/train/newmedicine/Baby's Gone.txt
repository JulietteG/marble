Sometimes I wish that I could be wrong,
All these thoughts they run through my head, yeah.
This time I don't think I can be strong,
She's never gonna miss me, I never wished she went and loved me.

A thousand times we bled out before,
You know she ain't coming back anymore.

And I'm a little bit scared, a little bit smart,
To feel like a man tonight at all.

Cause all night, all night my baby's gone,
And it feels like this time she's done me wrong.
She's my love, my love, my world,
Please don't take away my girl.

Cause I can't go on, now that my baby's gone.

Did she really mean all the words that she said?
"This will never work anyway", yeah.
All my dreams of her are now dead,
Your honest memories in the picture frame are never gonna be the same.

Cause all night, all night my baby's gone,
And it feels like this time something's wrong.
Cause she's my love, my love, my world,
Please don't take away my girl.

Cause I can't go on, now that my baby's gone.

(Baby's gone, you know, you know, you know she's gone.
Alright, she ain't, she ain't never coming back.)

And I'm a little bit scared, a little bit smart,
To feel like I'm a man tonight at all,
I'm a little bit tired, a little bit torn,
But please don't tell me I'm alright.

All night, all night my baby's gone,
And it feels like this time something's wrong.
She's my love, my love, my world,
Please don't take away my girl,

Cause my hearts leaving, baby's gone,
And I'll stop breathing when she's gone.
Tearing all night, awake all night,
Said you'll never go, you'll break on through.

I can't go on, now that baby's,
I can't go on, now that baby's gone.---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
