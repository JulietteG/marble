You'll say that this ain't over yet, over yet.
And you would say there's no way I'd forget, forget.
I told you some day this would stop, all the lies, and sneaking out
And we can't do this anymore.

Cause I don't wanna love you like I do, 
I don't wanna feel these things for you, 
It's out of my hands, over my head, 
Haven't you heard a word I said.

And you got me wrong, 
And you got me wrong.

I'm in bed with her but I got your kiss, on my lips.
And you ain't the girl I'm gonna miss, gonna miss.
You know she'll find out about us, I gotta quit man, I gotta quit, 
We can't do this anymore.
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/new_medicine/never_heard.html ]
Cause I don't wanna love you like I do, 
I don't wanna feel these these things for you, 
It's out of my hands, over my head, 
Haven't you heard a word I said.

Cause I don't wanna love you like I do, 
I don't wanna feel these these things for you, 
It's out of my hands, over my head, 
Haven't you heard a word I said.

Sometimes a spark that's in the dark, 
That catches fire and burns you up, 
As far as I'm concerned you're dead, 
And you still haven't heard a word I said.

A word I said.

Cause I don't wanna love you like I do, 
I don't wanna feel these these things for you, 
It's out of my hands, over my head, 
Haven't you heard a word I said.

And you got me wrong, 
And you got me wrong---Lyrics submitted by Brandon Badger.
