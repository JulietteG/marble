I wish there was a photograph
That showed me here with you
And I could kiss the photograph
And make my wish come true
I wish I was a humming dove
So I could sing so sweet
I wish that I could steal the moon
And kiss it with my feet
I wish I was a remedy
That you were meant to take
A product of a recipe
That no one had to bake
I wish I could forget that day
The hurting in my heart
And wash our mouths with Listerine
To make a brand new start

Watching the rain fall down
Watching the rain
Watching the rain
Watching the rain fall down
Watching the rain
Watching the rain fall down

I wish there was a fairytale
That turned into my life
So I could kiss prince charming
And be his princess wife
I wish the voices in my head
Would leave my ears alone
So my eyes would stop their water bleeding
And I could find a home
I wish there was a ruby rose
Where I spread my wings with you
So I could inhale the perfume
And be the morning dew
I wish the raindrops on the glass
Would let me join their dance
I'd spin and twirl and laugh with them
And drown my thoughts per chance

Watching the rain fall down
Watching the rain
Watching the rain
Watching the rain fall down
Watching the rain
Watching the rain fall

Woah oh I kinda like it
Woah oh
Woah oh I kinda like it this way

Watching the rain
Watching the rain


Watching the rain fall down
Watching the rain
Watching the rain
Watching the rain fall down
Watching the rain
Watching the rain
Watching the rain
Watching the rain---Lyrics submitted by Grace.
