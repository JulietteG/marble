I close my eyes,
but I always see your face
Watching very close,
every breath of my life

So i try to close my heart
and you just watch me run
Behaind a dead dream
that will never come true

Look to my wounds,
that forever will bleed
Put your hands and feel,
there is only death above me

Now im trying to weak up
and catch this crying butterfly
That escapes from my mind,
breaking my soul forever

Dont say a word, dont make a move
Im fighting for dreams in my broken soul
Help me to kill this blackened heart
Love me forever and dont let me go

Im trying to run, but I have to look back
Im trying to find a light in this dark
Im trying to run, but I have to look back
Im trying to find a light in this dark---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
