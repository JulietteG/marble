Blues stay away from me
Oh blues, why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
Oh true love was never meant for me
Seem somehow
We never can agree

Life is full of misery
Oh dreams are like memories
Bringing back
The love that it used to be

Tears, so many I can't see
Oh yes, don't mean a thing to me
Oh, don't go by
Still I can be free ---Lyrics submitted by Gabriel Grinber.
