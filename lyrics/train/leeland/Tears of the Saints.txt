There are many prodigal sons 
On our city streets they run 
Searching for shelter 
There are homes broken down 
Peoples hopes have fallen to the ground 
From failures 

This is an emergency! 

There are tears from the saints 
For the lost and unsaved 
Were crying for them come back home 
Were crying for them come back home 
And all your children will stretch out their hands 
And pick up the crippled man 
Father, we will lead them home 
Father, we will lead them home 

There are schools full of hatred 
Even churches have forsaken 
Love and mercy 
May we see this generation 
In its state of desperation 
For Your glory 

This is an emergency! 

There are tears from the saints 
For the lost and unsaved 
Were crying for them come back home 
Were crying for them come back home 
And all your children will stretch out their hands 
And pick up the crippled man 
Father, we will lead them home 
Father, we will lead them home 

Sinner, reach out your hands! 
Children, in Christ you stand! 
Sinner, reach out your hands! 
Children, in Christ you stand! 

There are tears from the saints 
For the lost and unsaved 
Were crying for them come back home 
Were crying for them come back home 
And all Your children will stretch out their hands 
And pick up the crippled man 
Father, we will lead them home 
Father, we will lead them home---Lyrics submitted by Christi.
