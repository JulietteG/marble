(feat. All Sons and Daughters)

As I rise, strength of God 
Go before, lift me up 
As I wake, eyes of God 
Look upon, be my sight 

As I wait, heart of God 
Satisfy and sustain 
As I hear, voice of God 
Lead me on, be my guide 
Be my guide 

Above and below me 
Before and behind me 
In every eye that sees me 
Christ be all around me 

And as I go, Hand of God 
My defense, by my side 
And as I rest, breath of God 
Fall upon, bring me peace 
Bring me peace 

Your life, Your death 
Your blood was shed 
For every moment 
Every moment---
