mystery the moon, a hole in the sky, a supernatural night light, so full but often right. 
A pair of eyes a closing one, a chosen child with the holding sun. 
a marble dog that chases cars to farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars. 
the cosmic fish they love to kiss. theyre giving birth to constellations, no rifts and no no reservation, if they should fall youll get a wish or dedication. 
may I suggest you get the best for nothing less than you and i.
lets take a chance is this romance is rising oh, before we lose, the light. 
oh Bella Bella please, Bella you, beautiful luna. oh Bella do what you do. (dadaladada)
you are an illuminating anchor, of leagues too infinite in number, a crashing waves, and breaking thunder, tiding the ebb and flows of hunger. 
youre dense and naked there for me, you expose all memory you make the most of boundary. 
Youre the ghost of royalty, imposing love you are the king and queen combining, everything, intertwining like a ring around the finger, of a girl, im just a singer, youre the world. 
all I can bring you, is the language of a lover.  (the language, the language, the language of love) 
Bella luna, my beautiful beautiful moon, how you swoon me like no other, ohh. 
may I suggest you get the best of your wish may I insist at no contest for little you or smaller i, a larger chance at what all them may ly, all the lies, at the brink of our lives. 
Bella please, Bella you beautiful luna, oh Bella do what you, do. 
Bella luna, my beautiful beautiful moon, how you swoon me like no other. ohh.---Lyrics submitted by Maren.
