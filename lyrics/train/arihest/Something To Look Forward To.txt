Don't have to go to far
Don't have to make it last
Don't have to change my world 
Don't have to hide my past
All it is I'm wishing you would do
Is give me something to look forward to

Don't have to sang my song
Any brighter than before
Don't have to bring no one
Right up to my front door 
All I wish that you would do
Is give me something to look forward to

'Cause oh I've been so lonely 
Sitting here and waitin' 
for the moment to come upon me
Take my breath away
and allways know that it will find me
Right here where I lay 
I'm still pretiending that it may

Well you don't have to give me much
Just a little taste
Give me just enough
To put a smile on my face
That's the only thing I'm wishin' you would do
Give me something to look forward to

(Hey, yeah)

'Cause oh I've been so lonely 
Sitting here and waitin' 
for the moment to come upon me
Take my breath away and allways
know that it will find me, oh
Right here where I lay 
I'm still pretiending that it may

Well you don't have to give me much
Just a little taste
Give me just enough
To put a smile on my face
That's the only thing I'm wishin' you would do
Give me something to look forward to

That's the only thing that I will ask of you
Give me something to look forward to---Lyrics submitted by Wpgreg.
