If I woke in a dream I'd know it
If I was, if I was still dreaming
Would I still feel the way I feel right now?
Slip away  - I don't really know how.
With every heartbeat I can look back
With every step is a new direction 
Leaving me so where I live again
All because I love you.
Maybe we were two rivers flowing
Taking breath and look at where you're going
Do you see the end of me
and the start of you?
I guess that was the best we could do
With every heartbeat I can look back 
With every step is a new direction
Leaving me so where Ive never been,
All because I loved you.
And the stars will all fall down
and the moon will slide to the back of my heart
And the world will spin around
Making room for the light.
With every heartbeat I can look back
With every step is a new direction
Leaving me so where I've never been
All because I love you.
With every heartbeat I can look back
With every step is a new direction
Leaving me so where I've never been
All because, all because I love you.---Lyrics submitted by Valerie Grimes.
