(Ohhhh)(Ohhhh)

Took a while to drag me out of bed,
Aim some coffee at my head,
Saw tha clock im running late,
It's an ordinary day.

And I'm like a dog on heat,
Knock one out and then fall asleep,
It's sad but true,
I'd rather be with you

Don't you forget about me,
When your're a celebrity,
It will be only you and me
Before too long.

So little time so much to do,
I'd rather spend my days with you,
So little time so much to do,
I' like to spend one day with you,

And if that day is not enough,
May be can stay and touch
But i'm not making plans,
For tomorrow, For tomorrow
Never comes...
(For tomorrow)
(Ohhh)

Said I've been celibate for years,
Not out of choice thares no - one here,
See i can't give my end away,
Another ordinary day,

And I've love to see
A little more of you,
You're clothes would look better
On my beed room floor,

Don't you forget about me,
When you're a celebrity,
It will be only you and me
Before too long.

So little time so much to do,
I'd rather spend my days with you,
So little time so much to do,
I'd like to spend one day with you,

And if that day is not enough
May be can stay and touch
But I'm not making plans,
For tomorrow, For tomorrow
Never comes...

In Your eyes, in your eyes
It's in your eyes

So little time so much to do,
I'd rather spend my days with you,
So little time so much to do,
I'd like to spend one day with you

And if that day is not enough 
May be can stay and touch
Bat I'm not making plans,
For tomorrow, For tomorrow
Never comes...---Lyrics submitted by jeff.
