[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm young, 21, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a herb
You frontin' like you got it, claim they hatin' on your wallet
Gucci telling you the time and you watch it
No I ain't stunting like my daddy, he's livin' with my granny
Used to be a big baller, he's surviving off of gambling
But I love him, he's my daddy, yeah I love him he's my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God cause the real world hurts, so much evil lurks
They just make us work but we can't find work
Abuela, mommy and the girls in a one bedroom
South beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view
Mommy on the couch since she was 42
Sacrificing for the kids cause that's what mommies do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candi says to stop, my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffing good
In Miami you catch a charge and the whole family tears apart

[Hook (x2)]
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 2]
And this recession so depressing
My parents don't stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all their lessons
Mmm and I'm paying for this session, I'm paying for this session
And I'm paying rent, food, clothes, phones, Christmas presents
Six shots in, I'm just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain't resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

[Hook (x2)]
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 3]
One way to the top, I'll make with what I got
You want my number, baby, I'm on a mission, catch up
Men selling love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves he'll start flirting with me
So I took on my heart, off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah, they all hungry
Never trust a man cause they all hungry

[Bridge (x)2]
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain't even gon' question
Why it went so wrong

[Outro]
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done---
