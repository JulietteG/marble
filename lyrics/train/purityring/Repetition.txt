Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Tell me that you wanna move me around like that
I will watch your lips curved in a smooth combat
Make your way through my tears and I'll relax
If you're the truest one I'm gonna make you a season
Climb up in my rattling spine and I'll contract
Tell me I'm the only one and I'll move back
If you see your daydreams in me they'll not lack
What's been waited in me, I'll make it click with reason

Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

I can feel your knees sinking into the bed
Searching in my dark eyes to wreck what's been said
There's a wave of grace until [?]
There's a light in my skin that's been dimmed
I'mma dig you up and give you what I took
Pull you up and tuck you in and make you look
I'mma smooth your shoulders down and calm what's shook
It was all forlorn, if only for a season

It was all forlorn, if only for a season---
