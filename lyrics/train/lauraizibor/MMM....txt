Make everything so simple in a crazy world,
and I'm trying to find the words to say.
You make everything alright  just by  being around boy,
MMmmm,  you make me wanna sing.

(Chorous)
MMMmmmmm,MMMMMmmmm,
MMMmmmmm,MMMMMmmmm

You're my light in the dark,
Guiding,Guiding me home.
And you're faith in me ,is all I need.
Baby, you're love it sets me free.

(Chorous)
MMMmmmm,MMMMmmmmm
MMMmmmm,MMMmmmmm

I need little help, boy
Well,I can't seem to breath easy,No,no
Not when you're around ooohh
