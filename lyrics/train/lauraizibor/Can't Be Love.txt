They say loves suppose to set you free
Give you wings to fly
They say loves suppose to hold the key
To life an eternity
Ba ba da da da da da
So when the partys over
You suddenly get colder
And I need someone to hold me tighter
And tell me every things gonna be alright

Cant be love
Cause Im free and it aint enough
I dont believe
Believe in love, I dont believe in love
I dont believe in love

They say love has all the answers
To your questions
Well baby Im still lost
Cause I dont understand
Ba ba da da da da da
So you could tell me that you love me
A thousand times
But for you to show me
You couldnt even if you tried

Cant be love
Cause Im free and it aint enough
I dont believe
Believe in love, I dont believe in love
I dont believe in love

On the outside I know there would make sense
On the inside baby it feels dangerous
You go your way and I go my way
Cause it cant be 
Cant be love
Cause Im free and it aint enough
I dont believe no no no
Cant be love cant be love
Cant be love cant be love
Mmmmm hmmmm
It Cant Be
..Love---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
