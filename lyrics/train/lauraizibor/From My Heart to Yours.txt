From my heart to yours
I would give you butterflies
From my heart to yours
I would give you summertime

From my heart to yours
Ooh... I'd give you everytime
From my heart to yours
I give you mine

Mm... Baby I'm never gonna stop loving you
You will never gonna find my love so true
Baby can you break it down just for me
Like this and just understand
I...

From my heart to yours
I'll give you my soul
If this no denying our love is real
From my heart to yours
From my heart to yours

Well, from my heart to yours
I would give you everything, everything
From my heart to yours
I'd make the bird sing... yeah yeah...

From my heart to yours
Don't you worry about a thing
From my heart to yours
I give you mine

It doesn't matter where I go or what I see
You're... you're the only thing that important to me
With you I belong
Baby I never felt this good before
I I I ...

From my heart to yours
I'll give you my soul
If there's no denying our love is real
From my heart to yours
From my heart to yours

I need you
I cannot live without you baby
I need you with me

From my heart to yours
I give you my soul
If there's no denying our love is real
From my heart to yours
If there's no denying our love is real
I give you my soul
From my heart to yours
From my heart to yours---Lyrics submitted by Richard.
