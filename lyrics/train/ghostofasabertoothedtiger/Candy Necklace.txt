She wears a candy necklace
Thoughts of incest and insects
Climb her piano spine
Lips red as the exit sign

(Pre-chorus)
Johnny Dark's in the corner
Placing yet another order

(Chorus)
Walls melting like ice in scotch
His face ticks like a pocket watch

Excuse me Marilyn Monroe
Your skirt's like a UFO
My heart's on the harlequin floor
The President walks in the door
With tortoise shell moon glasses
Sweat dripping like molasses
Paper planes everywhere
Now his palms are growing hair

Johnny Dark's in the corner
Placing yet another order

(Chorus)

I haven't slept for ages
My eyes turn to bird cages
If it's true time flies
Why oh why can't I?

Johnny Dark's in the corner
Spying for the secret order

The best laid plans of men and mice
Often turn whiskey and rye---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
