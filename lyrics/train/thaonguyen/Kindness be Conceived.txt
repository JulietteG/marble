Hold me hard, I've been let loose
Sift me clear of all I do
If by a third degree, you feel a guilt for me
Then I've been a villain all my life
And if by a melody, you stay and sway with me
I've been a salesman on the side

Kindness be conceived
When we wake in the California light
There is a concrete stuck between 
How we breathe and why we die
Why we breathe and why we die

Who wouldn't hold a wounded bird with anger stuck in time?
I told you I would hold no more
It weighed too much like mine
You and I, and I, alone... 4x

Oh, kindness be conceived
When we wake in the California light
There is a concrete stuck between 
How we breathe and why we die
Why we breathe and why we die

Hold me hard, I've been let loose
Sift me clear of all I do
Kindness be conceived
When we wake in the California light
There is a concrete stuck between 
How we breathe and why we die
Why we breathe and why we die---Lyrics submitted by Amy Morris.
