(Always x8)

Always,Always running late I know i should procrastinate
I should be all hard rock
I play
But sometimes hard work has to wait
There's always somewhere new to go
And I can never say no
(say no x2)
I've been awake for a day now 
24 hrs yet still i want it louder
Darkness can't get me to sleep yet I'm not that weak yet
I just want it louder
(louder x8)


Always,Always running late I know i should procrastinate
I should be all hard rock
I play But sometimes hard work has to wait
There's always somewhere new to go
And i can never say no
(say no x2)
I've been awake for a day now 24 hrs yet still
I want it louder
Darkness can't get me to sleep yet I'm not that weak yet
I just want it louder
(louder x8)
As I buy another round with my final 20 lbs.
Seems as if my moneys spent
how am I gonna pay the rent 
There's always somewhere new to go and i can never say no
(say no x2)
I've been awake for a day now 24 hrs yet still 
i want it louder
(louder x8) 
There's always somewhere new to go
and i can never say no
(say no x2)
There's always somewhere new to go
and i can nver say no
(say no x2)
I want it louder
I want it louder
I want it louder---Lyrics submitted by TeAuna.
