Something about your smile
That keeps me close
Keeps me warm
Is what love is made of
Something about your eyes
That bright blue shine
I see your soul
Is what love is made of

Lemme see
What love is made of
Give it to me
What love is made of
No recipe, what love is made of
So I can see
What love is made of

And I could stay like this for days
Looking at your beautiful face
Give me your word, say you'll never go
Let me know, what love is made of

Something about your style
The clothes you wear
You get it right
Is what love is made of
Something about your mind
The way you think
How you wise
Is what love is made of

Lemme see
What love is made of
Give it to me
What love is made of
No recipe, what love is made of
So I can see
What love is made of

And I could stay like this for days
Looking at your beautiful face
Give me your word, say you'll never go
Let me know, what love is made of

Say I'm the special one
The one you think I've lost
What your kind, that cooking up
Come give me my toast

Lemme see
What love is made of
Give it to me
What love is made of
No recipe, what love is made of
So I can see
What love is made of

And I could stay like this for days
Looking at your beautiful face
Give me your word, say you'll never go
Let me know, what love is made of---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
