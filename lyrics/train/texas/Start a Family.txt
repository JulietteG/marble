You can start a family
Or you can start a war
Began with good intentions
Now you dont know what youre fighting for

Theres no way of knowing
The way you are today
When I look up to the sky
Theres only one thing that I wanna say

Lay down, try and talk about it
Lay down, dont scream or cry or shout it
Stay down, dont deny or doubt it
No one knows you better than me

The worlds a little darker
Through your tinted view
When the times get harder
Know Ill always be there for you

But theres no way of knowing
But I guess if I may
When I look up to you
Theres only one thing that I wanna say---
