SIKE!
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY is false
Just like your actions
Fill your mouth up with a filthy waste
Breathe it in
Oh yeah, here we go
So how does it feel when the tables are turned?
Take a moment breathe it in
Get a better perception of the damages
Oh, I'm glad I finally got the chance to say I got the last laugh now!

And now we start again
Oh, we'll take this situation right back to the city that created us
I can't imagine what it meant to you
If it meant anything at all
You've torn and broke the boundaries and it's a miracle that we're even around
So consider yourself to be lucky, sit back, don't talk, take in this sound
Yeahhh
OH MY GOD, what now?
OH MY GOD, what now?

This is my final stand, I won't take another chance with your antics
You've torn and broke all of the boundaries
Surprisingly it still appears as if I'll be the one with the last laugh!
OH CAN YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT PUSHING DOWN ON YOUR SHOULDERS?!
You'll forever carry the weight of our past---Lyrics submitted by Doug.
