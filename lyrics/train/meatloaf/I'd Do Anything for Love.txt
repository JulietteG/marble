And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now--
Oh no--no way--
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
I won't do that
Anything for love
I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
I won't do that

Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
and these are the days that never end

Maybe I'm crazy
But it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are comming true--
You better believe it!--

That I would to anything for love
And I'll be there until the final act--
I would do anything for love!
And I'll take a vow and seal a pact--

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way--
Tonight--
I would do anything for love!
I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
I won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

Somedays I pray for silence
Somedays I pray for sould
Somedays I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock'N Roll

Some night I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some night I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely
And that's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
The one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true--
You better believe it--!

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and that's a face
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back--

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long--
So long--
I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I won't do that...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you
Every night of my life--
No way--

I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
I won't do that!

Girl:
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out if this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

Boy:
I can do that!
I can do that!

Girl:
Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

Boy:
I can do that!
I can do that!

Girl:
Will you make me some magic
With your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

Boy:
I can do that!
I can do that!

Girl:
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will ya hose me down with holy water--if I get to hot--?
Will ya take me to places I've never known?

Boy:
I can do that!
I can do that!

Girl:
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude
And a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on

Boy:
I won't do that!
I won't do that!---
