Kelly the insistor
Your brother is a blister
I'll be had if I'm in your dress tonight

When you go and you're all alone
Are you still afraid of home
Do you lie in bed with fright

Your father said I lost her
Your brother said I fought her
But I stood still and I'm in your arms tonight

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger
And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say good lies
And know that I will be your bail bond

Mickey the ol' lithper
Said hey there hey mister
My cold razor's edge will meet you in the light

When you go and you're on stage
Is your heart still filled with rage?
Do you still fight for lover's rights?

Challenge is for lovers
But I run my feet hurt
So I'll stay here and fight for lover's rights

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger
And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say good lies
And know that I will be your bail bond

Oh Kelly don't you go
Kelly don't you go
Kelly don't you go
I want you to know
That I've been trying, I've been lying
I've been stealing, I've been hiding
I will meet you in the grave
Kelly, Kelly, it's not your right
To be cheating, fighting and starting life
When my head and hands are tied to you so tight
Oh Kelly just tell me one more thing
Is it mine or is it some other ring
That you wear as we lie in bed tonight?

And Kelly, who's the logger?
Oh, Kelly, who's the logger?
Oh Kelly, who's the logger who's trees were felled with might?
And Kelly, hold your water
Oh Kelly, hold your water
Oh Kelly, Kelly, hold your water tight

And when you rush I'll call your name
Like Harvard Square holds all inane
And don't you know I'll be your badger
And don't be terse and don't be shy
Just hug my lips and say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
