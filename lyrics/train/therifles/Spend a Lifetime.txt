As I walk up a street I lift my head up and I face you,
You look good and you smell sweet, it makes it harder to embrace you,
If i was back in primary in a playground I would chase you,
But I'm not I'm just me and though you might be what I'm looking for, 
My head won't function properly and my feet won't move in time,
And next week I'll forget probably but today you blow my mind,
As we talk I go all red and I'm feeling like a school kid,
All these thoughts fill my head, I bet I'll say something stupid,
Just play it cool and keep it calm and remember what your mother said,
Now boy just use your charm, but all that good advice gets lost somewhere,
Cos my mouth just won't work right today, all my head is full with lines,
If only I could find the words to say we could spend a lifetime,

Spend a lifetime (Repeats).---Lyrics submitted by James.
