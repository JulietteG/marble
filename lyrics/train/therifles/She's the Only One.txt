When my baby's lonley and she's lost her smile,
I call her up just to tell her that it's only gonna be for a while,
She's my one and only, the only thing worthwhile,
She lets me know I'm her fella and I'm never gonna leave her side,
Ooh ooh ooh, She's the only one (x2)
She's the only one in all I do and the only thing on my mind

When my baby's lonely and she's lost her smile,
I call her up and I tell her that I'm coming round to dry her eyes,
She's my one and only, the only thing worthwhile,
I know we'll always be together cos I'll never find a better way of spending my time,
Ooh ooh ooh, she's the only one (x2)
She's the only one in all I do and the only thing on my mind

I lose myself whenever she's away,
Don't sleep at night and sit about all day,
No one I know will ever take her place,

Ooh ooh ooh she's the only one (Repeats)---Lyrics submitted by James.
