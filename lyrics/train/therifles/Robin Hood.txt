One, just one and then I'll go
And though it's on the cards that an argument is imminent i know
But it's not like I get carried home
It's just that I believe that she don't think I think of her when I'm on my own
So...

Don't think that I don't be, I'll mess with the T.V
Your so dear to me, but sometimes i like to lose control

Just one more, I promise, then I'll go
And I don't want to see that I have you screaming down the phone
You should know, the only one I know
That'll make me laugh with the little things they do is you, and only you alone
So...

Don't think that I might be thinking that I might leave
Your so dear to me, but sometimes i like to lose control

Don't think that I don't be, I'll mess with the T.V
Your so dear to me, but sometimes i like it on my own

But my heart stays at home!---Lyrics submitted by calum.
