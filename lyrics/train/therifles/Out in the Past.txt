This little town hasn't changed so much,
Not since the time of night,
When we would lie out and talk but we couldn't be touched,
Then you'd go away when the morning was light,
And sure enough well, we had to grow up,
And there's nothing like a full time job,
To put out your fire, we were young and wasn't in love,
But maybe we were happy getting carried away.

Now that seems so long ago,
Out the door and down the road,
I sometimes think when I'm alone of the times we had and now we don't.

Out in the past we were running around,
Sometimes so fast with your foot on the ground,
It was so hard to stand you never could tell that all I saw was you.

Every place that we talk about don't seem too far away,
When you rely on yourself and the one you're around,
And always believe everything that they say,
But little talk isn't always enough and just cause you're still here now,
Doesn't mean you're a liar we were young and that was enough,
But life has a habit of getting in the way.

Now that seems so long ago,
Out the door and down the road,
I sometimes think when I'm alone of the times we had and now we don't.

Out in the past we were running around,
Sometimes so fast with your foot on the ground,
It was so hard to stand you never could tell that all I saw was you (3)---Lyrics submitted by James.
