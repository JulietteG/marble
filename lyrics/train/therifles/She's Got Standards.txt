If you're a new band breaking be aware cos she won't be far behind,
But if you've got no airplay she won't care and you'd better move aside.

She'll be down south top ten in her mouth in the blink of an eye,
She'll be top draw on the backstage floor till the new band arrives,
Ooh she's got standards but you're cool if you're at twenty five,
Ooh she's got standards til you put the twinkle in her eye,
So you better cover up boy.

If you're a new band breaking be aware cos she'll never leave your side,
Cos if the N.M.E say you're so cool and they really like your style---Lyrics submitted by James.
