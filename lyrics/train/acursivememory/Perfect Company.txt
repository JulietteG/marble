I've been to just about a million places,
Sunny skies everywhere and in between,
But just to know I'm right here with you,
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Oh my God you're such a beautiful girl,
With such a wonderful way in such a beautiful place,
The sun is shining and it warms my face,
What a wonderful day I just hope it can stay.

I just want to tell you I love you (I love you), and everything is gonna be okay someday soon.

I've been to just about a million places,
With placid seas and perfect scenery,
But just to know you're right here with me,
Well you make the perfect company.

Oh my God its true,
If time stood still I'd wait with you,
If time stood still and still it stood I'd be with you.

I just want to tell you I love you (I love you), and everything is gonna be okay someday soon.

Lovely love, we're almost in it.
We'll laugh and love in this world.

Oh my God its true,
If time stood still I'd wait with you,
If time stood still and still it stood I'd be with you.

I just want to tell you I love you (I love you), and everything is gonna be okay someday soon---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlyn.
